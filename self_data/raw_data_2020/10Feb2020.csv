2,"There’s always going to be someone who is prettier than you look, more hardworking than you are, has more money than you have, lives in a fancier house, has more friends, eats healthier, is at their A game in their Career and has whiter teeth. Every where you look; on google, social media, offline, supermarket, everywhere, there is always going to be someone who seems to living their best life, you know ,someone that always  seem to have it all together every time.

When you compare your self with others, you open yourself up for sadness, pain and even depression. You need to realize that our journeys are different. And even if our paths were similar, our experiences differ. Sometimes, youare not even aware when you start to compare yourself to others; it could be a mindless scroll on instagram, and Bam! a picture pops up and makes you question your own journey in a berating manner.

 It’s OK to be inspired by other people’s success stories or lifestyle. However, what is not ok is when you look down on yourself, because others are doing better than you are currently. When you do that, you won’t be able to acknowledge all the good happening in your own life; the milestone you’ve crossed, the book you finally finished writing, the five pushups you did today, the charity organization you volunteered for, the bad habits you’re gradually quitting, the steps you’ve taken to improve your life, the bold decision to start a business, and the list goes on. The only thing you end up focusing on when you compare yourself to others is your weaknesses. How you are not this or that, and how you don’t have this or the other one. Soon, you are deep into jealousy and hatred for other people.

Truthfully, we all have compared ourselves to others, maybe not as frequently, but we all have, at some point in our lives. How do we put a stop to this self destructive habit?

1. Self acceptance

You have to accept yourself wholly, flaws and all. Even though you’re a masterpiece, you are also a work in progress. You need to accept that it’s OK  not to be perfect. 

2. Throw away the metric of measurement

We set unrealistic expectations for ourselves because we’ve conformed to the metric measurement for success in our society. You should have gotten married by age twenty-five, you should have made X amount of money before age Z. Setting  a timeline to achieve your goals is not bad at all. it’s bad when you use those timelines as a yardstick for success. We are all different people,with unique ways of doing stuff and with different timelines for success. One step at a time and you’d blossom in due season.

3. Invest in your growth

Generally, the more you develop yourself by acquiring skills, learning from others, and applying your knowledge, the more you grow, and become the kind of amazing person you’ve always wanted to become. You can’t be dormant and expect your life to change, or move in a certain direction.In fact, Investing in your growth is a form of self love and care, it is your way of growing, so you can contribute positively to the world.  

4. Be aware, then walk away.

A lot of times, it’s quite difficult to identity the things that trigger us and cause us to compare ourselves to others. However, it’s hard to heal from what you can’t identity. Which is why you need to be self concious; recognize what tips you off and turns on your inner critic. Is it the people you follow on social media? Is it the people on the magazine, is it Forbes list, is it your sibling? You need to take out time and pin point what turns on the comparison button. As soon as you identify the cause, walk away from it. So if it’s someone you follow on Instagram for instance, unfollow them.

5. You are enough 

There’s only one you in the entire world, and even if you have an identical twin, you’re your own person. Your path is unique, your struggles, success, and experiences are yours. Your strengths, and achievements are yours. You are capable of so much more, and as you continue to put your feet out one step at a time, one day at a time, you’d achieve your dreams. Other people’s success shouldn’t hinder you from using your voice, writing your book, starting that business or anything you want to delve into. Truth is, no matter how many people in the world right now are doing what you want to to, nobody can do it like you can.

These points are not exclusive at all, there are more ways to quiten the mean voice of comparison. As you embrace your uniqueness, and walk your journey, may you also find courage to soar.

8,"So for some context, I’m a high school senior. I don’t know how else to tell my mom that I won’t be going to college this year. I haven’t written any application essays or even applied to any colleges yet. I’ve looked around at colleges but only for fun and just to plan my future out ahead. 

Instead, I’m going to enlist in the Marine Corps and I’m nervous as fuck. Everything is coming by so fast. I’ve filled out some medical forms with my recruiter already which basically says that I’m medically fine (except for my eyesight but I’ll get a waiver for that). I’m going to MEPS in two weeks after I turn 18. Don’t get me wrong, I’m really excited and motivated to join and I’m glad to be doing this since I’m a really patriotic person who wants to be with the Marines but I honestly cannot believe that I’m already at the point where I’m about to head off to MEPS. Like holy shit. This is actually happening. Soon, we’ll start talking about my MOS field, ship date, boot camp, etc. I can’t believe that this is actually happening right now. Again, super excited and really proud to be doing this but goddamn I’ll be lying if I didn’t say that I’m nervous to some extent. 

The big problem is how the fuck do I break the news to my mom that I’m enlisting. I can’t really hide the fact that I’ll be gone for two days to go to MEPS. She’s not a fan of me joining the military (much less the Marines) and she’s told me many times that she refuses to let me join the military and that I must go to college, no excuses and no exceptions. I’m honestly nervous as fuck since I’ve told myself that I will come clean and tell her that I’m enlisting before I actually turn 18, sign the papers, and go to MEPS but I’m just really nervous. Like I don’t give a shit about what my mom thinks about me enlisting since nothing can change my mind, I’m committed to joining the Marines. But I honestly just don’t know how to break the news to her, especially with everything quickly moving into place. 

Anyway, yeah, I just needed to get this off my chest. My heart is pounding as I write this right now. But yeah, I’m honesty at a complete lost as to what to do. But you know what, it’s whatever. Whatever happens, happens. I just can’t wait to officially join and leave for boot camp ASAP.",10Feb2020,1

12,"a little backstory on me:

I, a 16 y/o, hasn't really participated in this whole ""team sports"" thing, let alone physical activity, for much of my life. I may not look like it, but at the beginning of December, I was about as out of shape as someone my height and weight could be. 

My school has a requirement to do a team sport at least once per year to fulfill the PE requirement. Don't really know how I got out of it last year, but I did.  This year,  the  activity near and dear to my heart (theater tech) became much more boring as all of the fun people graduated, and  I realized I needed something to do with my time that either is productive (which 99% of the time, tech was not), and brought me joy. 

In comes lacrosse. 

Now, before the official season, my school has a sort of pre, preseason that gets you ready for tryouts, specifically the varsity level. Had I known what this entails, I would have probably never signed up. 

7 minute mile, 2 minute plank, 10 pushups, 3 rounds of 80 second 400 meter sprints, and stick skills that would win a game. 

Yeah, my legs are aching just thinking about that. 

For the past six weeks, I've been going up to my school's track and running the mile at least once. Now, at the beginning, I could barely get  a lap in without needing to walk half  of the next one. I was consistently the slowest (and still am, but my times are improving), and while torturing myself with 4 laps  around the field, I began to apply  the misery and strife I was experiencing to other parts of my life. 

See, there are other times in my life where the act of pushing forward seems impossible, when my lungs burn and my legs ache and my vision starts to get all fuzzy and stops seeing the end goal. 

But then the mile is complete. I  get to rest, recoup, and continue conditioning the other days. The bliss and accomplished feeling at the end of the mile was like nothing else at that time. 

Rinse and repeat. 

The whole concept of ""completing the mile"" has kind of leaked into other parts of my life, and I've found to be more productive because of it.  

Whether its homework, or making my writing goal on a personal project, there are other times where ""completing the mile"" is a good way to push yourself to complete the task. It's only x more words, only x more hours until this is all done and over with. Instead of giving up, keep  going, and remind yourself of that feeling.  Another mile completed.",10Feb2020,1

15,"I’ve had clinical depression since high school. I’m currently 25 approaching 26. I met my husband when I was 22. 

Over the course of our marriage I’ve noticed how he has depression. I help him on his weak days. I even brought up how he should see a therapist about his mental illness. I divulged that I have depression early on in our relationship. I made him acknowledge his own. 

Once when arguing over differences, he said, “I have depression, you wouldn’t get it.” My response wasn’t, “You act like I don’t have it.” This was a blow, because he knows I have depression. I see my therapist regularly. 

He never notices my lows. Today is the 1 year anniversary of my mom’s death. The past 2 weeks I’ve slept all day. I over eat. I have mood swings and get agitated easily. Today I isolated myself. We just got a new car yesterday. He’s been excited. I do get that. Everything was about how good and happy everything was for him. He’s finally in school, blah blah. 

His mom group text me and him, telling how she knew this day was hard for me. Yet he’s said nothing. Not even an acknowledgement. 

I’ve been short with him most of the day. I tried my best to not be totally passive aggressive. It’s my depression of course. The agitation and over thinking everything. He got mad at me and asked what my deal was. I went off on him about how he only thinks of himself and it’s really shitty of him. I told him I don’t feel like spelling everything out for him. He then proceeds to say “oh I’m a piece of shit yet all week all you’ve done is sit on the couch or lie in bed.” 

Oh okay... he’s never supportive of my grief. I don’t want to explain myself. I’m tired of it. Maybe I’m over thinking. I really don’t know why I’m with him if he can’t even be there for me when I need support. He’s never there and I’m always there for him. I’m just tired.

I’m venting, because I went off on him a moment ago for something minor. It was a mood swing. I don’t want to take it out on the kids. So I locked myself in my room and sobbed. 

Opinions are welcome. I don’t know how to feel about him at this point. I made a therapist appointment. Hopefully when I see her, I’ll feel better. Right now I’m grasping for reason and trying to prevent myself from having a manic episode. I just want to feel better about myself :/",10Feb2020,1

17,"There is no doubt in my mind that there is no joy in the pain caused by another. Or rather, there is no joy in unwanted pain caused by the recklessness of another. Pain in this sense can be anything from emotional, physical, spiritual, lasting or fleeting pain. Pain that causes confusion, causes a sense of lack of control, which causes a sense of hopelessness, anger, and no doubt sadness. Pain that causes the course of one’s life to be drastically altered, and a future that seemed so clear to be muddied by the unknowns that most certainly follow. There is no doubt that pain in this form has stricken the hearts of so many a person in the history of this world and our position in it. On reflection, however, I see one redeeming quality, or rather, one aspect of this pain that when thought about truthfully and rationally, eases, if even so slightly, the depth of pain and heartbreak that follows. The simple fact that the pain caused by another is not caused by the person in whom the pain revealed itself. The person upon whom the pain was inflicted certainly feels a certain set of emotions and asks many certain kinds of questions as a result. These are in and of themselves legitimate feelings and questions. Why me? Why this? Why now? Anger, resentment, hatred towards somebody other than themselves. This is of course if they choose to respond that way. Though, no one could blame them for this reaction.   
One would hope that they would heal from their pain, forgive them who caused it and see a new reality arrive before them. One of continued clear conscience and a bright future ahead. 

This aspect of pain and its consequences of the psyche are all but illegitimate in the heart and mind of the person whose actions caused their own pain. To be clear, I would say that this does apply to someone who’s actions were an accident, or out of their control. Rather, I am speaking about the deliberate actions of a person who was capable of choosing the other path, the path that all but negated the possibility of the pain that was brought by choosing the former. Even then, a distinction must be drawn between the person who took action to cause their pain out of hopelessness, or false thinking and the person who caused their pain by taking actions in full knowledge of the potential outcomes, regardless of impairment of mind. Compound upon this, stupidity and embarrassment, the individual whose pain arrives in this form of a self-delivered punch to the throat, is the one in whom the true depths of lonesome pain are felt. There is not a single redeeming quality to this pain, nor the understanding nor sympathy given by those on the outside to individuals whose pain was undeserved. In the case of self-inflicted pain, there may be support, which there certainly is in my case, though this even comes with the caveat of utter disappointment and unearned or rather undeserved sadness of the families and friends of the person who is at fault. This pain is deep, like others pain is deep, though I believe it to be different in nature. There is no: Why me? Why this? There is no legitimate basis for these questions when one comes to the reality of their situation and comes to grips with the fact that there is no one to blame but themselves. No one to pawn off the responsibility of their actions. It is as simple as that. The pain is Self-Inflicted. It is the ownership and responsibility of the person holding their own gun to their own head and pulling the trigger. It is pain in its most raw and unforgiving form. Pain of this nature is the type I would not want to befall anyone on this earth until they find themselves in the grips of it. At that point, they must feel this pain. To not feel the lonesome pain of self-regret, self-hatred, self-disappointment, self-embarrassment, self-doubt, self-hopelessness, to me, is to not be capable of feeling; to not have an element within their hearts and mind that knows at the innermost core of their being that what they did was utterly and shamefully wrong. To not feel this pain in the light of one’s own circumstances is to negate the responsibility upon who the action falls. Me. It falls on me. This is the type of pain in my heart that I feel at this very moment. The pain that does not allow my mind to rest, and unwinds my stomach. That makes me doubt if I ever truly will make it in this life. I hate it, and I should. This pain I feel is remarkably my own, and to pawn it off on anything other than myself is to negate the human characteristics that make me who I am. This is my door to a new reality of renewed faith in myself and in my actions. This is my way of paving my own path in truth and in righteous thought and action. To lean into the pain, fully, and to continually and completely negate the thought of: Why me? The question is answered in its asking. The answer is Me. It was because of me.  

  
I hope that I will heal from this pain, forgive myself who caused it, and begin to see a new reality arrive before me. One of a renewed clarity of conscience.   
God willing, I will. Thank you. ",10Feb2020,1
18,"I miss my family, and how it was before my dad passed away. It’ll be ten years this week, and I’m in the process of moving in with my boyfriend out of the apartment he’s been crashing with me in to our own place together. 

When I remember my parents house before he passed, I just remember a feeling of warmth and tenderness. I felt so much love in that place. My folks always made sure to make me know that I was loved. They would tell me every day how special i was to them. 

My boyfriend shows me a lot of love too, but it’s different. He shows it through his actions. He works more than one job to keep us afloat. He makes sure I eat, even when I’ve worked long days and don’t feel like it. It’s not the same love, but it’s a strong love. We laugh together and he knows how to be supportive when my mental health is not as great as I wish it was.

I used to never do anything cool because I was afraid of getting in trouble, and all that really did was make it so I had no good friends because all my ""friends"" were also goody two-shoes that didn't do anything but sit around and read books all the time. Nothing wrong with that, but I didn't fit in. I guess it didn't help I was hella cringey, anyways, I used to only listen to VGM and shit like those kids you see people make starterpacks about all the time. Like, I listen to more conventional songs now and all I want is to find someone that likes the songs do as much as I do, but I'm an adult surrounded by other adults who don't have the time to. Really feels like I've missed my opportunity. I only did half the stuff I did to end up where I am now because that's what my parents wanted, but it's not what I wanted and now I have no friends or social skills and don't even know what I want from life anymore. I lie to them everyday about how college is going fine when in reality I've already given up on everything less than a month into the semester and wasted thousands of dollars like I usually do every semester because I legit don't know what else to do with myself.

Me and my best friend don’t really talk as much, we don’t really play the same PC game anymore, which means most of our time together doesn’t really exist anymore. I lost him to another group of people that I don’t really like. My other friends are on a separate platform, so I spend my free time playing WOW alone.

As for other people, were still friends, and everything appears fine, but I feel disconnected from everyone. Like I’m on a separate plane. I went through a breakup where the girl was in a bad spot and just had to break it off, and I received no closure. This added to it. 

This entire month I’ve been extremely stressed with school and extracurriculars that I just can’t anymore. I have some out of state trips for a tournament in the next week that Im usually exited for, and I could care less right now. In and out more and more work, I feel so burned out.

We dated for only 7 months but up to that point, it was the happiest I had ever been in my life. She told me every day how much she loved me and she always wanted to do nothing more than spend time together and cuddle. She made me feel so loved. She told me she felt safe with me, she told me about the things going in in her life and of her deepest worries and I did the same. We planned for our future together.

Things were perfect and then we both had to go to sleep. I texted her goodnight and that I loved her with all of my heart and she responded the same. She was so beat from work and her home life every single day but still always had time for me and she always just wanted me close to her. And I never wanted anything more than to be by her side... We both went to bed and in the morning, I messaged her before work like I always did. I made sure to wake up at 6AM every day so I can tell her I loved her. I told her to have a good day and that I'll talk to her when she gets home. Everything was normal.

And then I didn't hear from you all day. I messaged you again when I knew you'd be home but I never got a response. The next morning I was so confused but I messaged you again. I had no way of contacting you other than this phone in my hands, so I texted you again the second night. You had never ignored my messages before. So I asked if everything was okay. Days passed, weeks passed, your birthday passed and I drove to work crying. The past few weeks I tried calling, I tried texting, I tried everything I could do to get a hold of you since I couldn't drive to see you. 

I needed you so much and I felt like I had lost such an important part of my life. I tried my best to stay positive in my messages and my letters. But in the inside I felt empty. I had no idea what had happened to you and if I could have had anything in the world at that moment it would have been just to get a message from you, to hear you, or to see you. I needed you and you were gone, and I fell into a dark place.

Weeks passed, months passed, and I had days where I couldn't get up from bed because I felt nothing but hopelessness. I cried at work, I cried in the shower, I stopped taking care of myself. I didn't care what happened to me, all I felt was pain. Abandonment. Fear.

I had come to the conclusion that you had passed away. There was no way that you would have done this by choice. You told me you would never and that I was the most important person in your life. You told me about your last relationship, you told me how you were abandoned and how much it hurt. You told me of how I was your light in the darkness. How I could make you smile and feel loved when nobody else could.

I found comfort in knowing that the last moment I shared with you was one of love. My unfaltering love and joy. I would have done anything for you Lilly. My beautiful Lilly.

I waited for you for so long. I still held your matching ring in my hand and I still hoped for your return. When I was at my darkest point in life, your friend was there for me, and he supported me and we bonded over the pain we both shared. Eventually he convinced me I needed to move on, and I felt like I needed to let go finally. I didn't want to though. I needed to for my mental and emotional health. I met this other girl and we got close and eventually started dating. I was broken and fractured but she put me back together again. I would never be the same but I could feel happiness again. I had forgotten what a loving touch felt like. I had forgotten what it meant to be loved by someone and what it was like to have butterflies whenever you heard their voice, saw their name, or thought of them. I was in love again.

Nearly 6 months later everything was going normally. I had just woken up that morning and I had a dream about you. In my dream you messaged me and I was so happy. We met up and we started talking again and you apologized for everything that had happened and I just wanted nothing but to be with you again. It felt so nice... I woke up from my dream and felt guilty. I was in a new relationship and I realized I wasn't fully committed to it. I wasn't ready to move on.

Later that day I got a message and to my shock, it was you. It felt like the dream I had just had but instead of pure joy, I felt a mix of sorrow and nausea, then anger which settled into desperation to know what happened.

We talked and then met up and you explained what had happened. You seemed so sad and regretful. I set aside my brief anger and needed answers and I needed them now. I was scared and nervous to be around you. Something I had never felt before. You told me you were in an car accident. You told me that you were having mental health problems and that the problems you had at home became so difficult that you became homeless for a while... All this had happened in six months. You didn't seem like the same Lilly. My beautiful, bright, and loving Lilly. You seemed worn down... Beaten and tired... But you seemed happy to see me.. and I was happy to see you.

I told my girlfriend what had happened and that I needed time alone with you and she understood.  We talked for hours and I told you what I had been through. I told you how much I needed you and how I would have done anything to hear your voice again. I told you how much I loved you and how I never expected you to leave.. I told you that I had always wanted to be there for you and I would have done anything in my limited power to protect you, to relieve you of the burdens you faced. I told you that I had found somebody else and explained that I thought you were dead... I would have never left if I knew. You knew I tried my best to be a loving and dedicated boyfriend... But how can I wait for half a year? Half a year without hearing from the one person in my life who meant the world to me. I loved you with all of my heart. With my soul. With my very being and you took that for granted...

You grew distant after we both realized that things weren't the same. I was in a new relationship, emotionally scarred and sorrowful, and you had been through things I can't even comprehend. I still cared about you... I guess I still loved you. I still wanted things to go back to the way they were. To hold you one last time and tell you everything is going to be okay when the rest of your world is falling apart. I wanted to be your rock again, the pillar you leaned on when you just couldn't deal with the pain of your life. But I couldn't.

We stopped talking for a few weeks and then we met up again. Things were much different now. You were coming to terms with the new situation and I felt as distant as ever from my current girlfriend. I didn't know what I wanted but I felt like I couldn't let our relationship end the way it did... I dedicated over a year of my life with you, then waiting for you. And I couldn't let things end that way.

Eventually we had a heart to heart and we were entirely honest about how we felt about the situation, with each other, and I said some things I shouldn't have. The one thing I had always prided myself on was always being a faithful, dedicated, boyfriend who would do anything for the one he loves... but at that moment I just wanted to be with you again. We didn't do anything, but the fact that I wanted you reminded me of how I can't get over you. We distanced ourselves again.

A week later we talked for the final time. We opened up again and we both apologized for what happened and for saying and doing things we shouldn't have. You were in so much pain and I was barely holding onto the little composure I had. I wanted to cry. I needed someone. Anyone to hold me. Eventually you told me that seeing me was nothing but pain and regret for the things you did. You told me you were sorry but you were happy for me, and then you told me that the best thing I could do for you was to leave you alone. I said ""Okay"" and I did. It's been two months now and I haven't broken that promise, but there are times when I want to...

I just wanted to tell you that I'm so sorry Lilly. I'm sorry that I couldn't have supported you or made you feel safer when you needed me most. I'm sorry that you felt the need to cut me off for those six months and that I didn't try even harder to contact you. I'm sorry that I moved on and didn't wait for you like I had told you when we made our promises to each other...

This all started because I decided to dig through our messages and saw something that I shouldn't have. It was us talking when we were at our happiest. It hurt me so much to read. You were telling me how much you loved spending time together. You told me how much I meant to you and to never leave you.... 

I am in a relationship with another woman, and I like to think that I'm happy... But I don't know anymore. The way we talked is so much different than the way I currently talk with my girlfriend. Maybe it's because of my new insecurities.. maybe it's because I'm scared of being hurt again, maybe it's because I know I'm not completely over things... I know you're trying to move on Lilly, if you haven't already done so, and I'm trying to do the same. I just don't know how to be happy. I want to talk to you again...

I don't know why I can't get over you. I don't know why every time I see something that reminds me of you it brings me back to the happy moments we shared. I don't know why I can't fully invest myself in my current relationship or why I can't be as happy as I once was. I just want us both to be happy...",10Feb2020,1

So for some background, I have PTSD, manic depression and deal with suicidal thoughts daily. I’ve always had trouble seeing therapists or counselors because as a kid, I would be beaten for my step father even so much as THINKING I had told my grandmother or someone else about what was going on. And was constantly punished for throwing “pity parties” any time I would complain about the things that went on. So I have had a tough time reaching out and connecting with someone basically my entire life, other than those close friends I trust. But somewhat due to these mental issues, on top of burying my 5 friends since September 30th, 2018 until, including my fiancé, I have ended up self medicating. Throughout being a teenager/high school, I could dabble with anything and never so much as have a small craving. Well the first time I touched that horrible heroin, I was hooked. It’s been about four years or so now. My fiancé ended up on it thanks to me, when we first started dating she went with me to the friends house I used with and she ended up trying it and hooked as well. So we used for a majority of our relationship together. She dealt with depression and had attempted suicide in the past. 
Last September she went through with it, and took her own life in my garage while I was napping on the couch. We were both fed up and ready to be clean, we had tried going to clinics and were finally set on it. But life seemed to have other plans and took her from me. Which obviously has set me back some and put me further in the whole for a while. I had lost my job about 2 months before she passed and a friend helped me get a new job a month or two after she did. It ended up being the worst job I have ever had and quit maybe 3-4 months later. So now I have gone down a pretty bad bad, got arrested for the first time ever, been in a very low place and I know it’s time to be done with it all but I have been afraid to face my emotions and trauma head on without something to... well numb me. On top of that, I’ve lost all my friends since her passing, and feel like everything is going wrong constantly. I hate feeling like someone who just complains but life has finally beaten me down. I have always been told how “strong” I am by my family and didn’t believe it until recently and now I feel like I have finally broken. Like the weight is too much to bear. I know if I don’t get out of all of this soon and away from everything, I won’t be alive much longer. 
So I have been planning on going into treatment now, and have been planning on one here in my city where my fiancé had actually gone early last year. She only stayed about a week and came back to my house after she left, even though I told her not to. But she enjoyed it there, and I have heard good things about the place so that’s where I have planned on going. But my family wants me to go out of state. Arizona possibly. Which does sound really nice to me, getting away from everything and everyone for a little bit. New scenery, people and such. And it’s also in the city my fiancé and I had wanted to move in the future. 
But here is my dilemma. I know have court in a little over a month for my arrest, and I also have a pet at home with pneumonia that is on a strict medicine regimen and I’m worried the best thing to do is put the poor thing down because she is not doing too great. I promised all of my animals that I would be there when it was their time to go. And so far have held true to that. I am also dealing with insurance because of my motorcycle being stolen. So I’m not sure if I’m going to need to be around to handle some of that. 
So I’m just not sure what to do Reddit. Should I go to an outpatient program until my court date,  so that I can start cleaning up and in case I am ordered to go to a program; so that I can handle my insurance and also so I can be here for my pet. Instead of having to worry about someone else taking care of her and if she passes while I’m gone I will be devastated. I would still plan on going after my court date, honestly probably For a longer amount of time than if I were to leave this week like my family wants. Or should I go ahead and go for a couple weeks, and come home, risk being away from my pet, and also risk failure and relapse for not staying until I have my mind in the right spot? 
Talking to a friends mom of mine today, who, I found out today,  is actually one of the head directors of the treatment place here I had planned on going to, and she said that the longer one goes in, the higher their chance of success is, obviously.
I apologize for the long rant, if you read this far. Thank you so much and just any advice, opinions, talking is very appreciated. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

43,"These past two days I've  thought about the first 3 months of my sophomore year in HS and how I felt like my life was on top of the world and for the first time in my life I would rather go to school then miss a day, It started the first day when I asked the school officer to my first class, I got to my first class and was shown to my second class, it was in this class that I met the first person of what would be my friend group throughout these 3 months she was a cute blonde who helped me get to my next class, the next day I walk in school she and her group of friends were hanging near the entrance and she asked if I wanted to hang with them, there were 3 others in this group, the other guy in the group looked identical to me just shorter which I wasn't used to, the other 2 girls were a red head with freckles and a dark haired girl, I am pretty sure the dark haired girl and guy were both related since they were both Latinos the group was labeled as the druggies and would usually joke with me about not being one, I hung out with them the morning after and they found me at lunch and asked if I wanted to join them in going to mcdonalds at first I said no because of fear of being caught away from school by my uncles who traveled down the same area from time to time but after about 5 seconds I just started going with the 2 of the Latinos and I went with them when they offered which was usually every other day.

That was the first time I felt like I truly rebelled in school as usually I was just the shy kid who was the good kid, I hung out with this group every day I went to this High School, I was really hung around the 2 Latinos the most because the guy was super fun to hang with and I was becoming attracted to the girl and I liked that my first group of friends in HS were all a year ahead of me and people knew me as the shy kid who hung around the druggies, some of my more interesting moments with them were going with the other guy whenever he had to go visit the school cop because he said she would go easier on him if I was there, going with the Latina when she took a make up test early in the morning, I had a choice to go with her or the other guy and walk around the school but they both wanted me with them, the last was something called Burning of The H where the redhead and two Latinos begged me to come and it was my first HS event by myself with friends, that night once it was over I hear the two girls talking and about making the night special for me and the Latina ask the red head to kiss me and she says no then the Latina says she will, this would have been my first kiss and she says that I'm really cute and I just say thanks and feel awkward afterward, I get a text from my uncle after to pick me up and I leave, I still haven't had my first kiss at 23.
 
The next month is where things start going me and my uncle became homeless and I stopped coming to school, I then move in with my abusive cousin who I thought changed and that began the period where everything started going downhill.",10Feb2020,1

45,"I (15F) am a sophomore in high school. High school itself is not that bad. At the moment, I feel like I'm in a good place. I simply need to work on my time management skills, and stop procrastinating and getting distracted. 

I get homework. Some days I truly do get overwhelmed with it, but most days, it would only take me a few hours to complete, and I'd probably be able to go to bed on time, if not even have free time.

But is that what I do? Haha of course not... I get home from school every day, feeling tired and exhausted, not only physically, but mentally as well. I talk to my mom for about half an hour and vent about my day, which helps alleviate the stress and clears my mind. I then have a snack and go up to my room, in which I collapse in my bed. I take a nap, which ranges from 10 to 45 minutes usually, depending on how I feel. I set my alarm for a given time, and then wake up. It's very hard to wake up, so I need at least 10 to 15 minutes to be able to function and to feel awake again. At that time, I usually scroll through social media and entertain myself. But do I only take 10 minutes? No, of course not. Usually, I end up laying in my bed for way longer. Half an hour, an hour, maybe two. Then I go and have dinner, and also have to shower. By the time I sit down to do my homework, its either 7, 8, or 9 pm. There have been days when I've sat down to do my homework at 10 and 11 pm.. bad decisions... Then after getting to my homework, I keep on getting distracted by things. It's like my mind is doing everything to avoid doing my homework. But in the end, I stay up until 12, 1, 2, or 3 am doing homework. Then I wake up the next day feeling terrible. My brain all numb and foggy. My eyelids heavy.  I somehow end up getting through the school say this way, sometimes struggling to keep my eyes open. Then I get home and repeat. 

I wish I didn't do this. It makes me feel awful, and I feel like my life is wasting away cause I'm not getting the enjoyment I should be getting out of my day. Getting a good amount of sleep would make me feel so much better throughout the day. I'd be able to be more focused, and be in a better mood overall. 

I'm a perfectionist, so I can never leave my homework uncomplete or anything. I always have to try my best and get everything done. If I don't finish my homework, I wouldn't be able to sleep. I struggle with insomnia sometimes as is, but I would 100% not be able to sleep knowing I have incomplete homework. I've tried to change my ways multiple times, but it's not working out that well. Last week, the best day was when I went to bed at 11:30 on Tuesday. The rest of the days were mixed between 12 and 2 am. And even now, as I'm typing this, its already 1 am. 

I'm just sick and tired of it. I feel like each day, I'm walking around braindead, and my life isn't leading me anywhere. I guess I need to try and fix my schedule harder. It's just that I'm so exhausted after school, and don't feel like I'm capable of sitting and doing homework. Like, by the end of the school day, my brain becomes so tired that it loses its ability to process information.

I dunno what to do since every time I've tried getting it together, I've never been able to. I guess you could say it's a lifestyle, but I don't want it to be. I want to change this, desperately. 

If anybody has any advice or anything, please let me know! It would be greatly appreciated.",10Feb2020,1
46,"As you don't know, of course, I am a man of many aches. In my - just shy of - 28 years every part of me has hurt in every possible way to the point I'm starting to think my body is suffering from münchhausen and my brain remains unaware. Just in the last year I've spit up blood because my tonsils were ragged due to infection, and my entire left arm - after carrying home quite a heavy bag on my shoulder, was rendered numb for several weeks due to a pinched nerve. Last year, I went to the dentist where he felt up my mastication muscles as if they were a cheap-and-easy working girl and told me they were overdeveloped to an olympic level. At first flattered, he then proceeded to ask me whether I frequently use drugs, such as cocaine or MDMA. ""Of course not,"" I barked, ""not regularly,"" I muttered. He asked me whether i clenched my jaws. And i confirmed. Because I do, a lot, and it hurts, even more. So basically the muscles in my cheeks are 40 year old olympic runners whose muscles and menisci are so worn down they have the integrity of a senate impeachment inquiry. 
But also polyp-surgery, a fractured nose, a crushed index finger, a broken thumb, and other many stupid things have befallen me. One of the most annoying though, is headaches. Not because they're so intense, but they are very frequent.

Two snoozes later, i tumbled out of bed, made my way to the bathroom and stuck my hand in the medicine drawer clawing at any and all medication. as i swallowed probably four or five pills, of which at most two were morphine, and drank a glass of water I looked at myself in the mirror. ""just my luck. Headache. Again!"" I thought, as i stared at my tired eyes, broken nose, and my olympic cheeks, ""of course, once again, simultaneous with my stupid jaw clench..."" A frown unfolded on my face, my grip on the glass weakened, it slipped from my hand, ""It can't be!"" I shouted! The glass shattered on the ground and on the bottom it said 'You Effing Moron, Ltd."" Because yes! Yes! Of course it's connected. Of course you've been having headaches for eight years at the same time as your jaws ache, BECAUSE IF YOU CLENCH ALL YOUR MUSCLES YOU. GET. HEADACHES!

I've not done a good job of staying on track of things in my life, I definitely should have graduated high school but didn't. 

I definitely should have had a job by now that I am 22 and I definitely should not have let my weight get out of control (right now around 400 pounds). 


I can't change the past though, only the present. I am trying to right my path and trying to find the direction to go in. 


Lately I've taken up ""intermittent fasting"", I am confident in it and have made it work for me over the last month. I might have even already lost some weight (recently tried on a couple of shirts that were a bit tighter a few months ago).


This brings me to the rest of my life's problems, no job experience and no education. How can I write this into a resume to move forward? 

It's not like I've been completely idle. Starting at the age of 17 I've been running somewhat of my own online business, selling things online. Sadly this experience is not something I can write onto a resume and most would consider how I've been making money a side income (up to around a thousand a month).


I can read and write very well, I spend hours on Reddit every week reading and writing, participating in discussions. I feel like it is time for me to go back to school and get the equivalent to a Grade 12 diploma. I have recently discovered how to do that but I do have some obstacles in my way. 


I am making this on a throwaway so I don't mind mentioning that I'm in Canada, it's winter, with my weight issue I've let the crappy weather get the best of me and I regularly go weeks on end without leaving my house. Lately as I've once again been trying to lose weight and eat better I've also been doing exercises of sorts in my house since I can not go on walks the weather is too bad. My main reason for not going on walks is if I slip on the ice and hit the pavement, I'm likely going to be in severe physical pain for a number of weeks. 


Anyways back to my point, I'm trying to figure out a direction to go in, I have been looking at entry level jobs in a city I plan to move to, something basic like stocking shelves at a grocery store to get some work experience. I feel like I would thrive in this environment however I do have Aspergers and this is no excuse - plenty of people with Aspergers have jobs- but I can't imagine the anxiety I would have prior to an interview, something as simple as eye contact would be a struggle for me. Again this is something I can work on, once I start losing more weight I'm quite certain my confidence will go up and I wont be worried about these things, I don't usually have too difficult of a time speaking with strangers as of now anyways.  


I don't want to ramble on here too much I don't even know if I want to post this here but I am hoping somebody can read this and offer me some direction. I realize the mistakes I've made in my life and I'm getting to a point where I see so many others my life that are thriving and it honestly makes me jealous, jealousy will do nothing though, action will. Losing weight has been the first step, I know that much. Upon discussing this with my only friend, I think what's clear is at my size I can't get a job at this point, I am not fit for even something like stocking shelves, however as I said before the confidence from losing weight should boost me into a entry level position.  

My plan as of now is to stay strongly focused and disciplined on intermittent fasting, when the weather gets back I'm going to be walking 1-3km a day (I was doing this starting back in August every day until the weather got too bad ~ late November, the last few months have honestly been a blur, very depressing time for me). At some point I will need to pull the trigger and get started with the program in mind where I can get my Grade 12 equivalent. 


Oh there's another part I should mention here, my end goal is a job in web development, I've been self learning it for a while now and I honestly have a hard time staying on task, I've unfortunately also developed a severe pornography addiction and the lack of discipline has made it difficult for me to get things done. 

I've gotten to the point that I realize I need to get things done though in order to get to where I want to be. I've been learning Javascript starting late January and I'm going to keep learning it. 


Funny how I write about my excellent reading and writing skills but keep rambling and going off topic one paragraph after another, any ways back to my plan, I'd like to focus on web development while I'm losing weight, but I need some direction, how will I know when it's time to start working on my Grade 12 equivalent? It will require me to physically go to a place several times a week, I actually look forward to this because upon reading on their website they have staff in place to help guide students one on one. This is exactly what I need. 

Is my plan of focusing on losing weight / web development for a bit then getting my Grade 12 equivalent then moving to a new city (moving away from my parents too that is) and getting an entry level job a good idea? 

Is this realistic? I'm trying to be realistic, but the issue in my plan is I don't see a set in stone mark for when to make this transition to start working on my schooling. 


Also I have ninth grade education (I'm definitely more literate than a ninth grader though) as of now and I'm thinking of improving my math skills through Khan Academy. Ideally I can set out a schedule each day for working on khan academy, working on web development, and leave time for other things. 


I know this is long and a lot of rambling but I'm desperate for someone who knows something to give me a sense of direction. I'm really not happy with my current situation but instead of feeling depressed over it I'm ready to do something about it.",10Feb2020,1

I've spoken to him quite a bit and we have a fun back and forth, that's a tiny bit flirty, but nothing crazy. I asked him if he was single and he told me ""Yes, but my mom told me cute girls like you always end up hurting boys like me"" in a sarcastic tone and I thought that was hilarious but didn't really know how to take it haha.

He hasn't asked me for my number or anything, and I know that other girls find him attractive since I overheard two other girls talking and saying how they found him good looking too. He also talks to the other girls in class, really he talks to everyone, he seems incredibly personable, but nonetheless, it does make me feel a little insecure and I'm competing or something, which is fucking dumb since I literally met him like 3 weeks ago.

How do I conquer insecurity like this, and just go for it?",10Feb2020,1

62,"Mindfulness is about being fully present and aware of where we are, what we're doing, how we feel, and what we think on a moment by moment basis. By doing so, we wake up to the inner workings of our mental, emotional, and physical processes and understand why we are the way we are, think the way we think, and feel the way we feel. This understanding, coupled with acceptance leads to deep peace in the here and now.

The four best ways to develop mindfulness are:

1. Pay more attention - Try to take the time to experience your environment with all of your senses; touch, sound, sight, smell, and taste.
2. Live in the moment - Try to intentionally bring an open, accepting and discerning attention to everything you do. Find joy in simple pleasures.
3. Accept yourself fully - Treat yourself the way you would treat a good friend, with patience, empathy, and kindness.
4. Mindfulness meditation - Allow the mind to flow naturally and simply observe where it goes. Ground ourselves in our observing nature and watch life play out like a movie.

Mindfulness has changed my life as it has to everyone who has cultivated it in the past and present. It is about developing something we all have innate without ourselves, being our observing nature that's free from discriminations, criticism, and judgments.

I talk about it in detail in [this video](https://youtu.be/lxXS6PCPTCw). Please take a look and let me know what you think! =)

Best wishes to you and your mindfulness journeys.",10Feb2020,1

Me and my best friend don’t really talk as much, we don’t really play the same PC game anymore, which means most of our time together doesn’t really exist anymore. I lost him to another group of people that I don’t really like. My other friends are on a separate platform, so I spend my free time playing WOW alone.

This entire month I’ve been extremely stressed with school and extracurriculars that I just can’t anymore. I have some out of state trips for a tournament in the next week that Im usually exited for, and I could care less right now. In and out more and more work, I feel so burned out.

72,"[ORIGINAL POST HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/eztzcb/have_a_unrequited_crush_on_a_girl_in_my_extended/)

Thought I’d give an update in case anybody saw the original post and wondered how things went. I was working the day I was going out, nervous as shit about the night ahead. At one point I was daydreaming and realised her and one of our friends were in the fucking store. I took a second to kind of get my thoughts together, confused as fuck, and went up and said hey. They said they were around and just dropped by to see if I was still definitely coming out. I said I was, they seemed pleased, and so we stood and chatted for a few minutes and they left eventually. That kind of helped settle my mind; she clearly wasn’t freaked out by this at all, and actively wanted me to be there. I was excited as shit to see her.

So eventually the night rolls around, and we definitely ended up gravitating towards each other like tends to happen when we’re out together. It wasn’t awkward in even the slightest way. Jokes were made, but I kind of just laughed them off. She did get pissed at one particular joke one of her friends made; her friend had basically insinuated that she wouldn’t go for a ‘guy like me’ (whatever the fuck that means), and she told me she’d been pissed off by it, and even said to me ‘how the fuck would she know what I want?’

In all honestly I overdone it a little and drank too much, so my recollection gets hazy, but I do know a bouncer didn’t let me into a club we were meant to be going into, and while some went in anyway, her and a couple of my other friends stayed with me and we went somewhere else for a couple of hours. The other two that were with us are kind of flirty with each other, so we all kept making jokes about how it felt like we were on a double date or something. 

Anyway, the night came to an end, and when it came time to get a cab and there wasn’t enough space for everyone she just said she’d hang back with me and we’d just get one ourselves. So in the end it was me and her alone in a cab home, and she was talking basically the whole way about her own relationship shit. I knew she’d been seeing someone not long ago, but she said that was over, that she’d tried tinder recently but apart from like a hook up it hadn’t gone anywhere, etc. The cab driver kept joking that she should just date me which we both just kind of awkwardly laughed off. When she got home and we said bye she said ‘give me a hug you idiot’, so I gave her a big hug and she told me to let her know when I got home safe (probably cause, like I said, I was pretty drunk lmfao).

She’s a pretty bad social media replier, so after that and a little bit of conversation the next day about how we were both hungover, that’s been it really. I had a really fucking good night being with her, I instantly just felt at ease and all the other bullshit went right out my head. It honestly just felt like business as usual for us, I’m so happy that the jokes didn’t cause any awkwardness between us, it anything I feel like things were a little more flirty between us than usual. I don’t want to get my hopes up; we didn’t actually talk directly about it all, which I feel like if she did really like me a lot she’d have mentioned it for sure, but I do feel like something is going on. I don’t want to put any pressure on though, I’m just excited for the next time we get to see each other to see how things develop. Nothing major really happened, but I’m happy with it all. I don’t really know where things stand between us, but I feel like the ball’s in her court. She knows how I feel, if she wants to do something about it I’m sure something will happen at some point between us.",10Feb2020,1

77,"Two years ago I moved to a new school. I didn't have any friends so I thought I'd befriend some of my new classmates. However something happened to me that made me really sad so during the first few weeks of school I was a lot quieter than usual. 

So naturally I became the ""quiet kid"" and I didn't succeed in making friends. For months I tried really hard to talk to as many people as possible and I made a few friends. 

The problem is that I don't know if they are really my friends. Sometimes I think they like me, sometimes I think I annoy them, sometimes I'm sure they like me and sometimes they just completely ignore me. I often feel like I'm their last resort like they'll only talk to me if there's nothing that's more entertaining. 

The thing that bothers me the most is that I never get invited to anything. They often hang out together but they never bother to ask if I want to join. They also have a private group on messenger that I'm not part of.  I have a huge fear of rejection so I couldn't muster up the courage in a thousand years to just straight up ask. 

I'm still dealing with what happend and I'm still quite sad so my social skills are roughly equal to a teaspoon's but I try really hard to be entertaining but I always get left out or ignored. 

I've never been this lonely in my life and I get sadder every day. I just want a few genuine friends who I can talk to and hang out with. How can I improve my friendship with them and how can I get invited?",10Feb2020,1

So I'm being financially dependent on my parents. En Epiphany hit me when I realized where my life is going and seeing other people's lifestyles at my age, especially gay guys' lifestyle and I thought of **moving to a bigger and crowdier city in another country abroad for studies while financing myself without bothering my parents and settling there until god knows when and live the lifestyle I want to.** 

I feel the current city I'm studying abroad is not matching my vibes, **finding fellow gays is very difficult although it's ""accepted"" and the fact that there's gay pride month,** and also difficult finding people with common interests, I'm feeling often excluded, perhaps that can be because I'm not fluent on the local language but I can speak the local language very well.

It just came naturally to me to be open and to express my feelings, but I understand that that wasn't the case with you. After a year and a half together, you told me I was too much. You broke up with me two days after my grandmother's funeral and you were the only one who knew how much she meant to me, so I had no one to talk to.

Months later, you apologized sincerely and asked me if we could try again. I believed you and I still do, and I know you love me because you've been treating me better than before and I appreciate that. I know we said we wouldn't talk about that 3 month dent in our relationship, but it really hurt. After being told I'm too much, I started to make myself smaller. I closed off. I kept things to myself. It's been 7 months since she died and I haven't talked to anybody about it. It's still hurts like it happened yesterday. Lots of other things have been happening and building up around me during that time too and I can't talk about that to anyone now. Not you or anyone else. No one.

I've been trying to say something for months but words just don't come out. I'm not as open as I was. I repress everything. And I hate how it feels. I feel like I could burst any moment now.

87,"Hello everyone. I hope you are well. I write this at my wits end and looking for any help that can be provided. I have a doctor appointment coming up this Wednesday (via phone) and a face to face one in 3 weeks.

I have been hesitate about going to a therapist but I have allied to a few yesterday as I know I need help. I will try to make this as clear as possible as I fear this is going to come across as rambling. I \[m27\] suffer from long term pain, I have not been pain free for 10 years. The pain is 24/7 and I have forgotten what its like to be pain free. It has some what taken over my life. Started as a permeate headache, I just woke up one day and it never left.

In the past 3 years it spread to my entire body. My doctor thinks I may have fibromyalgia, but I have not been diagnosed yet. The pain of my head and body is still 24/7.

Stress is a large trigger for my pain. And I have had a lot of additional stress in the last few months (family dog passing away, close family passing away, my dad being made redundant, my mom not reacting well to her cancer treatment).

I have been in an amazing relationship for 11 years. And got married late last year.

But, either due to to the constant pain or maybe due to my medication I have been getting mood swings ( super down moments where suicide is heavy on my mind, but far less often, I have super highs where I seem unstoppable) and gaps in my memory. The memory gaps started off small a couple of years ago but they have proceeded to get worse. I am loosing half of my days at work, loosing evenings and no recollection of conversions (this has lead to me double booking events, missing events etc) and a lot of other memories have a white lens flair over it, obscuring it making it hard to look back.

\[I have tried to keep dairies but I forget where I put them. I started keeping a digital dairy on my phone but I seemed to rewrite or deleted the entries, and forget did it\]

I have been going to the doctors for 11 years. I have mentioned my memory loss in part but not to its full extent. Yes I know this is a mistake, I honestly am worried about losing my job. I would not be able to support my future family if I can't work.

But yes I would not be able to support a family if I let my illness take me over. My wife does know, but not the the extent that I previously reviled but I have told her now. That is the background.   I met someone at work \[F26\] about a year ago. I would unexpectedly developed feelings for someone else (I believe an emotional affair though I do not recall talking about anything that personal just work stuff, tv shows books etc).

Though like most of my friends, I now have large gaps in the freindships.   The main way I communicated with people (when not face to face) was via the messenger app. But either problems with the app at the time or problems with my phone was making ti a hassle so I moved to whatsapp for most people. But this friend used snapchat so we started chatting via that. Which of course is a massive mistake, as I can not look back on the conversations.   \[With my memory loss conversations have become hard.

But stuff bleeds in, I am able to get some stuff, and though just by having other conversations I am able to pick up on new running jokes etc. But it has gotten so much harder.\]   I didn't realise about this “emotional affair” until to late. My friend now lived in a different city and I visited her in her new city. And this is where it gets super worrying. \[My friend does not know about my mood swings or memory gaps\].

The emotional affair went against everything believe in, and now the affair turned physical. We went out for drinks with her friends. But stuff happened before we didn't have sex but we got to “second base”. Again I don't remember this, I get minor flashes but I cant “view” it. After we went for drinks more stuff happened, I guess “3rd base”. Again I get flashes but I can not view it fully. I see moments when I really try to focuses.

The more I try to look back my pain spikes. I do know that we did not have, as we talked about t after wards. I stayed the for 1 night 2 days. I cant not remember most of it. Its like it was somebody else, as cliched as this sounds. I planned to end this friendship after this. Which sucks as she was one of my best friends-but it was the right thing to do. I slowed down my interaction with her but I did not cut contact with her. I wanted to end things face to face. She was my friend and she delivered that. We met up a second time a few weeks ago. My plan was to be honest, talk about the mood swings and my memory gaps.

That didn't happen. I get flashes of the weekend. Some normal things, watching films, take away food (I cant remember food being delivered, what films bar 1 etc). we left on good terms but I knew something had happened and was off. From what i can tell more messing about- i didn't even cut things off like I planned So I was going to be honest over the phone and cut things off over the phone, which I hated but as I kept loosing such large gaps I had to it. As i said i planned to cut things off but it had been to weeks and haven't been able to call her. She is on shift work which made it hard to find a good time.

Then Friday evening I got a message from her (my friend's) mom. telling me not to contact her daughter (my friend) ever again and that I had forced myself and no means no. And to never contact her again.   From what I can tell I was/had forced myself. I don't think anything happened but what I had done is fucking disgusting, and now I have also done something that is sexual harassment? Assault? This was killing me I couldn't believe I could have even done something like this.

I gave an apology but I couldn't remember doing this shit, some flash backs but noting as bad as what I apparently did so the apology was generic as i cant recall most of it. Then yesterday received a message from my former friend.

She talked about how she did at one point value the friendship. That I ruined it and that I had no respect for my marriage. She did reveal that I tried to kiss her, and tried to unbutton her jeans. And that I kept trying. Though yes still fucking shit, at least I know I'm not a rapist. I said sorry and wished her good luck.

I did not tell her about the mood swings or memory gaps as, it sounds fake. It sounds like a cop-out. Sadly my friendship has ended with her hating me. Though this isn't how I wanted to do it. I am glad that it did. I know I have to tell my wife what happened, but I don't know how. I barely remember what has happened.

Like I said, it sounds like a cliche but it feel like it is a different person. My friend unfriended me and my wife on Facebook (but kept other friends of mine). So my wife may realise something is up on her own.   I need to tell her. But I really don't now how. I am looking for a therapist at this very moment. I might tell her AFTER I have seen a therapist, to try and sort out my mind.

I know this isn't an easy situation. But any help that can be providence would be grateful.

\---- How should I tell my wife? When? Has anyone had a situation similar to this?

\----- How can I ever gain trust of my self again? If I can not gain trust how will my wife be able to?

\------ Mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse. But if I cant remember, if it doesn't feel like me., How can I take responsibility?

Thank you for any help

TL/DR: I \[M27\] have chronic pain, mood swings and memory gaps. I had an affair \[F26\] I barely remember having it. It feels like another person. I don't know how to tell my wife \[F27\]of a relationship of 11 years.",10Feb2020,1
88,"I used to be crazy introverted. I worked at a place for 2 whole years and never had a single conversation not work related. I talked to no one, hung out with no one, and lived alone. And I thought it was fine. But it was not fine. 

I made my first friend at age 23. That's when it started because I realized like wow people can actually love me for me??? WTF??!? It was a like a revelation. I also never realized up to this point that socializing can actually be fun.

I started approaching people and talking to them and my life began to improve to an unbelievable extent. I realized that when you talk to people you build social connections. For example, at work, you can get away with so much shit when people like you. If it's a strict work relationship people are unforgiving when you slip up. 

Life sucks when you're by yourself. It's harsh and unforgiving. You don't have to live like that. I'm so happy that I was able to realize this, even if it was a bit later than normal.

100,"My depression and social anxiety makes it so hard to connect with people. This girl was so nice, she meant well, but I guess during my major depressive episode I isolated myself. When I get like that, people tend to back off. 

I’ve heard people describe me as “versions” of myself, “exhausting”, “unpredictable”, “too much”, “comes on too strong”. She was yet another friend who told me those were the reasons she separated herself from me. Including the fact it looked like I was brushing her off every time I canceled hang outs or didn’t respond to her messages. 

From my perspective, she had been very cold and then stopped talking to me. My aunt and grandmother died over winter break. My birthday went by. Nothing from her. I eventually got a text saying she wanted to catch up but I couldn’t respond because I was going through a horrible low. 

And then the school year started. She socially ignores me. Smiles a little but doesn’t try to say hi. I don’t know all that’s happening in her mind and she doesn’t know mine. But to me, it looked like she peaced out because I was too messed up to be around. It was rude not to give condolences or say happy birthday. But I don’t even know if it is my place to feel that way.

I was operating under the pain of that. When she sent her reply after I inquired why she was giving off a weird vibe, she said what I’d mentioned before. “Exhausting” “versions” and she was hitting a point where she also wanted to work on herself and distance herself a little from people because she’s graduating college and has shit to figure out. 

My gut reaction was anger. I indignantly felt discarded and blamed for being too messed up to maintain a relationship with her. Which honestly is true. I replied stating her dropping off when I was extremely depressed, selectively ignoring me in public, smiling to my face, not saying anything to me over winter break, and then saying to me I was exhausting and came in versions was really tactless and dishonest. It looked like to me, she decided early on she didn’t want to be my friend because she felt that way about me. I told her I wish she mentioned sooner how she was feeling and brought it up in a supportive way instead placing out but smiling to my face in public, all the while I was worried why I hadn’t heard from her.

The kicker is our last conversation. I told her I distanced myself from her during my episode because she seemed like a happy carefree person and I didn’t want to mess that up for her. I didn’t want to need her because she deserves better than me.

Then I said I can’t blame myself for going through what I went through and I don’t want to feel like I’m not worth good friendships. I said I might actually hurt myself bc it’s just too much to lose another person the same way. 

Then she called the cops last night. I woke up to knocking. Had to explain to them I was okay just not in a good place. 

It was so humiliating. I genuinely feel like people don’t know how to handle those with mental disorders. 

Like we live in a world where it’s okay to report people anonymously about their mental health to get “support” but not actually talk to them. And I feel so stigmatized any time I open my mouth and express how I’m truly feeling. I become too much, versions, exhausting. I don’t know what to do anymore. I hate hate myself. I feel like such a screw up.",10Feb2020,1

102,"
This year would be my 5th year working at this place.  It’s not a career type job (it’s a seasonal job), but I love it.  This was my first job and I’m pretty good at it.  I’ve been a supervisor for 2 years.  Last year they were looking to promote people and I asked about it.  Since they don’t have an application for this position my boss just did interviews.  Well, he gave me a few things to work on, so I didn’t get promoted.  The things he gave me to work on were super stupid and generic things.  Yet 4 others got promoted.  I have been here longer than all four and honestly I believe I’m more liked among my direct supervisors than them.  All my coworkers wondered why I didn’t get promoted.  Even my direct supervisor thought I should get promoted and told our boss.  The promotion never happened last year.

The season is about to start up again and a month ago I messaged my boss about the promotion.  They never even messaged me back.  Our “training” is in a few weeks, for they’re probably just message me then.  But today I found out that someone else got promoted.  It was someone who has been here as long as me, but has only been a supervisor for 1 year.  Now the thing is we’re close and I really think he should be promoted, and vice versa.  He texted me and told me and I was really happy for him.  But I’m still so disappointed.  I work my tail off and literally EVERYBODY likes me.  All the supervisors think I should get promoted, and our associates LOVE me.

I usually just scroll past her posts with an eye roll and keep moving. This time last year she found out she was pregnant and posted non stop about it. Unfortunately she lost the baby a few months in. Now, I understand that miscarriages can be very emotional and grief-filled experiences. However she has been posting NON STOP about this miscarriage for weeks. Everything has been related to the miscarriage. She posted a picture of the snow and thanked her unborn baby for giving her snow. She posts selfies just stating she that her and her husband think about the baby every day - stuff like that. In my opinion there is absolutely no problem with sharing the initial experience online to inform your family and get support from other women who have experienced the same thing. I know It shouldn’t bother me this much, and I can just unfollow her (which I plan on doing) but to me it just feels like she’s using a tragic event to get attention and sympathy from people.

I made the decision to get my AA because, the college i'm currently going to doesn't have the degree i wanted (computer science). So i thought ""hey"" I might as well get my AA and transfer since i'm getting money from the GI, and working then i can transfer to a university. 

I fucked up.

Tomorrow i'm putting in my two weeks notice to my job. I realized that i won't have the money to a university for the CS program, cause i have to use the money from the GI bill for bills, and food.   I can't cancel the GI bill cause once you start you can't stop the GI bill process, and if i drop out i wouldn't get any money and it would just continue until it reached the two year mark.  My parents said to quit or limit my job so i'll just quit because, most of the time i was exhausted when I would come home from work.

I tried to tell them that college isn't for me but , they said continue with it or else you just wasted your time and money which is true. I seen on a lot of entry level job listings for programming  is that you need a four year degree, or masters, and i'm just bewildered.  I taught myself programming and enjoyed creating projects.   I did it on my free time but with school, and work I couldn't continue practicing it because,  school work would just pile up and i had to wake up at 5 a.m for work.

i'm on the verge of another breakdown because i'm just wasting my life and my parents time away, all there hopes and dreams of having their son getting a good job will not come true.

I wanted to take the time off to improve myself, mentally and physically because, sitting in a classroom for two hours learning information that will not help me in my field, (if I get into it), is a waste of time. But they say this piece of paper will help you land a job, and have a good life.

Fuck that shit!

Take this as an example: Tomorrow, Tuesday, I have one essay to write and get a grade on in English, one test in English, one huge test in Romanian, one test in German and also a fuck ton to learn in German next to the test. That's all in one day. And so is every day of every week until June comes and I'll have three whole months of summer break, which is a great amount of time, but there is a great amount of homework, books and books and books to read and hundreds of pages of math to solve. Then eight grade comes and after that, it will be the exam that pretty much decides my future and fate. I think that I will get into the school I want and I will, but there is a lot to learn for that, but I will learn all that crap and pass that exam. And that's getting into the high school I want. Most people don't even struggle that much in other countries with their college entrance, and don't even get me started on that.

128,"So this is just going to be more of a rambling more than anything, but it’s a pretty difficult transition period for me now.

I was at a company A for 3 years. I always loved how close it was to home, but hated the work itself. I eventually moved up from the bottom of the barrel to doing IT, but even then, the pay itself was crap. We also had to rotate each 3 months to other shifts, including weekends and nights. A lot of sacrifice for what the job paid. But even through all that crap, I enjoyed the place. I met a lot of good friends there, and hope to still communicate with most of them. 

But eventually after applying to other spots, I finally landed a gig downtown. More pay, but also came with more responsibilities. I wish I could say it was as easy as simply packing my stuff up and going, but it’s been hard. Almost as if it was by fate, I met a person working at company A I fell for hard. To make the situation even shittier, they were already taken anyway, but i was still determined to, I can’t even tell you what the end result was, do something with that person. But besides the hanging out every now and then, I realized I couldn’t live that way forever. Yes, I had gotten another job at the other company, but this person coming into the picture complicated the transition so much for me. I tried justifying ways to stay at company A, stupid reasons. Maybe I could get a promotion, maybe I’ll just work extra time to make the pay difference up, etc. I already had gotten a new job most people would die to get, and here I was thinking of throwing it away. I would have done anything just to stay at A to see this person.

I made my big boy decision today to say screw it and finally leave company A. I was on leave just in case I hated my new job, but this was all before I met the person. It feels shitty.

My friend is having a wedding and I am one of the bridesmaids.

It took me until 2017 to really love and embrace my natural hair and I feel like it’s a major part of who I am. But I understand that it’s her day and she wants things a certain way and I don’t want to take away from that but I don’t think the style of my hair is really going to affect her wedding in a bad way.

133,"Ever since the breakup she suggested we stay friends. She apparently didn’t love me and saw me as more of a friend, even wanted to do the same couple activities. I initially gave in, but my emotions were all over the place. I’d go from speaking to her as usual, to blocking her and so on. It didn’t feel healthy and my mind would create scenarios in which I would imagine her with other guys and over me already, which infuriated me and I took out my anger in the heat of the moment over text, saying I didn’t care about her. This hurt her, and for the sake of not wanting to say anything more stupid and hurtful I decided to take a one week break and we both agreed. 

During this week I felt shitty for what I’d done, I wanted to make things right so I apologised but of course she was still pissed and very dismissive. 

This went on for a good few weeks, and it got worse and worse. A part of me knew things weren’t the same anymore as I could feel the coldness in her replies, the one word answers and just general dis-interest. 

When id ask her if it was me she’d tell me she wasn’t in the mood, but again with time repeating itself this got very hard to believe. 
Even when I would bring up the issue she would just boil it down to me having to ‘chill out’ and tell me to shut up, which felt like a kick in the nuts.

Alot of the times I honestly felt obsessed with her. I’d check her snap scores, see when she was last online and anxiously await for replies (which would always disappoint me). This ate away at my sanity, and it made me seek her validation and reassurance again. I’d often ask to see her, apologise when it wasn’t even needed and not really be myself anymore. 

We finally arranged to meet for me to collect my shorts and even in person it just felt awkward and wrong and like “what on earth am I doing here”. She told me she’d slept with two guys not a week after we’d broken up (during the week in which I flipped on her) and just seemed to get annoyed with most things I did. 

Yet afterwards I’d feel this longing to be with her again, like a literal addict. This whole situation just seemed tainted and completely like not a good idea, but letting go was so hard. I missed the good parts of her and ignored the bad. Yet I explained myself to her and now it’s final. No going back but at the same time I’m hoping what I’ve done is rational because the second thoughts are already starting to creep up.",10Feb2020,1
134,I am starting my business soon and that was one of the first steps. I know it’s not much and anyone can get one but I feel like it’s an  accomplishment of some sort even if I haven’t sold a thing yet.,10Feb2020,1
135,"Just had a random thought today. When my wife has sex with me and she squirts (which she does quite often), what is she spraying all over me, the bed and probably the ceiling fan?

Well I found out.

136,"Went to lunch with a friend and 2 mutual friends whom I just met. I said I could pay for my own stuff. ok so we split the bill, then I end up paying half of the bill. I ask them if I can have some money back cause I paid for two peoples worth of food and they say “we are going through a tough time right now” so they don’t have money..

Bill cost me $60 wtf...",10Feb2020,1
138,"With the knowledge I knew now...
Why did I ever waste my youth trying to be good and holy. So fearful of God and his judgement. I never lived life.
I got mad once at work because no one ever does anything to complete and I am the MVP. Without me everything fails... I got so mad I jerked my head violently and I knew I gave myself a concussion then. My head was light headed everytime I tried to wake up. And it took around 3 to 4 months to recover but my memory is all foggy now. I am so forgetful now.
It's sad.
Don't waste your youth chasing money. Happiness is what I should of pick. Everything in life is so mechanical now...",10Feb2020,2
