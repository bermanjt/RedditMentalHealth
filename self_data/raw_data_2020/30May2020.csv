1,Hi guys. I’m an 18 year old girl who is graduating HS this year and I have nothing to do due to quarantine since I have no graduation. I want to broadcast my new hobby on r/pan really badly and I don’t have enough karma. I get it if I sound begging and childish but I really want to broadcast my work. Everything is appreciated. Thank you guys so much.,30May2020,1

3,"I’ve been a long time Reddit reader but have never posted until now. I am at all accustomed to posting personal things on social media so this is literally the first time of ever done this... but I really could use input. 
My oldest son is 18 and in the Class of 2020. (Bless these kids and all that they’ve been through this year.) In 2018, he lost one of the closest friends that he’ll ever have to his heart...his first true love and true best friend. She was everything to him and he lost her unexpectedly and it was very, very tragic. Through the years I’ve developed a friendship with her parents and we now actually live about two minutes away from them. Since their daughter passed away when the kids were in 10th grade, a great deal of time has gone by and my heart ached for months this year, thinking about graduation coming and their daughter not being there and also not being honored. Since the graduation ceremony this year is going to be drive through/social-distance enforced and very informal, I decided to reach out to the company that provided the school’s caps and gowns and ask them to donate one to me to give to her parents and they happily obliged. I stopped over there this evening and presented it to them. Her mother immediately broke down as she held it, and her dad had tears in his eyes as well. My heart almost fell out of my chest and I immediately felt like what I had done was bad (I even started apologizing...). Her mom said thank you and she said she truly appreciated it, however I feel so guilty for bringing back pain, if that’s what I did. I hope that my good intentions were not truly the wrong thing to do. My fiancé and my son both gave me very positive feedback when I initially told them I wanted to do this. But after seeing her parents’ tears, I seriously felt extremely sad. They did text me shortly after I left and said they were going to frame it and thanked me again for my friendship, but I just wanted to get input because my heart hurts. I didn’t want to cause them pain all over again thinking about their daughter not being here to graduate, but I also wanted them to know that I wanted to be sure that she was remembered with her graduating class...",30May2020,1
4,"I came here at 13, my mother got a job that would allow her to return back home with me and my father. Life was good, I got a bunch of personal milestones down while here, and started my career.

2020 then decided to really show its shiny ass. COVID dropped me for two weeks, my employer's local branch folded and offered to transfer me to the head office as I have the ability to cross the border. I've had lots of free time to pack my life into four suitcases + 1 backpack, stew silently, shitpost, and all the rest of it.

I'm going to be going back to a country I haven't been in since age 13. I'll be leaving all the friends I know (and have had to say goodbye to over FaceTime because of lockdown), and ending up in a part of it where I know nobody. Not to mention the time difference: our schedules will have very minimal points in which we can talk to one another. I have to leave most of my belongings behind because of issues acquiring storage and relocation services. I'm going to be othered: a lot of you changes since age 13 especially if you move countries. I don't look forward to the accent vs origin issues I foresee myself encountering, and the ""jokes"" on that subject. I've never even been to this part of the country before, so add complete and total unfamiliarity with the area to the mix.

But yet, if I don't do this, I end up with unsustainable means of support, in a place where the head of state finally got Twitter's pathetic ""moderation"" team to act by putting a click through banner on a call to mass violence during a riot in response to effectively state-sanctioned murder and the state's lackluster handling of the situation. The government's handling of COVID results in 100k dead and counting. What's this number going to be in November? December? Next year? Not to mention inciting people to internally administer bleach, voting by mail while not approving voting by mail (or the one state that remotely voted to disallow postal voting), etc.

9,"I like most am simply shattered by the world that we're living with. The real horrors of our situation seem too much to bare. Climate change, Covid, and the ability for people to be demonstrably racist during it. I've never been more scared in my life. 

We have an ineffectual leader in the White House. We have an ineffectual government at the helm of these problems. We have a government and corporation and wealthy elites working in tandem to control the narrative, maximize profits, retain power, and keep us divided enough that we right each other instead of them. Republicans and Democrats, as humans, have so much more in common and so many comparable goals than they can afford to let us realize. 

We have a connection of communication that is called the internet which is a gift that has not been utilized for the potential it holds to do the world good. It is, in my opinion, where our hope lies. We can connect and care and disagree and compromise and find empathy in ways that weren't possible before the internet.

my gf and i disagree about the precautions about covid 19.

she is having a gathering with her family tomorrow, and says that social distancing cannot be realistically enforced forever, to justify hanging out with a group of approx. 15 people

I said i’d rather be safe than sorry, and i’m hesitant on whether or not to go to this gathering. I’m worried I’ll get sick as I do not know where her family has been. However, when I say this to her, she seems appalled that i even hold such an opinion.

I don’t know what to do. Sorry, this seems like a /r/relationships post. But I just want some quick advice. What are the dangers if i go? Have social distancing rules become more lax since march/april? I just want someone’s opinion who is more informed about this virus than I am.

34,"witchhunt rules:

(i have not play tested this at all so it might not work very well. i think the idea holds potential though.)
_____

# satan: the storyteller and liar
- describes what happens and referees
- chooses how many witches (must be &lt;1/4 number of players), but does not know who
- wins only if over half the people are damned
- damnation requirements: 
    - killing an innocent person
    - dying while cursed (from burning or the curse itself)
    - being a witch
    - being the priest in the chapel with the alter boy *
    - using the lord's name in vain *
- damnation does not kill you, but the curse does
- if satan does not pick any witches, they win if two people are damned
- for every potential witch satan does not pick, they can lie once


_____


# chapel: the safe haven
- everyone can spend 1 night in prayer in the chapel. if the curse would go off on them here, they're saved
- the chapel holds only 1 regular townsperson

_____

# witches: the killers *
- townsfolk don't know how many witches there are (it can be 0)
- witches cast a curse. it goes off on the x next morning (x = [0,n-1] with n townsfolk)
- curses must go off on different days (so you can't cast a 3-curse and a 2-curse)
- can't target everyone innocent in one round; eg: if there's 3 townsfolk, can only target 3 players
- x people die when curse activates

    example: witch casts a 1-spell, and chooses a player. the next morning, the curse activates on the chosen person. if they cast a 3-spell, they choose 3 players. not the next morning, nor the one after that, but the third morning after the night they cast the spell: all three players die and are damned.

- must cast a curse every round
- witches cannot cast the same curse twice unless they have to (if enough curses fizzled that they have no other choice) *
- witches win if satan wins
- a witch dies if they enter the church
_____


# judge: the arbiter
- a judge gets an additional entry into the chapel.
- first round, townsfolk elect a judge
- election rules: everyone votes for as many people as they want. the person with the most votes wins.
- tiebreaker is rock-paper-scissors
- townsfolk can elect a new judge once per day. they don't have to elect a new one.
- judge can be a witch if the townsfolk make a mistake
- burning happens when the judge declares it. it is optional.
- can burn someone; they die and reveal their card


_____


# priest: the voice of god 
- chosen by the judge, and stays priest until death
- can examine someone to see if they're cursed. does not know when it will work
- judge appoints priest; cannot re-appoint until priest dies
- priest can enter the chapel even if a townsperson is already inside
- the first time a priest is cursed, they are not damned and do not die. they do know they were cursed, and when it went off


_____


# alter boy: a very special boy * 
- wins if priest dies, no matter the other outcomes
- picked by priest
- knows if priest is a witch, and if so, who they cursed

_____

# townsfolk: just a bunch of regulars
- can vote on a judge from among themselves daily
- dont notice me witch senpai

_____

# win conditions
- game ends when all living townspeople decide to reveal their cards, or more than 1/2 of the people are damned (2 people are damned if satan chose 0 witches)
- if there is a witch living among them, satan and the witches win
- if there is not, the townspeople win
- burning a witch does not undo a curse, but ending the game ends all curses on the living
- the altar boy wins if their original team wins, and also wins if the priest dies

_____


_____

# how it's played:

at any point during the day, any townsperson may call for a reveal. if everyone (ignoring the dead and satan) agrees, the game ends. at any point, if enough people are damned, the game ends.  

the alter boy's win condition does not end the game. *

1. satan shuffles as many witch cards as they desire into the stack of player cards. each player draws a card.

2. everyone, including satan, closes their eyes. 

4. if the priest is a witch, the alter boy may open their eyes

3. the witches choose who to curse by placing a token in front of those people. *

3. the witches close their eyes, and then satan collects the curse tokens and makes a note of who is cursed and when it will go off. *

4. everyone opens their eyes

5. the townspeople elect a judge

6. from now on, the judge can decide if to, and who to, burn at the stake

6. the judge picks a priest (if there isn't one)

7. the priest picks an alter boy, and shows them their card (if they want to and there is no alter boy)*

8. the priest examines someone for a curse

9. everyone who wants to, says they want to enter the church
 
10. from among these, the priest picks at most 1.

11. the curse activates

11. repeat from step 2

I say no biggy I go home after the parade boot up the pc and start playing games. I'm looking at people's snapchat stories and then I see my friend who went along with about 5 other people from out core group...this is where I'm like wtf they didnt tell me? Then they sent a drunk video in our group chat and now its 10pm I'm sitting in bed confused on what to feel, close to crying from betrayal? But also confused cause like why didnt they invite me, and weirdly happy cause I graduated high school. Idk kinda hoped talking about it would help.


Bonus cause I just thought of it, i feel a huge amount of resentment from my mom I was never really into high school events I went to my homecoming freshman year then a spring fling in junior year, a few football games here and there along with volleyball games for fun but this year I was decently done with it and i could tell my mom was just disappointed that I didnt want to do anything school related, it took her prolly 3 times asking if I wanted to do this parade today before I agreed only because I had friends doing it. I did skip some other events and I'm just really fucking sick and tired of my mom asking or telling me about events that other parents kids decided to do.

I’ve ran head first into burning buildings, held skulls together with my gloved hands, and performed CPR on babies - and have never lost sleep over these events. But I haven’t slept more than an hour since I saw the video on Thursday. 

The systematic failure of the American Dream and it’s raucous laughter in the face of the marginalised scares me. I feel fear for my fellow Australians -particularly the indigenous, the disabled, and the youth. I see the events of this week reflecting what is becoming common here. Our training promotes zero harm, yet US-inspired militarisation of my workforce spreads like a disease. I don’t want to carry an assault rifle. I want to use communication not bullets to dissuade violence. 

I want to serve people, not dominate them. I fear for the future of our country if our strongest international ally wages war on its people. I don’t want to follow in their footsteps.

I promise to aggress the virulent plague that is injustice and brutality in our ranks. I promise to sow the seed of equity and fairness in every encounter I have with the public.

41,"Hello, I’m a 19 year old college student.

Just like anybody else’s, my family history is very messy. 

But, to sum up my parents’ characters (they’re separates), my dad is narcissistic, self-serving, conservative, strict, and is undoubtedly a prime example of toxic masculinity. He has done a lot of damage over the course of my entire life, getting arrested for violating a restraining order, domestic violence, doing cocaine, shooting himself in the chest, and making home life frightening and depressing. I realized a few months ago that I couldn’t focus in school while he was dragging me down mentally with him, so I’ve cut contact with him and we haven’t spoken since. 

As for my mom, I can’t ever fully trust her because of things that happened between us in the past. She’s manipulated me and my little sister for her own use in court, and was once an extremely vain woman. I’ve also imposed a great deal on her side of the family, which places a bigger strain on our relationship. Nowadays, we’ve tried to compensate for the damage in the past but it’ll never be where it used to be. While it’s easier with her, I HAVE tried to manage my expectations for both of my parents. 

However, I find myself flawed and stunted in my development from the lack of parental guidance and support. I know I’m not at my fullest potential because when I had my dad in my life during our good times, I was actually thriving. But it wasn’t worth the bad times, which were too debilitating and too frequent. 

My dilemma is that for my whole life I’ve tried to find balance in a support system. When I lived on my mom’s side, she didn’t care about me and sent me to live with her mother, my grandmother. I lashed out by becoming a rebellious teenager without regard for my future. When I lived with my dad, he was so strict and toxic it was suffocating. I’m currently living with my boyfriend’s family and while it’s great, I’ve been told by a member of his family that I can’t trust them to look out for me because I’m not blood. 

I’m so incredibly distraught. I spent my whole life trying to find a stable loving environment so that I could become the best version of myself, but I feel like there are things underneath the surface I could never compensate for. I’m clingy and insecure and I always feel like I don’t have a family. Maybe I’m bringing this onto myself by pushing everyone away out of fear of being hurt. Maybe I could muster up the strength to tackle these relationships for the good and the bad that they bring. I’m not sure. I just want to stop feeling like I’m alone. I just want people I can trust and rely on to have my back when I need it most.

44,"Social media plays a role in amplifying our grievances against one another, that much I believe to be true, but what could possibly hold humanity together when everything seems to be going wrong? Can we fight climate change and resist selling ourselves and our heritage out for immediate gains? Can we move past our differences and strive for something sustainable and equitable on a global scale? Or will we end up imploding under the sheer weight of disappointment when reality does not live up to our expectations? 

I don't know if anyone else has read the New Message from God, but it really changed the way I see myself and the world around me. Maybe it was taking the Steps to Knowledge that did it, but I no longer fear the emptiness inside. Now I simply feel like I'm floating in a massive river, flowing through time. My life is one in an endless string, and there is no way of knowing what value my life will have or has had until it's over. One thing I do know is that no one is beyond redemption. That being said, I've stepped off the path to pursue more selfish pursuits.

46,"So this just happened around 30 to 45 minutes ago. lol I posted this only cause I found it amusing. So anyway, I’m helping my family bake some bread and decide to go outside on the porch, and wait until it’s finished. Don’t know why, but I ended up going to sleep outside. When I woke up, it was raining. I thought nothing of it until I felt my neck. It was a bit sore, it was only then that it hit me. I had been asleep for too long. I tried to get back in, but the door was locked (as it usually is when the family goes to sleep.) tried calling; no answers. So I did the one thing I thought was necessary; go around the yard barefoot in hopes that the garage door was unlocked. It felt so weird, the rainwater at my feet, the bugs I was witnessing, and the couple spider webs I ran into on the way. I came to the conclusion; yeah. Never have the urge to fall asleep out on the porch ever again. Lol I finally got to the garage and as usual, the door was unlocked. So I went inside and celebrated my victory with a slice of that bread I was never there to see get taken out of the oven.",30May2020,1
47,"I was born into a military family. My dad was deployed for the first three years of my life. Growing up, we never had a good relationship. I never felt comfortable being left alone with him or even giving him a hug. I’m now 17, and I’ve worked on improving that but even now hugs feel awkward with him. 
My mom would always tell me how he was never there when I was in the NICU (I had fluid on my legs) and how she was the one who stayed by me. 
Our first duty station, I was molested by my teenage boy neighbors until they moved. I was around 5 years old, they were 14+ and forced me to spoon in the bed with their 17 year old cousin. This lead to me doing something I’m ashamed of to another family member closest to me. Even now we never talk about it, we ignore what happened and she’s my best friend.
I’ve never held a friendship for more than 6 months. I always end up getting annoyed with the person and distancing myself and blocking them on all social media. Recently, we moved to another duty station and I took the opportunity to completely ghost everyone I was once friends with. 
I’ve struggled with self harm growing up, since 7th grade. In many instances, my brother and mom have made fun of me for it. My brother in specific once told me to jump off of our banister if I was so suicidal. I’ve stopped cutting with a razor but if things get too overwhelming for me I’ll dig my nails into my skin and cut myself that way. Sometimes I don’t even think about. 
My mom let me go to a psychologist once. She recommended that they let me see a therapist ASAP. My mom took her therapy paper and never looked at it again. I’ve never been back and I’ve never had a therapy appointment. 
My mom and I have a shitty relationship. She beat me up (she got behind me, pulled my hair and hit my face with a closed fist multiple times) just last year for getting an attitude with her. I started sneaking out to see my friends and she threatened to take my phone. She also accuses me of everything I didn’t do. My brother drank some of our grandmas wine. She goes to me and yells at me for it because he said he didn’t do it. (He later admitted to it) 
I just don’t find her trustworthy as she’s known for lying a lot. Especially about my dad not being involved in the first months of my life. He’s openly protested about her saying that and she’d quickly change the subject. Due to this, I am very skeptical about what she says. Which causes her to complain about me being combative and challenging her. 
Back to my friends situation, I lost all of my friends by blocking them and quitting the job I shared with them. I regret it but I ALWAYS do it. 
I’m very possessive over people and I obsess a lot. Currently I can’t stop crying because we left my brothers house and his friends were there. I enjoy time around them and leaving causes me so much distress and I have no idea why.

49,"I (32m) have a disability - Cerebral Palsy - and live with my father (80) and mother (72) in a house I own but which they helped me pay for. They live upstairs and I live downstairs.

My parents are retired and on a pension but they also have life savings of $300k which they are planning to leave to me when they die so that I have enough to live on in a worst-case scenario.

Due to my disability I’m currently unable to work and rely on government assistance, but this is not something I’m proud of and I’m hoping it will change soon.

Here’s the problem. Not only do I feel stifled living with my parents in my 30s, but my father, while not abusive per se, has anger issues and has spent his life making everyone around him miserable. He often writes rude letters in my name for example. But he’s not the kind of person who cares how others feel about him. I’ve told my mother she has my blessing to divorce him but she doesn’t want to do so at her time of life.

I’m grateful for everything my parents have done for me but I feel trapped. I can’t ask them to move out because a) it would hurt them after they’ve spent 32 years of their lives being there for me; and b) if they bought a place of their own it would use up all their savings and I’d have no inheritance to fall back on if I still couldn’t work. And *I* can’t move out because a) it’s my house; and b) I can’t just go flatting anywhere, I need special access and facilities etc.

52,"Hi guys! This is my first post ever and I've been feeling a little down lately : (

So let's start w/ some background info. Im a 17 yrs old fob who came from Hong Kong. I immigrated to the U.S in 8th grade. I have a good amount of friends at high school. Some of them I only talk to in class and there are 6 ppl that im closest w/. I get along w/ these people at school pretty well and we eat lunch together. Other than seeing them at school, we also have a messenger group chat where we'll share memes and talk abt random things almost everyday. Before quarantine, I had gone out w/ these ppl many times like going to the mall, volunteering at Petsmart, eating dinner, and playing video games at a friend's house. But at the beginning of this year, I noticed something has changed. They started to hangout w/o me (I think last time they went bowling) and I found out that when they talked abt it in front of me during lunch. I sometimes questioned myself what I did wrong but I just couldn't figure it out. I treat them very nicely and for sure I know none of them hates me or anything. In this friends group, Ardee and I are they only ones who can drive ane I've given these ppl so many free rides b4 cuz I consider them as friends. Few days ago, Ardee baked some cookies and delivered them to everyone's house but me. I wasn't mad cuz I knew that i live kinda far from them (they live in the same city) and that it would be a waste of gas for him to drive to my house. Yesterday was the big day - graduation, a day that's supposed to be memorable and fun, however, it was completely ruined because they didn't invite me to take pictures with them. I asked in the group chat if they wanted to meet up and take grad photos and they just ignored my question as if they had not yet taken it and talked about smth else. Afterward I went on ig and saw one of them posted their grad photos w/ everyone tagged except me, and I was in my room left out and sad, almost to the point of committing suicide. I didn't really care that they didn't invite me to go bowling nor deliver cookies to my house. But this time it hurts like hell. I've been waiting for years for this day to come. It's not like I need someone to pick me up to take the photos. They all know I have a car I can go anywhere at anytime, yet no one ever invited me. Grad photo means a lot to me and my heart is completely broken with this surprise, in addition to graduation being cancelled.

75,"This doesn't seem like much, and it's only been a week. I left Facebook and a social media website called Ask.fm. I feel a good bit happier and more productive and more importantly I don't feel this constant nagging urge to check my phone. While the feeling of increased isolation is still there to some degree, I felt that with these accounts being active too. I feel over all a bit freer without seeing all the propaganda, all the ignorance, all the multi level marketing and scam advertisements. I feel less wrist pain decreasing the amount of time spent unlocking my phone and relocking it, which I did constantly to check Ask.fm notifications. I downloaded an app called Block site which actually blocks my phone from even accessing Facebook and I really love that. My phone's battery is also lasting longer. At work, the last week I really only want my phone on me for the pedometer and to have music going since I'm allowed to use headphones (within reason of course.) It already feels to some degree like my thinking might not be as black and white as it was with daily social media use, but again it's only been a week so maybe I'm just talking crazy or making up potential benefits. But either way, I feel really good. I don't feel as much of a need to dress up just for a camera to post a new selfie. I don't feel like there's this obligation to impress, and I feel like that's actually improving my performance because instead of focusing on what I can do that's awesome to tell the internet, which actually distracts from tasks, I can just....do the tasks and feel confident and undistracted doing them.

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",30May2020,1

86,"Hi, I'm on mobile so I dont know if the format is the same? Anyway...

So I'm an artist, I've been studying art for a while but only recently started building up my 'brand' and business. 
Last night I got an offer from an American magazine (I'm from Britain) to purchase one of my paintings as artwork for a t-shirt. 

The magazine seems legit, me and my sister have looked into it and I've found other artists that have participated with the magazine. But I'm unsure what to do? Its an amazing and unexpected opportunity, but do I sell the art once or do I get paid on commission/royalties? 
Do I ask to participate as much as possible in the process??

And I know these are all questions I could (probably should) ask them but I'm worried they'll find me unprofessional. If that makes sense?

I started a new job a little while ago, and met this really cool dude who I clicked with instantly.  We hung out a few days ago and it was just lovely.  I'm usually a very anxious person, but, with him, I didn't feel any more anxious than what I assume is just the normal jitters that come with spending alone time with a crush.  Last night, he explained that he does, as I suspected, have feelings for me; I haven't really been able to stop smiling, since.

90,"I had to have a hysterectomy due to a reoccurring infection. They figured since I have seen blood every day since my period started it would be better to remove the problem. Prior They did not see anything pointing to endo or fibroids . I was also experiencing sharp stabbing pains on my appendix which resulted in many ER visits only to be told nothing was wrong.

I had my surgery Thursday. Friday came when I was coherent and they told me they had wonderful news. On the back of my uterus I had a hidden dime sized Fibroid that somehow escaped 9 doctors and multiple exams and connected to that Fibroid was part of my appendix. I was confused because the appendix was on one side. She then showed me their pictures and pointed at something and said that was my appendix.

So now i can stretch that side and have 0 pain.  The incisions are still sore but they will heal. I am just so happy i have answers. Happy that it wasnt in my head.",30May2020,1

A little background, I am in my early 30s, happily married with kids, live by the beach and all in all have a very good life. However I HATE my job but can’t see myself ever being able to break free. 
I started working for a certain coffee company 15 years ago while I was in college. My boss at the time advised me to drop out and take a promotion. He told me companies want experience more than any degree so I took his advise and dropped out. Now 15 years later here I am, still managing a coffee shop. I’ve applied for other jobs and even other positions in the company but the one thing that remains the same is “oh we want someone with a degree”. So much for experience trumps all. 
At this point in my life going back to school is just out of the question. My wife and I both work full time and even if I found time I have no idea what I would do. Just under half of my life (my whole professional life) has been spent slinging lattes. I have looked into getting into other career paths but nothing will ever provide me the benefits or pay that my current job provides.

I do not hear enough people talking about the neighborhood and community that is the epicenter of destruction right now in Minneapolis. This area is easily one of the most impoverished, segregated, and low income areas in the city. It’s wildly a food desert. It’s one of the last pockets of lower income housing. The community needs the businesses that are burning. COVID already had businesses on the brink, especially community-owned businesses. The bus lines and light rail in and out of this area are shut down, making the vulnerable more vulnerable.

104,"His bedroom door was usually open during the day. I was pleasant to walk by and see him in there, at his computer (this was in the days before the internet) or putting together a circuit on a breadboard for an experiment or making a new explosive to blow up in the yard. It was an endless parade of a bright and active mind that never bored.

This morning was different, however. The door was not only shut, but shut and locked. And no industrious sounds were heard on the other side of the door. As morning turned into afternoon, the closed door seemed to hold back demons and monsters which I could feel lurking just behind it. 

I became hungry and cooked myself a hamburger at the stove. I made an extra one for my brother. Hoping that a plate of hot food would get him to open his door and behave normally.  I held the plate of food I made for him and knocked on his door, silence. But I could sense something horrible. Horrible beyond all imagining.  So horrible I put it out of my mind. I ate my hamburger. Then I ate the hamburger I made for him. Then I was too full and worried about getting fat. So then I went into my room and took down the special bowl I kept for vomiting in in secret and vomited out my brother's hamburger.  I guess I had mild bulimia, but that disease had no name back then in the 80s.

A couple hours later, my mom came home from work. I rushed her at the front door, ""Mark does not open his door or come out of his room all day! Something is wrong!"". She goes outside and tried to peer in his window. I hear her see him and yell his name. Now I get courage and break through his locked door inside. There he is. His twin mattress on the floor and a sandwich bag filled with clear liquid hooked with electronics wire around his mouth using his ears as holders. He was dead. There was dark stains of blood pooled in the parts of his body which were lowest. A dark chemistry bottle was nearby labelled  CHCl₃ , trichloromethane, otherwise known as  Chloroform . His electronic typewriter, a recent invention, held a note for us. 

""Dear friends and family, Be assured that my demise is not the result of any action or inaction of yours, but simply that the cost of living in a welfare industrial state is simply too high, at least for me. Goodbye, Good luck, Pet the cats.""

My mother screamed and called 911. ""My son.......I think he is dead......MY SON..."" A year later that 911 operator would send us a card because she remember that call and wondered about how we were and wanted us to know she cared.

&amp;#x200B;

The fire department came first and cleared us out of the house because of the chemical. Eventually we would be told he died about 6:30 am from  the  Chloroform  and that his death may have been painless. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our little family, now 25% smaller in number, but 50% smaller in spirit, was so shocked by all this. Paralysed into inaction. Weeks later, for no reason I could think of, my room started filling up with flies. The ceiling, then walls, blackened with flies. I finally cared enough to investigate and opened my closet. It was filled with millions of small flies all feeding off the rotten bowl of hamburger vomit I'd left in there on the day my brother died. I put the whole thing into a black plastic bag and outside into the garbage. 

Now, 32 years later, the impact of that day still rocks my family, my community. But we have each learned how to carry the burden of our guilt. The heavy weight of our regret, of how we let him down and failed to help him, is something we each just pick up everyday and carry it with us throughout our lives. We have grown so strong that we can pick it up easily. But it is always there with us. We can look at each other and see that each of us is bend over and twisted with the weight of it, but we are also grateful to have known his and bright insistent curious mind.",30May2020,1

If you've ever been on r/self or r/relationshipadvice you've definetly see this one. It's what people do when they don't have enough information. As soon as they smell a tiny bit of toxicity they'll tell you that the relationship is done for.

I am certain they do it with best intentions, but it can still seriously harm the receiver.


""Don't think about what other think/say""

Seems like genuinly good advice, but it's really bad actually. The better alternative would be to find out what they really think or why they say what they say. We are a social species, we can't live without each other.

""Ask someone for help""

It sure does seem like good advice, but too often people overlook what the consequences could be. For most mental problems telling someone is a great way for getting better, so this one's definetly on the better side.

""It's not your fault""

Thats nice, and somewhat dangerous. Telling someone that they aren't responsible for the situation they in might be comforting, but it won't help the problem.

""Suicide is for the weak""

I'm not quite sure there are good intentions behind this one. I've read this one wayyy too often and it drives me insane.



I'm not saying that these phrases should be banned, but make sure they aren't the first thing you respond with. Try getting more informationbefore you offer advice

Yet he always calls me a brainwashed sheep and a fan of “mainstream” science because I don’t believe in the illuminati or any sort of movement that has control over everything.


I something struggle to empathize and see the bigger picture I guess due to my autism and it’s making me emotional and depressed that I get called intellectually lazy and brainwashed for mymopinion on which I’ve worked for years. Here are my key beliefs:


- Humanity is corrupts. There’s corruption at every level in small pockets. I urge my partner to imagine a world in which this is the case rather than “old families” holding power, as imo the world would look exactly as it does today when one assumes my POV.



- When a millionaire dies his children fight each other over the inheritance money. Greed corrupts. There is no four hundred year collaboration between families because those that are that focussed on wealth, will stab each other in the back over it. Consider also politicians who deny global warming: they can only see as far as their next paycheck and they don’t give a shit about their grandchildren.



- I never really got an education and as such I don’t know a lot about science. I do know however that diseases are common and even expected when your population counts over 7 billion people. Computer engineers cannot create biological weapons in the form of viruses just because they’re able to create computer viruses, it’s a different branch of science.


- I like reading about logical fallacies but every time I try to explain errors in people’s reasoning I get interrupted and into arguments. Please let me know how I can be less condescending yet informative.


I’m real unhappy and miserable atm cause it feels like I’m treated as an “other,” one who doesn’t care about “the people” by my loved ones.

I'm almost 30 and I still can't get over my deep fear of being around anybody high on drugs and I'm scared that it will forever be the main reason why I won't be fully open to the friends I currently have

I have a panic attack whenever somebody brings up drug use when I least expect it, especially when it comes from a friend

I am scared of people who can suddenly change or snap and hurt me and I never, ever, ever feel safe whenever one of my friends is high on weed, and I've been told that that's not even an intense drug or whatever

Whenever my friends are high it makes me feel like I'm in a waking nightmare with nobody to talk to and anyone can say whatever they want without remorse and do anything to me or leave me behind

I don't know when this all started. I get easily disillusioned when someone I respect opens up about recreational drugs. I don't get why, and maybe it's about damn time I go see a therapist because it's starting to affect my relationships not just with friends but with my SO who is open to weed and ecstasy and whatever and I need to learn how to overcome this because I know he's frustrated about me having panic attacks over this

Whenever my friends are stoned I feel like they're not being their real selves and it bums me out 'cause I feel like they're like that all the time now and I can't have real conversations with anybody anymore

You've been mad before; you've tried to talk to the Higher Authority. The ones who might have stopped these abusive fathers. You were measured, reasonable. You even got on your knees, begging for help, for change. But they didn't listen. Not in any way you can tell. Was it because you were too quiet? Was it because they are abusers too? It's unfair! This is an unjust world! You clench your fists. You tremble with your rage and grief. Then you decide. You have to make your own justice.

But how? What can you possibly do? Maybe if you're louder, the Higher Authority might listen this time. They probably didn't take you seriously before because you were too quiet, you conclude. You want your voice heard. You want your rage felt. You want to beat your father just like he beat your mother. But you can't. Your father is too strong. He's stronger than you, and he has friends in the Higher Authority. And most importantly, he's not here.

You are so ANGRY. You look around your house as tears stream down your face. Your father has taught you well as a child. He has shown you that violence is the only answer. Might makes right. You will show him how mighty you are. You will show them all.

You see where your mother's corpse lies in the kitchen. You grab a plate, and you shatter it. If your dad won't face you, you'll destroy his house. It's what he deserves. You fling open the cabinets, and smash every dish you see. You kick over the table. You tear off a leg. You smash the pantry, the liquor cabinet, the stove. The air fills with the smell of eggs as the gas pipe hisses. You open a drawer, and grab the box of matches. You move to the front door, a match pressed to the edge of the box. Then you hear a whimper.

Your younger sister flinches when you look at her. She huddles pitifully in a corner, covered in shards of glass. Her eyes widen as she sees the matches in your hand. It's dark; you've smashed the lights so you can't see her clearly. Are those are cuts on her arms? Are those bruises, too? Did your dad beat her? You can't see, you can't tell. But you don't care. Your other sister had fled the house earlier, and said, [""Let it burn.""](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/29/let-my-building-burn-gandhi-mahal-restaurant-owner-calls-for-justice-for-george-floyd/) Anything you need to do to get justice for your mother. This is your justice. 

The sister's lips move, but you can't hear her words over the pounding pulse in your ears. It was probably words of support. The older sister said it, so the younger must have as well. [You strike the match without asking her.](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/30/how-to-give-back-to-your-besieged-community/) The fire catches, and the house burns. You spare a thought for your younger sister as you stand across the street and watch the inferno. She must have fled to safety, you conclude. This is justice. And, you think, even if she was burned, it was worth it. Now your father knows just how angry you are.

Thanks for taking action and protesting. If you don't voice your concerns, be sure USA will slowly become corrupt dictator country  and that's exactly what politicians secretly want. People themselves are source of government, not politicians. People mean everyone - every one person. Not only politicians, big companies, and CEOs who has salary of 10 million dollars but refuse to pay above  minimum federal wage salary to their workers that they themselves built their empire on their backs of, but also every one, every person. Politicians and CEOs succeed because of us. They are depend on us, not we are depend on them.

They want to make us feel worthless and let them and their fake ads control us, turn us into consumers to make us more dependent on them so they can do whatever they want

But you people - you showed them that they can't be defeated

136,"It looks as though Reddit's Social Justice Warrior cunts are intent on suspending every account I can make.  This is actually a very old alt that was banned years ago, that somehow came back to life, but whatever.  It doesn't matter.    
      
Dear Reddit Admins,     
     
Reddit has changed; I have not.  You will never change someone's thinking about something, nor will you ever change the facts on a particular subject, by censoring and suppressing speech that you don't like.  The only reason this place has become a SJW shithole is because you've banned anything to the contrary.      
     
There is no penalty for screaming ""FUCKING RACIST"" at anything that might offend the snowflakiest of redditors.  There is never any thinking beyond the charge.  But here's the thing.  **SMART LIVES MATTER**, and **USEFUL LIVES MATTER.**  That's the reality.  Black/White/Purple lives don't matter at all in and of themselves.  (Something about content of character and not the color...nevermind.  That would take thinking)    I am an Obama liberal through and through, but honestly, most black people embody the worst negative stereotypes, and acknowledging that is no crime.  Living in denial about it, or pretending it's not true is no better than what religious nuts do with their invisible gods.  If something is true, but it's not currently politically correct, that speaks to a lack of integrity in you.     
     
Trump, long with most other Republicans deserve to go up against the wall for treason.  It should end the way Mussolini ended in Italy.  I fear that the military will have to get involved with removing Fat Joffrey, and the people who continue to support this wannabe dictator will descend into cultish terrorism.  The country will die, and anyone who might have a solution is censored.  Posting that which seems to be the inevitable ending of the Trump Regime is not posting ""threats,"" you fucking asshole politics mods.  It's a reality based, *history* based analysis.    
     
Let's see, what else.   There are 2 genders, and you are mentally ill to say otherwise.  Personally, I don't care about LGBT at all.  They can be ignored and shunned.  The problem comes when Republican strategists use the issue to label the Democrats as ""tranny lovers,"" which suppresses turnout at election time in the key purple states that are must win.  Point this fact out, and you get banned. (But the fact remains, leaving it as a weapon for the GOP)    
     
There's much more, but this will likely get deleted by the same shitty admins that have ruined this site where I have participated for about 7 years.  Over 1.3 million in karma on my main account, and was a respected mod that built a particular sub from the basement to the top 1000.  Gilded dozens of times (but I never spent real money on gilding, heh heh)      
     
But all that is just swept away by some self imposed SJW piece of ignorant, lying-to-themselves shit, because they got triggered by something I posted.

138,"There is evil out and about and it is spread to every continent on this planet and it is seemingly inescapable. Murder, death, hate, misfortune, every day and every night. It has infected mankind with true evil. It’s hectic out there, outside of your house and maybe even inside. Whether it’s illness or human hatred, it feels you are always in danger. It’s unfortunately the norm in these modern times.

But don’t let it consume you. It may not look like it, but in the pain there will eventually be healing. In the bleak overcast there will be happiness. I feel hypocritical saying this because at times I feel hopelessness and apathy. Depression doesn’t help my matters. But I can be strong and you can be too. Things will get better in the end. And if any asshole wants to tell you otherwise, don’t listen. Block him out. You don’t need that constant negative shit in your life. Fuck hate. Be safe, take care of yourself, and live free.

I love  college, so much, I came from being bullied and having social anxiety disorder in a ""town"" with less than 2000 people, to blossoming in college in the city, making friends for the first time in years and falling in love with my amazing boyfriend. 

I hate my rural hometown, I love my family but I have no social life here. Last summer was ok as I had a job and saw my boyfriend once or twice a week. I was so sad that I had to rush home in mid-March from college cos of Covid. The place I worked shut down last fall so I was looking for a job for the summer in my hometown right before lockdown. Things like cafe's, hotels and restaurants won't be opening here till late July and with limited numbers of customers and staff, so there will be no job openings for me. My college is probably gonna be teaching online next fall, so I will be stuck in my hometown again, with no job or friends. I was supposed to be studying in Germany in spring/summer 2021, but the university are unsure if they will be do online lectures and they informed me I would be expected to stay there for TWENTY-ONE weeks when initally it was TWELVE and now I don't know if I wanna even go anymore, I will miss my bf too much and it'll be so expensive. Even if I dont go to Germany in 2021, I will not have any lectures in my home university for the first half of 2021, so AGAIN I will be stuck in my hometown as I have no reason to stay in the city.

4.  Enjoy.  Not hitting, kicking, punching.

That was years ago, and we still will pick up a game of spoon tag (yes even us adults play) when ever there seems like a dull point at a party/gathering.

However, today I received a gift from an online friend. Or I should say, a friend that we simply talk to everyday online since he lives in another state. He knows I've been going through tough times and has probably heard me complain one too many times.

I'm a PC gamer and it sucks to know that I can't upgrade my main source of entertainment for quite some time due to unemployment and lack of funds.

153,"At the age of 16 I entered a relationship with a year younger girl met on the Internet. In my eyes the relationship was really nice and we were really lovey-dovey until it gone to shit after about half a year. I ended up dumping her being frustrated with how she would give me little attention and to some extent even avoid me. Took me over two years to realize that I was the one at fault, actively forcing her to do more and more sexual shit. It may not have been any physical aggression but I am 100% sure she ended up fearing me and simply wanting me to disappear from her life. Before my realization I actually had another short relationship that looked very similar, but the girl was way more brave and ended it herself. That's basically how I realised my mistakes.

I had undergone psychological therapy that was unrelated to the topic but indirectly let me understand more about myself and my mistakes, likely keeping me from any extreme measures such as suicide. I learned how terribly I deal with losing and straight up not getting what I want. Too bad I easily get excited and fall in love.

On one party I'd been to with my second girlfriend I met this one girl. She seemed so perfect in my eyes. Naturally after being dumped it didn't take long for me to try and get that girl's attention (I'll call her Lily for future referencing). Me and Lily shared tons of interests and so I even ended up introducing her to my group of friends who she easily assimilated with. I tried my hardest to form a relationship, got turned down. I really didn't take it well, I eventually grew up to hate her in a way. One of my friends saw my grief and wanted to 'fix' me. He took me to his friends bday party saying there would be tons of cool girls to distract me. 

I got on pretty well with one girl from the party, we fooled around a bit. Eventually we entered a relationship. It was going slow and steady. I honestly thought it could be something. Over time however I'd begun to realise how badly I defiled my very own morals. I realised that even though the new girl was meant to be the cure for Lily, she only made me think that I can't stop loving Lily. Basically, I went for two girls in my mind and it made me hate every bit of me. I dumped the new girl, I am pretty sure she ended up hating me as she blocked me on various social media (even some of her friends did that). 

All in all I really feel devastated and I do realise that these words seem pathetic coming from a 19yo. Despite that I felt a high need for sharing that story and confessing my sins of sexual assault and straight up indecency. Go rough on me, I don't care.",30May2020,1
