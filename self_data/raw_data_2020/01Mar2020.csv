0,Not much to say. I keep on trying to stop but I can’t. I can’t even masturbate without porn. I’m not a quitter but there isn’t anything else I can do. Well at least I’m addicted to porn and not cocaine or something.,01Mar2020,1
1,"""Your pussy looks delicious and I'm starving"" reads that little blue text bubble. My body jolts with excitement and a high-pitched *AHH* leaves my body without warning. Carissa's exchange with our smoking hot kickboxing instructor sounds more like erotic fiction than reality, the one-on-one training sessions Joe has set up this week oozing with so much sexual energy it would make an entire Atlanta strip joint blush. I reply with an army of all caps proclamations of excitement and stunned disbelief. ""THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE,"" my final soldier, storming the field of this gushing exchange. I wait for a response; my mind takes an unexpected tilt. Me and you ended your borderline euphoric visit with the decision to be exclusive. I wonder, does this mark the end of excitement for me?

The memory of Marcelo falls onto the forefront of my mind like the winds of longing blew it all the way there, just to spite me. Marcelo, the Brazilian man who I matched with on Tinder and proceeded to meet for the first time on the nude beach during my vacation in San Diego. Marcelo, the bronzed, bulking man that closer resembled a statue of a Greek god than his actual pictures. Marcelo, the man who joined his shadow with mine onto the white wall of his all white room, moving together next to the window of an electric blue sky, a burst of color after sunset almost radioactive.

I remind myself of when Marcelo said he wanted to make me his wife one day, yet today I doubt he could tell you my name. Even if he could, it would taste like salt water, deceivingly refreshing and bitter all at once. With you, hearing my name on your lips tastes of something almost too sweet, but not--something so warm it make you warm all over. Like water in the desert, I need it desperately.

The taste of empanadas fills my memory. Ah, yes, the empanada stand. The playground of inexplicable possibility, between two of the most elusive speakeasies on Hollywood Boulevard--the empanada stand, Christian's empanada stand. The empanada stand I spent nearly every weekend of my 4 month stint in LA. At first it was to spend more time with him, my coke dealer and my lover. The blow pulsed like an ecstatic current, highlighting the excitement of chance encounters, the dank breeze of the best kind of trouble sweeping the neon lit streets with the fury of Santa Ana winds, the never ending nights together fucking until it was time for another line. I think of Christian, the man who showed me how to do coke off an erect penis. Christian, the 38-year-old that looked much more like a spry 25 and made you laugh like one too. Christian, the sweet man with two pitbulls so perfect I love them still, the man who favored my character and friendship enough that he didn't bat an eye at letting me *just* help sell empanadas for free blow when I started seeing the Turkish fighter and security guard I met at an after hours club.

Turkish Matt, the man I met red-faced from embarrassment. I told Alvaro (the man I almost married for his green card that I met through my professor), that I thought he was attractive. Alvaro turned to him immediately, speedily working his way to him, against my nervous protests. I pretended I was busy dancing by the time Alvaro made it to him, looking anywhere but over there. Turkish Matt, the man who wasted no time trying to get to know me, on or off the clock. Turkish Matt, with the hard, resolute exterior and astonishing softness for me, the man who only wanted me to say one thing as dirty talk--*I love you*. Turkish Matt, who loved sharing a bottle of wine in a bubble bath fit for one, our bodies entangled with one another. Turkish Matt, who so desperately hated when I left before he woke up that one drunken night fumbled to handcuff me to him before we passed out.

You don't need to handcuff me to you, I am bound to you by our connection, something much more tangible to me than the fleeting memories of those who came before you (pun definitely intended). As I replay the moments of excitement that I've always worn with such pride, the moments I've held so close to affirm my belief that life is meant to be lived, I realize that this new chapter does not banish me to a life devoid of excitement. This new chapter, our chapter, is riddled with *three-dimensional* excitement. Not the flat, jolt of excitement that can be summarized by a couple of lines or text bubbles, but rather the dense, all-encompassing excitement that has no end--a bottomless pit of conflicts, both internal and external, ever-changing character development, climaxes of the highest degree, rolling plot points that will constantly challenge us as well as strengthen us.

""I DIED IN THAT MOMENT,"" she finally replies. Although my excitement for her pours out of me like a bursting fire hydrant, my excitement for us, for this, ignites my soul with a severity completely foreign to me. Cheers to something new.",01Mar2020,1

3,"Hi, I have been worried sick lately about a mistake I made 2 years ago.

Backstory:

Early in college I got way too drunk and couldn't find my way home. I was found sleeping on a bench by another student. Thank god he/she found me because I wasn't wearing a jacket. This was in November. He called an ambulance, my blood alcohol content was way too high. Usually I don't drink but some buddies kept hounding me to go out. I checked the historical weather calendar for the city and it was 42 degrees F, with 12 mph wind speeds at the time I was on the bench. I estimate being found around 20 minutes after sitting on the bench which is about a 10 minute walk from the bar.

Question: How close was I to getting frostbite? According to this graph/article [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5281587/Chart-reveals-long-takes-frostbite-occur.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5281587/Chart-reveals-long-takes-frostbite-occur.html)

it takes 3 hours for someone to get frostbite at 10 degrees F with 50 mph winds. So if I was in 40 degree weather would I have like a 0 percent chance of getting frostbite? In other words is it silly for me to worry that I could of gotten frostbite while being in that weather? Is me worrying about this the same as a athlete worrying about developing diabetes? (not sure if thats the best analogy, but I tend to over worry and want to try and get it in perspective) According to google, people can get frostbite at temperatures up to 42 degrees F. I am not sure how long it takes though.

I did not wake up with any signs of frostbite, the nurses told me my BAC and had me have someone sign me out of the hospital. I knew a guy who got frostbite just being outside completely sober. I am not sure what the full story was, but he showed me pictures of his fingers all blistered.

If he isn't worrying about that situation then why am I lol?

Sidenote:

The whole situation was really unsettling and I did not think about it until a couple years later. A couple buddies begged me to go to the bar and I usually never drink. I was on a medication that made me not feel alcohol as much and ended up getting wasted and could not find my way home. I do not like to be out of control. Being so inhibited that I could not find my way home in cold weather is super dangerous. It was totally my fault and a learning experience.

Thank you for any insight doctors! Any help is appreciated more than you know.

TLDR: Was passed out in 42 degree F weather in the middle of the night with 12 mph or so winds, how long would it take for me to get frostbite? Also should I even be worried that I could of potentially gotten it being that the temperature wasn't horribly cold?",01Mar2020,1
5,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

11,"I was sleeping over at my boyfriend’s place last night because the roads were too bad to go home. Some time in the middle of the night, I woke up and was anxious for seemingly no reason. I rolled over in bed to face him, and he pulled me against his chest so my head fit under his chin and my forehead was against the side of his neck (yes he’s taller than me obviously). I didn’t say anything but assumed he was awake to do something like that. It really helped me feel safe and more calm, and I was able to fall back asleep. 

I brought it up to him this morning, and he genuinely had no idea he did that. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but I like to think he was aware of me even in his sleep. It made my heart melt, that’s for sure! He’s so sweet and I’m so lucky to have him in my life!",01Mar2020,1
12,"TLDR: Give me a reason why I really need to move out of my city despite meeting some really cool people at the last minute.

Last year, I was in a rut. I was graduating with no job prospects, I couldn't afford the city, and I had lost one of my closest friends for damn near no reason at all. When my landlord proposed a rent increase, me and my sister (my roommate) literally considered moving to New Jersey to make ends meet. In NYC, we're already living way below market price and it's still too expensive. Luckily, my landlord lacked enough initiative to actually draw up a new lease so we're now on a month-to-month. But in the midst of my emotional/financial crisis I realized a couple of things:

a) New Jersey, including Jersey City, will never be a desirable location for me. In spite of the cheap rent, it hardly emulates a true metropolitan area in the creative sense, and for me, commuting just doesn't seem worth it.

b) I've been to many cities before, but by far NYC exudes the largest attitude of relationship disposability-- the idea that people aren't worth staying in touch besides short transactions or networking. Romantic or not, there's plenty of fish in the city.

c) I hate gentrification. I can't even look around my neighborhood without feeling incredibly discontent and anxious. I also simply can't afford to live here.

d) While most major metropolitan areas are gentrifying, few are doing so at the rate of New York.

e) I want to live alone. My sister and I don't even remotely share the same cleaning habits and I hardly sleep at night because she likes loud music and watching anime into the AM. I've lived with 2 other roommates before and my passive natured has forced me into being a silent sufferer. Even if I do confront issues, they're never resolved and an argument or unspoken grudge presents itself.

f) Living so close to my family members makes it really hard to be who I am and express myself accordingly. Whether or not they're with me in the moment, I feel immense pressure knowing that they're not that far away.

All these points led me to Philadelphia. Close to New York City both in culture and physical proximity, but far cheaper. I've researched Philly for the past year, visited, and I'm determined to move there. Regardless of my failing job search, I began searching specifically for remote jobs so finding a new job after moving wouldn't be an obstacle. As an English major, copywriting would provide the stability I needed in the moment.

Well, I finally got the job. My paycheck has increased dramatically, and I'm working from home. I decided to moved to Philly May 1 because I'm afraid if I wait any longer my anxiety will debilitate me.

But in the past few months I've met or strengthened relationships with some awesome people. For example, when I told my coworkers I was quitting, we organized monthly brunches as a group to keep in contact. And on an individual basis, I meet up with one or two of the group every other week to just chill and hangout. At least two of them have the potential in my mind to be really compatible, long-term friends. We really love and respect each other, and share the values I appreciate in a friend.

Then on the other side of things, I met about three people whom I have romantic/sexual relationships with. Usually this doesn't matter much to me because I don't take romance as seriously as most people do. Except these people I have put in a lot of effort into getting to know me and I feel like our relationships with one another could be long-lasting and meaningful. I don't get easily attached and I'm not, but I can always tell whether a new partner will ghost in a month (which happens quite often to me in NYC) or will be one of the greater experiences in my lifetime.

The problem is I need to move. I'm not usually the one to blame my mental wellbeing on an arbitrary place or locale. But even if it weren't for the general feeling of suckiness this feeling started, there are concrete characteristics of this city that are pushing me away. Even if I made a salary where I wouldn't have to worry about money and savings so much, I would feel like a traitor of sorts living in a city where a certain standard of living that is pervasively inaccessible is normalized. My local grocery store is a ""organic market"" and my food stamps for the month cover only some eggs, milk, and sandwich ingredients.

Maybe someone can offer a motivational quote or two that reinforced the notion that I need to get the heck out of here no matter what. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",01Mar2020,1
13,"Been going to the gym for a few months now, when I noticed a girl I thought was cute working out next to me. Asked her about the exercise she was doing and she told me about then walked off. Tonight I saw her in there, made some stupid joke to her, but she ignored it, and I figured it was because her music was loud (I've had guys there come up to me to ask things, and it usually takes them tapping me on the shoulder to get my attention through my headphones). On top of that noticed that she looked really young, and wondered if I had been crushing on a high school girl this whole time. I was leaving the gym when an employee stopped me, and asked to talk to me in private. I went in with him, and he said that a girl had claimed that I was sexually harassing her, and that he wanted to get the full story. He told me I wasn't in trouble, and basically told me that he just wanted to make sure that nobody was getting assaulted, and that he wanted to be extra careful, as the girl in question was underage. I tried to stay collected, but apparently I wasn't doing it, as he asked me several times if I was doing okay. He seemed genuinely not angry or anything, but this has me really fucked up right now. I don't know who I can talk to about this, or if I want to talk about this, but I'm just embarrassed, and I feel like shit. I don't know how to end this, I guess I just needed to let this out.",01Mar2020,1
14,"I've always been a humongous airhead, even when I was a kid, so getting distracted and day dreaming are a part of my daily life since, well, forever. But as I got older, I started feeling like there was something I needed to find. Like a part of me, or my life, that was missing. I look for it in unfamiliar faces, news articles, entertainment, etc. Maybe it's passion, maybe it's meaning, but it's something that's always present. Every day, it's there, at the back of my head, creating this confusion and curiosity. It almost feels like I forgot something essential about my past, or myself. Do any of you relate, and how do you live with it?",01Mar2020,1
15,"   Everyone needs someone to rely on in their life. Someone who lifts them up when they are down. Someone who treats them like they are deserve to be treated. Someone who laughs at their jokes even when the joke isn’t even funny. My little brother just turned 10 and he is really short so he gets made fun of a lot at school and also their are 5 of us children in the house and I’m the second oldest and he is the 4th. ( the oldest one is 19 so while she still lives here she is starting her career and has a boyfriend so she isn’t here a lot so I would say that I usually hold the most power in this house out of all us children).


   Also though combined with my little brother not being that popular he also gets treated unfairly in this house and I don’t appreciate that. During Christmas he gets the least amount of stuff. Stuff he didn’t even ask for too. Dinner suggestions? Nope nothing he ever says gets taken into consideration. (That’s why I ask him before hand what he wants so I can agree with him since my vote holds the most power anyway). Any ruckus happen in the house? He is the one who gets blamed. Even though it’s usually never him who should be the one to be blamed. And no one ever sees this. Their go to response is that he is just annoying. No he is just trying to get your attention because he feels ignored. 

  I already see signs of depression in him and maybe I’m wrong about that but I rather be wrong then to just ignore it. He gets really down after getting in trouble for things he didn’t do multiple times in a row every day. And when he actually does do a little thing usually on accident it’s a lecture, time out, and toys taken away. Other kids? Hardly nothing happens to them. And unlike the other kids his good behavior isn’t acknowledged or rewarded. 


   It’s fucked up! And no one else can see that except me and him. So I have always taken it into my own hands to treat him like the great kid that he is. I have my own money from baby sitting so I take him everywhere with me. We go to the store and buy candy together then come back and watch a movie. Everything that is mine I let him use whenever he wants. Because I know that no matter how many times he ask for that item as a birthday or Christmas present he will never get it. I take him out with my friends and I and they love him and some haven’t but I don’t care. We go to the mall together and I buy him things. 

   When he gets yelled at and put in time out I reassure him that someone sees that he did nothing wrong. That I know which kid did it and that mom just won’t listen. I have tried to tell my mom before but she just doesn’t listen and insist on the fact that he is the trouble maker. Because all the other kids blame him. 

  I don’t want him to ever feel like I have been made to feel. Worthless like a piece of garbage. A fuck up or like he is always messing everything up when that isn’t true. I know he already feels like crap but I try my best to make sure he has someone to anchor him down to this world. Maybe my mom is just busy but it’s still doesn’t make it ok. The kid doesn’t have any friends at school or in this neighborhood (he has one friend who doesn’t live in the neighborhood though so that’s good) and his family are assholes to him. He just needs kindness and for someone to not kick him when he is already down. 


  Please check in on your siblings and make sure they are ok and if they aren’t then help them out. Because this world is already crappy enough. Show them some kindness.",01Mar2020,1

27," Two years ago, my husband and I decided to join the Big Brother Big Sister Organization as a Big Couple. For those who don't know, this organization pairs adults to mentor and be like a big sibling to a child who faces adversity. Once we were approved to be Bigs, we sat down in a room with three files--one dedicated to a little boy wanting a mentor and a friend.

My first choice was always Andy. He had been put into the program when he was five years old by his mom, but had been waiting for three years to be matched with a Big Brother. We could see how many times Andy had been passed up by other potential Bigs. Three people turned his file down over those three years. He was the perfect choice, in my opinion, for me and my husband. He was eight years old, the age I was best at handling. He talked about in his file wanting a hero for a Big Brother. My husband is, well... was, an Airman. I told my husband we had to choose Andy so he could be the hero he was looking for.

And so Andy became our Little Brother that day. Our very first visit with him, we pulled up into his driveway and saw him peeking through the curtains at us. When we entered his house, he was so shy and quiet, but he couldn't stop staring and smiling at my husband. Our match specialist--the one who coordinates the matches between Bigs and Littles--began explaining that we were a Big Couple, so Andy would have a Big Brother as well as a Big Sister. His whole family was surprised as they didn't realize that was a possibility.

Once we were alone with him, he talked and talked. He kept saying he was so happy to have a Big Brother that he had waited for so long for one. Throughout our time together, he'd always casually bring up how he only wanted a Big Brother, but now that he has both a Big Brother and a Big Sister, he was really happy. At the end of our very first outing he asked if he would see us the next day, but we said he'd only see us about once or twice a week. He didn't like that at first, but we got into a groove and he came to expect and look forward to our regular hangouts. The first thing he said to us on our second visit was, ""I really missed you guys.""

He grew attached to us so fast. We'd play a lot of video games like Fornite and Minecraft. We made a volcano and made slime. Went to a drive in movie theater. We did all sorts of things together over the last two years. And he was always so happy to see us every time.

But my husband is getting out of the Air Force in May which means we are moving back to our home state. We saw Andy this afternoon and helped him with a school project. After, we let him pick somewhere to eat. He chose Subway. He *always* chooses Subway. He ordered a footlong like usual because he liked to give half to his sister. He was always thinking of her whenever we were out doing stuff. Once we were done eating, my husband and I broke the news to him.

We were moving away.

He wouldn't look us in the eyes. He started shaking his leg vigorously and I could tell he was trying not to cry. He said that he would be going on vacation in May as well so we could still hangout once we get back. It broke my heart to tell him we weren't coming back. We were staying in our home state for good. We iterated to him that we didn't want to leave him, but we wanted to be near our family again. We made sure to tell him that he is always welcome to text or call us or play games online with us even after we're gone. That we were sad too and it's okay to feel sad. He seemed eager to leave so we drove him back home. We told him to come up with a list of everything he wants to do before we leave so that we won't have any regrets. He seemed happy about that. We dropped him off at his house and said goodbye.

And now, I'm having a hard time processing how I feel. He is such a sweet kid and brightened up my day every time I saw him. When we joined the program, I was so excited about the little kid we would be helping that I didn't take the time to think about the goodbye and how hard it would be.

31,"The outer world is cold but not dark. And I walk along the shore of a pond. The water is blood red and misty. I kick a rock into the water and the water tosses it at my head.

I fall over on my side and grip my head in pain. I run to go tell someone if they can help me. They take me into a warm room. They rub the bruised area continuously which hurts but the pain goes away quickly. By the time I've healed, I'm back out in the cold.

I walk along the shore again and toss another rock into the water. The pond tosses it at my leg.

I fall, unable to move. I cry for help and someone comes. They take me away from the pond and bring me back into the warmth of their room. They press hard on my leg which hurts a lot but I only feel the warmth of the room again. Once again, the warmth stops as they put me outside.

I walk outside to the pond. I lightly drop the rock into the pond and it gently tosses it back into my hand. Where's the pain? I throw the rock into the pond once more. And it spits the rock into my crotch. I cry out once again. Someone walks up to me. As soon as I look at them, they walk away. The world gets colder. 

I see the warm room's owner carrying someone else. I chuck the rock into the pond in frustration. But the pond was only getting started with me. It bombards me with rock after rock. Eventually crushing me with a boulder. The pond asks me, ""are you done yet?""

The pain is so great, everything feels so wrong, but at any rate, the only thing I have left to say is, ""keep going!""

The pond isn't shy to continue slamming me with more rocks until I'm barely breathing. Blood drains from me as I can feel myself slowly fading away. For the last time, I cry out for the warm room.

The man comes for me, and kneels down. He doesn't say anything but I understand exactly what he means. For the first time, my eyes light up with tears. The man stands up and walks back to his house. 

And the only thing I can do now is cry. But I deserve every last second of it.",01Mar2020,1
32,"I met a girl at a bar seven or eight weeks ago. We really clicked, drank too much wine and laughed all night. We caught up for coffee a few days later. We then met up several times at her place, we cooked dinner together then watched a movie and had sex and held each other as we slept. I thought everything was going well. Recently she says she doesn't want to have a relationship. Despite the fact she kinda indicated otherwise before. Now I feel really shit about myself. Like I'm not good enough, not smart enough, not good looking enough, not nice or caring enough. I really like her. My love life has been pretty tremulous but I've never really questioned myself like this. Does anyone have any advice on how to get my self esteem back?

33,"My frustration turned into an out of body experience

I’ve been going through a lot of changes and self development recently. Although this sounds great, this has only came from great deals of pain that I used to be open about, but now internalize due to negative feedback. Naturally, this has caused me massive amounts of anger, frustration, and disappointment with the world, my choices, and the choices of those around me. 

Today, I had been the most frustrated I have been in a long time.  I just laid in bed with a small, little, warm lamp in the corner. I put on some headphones, listened to some music, and began to “fade away”. I was completely sober, but it felt like I had been under some sort of influence and began to have vivid images appear and things start to look deformed.

70,"Hey, I haven't posted anything on Reddit before but I really don't know where else to turn…

I've been sick since July 2019, undergone numerous medical examinations, including several blood tests, a cardiac ultrasound examination, an MRI of my head and cervical spine (with focus on MS), and a liquor punctuation. All of these examinations have been without any pathological findings and don't know what to do anymore as the symptoms get worse with every passing day...

## Symptoms:

* Hypoesthesia (reduced sensibility), primarily in the left half of the body, started spreading from the back left of the head.
* Impaired coordination and muscle-strength in parts of the body with hypoesthesia (paired with joint stiffness)
* Difficulty concentrating, remembering, speaking and lack of energy. Furthermore, I am experiencing slightly impaired vision (increased adjustment-time to changing levels of brightness).
* (Luckily, I am not experiencing any physical pain)

## Other Symptoms (may be unrelated):

* Increased blood pressure (≈ 150/70)
* White spots and coating on tongue (First appeared in September 2019)
* Eversince the symptoms first appeared my immune system seems to be a lot weaker than usual
* Often inflamed pharynx eversince symptoms started

# What influences the Symptoms:

* Ibuprofen 600 takes away symptoms significantly (I also tried ASS which only had a vanishingly small effect)
* Taking H2O2 helps reducing the symptoms slightly
* Applying pressure to certain points at neck (pushing back Atlas) and certain neck positions seem to influence symptoms. Furthermore, heat also used to help with reducing the symptoms. (When symptoms first occurred, physiotherapy + heat helped take away the symptoms. Also, applying pressure to certain cervical vertebrae used to move the reduced sensibility to a different area of the head)
* Symptoms are worse in the morning after waking up and get better, shortly after standing up.
* Symptoms get worse when using electronic devices (e.g. when using bluetooth headphones sensibility at the head is getting worse; regular headphones are fine)

# Timeline (You can skip this part if you don't want to read too much):

**April 2019:** One week stay in Singapore.

**June 19. - 23. (Camping, France)** Two days after returning from a camping trip in France in the woods, I noticed that a lymph node on the left hand side of my throat had started swelling. (Initially, I didn't think to connect the swollen lymph node with the camping trip)

**July 10. - 16. (One Week before symptoms started):** I had flu-like symptoms for one week, including slight fever, coughing, etc. One day after these symptoms were gone, the sensitivity impairments started (17th).

**July 17th 2019:** I was simply reading in a book when all of a sudden a small area of skin at the back of the right half of my head began 'falling asleep'. After applying pressure to some vertebrae from my cervical spine, the loss of sensibility would disappear but shortly after, come back, however now on the back of the left half of my head. Applying pressure to certain points of my cervical spine would allow me to relocate the area with reduced sensibility (always primarily on the left); however, nothing could fully take the symptoms away. After that, I got prescribed physiotherapy which, bit by bit, took away the symptoms completely. Here, especially heat therapy turned out to be extremely effective.

**Two weeks after symptoms had stopped (Exam-Phase):** After roughly two weeks, the symptoms started coming back, however, this time more smoothly. I noticed that the symptoms would primarily occur when using electronic devices. Furthermore, to my surprise, jogging seemed to aggravate the symptoms as well. Every time the symptoms came back, I would use heat and some exercises the physiotherapist had previously showed me to make the symptoms disappear again. Unfortunately, over time the exercises and the heat therapy became less and less effective in taking away the symptoms, going beyond the point where they could only reduce, though not entirely remove the symptoms.

**August 18th 2019 (Beginning internship):** During the time of the following internship, the symptoms continued to get worse. A couple of days after the internship started, I noticed reduced coordination skills in my left hand combined with a slight tremor. The tremor was strongest while trying to perform precise movements with my fingers which made things like typing more difficult for me (however, not so strong as to make typing impossible). Shortly after, I started experiencing the same type of hypoesthesia on the complete left side of my left tibia and the upper-surface of my forearm.

**September 18th 2019 (Wisdom teeth surgery):** The symptoms had continued to aggravate and now the reduced sensibility was noticeable on the entire left hemisphere of the head together with the left forearm and the left leg. On Thursday, September the 19th, I had mouth surgery to get my wisdom teeth (3) removed. As instructed by the doctor I took an antibiotic (Amoxicillin) about an hour before the surgery and one Ibuprofen 600 right after the surgery. Already while driving home from the surgery, I noticed the feeling coming back to the left frontal lobe of my head, together with a progressive recovery of my cognitive abilities. After the surgery I somehow didn't feel as tired and shiftless as usual but filled with energy. Throughout the course of the day, the motor skills in my hand, arm and leg fully recovered; the feeling went back to normal and with that the rest of the symptoms vanished as well. In the evening, before going to bed I took another Ibuprofen pill against the pain in my mouth from the surgery. The next day, the symptoms continued getting better and better. Now, I also perceived my memory getting noticeably better again and also my ability to find words when speaking had gone back to normal. The only symptoms remaining were the reduced sensory perception on the left back of my head and also the cognitive abilities hadn’t recovered all the way. This trend of improvement continued until Saturday when the recovery process slowly started stagnating. On monday I really started noticing that the symptoms were coming back (Again, especially when using my work-computer). Throughout the course of the next week all of the old symptoms came back and kept getting worse, however, much faster than before the surgery. We suspected that the alleviation of the symptoms had been caused by the antibiotic from the surgery so a couple of weeks later, we asked the doctor if they could prescribe it to me in order to see if it would have any effect ー it didn’t.

**Beginning of University, October 2019:** When I went back to university after the internship had ended, the weekend before the semester would start I took one of the Ibuprofen pills I had left from the mouth surgery in September to see if perhaps they had caused the reduction of the symptoms after the surgery ー radical improvement of the symptoms, starting approximately 15-30 minutes after intake. Again, the symptoms kept getting better throughout the next day. However, unfortunately after that the symptoms came back ー worse than before.

**End of October (Taking a break from University):** At the end of October I 'decided' to take a break from university as my symptoms prevented me from being able to study. Furthermore, some of my doctors had suggested that the symptoms may be stress related so I wanted to see if this break would actually help reducing the symptoms. Hence, until shortly before Christmas I restricted myself to doing nothing that might cause me any stress whatsoever. However, despite all my efforts (going swimming, eating healthy and taking all sorts of vitamins) the symptoms kept getting worse. At some point they also started affecting the right half of my body and other parts such as the mouth. Along the way, I started experiencing joint stiffness in my left hand. One day in early November, the symptoms all of a sudden improved significantly within only minutes, however, smoothly came back over the course of the following week. Shortly after Christmas I coincidentally noticed that I had fairly high blood pressure. (≈ 150/70)

**February 18th 2020 (Ibuprofen intake):** Until now, the symptoms have kept getting worse. As of October, I had refrained from taking more Ibuprofen as I was afraid of the symptoms getting significantly worse afterwards. Nevertheless, I decided to take one more pill to see if it would still have some effect; and it did. This time the symptoms did come back as well; however, the worsening afterwards wasn't as bad as the times before (this time I didn't use any electronics in that time).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

No one seems to know what is causing these symptoms – despite the fact that Ibuprofen has such a strong effect on the symptoms. **Should you have just the slightest idea of what might be causing the symptoms or what I could do, please respond – I'm grateful for every bit of help I can get!**

There was this sense of infallible hope for the future; followed by a slow breakdown of said hope as you progress through college and your first “real” job, various friends, significant others, etc. 

After going through this realization of sorts across my prime years, I’ve also realized that I’m far from alone in my age group; EVERYONE is going through this same existential roller coaster in their own way. It’s evident by the polarized climate on Reddit and other social media platforms that some people are having more trouble with it than others. That’s why I wanted to put this in writing.

80,"Context: I don't own a car, I'm a money pincher, I don't show my anger often.

Last night I had plans to meet up with a couple of friends to eat at this fancy sushi place. One of those places that you actually have to make a reservation to. Since I don't own a car I decided that public transport (ie. The Bus) was the next best thing. Now I knew taking the bus would take a longer time then calling a Lyft so I thought ahead; I left quite a bit earlier. Now I have to take 3 buses to get where I was going. The first bus came about 6 minutes late and then the driver stopped out of nowhere to drink water. That was the first sign that I should have seen. The second bus was about 20 minutes late, two of the same buses actually passed the stop before my bus came. At this point I was getting a little angry so I decided to blast new music. Looking on my GPS I see that I'm going to be about 18 minutes late, which shouldn't be too bad since we have to wait to sit down anyways. So I'm waiting at the bus stop for an Express bus, I know its gonna cost more but it's fine as long as I get there relatively fast. 10 minutes go by and a bus comes, #14, not my bus. Another 10, #29, not my bus. Another 10 and which bus comes? #14. At this point I'm literally screaming out ""Why, why, why, why, why. There's no traffic, I'm so close, why now?!"" If I were to walk it would take me about an hour to get there but surely I should have faith in public transportation right? I'm on the verge of angry tears which hasn't happened to me in years. I'm already 20 minutes late and my friends call to see where I'm at. I'm a person who is chill most of the time, but when something is out of my control this bad I can't handle it, I seem to lose functioning power. Another 10 goes by and I reluctantly buy a $15 Lyft. I was so angry when I got to the place I was literally shaking, every inch of my body hurt and I could barely enjoy the meal. Eventually I calmed down but this has been a learning experience.

I enjoy chillin' with him sometimes whenever we run into each other, and he can actually be fun to rap with as well, but there's one problem... the guy is a chronic cigarette bum. I mean like... he'll say hi and the very next words out of this MF's mouth is ""got another cigarette?"" He also has a tendency to continue raiding my pack while we're talking as if it's his right to keep smoking on my dime. ""Tommy"" has a real street and ghetto edge about himself which means he's a hustler as well as a bum. I say this because I keyed in on something he said the last time I hung out with him. He was telling me about some other guy he know's who smokes weed (just for the record I don't), and how he would smoke off the other guy while keeping his OWN weed hidden. It occured to me that he was probably doing the same shit to me when it comes to cigarettes. I finally got tired of the shit and spoke up. I saw him last night and as usual he said ""what's up"" immediately followed by ""got another cigarette?"" I had a pack visibly sitting in my car and said ""no."" I also made him go BUY some.

86,"Middle/high school was a nightmare, because all I did was get bullied. I embarrassed myself so many times that I was considered the cringiest kid in the school. I did a lot of stupid shit and had an insufferable personality, and I was an asshole after trying to stoop down to all of my bullies’ level (i.e. I accidentally started a fight with a catfish account and got two kids suspended).

A lot of my classmates would tell me I had no life, that I was cringy, that no one knew I existed, how no one would love me unless they wanted something from me, how my home life was a mess, how stupid I was, etc. It’s been 2 years since I graduated and I still feel horrible, mostly stemming from all of my past mistakes and cringy personality that everyone remembers me for. My nickname was “tweak.” 

My whole school saw me as a loser and asshole. People were only nice to me when we talked because it’s just the polite thing to do, but they’d make fun of me with their friends the second I had my back turned. My friend group only let me hang out with them so they could use me as a punching bag for their jokes, and I took every one of them because I didn’t want to be seen alone. 

I can’t go back to my hometown and risk running into anyone from the past. I saw 4 people I knew the last time I visited, and they gave me a look and kept walking. Sadly, I knew exactly what they were thinking when they saw me on the street. 

It’s too embarrassing because I know what everyone thought of me. All of my mistakes and cringey moments were known by the whole school, and I relive those moments every day. Someone from my friend group told me that everyone’s going to remember me as the tweak.

I’m trying to move on but inside I’m dying from the weight of my embarrassing past and past mistakes I’ve made. I’m a completely different person now and I wish I could keep moving forward, but it’s literally all I think about 24/7.",01Mar2020,1

96,"First off, they aren't actually disappearing into thin air, I'm no schizophrenic or something.

So, basically every Sunday, not sure when it started, but I've been waking up to an empty house. I do not know where everyone goes. There's no posts on social media, no stories as to where they went, no shopping bags. Their cars don't even leave the driveway; it's like they're walking there, but their SnapChat accounts are always on ghost mode so I can't confirm.

Trust me, I can confirm that I'm not crazy. I've asked them countless times, to which they just always laugh and ignore me, moving onto another conversation. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY COULD BE DOING AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY HONESTLY.

The other day I woke up to the house empty, and this time the dog was gone too. All the TVs in the house were on, but nobody was watching it.

Today, I woke up to an empty house AGAIN, and decided that I'm actually going to fucking set out and look for them. I must have gone to about 50 fucking stores looking through the windows, and there was no sign of them!

My only remaining theory is that they're fucking hiking or something without me. I mean, we live next to some bigass hills, so this could be it; but how could they do this for about 12 hours each day?

Also, they always come back at exactly 8pm; which is 5 minutes from right now as I'm writing this.

101,"My boy, my oldest child, was so good when he was little, but something broke inside of him when he was a teenager.

My wife and I always accepted, loved, and encouraged him. We pushed him to work hard and treat people with respect. I don’t know where exactly we failed him but as a father I feel responsible for the thing he’s turned into.

It started when he was 14. He had began to become withdrawn and emotional. We chalked it up to teenaged mood swings. For some reason he was just so angsty and bitter all the time. We were worried about his lack of social life and his over-reliance on his computer. He kind of hid himself in the online world so my wife and I began to limit his computer time, but he simply became more aggressive and confrontational.

His hygiene was bad, and he was always confrontational when we told him to shower or do laundry. His room stank horribly and we eventually had a huge fight over it where he physically shoved my wife and called her a bitch, and eventually we got him to at least clean and air out his room regularly on the grounds that it was our house and if he couldn’t maintain his space he wouldn’t be entitled to it - essentially we got to the point where we told him he wouldn’t be allowed his worldly possessions or privacy unless he took care of the space we all shared. the room still smelled and he was still rude about cleaning it but we could tell him to get it clean and he would do it after that.

We ended up getting a call from his school saying that a female student felt harassed by him. We were shown messages where he continually badgered her to have sex with him, threatened to “punish” her for stringing him along, sending her unsolicited nudes, telling her some violent fantasies of his, and eventually just descending into some horrid rage-filled rant about how she is just another “whore” and other things.

We were shocked. We explained to him why this behaviour was unacceptable, and I explained to him that it was ok to be sexually active but his actions were toxic and abusive.

I tried mentoring him man-to-man, taking him on camping trips and whatnot and talking to him about women and girls and trying to give him advice. I suggested he try showering, changing up his hair and facial hair styles, trying out different fashion styles, maybe going to the gym.

I told him some hard truths - that he doesn’t want a gross woman so he shouldn’t be a gross man. By gross I mean hygiene and looks. I explained to him that good looks are more hygiene and self care than genetics but he refused to accept what I said to him.

After that I caught him sniffing his sister’s panties in the laundry room - she was 12 at the time and he was 17. He assured me it had nothing to do with his sister, he said he just had a panty sniffing fetish and he pretended they belonged to girls from porno videos, but still I gave him hell for it, and he was grounded and lost his computer for 6 months. I went through his computer and I was disgusted by the kinds of hateful, racist, incel forums he frequented, the horrid things he said about women, and his save file was full of cartoon porn with girls of questionable ages. I wiped the hard drive completely and began strictly monitoring his online activity. I used parental filters to block incel sites and and porn sites that hosted cartoon porn.

The next big issue was something he did to my daughter’s friend. My daughter is 5 years his junior, and one day after a sleepover, my daughter came to me and said her friend wanted to tell me something but was afraid of what I would say.

My son cornered this 13 year old girl and physically blocked her path and touched her hair and face while making very inappropriate comments about her body and asking her if she liked to sleep naked and what kind of underwear she wore.

I tore into my son for that, my wife and I both shouted at him, and told him his behaviour was horrible and I told him then that if his actions got him arrested I would not defend him. He accused us of not loving him, but I told him the reason I was so passionately angry in that situation is because I do love him, and I want to help him become a good man so he can stop being so predatory and bitter and miserable. I told him some hard truths. That he did this all to himself and that he is the only one he can blame for how bitter he is.

I suggested he look to women his own age and he went on a rant about how it was a waste of time because women were already whores (and his definition of a whore is a woman who has had sex even just once) by 17. I called him out on his bullshit and expressed clearly that if he harassed young girls anymore I would personally turn him in.

I invited my daughters friend over after and I personally apologized to her for her experiences, I cried in shame for my son’s behaviour and begged her forgiveness for allowing her to feel unsafe in my home and promised her that if she ever felt uncomfortable she could come to my wife and I and we would always believe and help her. Luckily, my daughter didn’t lose this friend, but for safety I installed a lock on my daughter’s door.

We got my son therapy but he refused to engage with the therapist, calling him a “sand nigger” and “pajeet” and “terrorist”. His next therapist was a “chad”, so he didn’t relate to that either.

We fought about him not trying, not getting a job, and he said he couldn’t get one because of the immigrants, to which I pointed out that he was struggling because he got fired from his high school jobs for being lazy.

After those fights, my wife tried to empathize with him and understand what made him so bitter but he flipped out at her, and called her a cock-gargling whore and said that she fucked her way through dozens of men until she found a “beta-fag” who was willing to shelter her for missionary sex.

My wife, who works and contributes to the family income, who is an independent, professional woman.

Honestly, I lost it more than ever before. I had never been so angry when I heard what he said. That may be his mom, he may be my son, but the woman he was abusively tearing into is my god damn wife. No one can treat my wife like that.

I am ashamed to say in my anger, he shoved me and I physically retaliated, shoving him back, and pinning him against the wall. I felt ashamed of myself, I have never been an angry or violent person, but I couldn’t control myself. I’ve never put my hands on either of my children in such a way in my life, I hate child abusers... but this boy was no child. He was a grown man.

He was intimidated and backed down, and for a while he was peaceful.

The last straw was this week.

My daughter has dated 3 people her whole life. A boy, a girl, and now another boy. We were as open about sex with my daughter as we were with my son. We asked if she would like to have a question-free steady supply of condoms left in her bathroom drawer, and if she wanted to get on birth control. She said no to both questions with her first boyfriend. She never really brought him home but we met him at one of her recitals. When she had a girlfriend she went over to her house all the time, and didn’t want to bring her to the same house her brother lived in, a sentiment I understood.

But her most recent boyfriend has a lot going on behind the scenes in his family. He’s a nice boy but his mom is a single mom of 4 and they struggle.

This boy started coming around a month after they got together. I like him. My daughter is happy with him. He treats her with respect. He is an intelligent boy. He’s an absolute gentleman. He’s respectful and polite in our home. He calls me sir, calls my wife Ma’am, he offers to help with the cooking or dishes or cleaning while he’s visiting, he talks to us, he’s a bit of an amateur cook himself and brings us food all the time to say thank you for taking care of him, when we go out for dinner he always offers to pay for himself and my daughter (though I know he doesn’t have much money so I always pay). When getting out of the car he opens the door for my wife and offers her his hand (he sits behind her for leg room). He holds the doors, when we leave somewhere he helps my daughter put her jacket on like those sweet old fashioned couples.

This young man works hard, and gives what little he has to his mom and siblings. Like I said, I really respect the boy. I offered him money once for groceries for his family but he turns me down and says he would feel guilty accepting my money like that. He’s appreciative of things - in the winter, it was -20 and he had only a hoodie, so I draped my jacket over his arms, and I said “take it son, it’s cold.” He had tears in his eyes as he said thank you, and I made some excuse about wanting to get rid of the jacket and told him he could keep it if he brought cookies for us next time he visited.

When Christmas came along, I invited him over for supper, and when I went to pick him up I delivered some presents for his family, and on the ride back to my house we had a moment. He was crying because he didn’t have much to give us - he got everyone in our house a present but he cried anyways because he felt it wasn’t enough to make up for what we gave him. I pulled over, and I just hugged him, and I said to him that it wasn’t the value of what he got, it was that he got us anything at all. I thanked him for treating my daughter so well, and I told him he would always be welcome in my home.

My own son didn’t get us anything for christmas, not even a card bought with the money we give him. This boy got my wife and I matching wine glasses since we like to share a bottle every now and then.

My son didn’t eat with us. He pillaged the food table and ran away to his room alone while my daughter’s boyfriend met my sister and her family and my parents and my uncle. They all told me how charming he was and how polite he was. Meanwhile after dinner my son told my 5 year old nephew “fuck off Faggot” for asking to play a game with him. A man over 20 years old.

Last week, my wife and I went out for an evening to ourselves. We went to dinner, then we went to an upscale bar to play some pool, then we went home.

When I walked in the door, the kids were screaming at each other. I came in to see my son and my daughter’s boyfriend fighting. The boyfriend was just pushing my son back and trying to redirect him, my son was throwing punches and charging him. My daughter was crying and sitting against the wall clutching her face. I got between them and pushed them apart, and demanded to know what was happening.

My son went on a tirade about how he found birth control pills and heard “whore” sounds from her room, so he kicked open her door and discovered them having sex, he said he couldn’t believe his own sister would “be a nigger’s whore” and called the poor boy a monkey and other things.

My wife got my daughter and her boyfriend out of there and I yelled at my son for how he was acting. Eventually I got nowhere with him so I made him wait in his room. I went to talk to my daughter. I apologized to her boyfriend, crying as I did, telling him that I hope he could forgive me for letting this happen. He said he was sorry for getting violent but that he only did it because my son hit her. My daughter cried and said he was a psycho and threatened to rape her, and that he admitted to ejaculating on her toothbrush and hair brush.

I charged into his room, and I said firmly that he should pack his bags and leave. I told him I would pay to have his things sent to him, wherever he went, but that he was leaving tomorrow.

My wife stayed at my sisters, and my daughter and her boyfriend spent the next few nights at his place.

The next day I practically threw my son out of the house kicking and screaming.

I took his key back and changed the alarm codes and garage door code. A day later I had a message requesting some of this things - mostly his gaming stuff - be delivered to some strange apartment block I didn’t recognize a couple of towns over. A college aged man buzzed me in and I delivered the stuff. I didn’t see my son.

My wife and I then went through his room. My daughter’s boyfriend came over and helped me move his furniture to the garage. We threw out his mattress and some other more gross and smelly things, and we took out the carpet to be replaced.

Hidden in the closet was a treasure trove of my daughter’s underwear, so saturated with old, moldy semen that they were as hard as bricks. The unnerving part was that there were a few pairs my daughter was adamant didn’t belong to her. And they were too small for my wife. It was possible he stole them from my nieces.

There was a sketchbook containing graphic drawings of my son violently raping different women and keeping little girls chained up in some kind of sex dungeon. I went through his old phone that was still working, and all his photos were screenshots of my nieces and their friends in their bikinis, lots of cartoon porn, lots of red pill and incel and Trump memes. He still had messenger, so I checked his messages, most of them were just him trying to harass women and underaged girls.

I checked his Email and... much to my disgust, he stole private photos of my wife from her phone, and he was selling them.

Today, I went to the police with everything and told them everything.

I gave my baby boy everything... I don’t know why he went down this road. But I’m just so sorry I failed him. I don’t know what the police will do... but I hope they stop him before he hurts someone else.

The sad thing is... yesterday, once it was all over and settled, yesterday we had a wonderful day. One of the happiest we have ever had.",01Mar2020,1

I'd really appreciate anyone's help or opinion on this. I'm a very impatient person and tend to rush into things head first.",01Mar2020,1

111,I go on tiktok and everyone is all like “i wanna be blue eye blonde hair” or “look at these crazy white people” and whatnot. I go on tumblr and everyone like “white ppl white ppl white ppl suck white people silver spoon bla bla bla” I go on facebook and get a bunch of indian men in my dms like “aaaaa u are white baby i wil make u happy”. In real life my friend from russia white blue eyes not too long ago said how one of her friends was jealous of her because she had blue eyes. Japanese anime is clearly full of white people. The white people craze has reached here too even. It’s like everyone is obsessed with white people. But they’re not special. Not any more special than any other person. They just have lighter colors. There’s no reason for everyone to be so crazy about white people.,01Mar2020,1

113,"I’m a 18 years old girl and i hit my brother today, like really punch him. It wasn’t the first time and i regret. We had an argument because my mom asked me to tell him to go to bed. He refused and stared at me saying nothing like he was challenging me. He have a lot of anger about me, my others siblings and my parents, we don’t know why. So i had enough of him challenging me so i punch him. My other young brother came for separate us and im really ashamed of the image that i give of their old sister. I really don’t want to be like that, im really really scared because i don’t want to be that kind of violent sister, and mother in the future.

I don’t know what to do because i don’t know how to control this anger that i have when someone provoke me. I tried to speak to him nicely, it didn’t work and he seemed like he considered me being nice like weakness. I tried to speak to my parents but because he is the youngest, they protect him. I feel like i tried everything and i don’t know what to do. Please help me, how can i deal with this situation ? What can i do for controlling my anger when he is challenging me ?",01Mar2020,1
114,"Finally after two years of just sitting in bars , I went to a party and danced and had fun!
This is so great!
But at some point I was so tired so I went to the bathroom and fall a sleep there for half an hour :)",01Mar2020,1
115,"I’m 6ft tall (1cm under 6ft to be exact) long legs short torso etc and have been for like 6-7 years, back then I was like 9.7 stone in weight and was pretty thin tbh but young looking and always suited a slimmer face so it wasn’t too bad. In 2014 I went up to 11.2 stone and Recently the past year or so Iv tried gaining weight and went up to say 11.9 stone but then my face went a lot rounder and fuller and I was still the same build but had a fat belly. I try losing weight again to slim my face back out but the bottom line is no matter how much weight I gain I’m still long and lanky and skinny so I may as well be a lesser weight to slim my face out? I’m so torn on what to do

Edit; in August I went down to 11.0 stone and my body went pretty thin but my face slimmed out. So I ate and ate to gain it and my body deffo went a little bigger as desired but my face went rounder a ton :/I want the slimmer face back tbh",01Mar2020,1
116,"Apologies for the long post, it’s something I don’t talk about often so I didn’t know what was relevant to include! 

I’ve (19F) dealt with low self esteem since I was about 12 years old. It’s always been pretty bad but since going to university the thoughts have suddenly become almost crippling. I find it hard to leave the house and if I see myself in a reflection in public I burst into tears because of how much I hate what I look like. I’m constantly self conscious that other people are staring at me when I’m in public and comparing me to other people, and find myself ranking myself against the people around me. I also had an episode last year with friends when I was getting ready to go out but every time I looked in the mirror I started to cry and I eventually ended up cancelling my plans. 

After that episode I had conflicting attitudes from my friends, with some telling me I should consider getting therapy and others saying that it was just insecurity that everyone deals with. I don’t believe that my issue is body dysmorphia as some of my friends suggested at the time, as to me that suggests that my insecurities are unfounded. For context, I have previously been called ‘the ugliest girl in my friendship group’ and have received many other comments related to the way that I look compared to other people, so I do believe that the way I look is something that needs to be changed. 

Anyway, I’m now at a point financially where I can afford to ‘fix’ my biggest insecurity with surgery (non invasive and temporary). Friends and family have all argued against me doing this with the same ‘just learn to love your flaws’ kind of spiel each time, but after years of attempting this I truly don’t believe it’s possible for me to feel good about myself without this surgery. I obviously don’t believe that getting the surgery will fully fix my self esteem issues but I figured that by changing my biggest flaw it might help a little bit in the long run

TLDR: I’ve always been very insecure, should I suck it up and learn to love myself or seek out surgery as a way of ‘fixing’ it?",01Mar2020,1
117,"I’m a fifteen year old girl and I’m sorry if the grammar is off I am not in the mood to check it. I’ve been feeling really upset lately and I don’t know why. I asked my best friend and she said it’s just the winter blues. I believed her for a bit but now I don’t know. I just feel so alone and I don’t have anyone to talk to. My other friends are closer to each other than to me. My mom and dad are living a busy life as it is and I know for fact that they don’t want to hear about how I I’m not happy. My brothers I know don’t want to either. On top of feeling alone, I’ve been having really bad self esteem issues. I’ve been over weight do as long as I can remember and I kind of grew numb to it. But as soon as I got into highschool, that was when my eyes opened. My dad doesn’t help at all. He constantly tells me that I am lazy and don’t do anything right. He tells me that I should be doing chores when I come home and to help clean the house cause he provides for me and my family and I’m not grateful enough. I don’t feel like I’m important anymore and that I’m just a fat kid who isn’t gonna do anything with her life other than playing sports. Plz I need someone to talk to. I’ve never felt so down and it sucks so bad. My world is shattering and I don’t know why and how to fix it. It’s not like any drama is going on but I wonder what it will be like to die. It’s a thought I think about everyday. But I know that I will only hurt the people around me. I’m not suicidal or anything. But my life has been harder and it hasn’t even started yet. I just want to know why I’m so sad and feeling this way. Is it hormones cause I’m so young? Or am I just looking for attention? If you know plz I’m begging you, I can’t live in constant pain anymore.",01Mar2020,1
