0,"For me, this has been a decade of nihilism. I've let myself be motivated by money. I've given up my dreams out of fear of hunger. I've smoked a thousand cigarettes knowing, hoping, that each would shorten my life. I've treated existence as a burden. The weight is no longer bearable.

I have hope for a better tomorrow. I'm going to quit smoking at midnight. I'm going to appreciate life while I can. I'm not going to beat myself up when I don't appreciate life because sometimes it just be that way. I'm going to try to be the person I always dreamed I could be. I'm going to try.",01Jan2020,1

2,"This is currently my longest enduring reddit account. I've made thousands over the last 10 years. Probably more but I don't keep count. In the past as soon as I made a comment or post that was viewed and recognized enough for someone to give me gold I would panic and delete the account. Make a new one. I don't post for Karma. I could give a fuck about Karma. I'm just crazy and anti social and participating in social activities online has actually been a huge part of my therapy. My current account, whale\_whispers has been the account that broke down the walls for me. But I'm past that now and it's time to let go of the account and move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to award the gold I've collected for posting or commenting stupid shit to the first thing that catches my eye. I'm gonna browse for a while. Comment here and there and maybe make a last post. When I go to log off tonight I will be deleting the entire account. The only reason I'm posting this, is because I realized people have been following my account. I never check that stuff and I never check my inbox or messages. Like ever. I just log on and respond to whatever catches my eye. I think on this account I have only responded to actual comments maybe two or three times. Not because I don't care and not because I'm some kind of bot. Just by the time I'm done browsing I'm done browsing and I'm not trying to go back and answer 2000 questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was the first time I've ever checked my inbox, or followers list and I had no idea. Like all of you you should find someone else to entertain yourselves with. My kind of crazy is in fact entertaining, but is also super easy to slip into. No one should listen to me ever. Even if what I say makes sense and is in fact right. Like sure, I get it right in some aspects, but in others? I'm the crazy homeless woman pushing a shopping cart around town. That's my aesthetic dig?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank all of you that have read my bullshit or interacted with me without judgement. I'm going to miss you guys alot. You see I'm not just deleting my account tonight. I'm deleting reddit from my life all together. Just like I did with facebook, twitter, instagram, 2-4-6-8- chans, my list goes on. By this time tomorrow I will be in South America on the next flight to Antarctica. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally found my dream Job yall. I think things are going to be ok and I don't need you guys anymore. At my age it's safe to assume I will die in Antarctica, provided I'm able to perform the job I was hired for in the first place. Once I'm there I'm not going to want to leave. A barren and frozen wasteland? WITH FEW IF ANY PEOPLE TO SPEAK OF, ALL OF THEM JUST LIKE ME?

&amp;#x200B;

Most would call that hell. All I see is a frozen and sterile crystal paradise. Even if I die of exposure? All I will ever feel is sleepy once I've stopped feeling cold. I'm super ok with this and super excited for the new adventure. The opportunity. I have no intention of ever coming back to the real world. If all I have to do is sit in a fucking tent and listen? Which is what I've been hired to do. Listen and analyze. Record and further analyze. Be able to tweak software to recognize sounds the ai is not familiar with coming from the depths of the ice and ocean. Like the mysterious BLOOP everyone is so up in arms about. Its not Chtullu yall. It's how volcanoes burp. Putting it simply.

&amp;#x200B;

SO yeah. Sterile frozen wasteland with pretty lights in the sky. Ice bears and snow birds and mysterious cold water deep sea fish. YETIS. Ice ghosts. Weird events. EVERYTHING IS GO IN THE ANTARCTIC, JUST NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO STICK AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH IT FOR SCIENTIFIC RECORD. It's an isolated harsh enviroment. One I look froward to calling home and one I look forward to calling my final resting place.

&amp;#x200B;

See yall on the flip side, it's been fun and peace. Thanks for reading my bullshit and thanks for being part of what healed me. TTYL.",01Jan2020,1

I'm trying to stay positive at work and at home, but my daily live revolves around taking care of my mom, who has head and neck cancer. The oncologist says chemo and radiation will take it away and she's lucky to have the type she has (squamous cell carcinoma) -- he's hopeful.

Can't have hope if no one else gives it.

The only support I have *(I don't call work support because fuck those who have feelings/youthful looks/vibe -- I'm the one-percent where I am)* is my twin sister. Everyone else bounced, including our older sister. I resent her because she moved AFTER finding out -- pretty sure she wanted to avoid taking care of her, but she's such an emotional wall. My twin, though -- she's been my ride or die and she's the only one who seems to give a damn about anything.

The world sucks. Everyone is cruel. I don't know where to get help because so-called support doesn't exist. And the doctors are dragging their feet. Guessing because my mom isn't rich or a lighter tone. My mom is withering and writhing and moaning and it seems like we're stuck.

It was almost like a dig to people who don’t go out and party. Since she is a party animal and gets drunk and etc. 

She is right about enjoying life and etc but I don’t think she should have had a dig at the fact that people don’t go out. Everyone is different and it makes people like me (who doesn’t party or drink) realise how my social life sucks.",01Jan2020,1

20," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

21,"You had a really good year, no matter what you mind says you had a GOOD year!!! Heres a few things that happened in 2019 for me:

I went to Finland for nearly 3 months!!! FINLAND!!! I went to be an Aupair and ended up leaving that family with cheating kids and one of them hit me, I am so so so proud of myself for sticking my ground and LEAVING THE NEXT DAY!!! Hell yeah!!!

I met 2 people in Finland thanks to Reddit. I still have that post on my profile. So so proud of myself for getting myself out there in a foreign country all by myself only knowing the family I was staying with. 

I made 3 friends for life. 1 of them I have everything to thank for and then also her family. I'll make a post about that soon maybe, about my whole trip to Finland, we'll see.

I stayed at an Airbnb for the first time like two days after making the reservation or maybe I think it was the day before. Yeah. Sunday afternoon to Wednesday afternoon. 

I flew in an airplane, rode on a bus, the metro, rode a bike for the first time in idk how many years, I was on an overnight ferry (it was HUGE) on the way to SWEDEN, before that I was on a smaller ferry to go to Estonia, and I rode a train to an Air Show by myself! All really neat experiences. 

I had my ups and downs with depression through the year, even in Finland, but I made it through. 

I made a Facebook to update my family and 2 close friends while I was overseas. That was nice updating them but mostly ranting, ha. Glad I was open about my mental health.

Before going to Finland I went to therapy for the first time in who knows how many years. This is two days after my dad's fianceé found me, um, half naked in our bathroom passed out in my vomit. Yeah.. 

I did not purge once this year. I did however ""fast"" for a few days once I realized I'd be going home a week early and felt out of control.. yeah.. 

I WORE A BATHING SUIT IN PUBLIC!!!!! First time at a spa, then at the cabin, then a BIG swimming hall not once but twice!! Hell yeah!!!

I started working on Friday's at my mom's job as an office manager. I like that. This week will be my 14th Friday in a row. Glad my mom is a phone call away though. 

I learned on Thanksgiving Day that my youngest bros girl is having their first kid and its a boy!!! So happy for them both!! Then the next day under not the best circumstances but still great news, I learned my oldest bros girl is pregnant too!!! Shes having a boy too!!! Aaaahhh!!! I went to her 18 week ultrasound yesterday and wow he's definitely a boy, haha. 

So to sum it up.. I went to therapy, I went to Finland I was in different transportation, I rode a bike for the first time in year, I went to Estonia and Sweden, I wore a bathing suit for the first time in many many many years, I went to my new friend's birthday party in Finland around quite a few people and for someone that has social anxiety that was quite something but glad I went, I was in an Uber for the first time (after said party at 4am, haha), I met the most amazing mom and dad who let me stay with them for a week!!! I had some really great tasting chocolates and experienced the pick'n'mix quite a few times, prob a lil too many but I made up for it by walking a lot, I went to Helsinki and explored it quite a few times, I did have a relapse with my eating disorder but it only lasted maybe a week, so that was good. I learned I was going to be an Aunt for officially the second time ever then the next day I'd be one again, wtf, I am so happy for my bros!!! I celebrated my birthday in Finland and that was another day I was in a bathing suit with many many people around, I met 3 amazing people from Finland and I owe them so so much and just this afternoon wished them a Happy New Year, I got away from a bad situation in Finland and realized just how strong and resilient I am.

If I think of anything else I'll add it but what matters the most out of all this is that I did it all WITH DEPRESSION!!! FUCK YOU DEPRESSION!!!! I can and will survive another year despite dealing with your bs everyday. 

I AM STRONG. I AM RESILIENT. I AM BEAUTIFUL. I AM SMART. I MATTER. I AM NOT A BURDEN. I AM CARING, NICE, FUNNY, AND LOYAL!!!!",01Jan2020,1

28,"My dad used to be a pretty shit one as far as i remember during my childhood, he had clearly angry issues and was very abusive (emotional abuse) toward me, my sister and my mom. Some years was a living hell with him getting home drunk and yelling at us for some petty motive. So, i grew up pretty resentive and cold towards him, as well as my sister, we never had much of a ""bond"" you know?

Dont get me wrong, im not exactly ""easy"" too. I simply dont tolerate him treating my sister or my mother bad so you could say our relationship was the worst one.

In 2016 i thought we hit our breaking point, i couldnt see any way we could be a loving family with him on our home. Then, on that very same year, by november, me and my dad got into our worst fight because he was yelling at my mother again, it reached to the point i thought he was going to beat me, but i wasnt going to let him have his way. He left the house without saying a word after our neighbors threathed calling the cops. Then... he changed.

It didnt happen overnight, hell he is working his problems up until now, but he really wanted to change. In his first year (2017) i didnt really gave him a chance and distrusted his reabilitation. When he decided to never drink again, i thought it was only a matter of time till he was back to his old ways. I was really cold when he tried to approach me, and was very wary around him.

It took a really long time, but he really changed a lot. Its been 4 years already and i think we got a lot closer now and holidays are a lotta happier now. In this new years eve, when we were walking home, he holded my hand. I admit, it was REALLY awkward at first but im strangely happy.

If you’re punching something continuously you’re going to increase the density of your bones in your hands.  Also referred to conditioning your hands. 

If you’re in a very physical extreme environment (perhaps a change in elevation) you’re going to adapt to it.  If you’re native to the Himalayan’s you’re lung capacity is increased to deal with the depravation of oxygen.

If your main source of food is on the bottom of the sea floor and your only way to survive is diving to retrieve it, your liver is going to be the sole reason why you can after a certain amount of time it’s function increases.  It’s adaptation.

I don't care, I think to myself as I grow increasingly annoyed with the fireworks going off three hours too early. Such a superficial day, made solely to cap off the holiday season and give people one last reason to get drunk before it's back to life as usual. Nature doesn't care that it's New Years' Eve, nothing special is happening in the sky other than the explosives the obnoxious partiers shoot up there. Nothing is blooming for the New Year except for resolutions that will be dropped after a month. The ground isn't shaking in anticipation of the coming decade. 

I'm alone tonight.

Why should I care? I am not the type to want to go to a party, nor the type to go out of my way to be social. I have a small circle of friends and I could just hop on the mic and talk to most of them if I wanted, so it isn't like I am missing out on anything. Besides, I spend plenty of days alone, why should this one bother me?

I'm alone tonight.

My mom and step dad are down stairs watching a movie. They invited me to join, but I didn't want to. I've seen Spider-Man: Homecoming a million times, I'm not interested. My dad called me earlier and invited me to a club with him and my step mom tonight. They have a friend whose band is performing to celebrate the end of the decade, and he would really like to see me out of the house. Not my scene, dad. Thanks anyways.

I'm alone tonight.

Why is this day always such a bad day for me? It seems like the whole world is happy tonight. I turn on the TV and see smiling faces in Time Square, rowdy and raucous as can be, all waiting for a stupid glass ball to slide down a rail. Why can't I be happy like them? Why do I care about this stupid night? Why am I always alone for it, even though I don't need to be? Why is it that whoever I would want to spend it with always seems to be spending it in the arms of someone else? 

Why am I alone tonight?",01Jan2020,1
36,"Currently I’m spending NYE alone while my boyfriend of 6 months is at a party with his friends. This is is not my ideal situation because I’d rather spend it alone with him, and I decided to stay home because I don’t like parties, or his friends... Part of me does feel he is choosing them over me, but 3 of his friends from out of state are there, and they all planned this over a month ago. He’s known his friends for 5-6 years, and he’s known me for half a year, so I guess it’s fair for his friends to take priority over me for one night.

Our compromise for tonight is for me to come to the party at 11:45 to basically just pick my boyfriend up and take him home. Compromising can really suck and not always work out in your favor, but sometimes you just have to do it. It makes him happy and me fairly content, and that’s good enough even if I don’t get my ideal outcome.",01Jan2020,1

40,"(Cp)19F. I’ve been in college for four semesters now and all I’ve done is wasted time and money (both financial aid and my own). I’ve failed almost every class and photoshopped screenshots of my grades to my family, which worked all but once. I have 0 motivation, my school sucks and I didn’t want to be in college in the first place, but as a former g&amp;t child I’m constantly pressured by my family to do super cool great things like become a doctor, lawyer etc. Honestly, all I wanted to do after graduating high school was get a job and make art..It sounds unrealistic but I did have plans, in fact a family member that lives with me is following very similar plans yet no one puts any pressure on them at all. I’m struggling with what to say to my family because I’m not exactly expecting to be able to return to my school for the spring semester and I’ve heard thousands of times that not going to college isn’t an option. I’ve had depression/anxiety all my life which somehow morphed into bipolar disorder and my mom pulled me out of treatment from the time I was 15. Besides all the issues that arose from that, my school problems weigh on my mind every day and I feel like I’m close to a breaking point. I don’t eat or sleep enough and all I do is think about the same things over and over with no solution. I have until about mid January to come up with something. So far I’d planned on finding a job and saying I transferred schools so I can pretend I’m in class all day.

53,"I graduated high school at May. Then in the summer I worked while I was pursuing a girl from high school. Started college confident in my major (psychology) meet some people at college but still maintained some friendships from high school. I also got counseling at my university, which has helped a lot. Turns out I have an anxiety disorder with depression. I admit I do have occasional thoughts of suicide but some how I found more than one reason I should stay alive. Then, one day my friends from HS wanted me to change and we’re forcing me to and making threats (including the girl I was pursuing). So I blocked them on every social media account)it was only two people) The semester continued and I withdrew one class and passed my intro to psych class with a 94%. It’s almost midnight. Meet a girl that I think I like but I got rooted trust issues and I got some things in my heart that I need to deal with. So yes, No gf at the moment. It’s almost midnight and I’m with my family and cousins. I still miss my friends from high school but I just keep praying for their well being even though they probably don’t deserve my friendship. I think New Years resolution are overrated and I’m done with the crap some people give out. I just want to be the person I meant to be but you know that takes time.

54,"Sorry this is long, tldr at the bottom! 

I'm (19F) obese and I have a bad problem with overeating. I have a strong compulsion to keep eating until I physically can't. I think it's due to emotional issues. Anyway, I track my calories and this last week I've consistently eaten 2000+ calories when my goal is 1280. I even hit 3620 calories one day. 

Even though I overeat everyday and have been since I was a little kid (honestly I'm really surprised I'm not bigger)  I can't eat much without getting full so the amount of calories isnt a problem for me. I had been overeating sugary, salty junk for a few weeks now. 

Previously I had been trying to eat clean (lots of veggies, rice, and chicken or salmon) and relapsed due to lack of funds.

 Until sunday when I ate 959 calories. 

Yesterday I had 742. That was all milk in my tea, some sugar, a pack of mini cookies, and a pack of crackers. (It's all unhealthy I know)

 Today I've eaten 395 calories in some chocolate mint candies, a handful of crackers, and some milk in a cup of tea I didn't finish. 

I can't make myself eat anymore. I'm not trying to starve myself. I feel fine physically. I've been drinking plenty of water. I have been eating a lot of sugar the past few weeks. 

My overeating has been going on for my *entire* life. That's no exaggeration. I've always been overweight or obese in my life. 

I didn't know where to post this but if anyone has any idea I'd like to hear it. I'm pretty worried. 

Tl;dr: I've been overeating my entire life. I've been trying to eat healthy and smaller portions, but the last few weeks I've relapsed and have been badly overeating. Until sunday when my appetite dropped and I ate 959 calories, the next day 742, and today 395. I can't eat anymore. I feel fine physically.",01Jan2020,1

I have a girlfriend but I even feel like she thinks I’m gay and I don’t know why that bothers me. 

I get a lot more attention from men, too. I can’t really pinpoint what’s wrong with me besides my depression and anxiety but being sexually fluid and having a feminine personality that I’m not afraid to show has really complicated things for me.

She works in a field where communication with other English speakers is vital, so working on her accent will probably help her career as well.

I used to masturbate to her at work, but then I lost control, I started directly ""ejaculating"" on her desk, I made sure to clean it rigorously.

At first I thought ""ah this is fine, typical company outsourcing, it's ok"" but after learning more about it I've realised this is a unique opportunity. These people are exactly the kind of people I thought I'd be working with maybe in 5 years. They're all proactive, professional and know their shit.

After much self reflection I realize I’ve had a good year and I’ve accomplished a lot. Some of the things I’ve done that seemed like a step back at the time, were actually steps forward. I took a lot of risks that proved to be rewarding. I put myself through a lot of pain this year but it was necessary to be where I am now.   
I’m very sick today so I got my shift covered and spent the day listening to music, reading, and writing. It was the first time I’ve done creative writing in years. I’m rusty but I had fun. This set the mood for how good I’m feeling now I think...   
I’m realizing how many people I have that love and support me. Not long after the clock hit midnight today I impulsively decided to lurk on an “ex”’s page and saw that, despite turning down my desire for a real relationship because they “weren’t ready” and insisting that it had nothing to do with me, theyre in what seems to be becoming a serious relationship with a new girl, like, a month and a half later. This seems to be a common occurrence in my love life - people not taking my love seriously. So seeing this made me feel dizzy and lied to.   
But miraculously I was able to push myself through waves of negative, self-destructive thoughts that crashed through my brain. I can admit to myself that my love is not a burden and that one day somebody else will appreciate it in the way that I know it deserves to be appreciated. I feel victorious right now.

ME
A 27 year old guy. I left home when I was 18, I now work in a BIG 4 tech company making very good money and living a great life in a big city in Europe. Have friends in the country I live in, but I am single. I’ve been through a lot to be in this stage and worked very hard for it. I also own a small business that’s growing, but I just don’t feel like money makes me happy anymore.  I can be angry from time to time, but also like to surround myself with positive people. I have a great relationship with my friends and work very hard both on my full time job and business. Sometimes I can be very quiet. I am currently undergoing though a lot of stress but always try to stay positive. I have a good relationship with a girl, which always makes my family feel weird about me laughing when I talk to her, because I never laugh with them. I will be also relocating to Canada soon,  which has been my long life dream, which I also never told my family about. Currently renting in Europe, no house, no girlfriend. I decided to take a trip to my home country for Christmas and NYE to be with my family. Now a little background about everyone in my family. 

- MY DAD
My dad has a simple job, he doesn’t make a lot of money, but my family lives in a decent apartment. My dad always corrects my mom for the simplest things, he is super judgmental
and always likes to comment on things he doesn’t know anything about or argues at all times. It’s like I have to walk on eggshells anytime I say something or act in front of them. He keeps saying my little name (when I was 5) with a tone of voice to make me feel little, but he never does that to my brothers (I’m the younger child). 

Parents have been together for 35 years.

- MY MOM
Mom is a very kind person, but also very needy and constantly build trips me. If I want to take w holiday and travel somewhere that’s not my home country, my mom immediately tells me how I should always be with them when I have a chance. Also, same thing goes for very small things, like yesterday, I just wanted to lay on the couch on my phone and do nothing and as soon as I tell her something like: “oh I can’t wait to lay on the couch all day”, she immediately suggests to go somewhere out and if I don’t do it, she guild trips me for doing it. It’s like if I didn’t mention I wanted to stay home, she wouldn’t have offered to go out. Its like she always wants things done her way when we are 5 people in the family wanting to do our own thing. 

She also tries to change my decisions all the time even for the smallest things like what meal to eat for dinner. If I say chicken, she would say: “are you sure you want chicken, why not beef”? I say no, and she tells me “cmoooon let’s eat beef”.

Same goes when we go to a restaurant and I am the first to sit on the table. She would tell me: “are you sure you wanna sit there, come here, it’s better?”  This constant bs has affected my life choices before, but I’m glad i distance myself from these things and got my life in my own hands.


- MY BROTHER
Always finds things to judge me on. From the style of music I listen to, to the way I walk and talk. It’s like I can’t talk with anyone about anything in my family.  It’s like every conversation is either him laughing at someone, discussing other people or trying to make me negative like him. (He is 30)


The funny thing is that I am the most successful person in the family and make 5 times more than my whole family income, but I never share my wages with them so they don’t start comparing me with other people. 

I became very secretive about all of my relationships, people and things I do in my life because my family constantly judges me and my choices. I remember telling them I started playing football and the first thing they said was:”oh, what happened with you liking basketball? Changed your mind again?! I thought you played before and now started playing football.” I always sense the bs from them and the negative vibes.

Overall, I started sensing that negative attitude from them last year and realised how judgmental and toxic they are. 

Sorry for the grammar and typos. I am typing this from my phone while with my family for the holidays.

Don’t know if I am going crazy or is this really true that my family is toxic.",01Jan2020,1

102,"I've been studying abroad for 4 years. Most of that time I've been dirt poor and barely had any fun, due to high cost of living. I've been a decent student who attended all classes, but spent majority of my evenings smoking weed with my buddies, after I finish homework and get back from ""work gigs"" that I would sometimes get. Having just a simple life, with it's struggles. I was living in dormitory, which believe me, was a sh\*t hole. I am a clean person who always tidies up, and for my whole life I've been told that I am a clean person, I loved to keep my room clean at all times.  There was \~70 people living from all over the world, so kitchens were constant mess, toilets and showers were shared, so yeah, not the cleanest place to live. City itself was small and you could see whole city center in \~30 minutes, around the city it was farms and fields, so not a lot to see as well.

&amp;#x200B;

My College was not top notch, barely average, I applied to it, because I am kind of lazy person and didn't want to study super hard. I loved my program, exams, most of the lectors. It was modern, we had all kinds of equipment and it really got me into programming which is what I've been working for the past 3.5 years. Everyday I would walk 2km to my college through quiet neighborhoods through rain/wind/snow.

&amp;#x200B;

I would usually get back to my home country whenever I had a chance, but after \~2 weeks of being at my parents, I would usually want to go back. After couple months of being abroad, I would dream about going back to my country. But it was always a healthy switch, and it kept me going. I would go back to my country during summer holidays and spend all of that time working and making money usually as a waiter or barman. I would bring that money abroad and improve my dorm room/buy new furniture, cutlery. It made me extremely happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I've graduated more than a year ago. I keep thinking and missing all of that experience I had, those friends, that simple yet kind of shitty part of my life, which I think was a highlight of my life until now. I had an opportunity to visit my friends back in that city, I was so excited, but once I got there, reality struck, and I realized that I am ""too old"" to live in that dorm again, I would go nuts because of all that mess, shared showers and bathrooms, people who cook stinky food, etc. But after half of year since that visit, I start to think and miss something about it once again. I am thinking daily about it.

&amp;#x200B;

When I think about it, back then I was poor, my parents couldn't help me a lot, there were days where I would eat once during whole day, I couldn't buy lunch at college, I would usually cook something of my own and bring, as I said most of the times I had to go to bed, I was high on weed. Today, however, I have a decent job, I live with my girlfriend of 5 years, I have money, I have hobbies, I do a lot of sports, I quit smoking, although I drink a lot. Most people would think that I live a better life now, however, those 4 years abroad feels much more ""real"", don't know how to explain. I feel like a more mature, complete person, but still there is this void that I cannot fill.

103,"Hi, Reddit. First-time poster here. Don't let the combination of my 10-month-old account and activity history ^(or lack thereof, really) alarm you, though—I've simply spent these last few years on Reddit as a lurker rather than an active participant, even after I finally decided to create an account last year.

I'd like to change that, though... hence this post. I started frequenting Reddit in 2016, just before my significant other and I moved halfway across the United States, and ever since we relocated I've admittedly grown rather lonely. I'm still in regular contact with My Closest Most Bestest Hometown Buds-Turned-Family, but as we've all become spread out across the country and started trying to properly ""adult"" over the last few years, we don't talk as much as we'd like, and the fact that we're all struggling financially means we almost never see one another. Three years into the new living arrangement, my partner and I still haven't truly befriended anyone in our area, save for three or four of his coworkers, and while we enjoy each other's company, well... you know what they say about too much of a good thing. Compounding all that is the fact that I'm an introvert who's long suffered from depression and anxiety, which makes trying to expand my social circles a challenge but intensifies the loneliness, which worsens the depression and anxiety, which makes meeting new people even *more* difficult, and on and on the vicious cycle spins. I know this needs to change, and I *want* to change it, but I'm also far more interested in enjoying my solitude, with my art, my writing, my books, my music, my online outlets...

So, I decided to start here, on the Internet—not only on Reddit but on other favorite websites of mine, which house communities relevant to my interests, hobbies, and aspirations and where I'll undoubtedly meet others of like mind if I make the effort to engage in said communities.

That's only one of the many changes that I'd like to make this year. For me, 2019 was, put plainly, *absolute garbage*, and while I am aware that the idea of ""new year, new me"" is largely a matter of perspective... it helps. After the tribulations that I've endured for the past year, the concept of being presented with a clean (or, at the very least, clean*er*) slate upon the arrival of 2020 is honestly a welcome one. I know, what with all the progress that I have to make, that this year won't be entirely sunshine and rainbows... but I don't intend to let it be entirely like last year.

Happy New Year. It's nice to finally step out and say hello.",01Jan2020,1
107,"[just a quick trigger warning; mentions of suicide and loss below!] 

I guess that’s not something you’d really expect to read often—I know it sounds ridiculous and probably pathetic to some people. How can playing video games for an audience help you with a medical problem? I don’t know either, to be honest, but somehow it did. 

I think streaming was always something I wanted to do. I had it written on my bucket list, aka, my list of things I would probably never be able to do because I couldn’t hold a job, I couldn’t even stand for long periods without being in excruciating pain and I basically couldn’t do anything fun. I’m talking about the wonderfully misunderstood, underfunded disease endometriosis. My uterus has glued itself to my other body parts, it’s great /s

As it stands, there’s no cure for endometriosis, and there is very few treatments. One (very common) treatment is even a chemotherapy drug which has some intense side effects. In summary; it’s an awful disease to have. Not the worst, but definitely awful. It ruined my life, or so I felt. All I ever saw in my future was me being a mother. I had no interest in doing anything else, I love kids so much, I love being apart of their lives, helping them grow, making memories with them. I raised my two year old brother and I just wanted a kid of my own. I was 19 when I found out I had endometriosis, we started trying basically straight away because we knew even if there was a slight risk of not being able to have a child, we wanted to have the best chances possible, but unfortunately chance was not on our side. My Endometriosis got worse, rapidly, I got very sick very quick. I had the surgery to remove it, which only made it worse (Refer back to unreliable treatments hah). 

Chance finally struck us and we fell pregnant. I had just lost my grandad when my sister fell pregnant with a boy, and my grandma had just passed away when I fell pregnant, so we were really hoping for a girl, so it was like some kind of silly reincarnation thing. Sadly, we lost the pregnancy though, so I never even got the know if it was going to be a girl or not. I fell into a deep depression from there onward. I couldn’t stop thinking about how I failed as a woman. I failed myself, my child, and the love of my life. It was extremely rough. I felt worthless, because all I saw myself as was a parent, nothing more. 

I remember feeling extremely broken, suicidal and just lost. I was at the point of doing something drastic and I remember giving myself two choices; I was just going to end everything, or I could just go all out and do something off my bucket list. If I was going to die anyway, I may as well try something fun, so I did the ultimate goal; streaming! 

It took about a month to get comfortable with talking. I was/am a very socially anxious person, but somehow on stream, it’s like I’m a more confident version of myself. I’ve made so many friends. I’ve made so many memories. In one month, I made it to affiliate which was when I realised streaming was something I really really wanted to continue. I’m only on month two, but I hecking love this hobby. I love doing it, and I love everything that comes with it. Now I stream almost every day, and every morning I have something to look forward to. “I don’t know what I’m doing, but I have a feeling I’m doing it really really well”

Most of all though, I found myself. I found Pachi, the person that wanted to be something else other than a mother. I discovered my tastes, my personality, and self love. I discovered that theres so much more to life than parenthood, and I continue to work hard; for me. I feel like it’s easy to forget yourself sometimes when the world makes you feel like you can only be one thing, and that’s it. But that’s so not true. Each person is like a randomly generated look chest where each one is different and unique in its own way, and when you get to open it up you find all this cool stuff! Like things you’re good at and what you love!

Anyways, in the chance that anyone actually read this all, thanks for coming to my midnight rant. 👉🏻😎👉🏻 stay funky.",01Jan2020,1

It made me realize how narcissistic, manipulative, and how much of a liar he is. I'm happy, yet of course sad.

110,"I hate my life, I hate who I am, I hate how the evil decisions people made in my early life changed me, literally rewired my brain, without my consent. Now I’m expected to “be happy” and “continue on”. 

To give a small bit of perspective my mother has BPD as well as CFS, I was essentially her indentured servant before I can even remember. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, etcetera. Then around puberty age my brother decided it’d be fun to start molesting me. This went on for two years. On top of that the only way I could get attention was to seek the attention of men online...pedophiles who liked to watch me do things on webcam. (I’m a boy if it matters at all). Then at the good ripe age of 20 my first love cheated on me with my best friend since childhood, and left me completely abandoned and alone. Everyone went with them. 

I have intense depression, crippling anxiety, I hate touch, I don’t know how to love, sex rules my thoughts when I think of ANYTHING romantic. I’ve seen multiple therapists over 5 years, tried so many drugs, and nothing helps for long. It always come back to living in hell. 

I barely make money, I have a HUGE amount of debt from my early ages cause I filled the void with credit, and now that I’m TRYING to do something I can’t because my mental bullshit prevents me from doing...anything worthwhile or productive. I can’t even afford fucking therapists visits. 

I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to live anymore, I’m so confused with life I don’t what to think. 

And I get that their decisions shouldn’t affect my future, and I tried. I tried going to doctors and opening up and unpacking all this baggage. But how long can someone try before the evil wins?",01Jan2020,1
111,"Because I fucking stink. It has been almost 3 days I don't take a shower because of the hurry around here. I'm on a trip with my family in a different country from homeland. Constantly thinking about showering, I'm having even recursive shower thoughts. I imagine a shower of thoughts, and each and every one of these shower drops is a thought about taking a fucking shower. I really can't stress enough how I fucking stink.

My luck is that I'm on a cold country (you may already even know where I am and where I am from, but I'll leave that to you), so the stink gets repressed in the heat of my body away from the cold air. I was actually looking for colder places to relieve my horrible smell, but it was so cold outside, I went to the metro, where it wasn't that cold, but it still was a little.

I spoke to an old lady, a humble Singapore muslim lady. She taught me not to worry, even though she didn't seem to be bothered with my stink. Was I even smelling to others? Was I even smelling to me? She taught me not to worry. She spoke of the warmer relationships from when she was 20, before the smartphone, before the internet, before the computer. She seemed to not care about the direction of our ways of life, because she laughed at it, not sarcastically, but humbly, like if we were just cute children that still had so much to learn. She taught me not to worry.

I realized I didn't smell. I wasn't cold, neither hot. Was I even in the metro? Where am I? Who am I? What the fuck is going on?

She, then, left. I am here, all alone, now. I look at my left, where she was seated, a note left, was it on purpose? What is the purpose of everything?

Her note, ""Should we open or close the gateless gate?""

For half a year I sat at home basically unable to do anything, then I started schooling online. Along the way I decided medication was the best option. I am in my final year of online school now and it was the best decision I ever made. I was able to focus on improving my anxiety without the struggle of going to school. Medication started my path to overcoming anxiety and now I finally feel like I am ready to work through it without any medicine. To some people this may not seem like much, but to me it means a lot.

119,"So my dad drank a little bit more wine to a local bar yesterday and he wanted to go to an other bar with my mom after 00:00am . I saw him getting another glass of wine at home so I told him that he shouldn’t drink more if he wants to go to the bar later with my mom, so they both have a good time. What was his response? “You will never be like me. You and your other two brothers, together, you can’t be better than me in everything.” I told him, “maybe not now, but ask me again in a few years”.

Guys.. this really broke my heart. I’m a 22 yo male studying computer science and engineering and i have 10 lessons left for this semester to get the bachelor degree. My one brother hasn’t finished then university yet, but he has a job. My other brother has a bachelor and an MSc degree on Animal nutrition and he has a job. My dad has nothing of that. He was just working hard from an early age because things were different back then.
I get so much pressure from the study I do every day, reading like 7-8 hours a day and all I needed now was his support. My mom supports me and believes in me. I thought my dad too but.. damn this hurts so much. I left home after dinner,  I stopped the car on the side and started crying.. 
It might be nothing important for you, but knowing your dad doesn’t believe in you and have you “low to his eyes”... that is something I won’t forget for a long time. 
I was always helping my dad with every job he had, I was there for everything he needed most of the times when I could.. and.. anyway.

Today he said that he couldn’t remember anything he said yesterday. I reminded him and he asked for forgiveness. I didn’t tell anything. I just told him that I’m close getting the degree and all i needed was your support, courage and hope to help me feel good while getting so much pressure from the study.

Guys, I’m on my lowest point right now. I had a goal to achieve so many things in my life by trying hard, giving my best! And now I feel like I need to prove him that I’m good. I don’t want that. I want to prove only to myself that knowledge is unlimited and i can be good to whatever I would like to spent my time on.

122,"I’ve always thought of myself as strong a strong person. I never accepted being bullied without fighting back, yet I felt bad even defending myself. I used to have a short temper as a child, but I quickly learned that being short tempered would just escalate my problems. I want to think of myself as someone who can get along with anyone. I’ve made peace with many people from different backgrounds by being calm and listening to what they have to say without ridiculing them. There was one thing I despised and that’s when people think it’s okay to hurt others.

I’ve always been the listener. When it was my turn to be listened to, I couldn’t find a person who would listen to me without judgment. However, today I think I found that person. That person is myself. Nobody knows me better than myself. I know I have flaws and I don’t mind criticizing myself. I’ve learned to take responsibility, even if honesty is not appreciated. Many people would tell you that they value honesty, but what’s honesty worth to the person being honest if all honesty does is get them in trouble that they wouldn’t otherwise be in? If you don’t want people to lie, don’t criticize them when they’re honesty.

I can’t speak for others experiences with confidence and self-esteem, but I think this is a thing that is highly influenced by the way we grew up. If we’re too confident, we could end up being arrogant or ignorant. On the other hand, no confidence leads us to be dependent on someone with more confident and to fall into depression. Our environment plays the biggest role in how much confidence we have. Often times, we know when we are under performing or not meeting expectations. For example, you know you’re not doing well in school when you’re not understanding what’s being taught or through the evaluation you’re receiving regarding your performance. How one deals with this feeling can vary. For example, some people might completely ignore it if there are no consequences. Others might lose some self-esteem for not meeting others’ expectations, such as their parents or for feeling inferior to their peers. The same applies when one gets constant rejection in job hunting or relationships. If all we do is point out the obvious and laugh, criticize or add more pressure on the person going through this hard time, we’re lowering their self-esteem.The more we do that the sooner we kill any self-esteem they have and lead them into depression, because you’ll be thinking why even bother going through the trouble if every attempt yields the same result?

Achieving goals raises one's confidence and self-esteem, which leads one to feel happy and satisfied. It leads to having a motivation to chase after bigger goals.  Motivation requires a reason, which is why often you’re asked about what motivates you to do something. We might lie about our motives, but we still have one. Motivation is the thing that drives you to keep attempting. Motivation is the fuel to go after goals that interest you. Motivation is what makes you tolerate the hardship on the way to your goals. I often ask myself “What really motivates me?” I find my answer regardless of the goal I’m trying to achieve to reflect the kind of self-esteem that I want. At the same time, I find my answer being influenced by my current confidence and self-esteem. With no confidence, I will doubt that my goals are achievable. With no self-esteem, I will not want to get hurt trying.

Taking a step out of depression is never easy and it’s an accomplishment in itself. Depression is like a maze. It doesn’t matter if you’ve escaped once, because each maze is different. Mustering enough confidence and self-esteem to keep going takes a toll on our will to live. It a mere hope that things can get better. Taking that away from a person is the cruelest thing you can do to them. You might as well be stabbing their heart with a knife. More often than not, the people closest to us are the cruelest, because we gave them our trust and made ourselves vulnerable to them. We’re limited by what’s available to us from birth. Some are born with options and others are forced to carve a path with whatever they have. Nobody gets to choose how they’re born and we barely get to decide how to live. Some have to try harder than others to achieve the same goal. Some may not even be allowed to achieve certain goals. It took me a long time to come to terms with these facts. Being told that you can only achieve so much because of how you were born is not motivating. Knowing that you have to work harder with little to no support and without seeing any rewards doesn't help either. Life is cruel.

I’m a fragile being. I’m not fragile by choice, but because all the odds are stacked against me. I’ve moved from one toxic environment to another, because I kept thinking “things will be different. Things will be better.” I kept blaming myself when things didn’t work out and destroying my own self-esteem. However, today I want to stand up for myself, because nobody will stand up for me. Today, I want to listen to myself. I want to tell myself that I’m not the problem and that I too deserve to be happy. I’ve already proved many people wrong with what I’ve accomplished. Most importantly, I’ve proved to myself that I have the potential if given the means, and nobody can take that from me. I’m already at a disadvantage. If you want to downplay what I’ve achieved, accuse me of not trying or prevent me from reminding myself that I’m a person who deserves a break for himself, you’re the problem. I’ve offered you nothing but support and I couldn’t get the same thing from you. No matter what mistake you make, I never make a big deal out of it. Yet, any small mistakes I make is an excuse for you to be toxic. You’re driving me to depression, but today, I want to take the wheel. If you don’t accept me as I am, then I can’t accept you as you are. Today, I won’t be bullied.

I might have to give up my dreams, but I’m keeping my confidence and self-esteem. I’m keeping the proud person I am today. Nothing is worth being treated like a slave. Nothing is worth being driven into depression. I’ve endured enough toxicity in my life and I don’t want any more of it. All I wanted was to be with you, but you tend to hurt the people around you. Today, I don’t want to be hurt, so I hope you can find someone who can tolerate you and make you happy, because I’m clearly not the one and I’ll never be good enough for you.",01Jan2020,1
123,"December 31st 2019

Today started out not like I thought it would. Two days before I planned to go to flagstaff to go snowboarding at snowbowl. I have the season pass and know a few others with it so I think I’ve already gone about 8 times. As you would think, I’m getting better every time too! 
When I initially planned to go today, I thought two friends would be joining me but one bailed and the other had a sick kid they had to take care. No worries, I’ve done plenty of day trips and many of those trips alone as well. I arrived at snowbowl the earliest I’ve ever been there, 30 minutes before lifts opened at 8:30am so I had plenty to time to take my time with getting ready and preparing lunch. On the first lift up Agassiz, I met a dude from Colorado on his way to Tucson just doing one run for the day. I offered to take him through the trees because he was unfamiliar and it went well! There’s so much powder and I love it! I like eating lunch around noon so I went up Agassiz about 5 more times, going through trees each time. I feel really comfortable with trees now and also with the terrain park. I can do all the boxes and now I’m even grinding rails, pretty awesome! 
For my last lift up before lunch, I decide I’d get a workout in and hike to the top of Humphreys. I don’t really have any issue working out on an empty stomach as I do it everyday for intermittent fasting plus I had like a full hydro flask of water before I got to the mountain. 
When I started my hike I saw two dudes about 2 minutes ahead of me so I quicken my pace so I’d have someone with me. I think it took about an hour to make it to the top and we took some pictures then had to decide where to bind up to board down. They continued to hike along with spine without me and I stayed to take more pictures and enjoy the view. By the time I was ready, they were probably a whole football field away. The spine was mostly downhill so I figured might as snowboard down and I did! It was pretty cool going along the spine with snowbowl on my left and some beautiful unknown bowl to my right. This continued until I came up to an uphill portion and had to take off the board to hike up. It was fairly hot and once I hiked up to see where I needed to go I decided to take off my jacket/gloves again. Upon taking off my gloves like I usually do (I have wrist straps so I basically throw them), one fell to the ground. Confused and surprised, I went for it. 
I take 2 steps towards the unknown side of the mountain. Boom! Ice! I’m sliding on the best slide in the world that no one ever wants to be on. In these moments, I didn’t see my life flash before eyes but I did think wow this simulation sucks. I estimate I slid about 50 ft down and I wasn’t shook too much. I was upset because now the rest of my day was ruined and now I’m cold. I really was positive it wouldn’t be issue hiking all the way so I even made sure to keep a good pace. I think I fell around 1:30-2pm and I wanted to see how fast I could get back to my belongings. Keep in mind, I didn’t have my jacket so this means I also didn’t have phone. I hike up, checking the time every break and by the time I can see my things adjacent to me it’s 3:30. In order to execute a snow hike, something I’ve never done. You must donkey kick your feet every single step of the way to make sure you can have balance to keep on stepping. Additionally, I have one hand in my pocket and the other in the captured glove using it to balance putting me into a side plank. Basically the stair master on steroids. I can see my things, but this means I am back where I started... the ice. I kick hard, but nothing. This is when I let out my first sign of surrender, “HEEEELLLLLP”. This isn’t a workout activity anymore this is my life. I kick again and there’s a dent. I take it and accept it. I’m side stepping back to my belongings and I’m feeling fully exhausted. This is it, I need it. I decide to kick it into overdrive and move quicker because I am hungry from being physically drained and most definitely parched beyond any means. More quicker means smaller holes for my boots to sit. This continues and I’m not effected. Kick! Slip! Wait what is happening?! I’m falling again. This time I resist less and it turns more into a tumble. I tumble past where fall from before ended, I slid over rocks, sharp ice, and even hit a tree! This is how I die, I think to myself. I stop. Lying in this miserable icy mountain, I yell out in pain, “HEEELLLLP”! I look at my hands, I can’t feel anything and can’t move anything. Yup my hands are broken! I look at my arms. My arms are covered in blood. At this point I’m thinking why can’t I just die. I’m in so much pain, I’m sore, hungry, need water, and I have to do this whole hike again twice as long or I freeze to death. This is when I decide every time I rest I will be yelling for help. This will do something right? This time going up I think strategically and head over to rock climb my way up. Periodically I release my hand from my pocket, gain some elevation, and perform my rest/yell for help. This begins at 3:30 and by the time is 4 I save my yells due to the resort being close and also just giving up. Using the rocks, I can climb higher than I was before but also I am done. I gave everything I had on the first hike. So now I have no energy and I’m injured making this by far the most I’ve ever pushed myself. The entire hike my breathe was heavy and rapid which concerned me and my face was numb. I gained feeling back in my hands after warming them up so thing we’re looking up. Whenever I stopped to rest, I got lighted headed and dizzy. But all I had to think about was how I made it this far so I’m not gonna freeze to death and die now. It’s 5:30 and I have an excellent view of my things. I am eating snow to hydrate and I think it’s actually working. Here comes the hardest part, leaving the rocks to side step along the incline to meet the spine again. This time I take my time. There can be no mistakes, I rest every single kick. I’m getting closer. Closer. Bang! Muscle cramp! The world is really testing me with this Charlie horse. I do not give up. Mind over matter. Kick! Kick! And finally l... I make it. I can’t believe it. I’m alive. I dress myself in my frozen gear, hike a bit to spot to board down and of course take a picture of the gorgeous sunset over snowbowl. Ok yes I’m alive and I have a solo sunset run down the mountain, but I am so much pain. My arms sting, my leg aches, and my body cries for nutrients. So sadly, I didn’t enjoy my run down. As I was getting into my car, I started to think what I was thankful for and just let the tears roll. I’m happy I’m strong enough to be here and thankful for everyone in my life.",01Jan2020,1

132,"I know nobody will see this and it’s gonna be messy. But I’ve just been thinking about it

Story 1:

Since last night was New Year’s Eve, I felt alone. Even tho I want. 

We are all 18. Except my friend In story 2 who is 17

I am 18, and have never taken a drink of anything. Or a hit of anything. But now that makes me “lame”. New Year’s Eve I felt I was the only one on social media that was sober and it kinda hurt. I know I will never drink anything, and I have my personal reasons. (Bad experiences earlier in life). I’m never one to shut down ones fun. I normally don’t give a shit. 

My girlfriend was with me yesterday. I paid $180 to go on a date with her. She said she enjoyed the hockey game I brought her too, but I’m pretty sure she didn’t. She was texting a lot. Then she said she wanted to spend all the time until midnight with my family and I. My sober family and I. I could tell she was getting bored cuddling, watching movies, eating, and the occasional make out/blowjob discretely since people were in the house. But Ik my girlfriend. She likes to drink. I’m never stopping her, but it just won’t be with me. My girlfriend is texting all her friends who are waiting on her. They’re playing beer pong, taking videos of them chugging everything. Hard Seltzer, beer, vodka, wine, literally you name it. They grow impatient and keep texting her to hurry up and stop hanging out with me. She stays until midnight. I kept telling her to leave and go have fun with her friends, but she declines. After midnight she kisses me goodbye and drives to her friends house. “Promises” me she’ll be safe. I don’t really know her friends that well. But Ik they love alc and nicotine and that sorta stuff. About 10 minutes later I see on her friends snap story (I have her on snap too) my gf arriving and they’re all yelling at her to get drunk with them. They sound angry, and to chug whatever she was given. I didn’t see the end, and she deleted it. I felt awful for some reason after that. I just felt angry. I knew she was gonna get so drunk. She slept over their house. With a bunch of other girls. And guys... hope she doesn’t hook up with them. 

But yeah. I know it’s her life and I don’t wanna control her. But I could tell she was gonna be drinking a lot. Her friends don’t know moderation. They’re the “girls” you see passed out and have to be taken to the hospital with alc poisoning. Whatever. 


Story 2: 

I’m obviously more introverted. I don’t really like talking to people. But I have some friends. Not necessarily best friends that I hang out with outside of school days/after school. But they’re chill. 

But my “best” friend who I’m closest with is changing. He started with Juuls and shit. Then he moved to Weed. He got addicted to weed. Smoking it every day. Before and after school, before practice, at home. He needed weed and to be high 24/7. I lost my friend with who he was. He became way more agitated after this. Hanging out with worse friends, always trying to get in fights, etc. Two nights ago he posts on his story that he’s gonna do crack. Oh no. I text him and ask what he means he goes “hehehe it’s fun. I have crack, weed, and alc in my system rn”. Damn. This was my boy. He’s been changed. We were supposed to go on a double date to the hockey game I talked about in story one. He never showed up. Or texted me that he was gonna cancel. I asked him the night before if he was still coming. And he said yes. He didn’t. His date didn’t. I saw him on Snapchat tho. Via snap maps. He was at home. Not responding to my texts. 


I don’t get why people feel the need to fill their body with drugs or alc. I’m not judging anyone tbh, but it’s to the point where it’s excessive and it frankly annoys me. I’ve been offered everything. I refuse every time. I’m not academically smart. I’m more athletic. But not a jock. I’m not popular, or talkative. I’m just in shape and like sports. Oh well. I’m more “lame” I guess. 


Sorry, I just needed to type my thoughts out somewhere. Thanks if anyone reads this whole thing. Even tho Ik nobody will.",01Jan2020,1

134,"I'm not the type of person to post these types of things - love reading others though - but i just wanted to share this because of how proud of me I am and to give you all some encouragement:

2019 really kicked me while I was still on the ground. I hit my complete rock bottom and was a wreck to say the least. I had been sexually abused and I turned to alchohol and drugs to cope. I was diagnosed with depression, cut myself multiple times and contemplated suicide at least once a week. I lost a lot of friends who couldn't/didnt want to stand by me through it. I started going to therapy for the first time in my life- twice a week.

But while I lost friends, I got really close with one or two that I wouldn't have imagined forming deep connections with. One of my best friends from high school got married and I got to stand by her side as a bridesmaid on her big day two weeks sober. I finished my first semester of my intense 1 year masters program with a 3.3/4.0 GPA. And most importantly, I'm still here today.

I spent new years alone this year for the first time ever and while the old me wouldve been insanely jealous of other people's wild parties and having friends to hang out with, I actually liked it. I liked being able to do my own thing and rest, just me myself and I. I'm currently out at Panera getting lunch with myself as I type this- my resolution to do whatever it is that makes me happy, whether others are with me or not.

For 2020 I just want to wish everyone happiness and to be able to feel content with themselves. Be proud of all your accomplishments big or small. I've had days when just showering was a big accomplishment for me- I know how hard it can be to do anything, to just get out of bed. But you are strong and you can do this. Hugs to you all ❤",01Jan2020,1
135,"Well friends, I don't know if I'm making it past the first day of 2020. To recap the past few months of my life: the end of July I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation. I was struggling horribly with my depression. Making statements daily I wanted to kill myself. I was actively medicated and in therapy. The next day, my boyfriend of 6 months dumps me. All within a couple days of my birthday. August I get ghosted by an eating disorder clinic, my binge eating gets worse, and I put on more weight. September, I again was experiencing intense suicidal ideations. October I start outpatient eating disorder treatment with the promise of impatient. November rolls around, I get ghosted again by the clinic and I've been about 2 months on my newest medications. Still extremely suicidal. December sucked. I've been on medical leave at the order of my psychiatrist and therapist. Still in outpatient. Still alone. Still doing everything I can for myself and not getting any better. 

I get this all sounds like a pity party. I have done everything for my mental health that's within my power. I chased that clinic down for a month trying to get the treatment I needed. I have been seeing my therapist twice a week, I have been on my meds. Seeing my psychiatrist when I have to. In outpatient 3 times a week. I just feel like I'm grasping at straws and nothing is sticking. I don't know what I can do anymore. I'm just done. I'm losing patience and strength. I have no idea why I'm writing this. I have a decently supportive family. And friends who care. But everytime anyone starts talking to me I just feel like I'm experiencing sensory overload. I can't handle it. I don't know how to make things better for myself. My therapist keeps saying that we have to find the right medication. I'm on my 5th round and nothing is helping. I've also switched psychiatrists. I'm really trying my best. I'm not sure what to do, fellow internet strangers. 

Part of me says maybe I should try to keep pushing through 2020. Find a different treatment center for my summer break from college. I have a couple things to look forward to. The other part looks in the mirror and tells me I don't deserve to see the next day, week, month or year.",01Jan2020,1

**I’m aware how dumb this question sounds.**  
  
The thing is all my life I just sort of *had* plans to choose from without any effort. I had two close best friends but from different friend groups. (They weren’t close with each other) Three siblings, and then friends from school.   
  
I’ve recently graduated college, but at some point in college I stopped having friends.   
  
One best friend moved away, and I’m no longer close or comfortable around the other.   
  
Then my siblings have moved away/become more entwined with their friend groups so I’m sort of a third wheel if I tag along. Sometimes I do anyway, other times I’m not even invited. (That’s normal, but I’m saying I hang out with them less than before)  
  
**So that leaves me with no friends in this state, and siblings who are usually too busy to hang out. **  
  
Perfect example is last night. My brother was working and the other two had plans I couldn’t (and didn’t even want to) tag along to. I ended up hanging at home with my parents which was fine. What bothered me is I couldn’t help but notice it was not only my only option, but I didn’t even know *who* I would’ve texted to find something to do.   
  
  
The only thing I could think of was texting random friends from college (who I haven’t seen since at least May) and just seeing if they were going out. It felt desperate and maybe sort of rude?   
  
Its been so long since I’ve had multiple healthy/strong relationships with people in state that I don’t even know how to go about inviting people out, and I know people already had New Years plans for example.   
  
Also I just don’t have much to offer, can’t really have people over at my parents for a host of reasons, and I wasn’t sure what else to invite someone to do.  
  
Tl;dr: no friends, no plans, no idea how to remedy that.",01Jan2020,1
137,"I went to Austin with my two brothers to celebrate New Year's. I have a gf that I've been with for almost 3 years. Recently my gf and I had sex with different people and realized we were okay with being open with new people. So honestly I was kind of expecting to meet someone while I was out for new years. That is until my gf sends me a semi-jokey text yesterday that I shouldn't kiss anybody for new years. But then my fucked up drunk and horny self kisses a guy at midnight. I don't follow up with him and I just go back to the hotel with my brothers. Then when I'm walking to my room... a guy and this girl  wave me down and tell to come over.... I do... I am so fucked up about this. There was a man, a woman and a trans woman. I'm so drunk and guilty at this point I think because they would blow me and I would spend a while fucking the girl but I couldn't get hard. I feel weird but I end up blowing the guy for some fucking reason. I've never given a blowjob, idk why I would do something so stupid. He cums in my mouth, I try to fuck the girl again but still won't get hard. I leave, smoke a cigarette, take a shower, pass out in my room. Now I'm on my way back home with my brothers feeling disgusted with myself and filled with dread and angst. Don't know how to talk to my gf now.

148,"This is kinda long, but I want to get it out. I grew a pretty decent friend group in college, as I was pretty outspoken in class. We'd have get together's at my place, go to movies, and have LAN parties, usual nerdy college friend stuff. I liked them all, but I grew the closest to one I'll call Duke. Duke was the most level guy I knew, and was a good solid ground if I got too depressed. He was at my house nearly everyday, a lot of the time even slept over, my place was basically a second house to him. I soon realized he was the best thing in my life. 10 months ago he died in a car crash.

&amp;#x200B;

The two people I want to kill were in the friend group. They're a couple, I'll call them Adam and Jesse. My problems with them started two years ago, me and Adam shared the same job, so we'd see each other a lot and became closer as friends. I think that closeness is what started me realizing they're weren't good people. One time on break I asked if they could clean their house and if I could help, he responded by threatening to kill me, then Jesse texted me saying I was an asshole and never to insult them again. Mind you, it wasn't just 'Day old McDonalds cups sitting around', a closer definition would be some of the rooms on NeckbeardNests, but the whole house. I'll add that I'm really bad at confrontation, so not wanting to lose them as friends and feeling bad that I insulted them I offered to pay for books that Jesse needed for school, Adam had brought up that they were always low on money and didn't have enough for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Later I got a girlfriend, a friend of Jesse's. But for me, managing work and a girlfriend wasn't possible at the time. It ended on a day I was feeling super down, I was staying the night at her place and couldn't sleep because I was so upset, gf didn't like that and and we had an argument all night, me trying to explain it wasn't her fault I was depressed, and her claiming she knows what I'm doing, ""Just using depression to run away from problems"". She broke up with me a few days later over text. In that time I tried to get advice form Jesse and Adam on how to handle things and, admittedly, validate how I feel. I was expecting Jesse to be to be somewhat defensive since she was her friend, but was incredibly upset at me. Being already in a state of depression, their lack of compassion toward how I felt hit me hard. I lost my job and lost contact with them after Adam threatened to kill me if I didn't stop talking to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to 10 months ago. A bit before Duke died I'd been trying to reconnect with Adam and Jesse, stupid yeah, but I'm a stubbornly caring guy, so stuff like that bothers me. And then it happened, a few hours later I was at the hospital and got a call from Jesse, saying that her and Adam ""loved"" me and that they're sorry about Duke. A few days later I suggested that all us in the friend group hang out, just to shoot the s\*\*\*. Since Duke was usually at my place, it would've brought up memories, so we decided to have it at Adam and Jesse's. I was supposed to be happy seeing everyone again and hanging out, but I just couldn't get over how A and J they treated me. Knowing they wouldn't apologize or bring it up I just left. I got a text from Jesse, ""We should just forget about it, move on"", I took that as ""We don't want to take responsibility for being terrible"". Later they'd agreed to go see a movie and invited me, I said screw and went, maybe I could just look past it, but in the lobby, in front of the rest of my friends in front of several people Jesse basically told me again, ""Move on, forget what happened in the past. Being un-confrontational I silently agreed and we all watched the movie, the whole time I was mulling over how they were acting, and how they got all of the rest of the friend group to side with them. It really burned.

&amp;#x200B;

After the movie I had to drive, I usually did it to get my mind off things, but it didn't help. I'd just lost the guy I could call my best friend, almost a brother, and these two were still doing they're underhanded, manipulative games. I went to their house, knocked on the door and told them that we needed to sort this out in person, the three of us sit down and talk about stuff, I just wanted to get that closure. Later I git a lot of hate texts from the other friends, ""You gave Jesse a panic attack"", ""She's super scared"". Adam told me to never talk to them again and filed a restraining order. So everyone thinks I'm a crazed lunatic and have no way to convince my other friends otherwise. I was alone at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to the Duke's funeral. I hadn't spoken to anyone for a few weeks before it, so I came in pretty angered, but what pushed me over the edge was seeing Adam and Jesse outside the church laughing with my other friends. I know it wasn't at Duke or at me, but seeing them happy after all the things they did and how I felt just broke me. I didn't talk to anyone at the funeral, didn't make eye contact, just sat there in a rage crumpling the funeral pamphlet in my hand. I was walking out and stopped at his car, just stared at it for a while then kicked in the rearview mirror and kicked some dents into the door, they came outside as I was walking off, called Jesse and Adam harsh names. I 100% admit that that wasn't the right choice, it scarred Duke's family and most likely cemented in my other friend's mind that I was crazy, but dammit if it wasn't the most satisfied I felt in a long time. I got an arrest warrant, had to pay $300, and I'm still on probation for a few months. I didn't go to the court hearing, I knew if I saw them again I'd fly off again.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, I've cut ties with all my friends that didn't cut them with me, even with my mom who, in my eyes, was in defense of Adam and Jesse. I don't trust people, and can't stand the thought of making new friends or any other relationship. Added on to that, Everytime I see their actual names, see someone's face in a movie that vaguely looks like theirs, see someone getting married, are boyfriend of girlfriend, or see any Halo related(Adam was a huge fan), or any other number of small insignificant things that vaguely remind if them I get in a terrible mood. I've lost days of sleep to that, sometimes a few in a row.

&amp;#x200B;

I've convinced myself that the only way to get closure to any of this is to hurt them, and since I've been alone with my thoughts for a while hurt has turned into considering murder. I think I'd actually do it if anything else traumatic happens in my life, like I'd just become dead to how others feel. I would not care about the consequences. I've already convinced myself that my death would be a little consequence, it would save money, and my family is emotionally distant. The only things stopping me is the well-being of my dog, who's 17, and funnily enough The Last of Us 2. I had a therapist but like I said, I can't trust people. But I am on depression medication.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice? Questions? Thoughts? I may not take it well, but shoot anyway. I just want to be happy again. Thanks",01Jan2020,1
149,"So, last night was the first time I was single on NYE since 2010, and I'll be honest it was really strange. I felt alone, without my best friend there beside me to celebrate it with.

Still, I can't help but think the relationship won't work out, and I think for the first time in a long time I'm coming to terms with that. She just wasn't happy taking care of both my depression and her depression, and it took a large toll on her physically and mentally.

I spent today hiking and reading, and I actually ate fruit for the first time in a few weeks, so I feel somewhat better just from my decisions alone. I'm still on the no soda train that I started last year, so I'm pushing 1+ year on that and it feels awesome to accomplish something like that. As far as reading goes, I'd like to double my books finished list from 4 to 8 this year, so I'll need to put down the video games and pick up the books more. Speaking of, I'm going to try to limit my gaming time this year as I think that's had a severe impact on my career development as well as my emotional development. I don't think video games are awful; I love getting a group together and playing Mario Kart or other co-op based games, and I even created a website to talk about my favorite indie titles that don't see much mainstream success, but I can't help the feeling that my life would be radically different if I had put down video games for a number of years and really dedicated myself to my income and my personal health.

As far as things between her and I stand, I don't know what's going to happen. But, I hope that no matter what she and I remain friends and can find happiness, either with each other or on our own. I just can't imagine life without her in some capacity, in the same way that I can't imagine life without some of my closest friends.",01Jan2020,1
151,So I’ve been friends with this person for a few months and we get along good and have similar interests and he seemed really happy to see me when we hang out he came to one of my choir performances which I considered to be special to me. So this friend came over Friday and seemed to have a good time but the very next day he says he doesn’t want to be friends anymore because we’re incompatible. I’m afraid his girlfriend might be jealous of me but I don’t know for sure yet. Yes I have a crush on him and this was really dumb but I told his girlfriend I had a crush on him and she was lucky and that I was happy for them.,01Jan2020,1
153,"It was a long time coming and pretty mutual. We dated for a year and it was good at first but as it went on it became evident we weren’t that great of a match. I like computers, video games, anime, sports, and she likes sitcoms, movies, clothes, dancing. We compromised and found things to do together,  but eventually ran out of things to do, and grew distant.

We also both have depression and it strained the relationship further. Most days I could tough it out and I would try to help her wake up on time, but she would sometimes rudely tell me to let her sleep. Many times when she was really depressed she would depend on me to take her to the grocery store, because she didn’t like going by herself. No big deal, but she wouldn’t be very clear about telling me when she needed to go and would be a little disappointed if I went by myself. She also didn’t have a job this year, and anytime we went out I usually paid for her. She just got used to it and eventually stopped asking and stopped saying thank you. Made me feel like was being taken advantage of.

Also we had dinner with her family a few times, and one time her cousin was there. He was one of the rudest people I’ve ever met and was insulting me and her the  entire dinner, and her family just watched. It was infuriating. She apologized, but it gave me a bad taste in my mouth for family gatherings with her. 

She invited me to be a part of her family’s secret Santa this year, but by this point there was some distance between us, and the last time I was with her family was miserable so I was honest with her and told her I would rather not. She wasn’t happy about it.

I admit I wasnt the greatest at talking about my feelings when I felt something was wrong. In my defense (but not an excuse) it was because I didn’t know how she would react. I had brought up problems a few times before and sometimes she would react well and say she would work on them but sometimes she would say “it feels like you don’t want me here” and start crying. Cue me having to comfort her and stop talking about my needs.

This morning she asked to get coffee and brought up that she thought we should break up. I’d been thinking the same for a while but the holidays complicated things and she beat me to the punch. We talked it through and agreed to break up but a few things she said just rubbed me the wrong way. “A year in I don’t think you should be too anxious to see my family, and I don’t think communication should be an issue.” And “as a friend, I think you should try not to let your anxiety control you.” That just made me feel so unappreciated, like all my efforts to help her and be kind to her went unnoticed, and that from her perspective she was leaving because of my problems. I felt like the whole focus was on my problems. There was no “I have my own things to sort out, but I can’t help you with your problems and need to focus on mine.” It was just I’m leaving because you have problems.

Idk what I’m trying to say. I just feel like she dodged responsibility for the relationship ending and put a lot of it on me. I tried expressing that I felt there were things she could have done better too but she didn’t really respond to it. I’m glad it’s over. It needed to end. But I feel aggravated and unsatisfied at how it ended.

I hate the concept of picking sides and bashing your ex after a breakup, and I don’t think anyone is “the bad guy” here. But I still just feel a little unsatisfied and have feelings un-expressed. 

Life is complicated sometimes.

Sorry for the wall of text. Just needed to put this out there somewhere and don’t feel like I have a close enough friend to tell this to.

Tl;dr: gf and I broke up. Feel like she didn’t really appreciate me and only saw my problems, and ignored her own. I felt like we both had some issues and tried to acknowledge that.",01Jan2020,1
154,"Kind of an oxymoron title but hear me out for a second.

What if we develop ourselves by learning about others? By sharing our time with others. Less Netflix and more social development by going out for lunch with the billing group from work. Maybe a small latte ( extra sugar) with your brother in law?  A walk around at Walmart a Thursday night with the purpose of saying ""good evening"" to everyone you encounter. Maybe asking that cute neighbor if she and that noisy chihuahua she has to come with you and your pooch for a walk out in the parking lot. 

 For a more socially active 2020, less Netflix more humans!",01Jan2020,1

I [F, 25] turned 25 this past year and it definitely caused me a bit of a quarter life crisis, but besides for that, I realized how time fast was going in my life. I started to think about aging and life and how long it would last for me and my loved ones. With it turning 2020, I feel like time is running out and I’m scared. I’m scared of people I love getting older and not being around at some point. I’m scared of how fast time is going and I don’t really know what to do. I’m scared about the fact that we don’t treat our earth right and the climate is changing so much. I’m scared thinking about whether or not I should bring in kids into a world like this even though I really want kids. I feel like my heart is too big and I worry so much and I’m just nervous. A huge part of me is incredibly excited for the next decade of my life, the next chapter, but I’m also so scared. Is anyone else feeling the same way? Does anyone else feel more self aware of time? How are you dealing with it all? Any words of wisdom will help. Thank you! 

TLDR: I’m scared about how fast time is going. Looking for tips on getting through this!",01Jan2020,1

I know it can be a downer to pull those skeletons out of the closet when life is good, but the best time to face them is when you have the energy and feel good.

If you know you’ve had mental health issues in the past, and you have the means, see a therapist while you can.

&amp;#x200B;

So, context here. I've had a date recently with a guy I met on a dating app. I wasn't expecting much but we ended up spending a great night talking and doing adult stuff. But the talking was really great and deep so I really appreciated this man's company.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I just recently got out of a really meaningful relationship and I absolutely don't want to get into another one for the moment. I enjoy this person's company but I don't miss him when I'm alone, like I would if I had any more feeling.

Now it's getting into the adult stuff part. We spent a lot of time on foreplay and after a while I asked him if he had condoms. He said yes but he said he doesn't like using them because it hurts him and he really doesn't feel okay with having one on. He didn't ask me to do it this way, he just gave me the info, it was my full choice.

I refused to take the risk and we went on and he finally decided to put one on.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later we met again me it was more chill, I just came over with some work and he has some to do too and we talk some more. And also a bit of foreplay again.

He still says he doesn't like putting on condoms at all when we talk about this. And I know he sees other women, and we are not exclusive so it's totally fine. At one point he told me about another girl he has been seing for longer and we ended up talking quiet a lot about her because she is fragile and he is worried for her. At one moment, I ask him if she agreed to go unprotected (beause I'm still a bit shoked to learn it was so common to do it this way outside of an exclusive relationship) and he tells me she is okay with that and they did it the very same morning. This girl would talk to him a lot by messages, that's why she was such a recurrent topic.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up staying for the night because I hurt my foot pretty badly when I was to his place and he insisted on me not staying alone and not walking at the moment.

As our conversation went on during the night, he got a bit more graphic about his relationship with this girl and I grew a bit upset (it was really late at this point) because he didn't seem interested in touching me. I finally told him to shush because it made me feel uncomfortable hearing so much and he apologized.

Today he told me about him preparing to have a girl coming by and I felt upset again about it.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that I don't understand why I'm feeling this way. I don't want to get into a relationship and I don't feel like I'm intersted in him in this way but I feel so upset. Is it because of my ego ? I have had self estime issue during highschool because of me not being desirable and it's still something that I feel from time to time. Or maybe I grew more attached to him than I think ? Also maybe I'm mistaken because he was just being an actual human by not trying to have sex with me while my foot was badly hurt. And the talking was pretty deep most of the time (when it wasn't about this woman).

Or is it just a normal thing to feel offended about hearing so much about the sex life of a man I am seeing too ?

I'm sorry about this post being so messy. I really would like to know why I feel so self-conscious about all this.

I've cried too much today, and just couldn't find any joy in my birthday the other day either knowing this was coming. Recently left my job of 3 years as well, and starting classes in a few weeks.  Find myself missing my coworkers, but not sure if we were close enough for me to reach out or if that would just be weird. I think it's just a lonely patch until classes start and life gets busy again. I wish I had a friend I could just call to come over though.  Could really use a hug.

Side note: sometimes when he gets to talking I'll blow on his ear to wake him up because talking to him will just get absorbed into whatever he's talking about. 

Let's see. I'll take this straw and this other straw and attach them like then. Add a little bendy part and put it cock-eyed in my mouth and voila! Delicious side air! \*Takes deep breath\* Its so good! How's that nasty air, mon love? Full of car exhaust and cigarette smoke. I'm just enjoying this delicious side air! MmmmmMmmm. (At that point, I was tired and wanted to sleep so I started blowing in his ear.) Ahhh! ASMR! I need a lot of oxygen to deal with this. \*Begins breathing rapidly\* It's not enough! Bigger straw? Pipe? No, the only way is...no. But I have no choice. \*Takes huge breath\* Ewww! It's so nasty! No! I want delicious side air! Nooooooo!",01Jan2020,1
