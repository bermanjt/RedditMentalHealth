0,"How could you be a Slytherin and not be evil? It doesn't make any sense! Then I had kids. Well I found some and kept them I guess.

I'm a 40 year-old man and I have two adopted daughters, 14 and 12. They are very different from one another, but both somewhat similar to me in complex ways. The oldest one reminds me of who I am now, confident, capable, hard working. The youngest one reminds me of who I was growing up, bookish, anxious, no confidence, quick to cry, just generally a nervous little wreck. I love them both more than I ever thought I could love anything. I never wanted kids, I even ended a serious relationship over the topic once. I ended up with two kids and she never had any.

They've been with me since they were 3 and 5 and I've loved watching them grow up but I've often been baffled by the little one. She does things I would never do, asks questions I would never ask, just generally thinks in a way completely dissimilar to the way I think. I understand her emotional side very well, she's so gentle and easy to hurt and hurts deeply. I understand that, I was like that, but I don't understand her intellectual side at all. How she processes information or how she reaches conclusions makes no sense to me. And as she's grown I've realized she's a Slytherin.

If the oldest one sees a mess on the floor she will clean it up, partly because she's tidy by nature but she also likes to avoid getting in trouble or having to do work at inconvenient times because I noticed it and interrupted her. The little one will do exactly as she is told, no more but occasionally less, and will do it slowly and drag it out, making a 5 minute task into a 30 minute agonizing chore.

But that's not the Slytherin part. The Slytherin part is that if her sister helps her, she won't thank her. ""I didn't ask for help Vannah, I don't have to say thanks.""

""Well then I won't help you next time.""

""Yes you will and I won't ask then either.""

To me this entire conversation is insane. Someone just assisted you with work, thank them, show gratitude, maybe next time they'll do even more and you can do even less! But no, that isn't her concern. She did not request help and so will not thank you for it. She will even taunt you about next time, and what's more bizarre, she really doesn't care if you help or not. It engenders no favor with the little one to do something she did not ask you to do. You gain no karma for unrequested kindness and she most certainly owes you nothing in return.

This is very different from me, and very different from her sister. For us a favor done, ask or not, is a favor owed. I won't allow myself to be taken advantage of, you can't do me some small kindness and then request a large sacrifice, but I appreciate help and am always thankful and gracious and I do feel a need to repay that debt at some point.

Now I have no problem with my youngest feeling the way she does. In fact we had a discussion about it tonight when the older one ask her to do a chore for her and the little one refused. A large argument about ""all I do for you"" occurred and eventually ended up in front of me for judgement.

In my infinite wisdom I turned this into a parenting moment and explained to the little one that failure to appreciate such gestures and reciprocate might have adverse effects in the future and I told the older one that she needed to learn now not to be an ""over-giver"", as I have often been, and to learn when to recognize the kind of person who will not return your favors and let them be. I did not attempt to change either child, but I did explain to the little one that I feel like the sense of cooperation her sister has will make life easier in the long run.

Is this all my Slytherin justification consists of? Why no, it is not. You see she also has plans, and plans within plans, sneaky little thoughts and tiny little loopholes. Ways of thinking that creep up on me and surprise me with twists I don't see coming. Here's a fun one:

We went to an all girls charity Jiu-Jitsu tournament (back when the world made sense) and while there she saw a hoodie she wanted. It had a female ""Warrior Angel that's so cool!"" I told her to go ask how much it was and she returned looking forlorn as I ask ""How much?""

""Mmixtee""

""Sixteen?""

""Sixty.""

""Oh. I think you know that's too much."" and here began the bargaining. This jacket was spotted around 10am, we didn't go home until 6. She was well behaved and careful not to push any one attempt too far, but she was determined to find a way. Old deals, past favors, promises of future work, anything you can think of she tried, but was rebuffed. It was a cheap hoodie with a badly applied image that had too much ink and made the jacket stiff. It was going to crack and peel immediately and I wasn't paying 60 dollars for it.

So finally the day wraps up and she is staring longingly across the room at the jacket. ""Uncle Sam?"" she says, wistfully in a voice that has clearly given up all hope of ever being happy again. ""Could I have had the jacket if it was 30 dollars?"" I sit with this thought a moment and decide there is a teaching opportunity here. She can go try to negotiate the price down, no matter what happens it will be good experience, so I reply ""Yes, since you were so good all day I'd probably pay 30 dollars for the jacket, do you want to go ask if---"" SHE LEAPS FROM HER SEAT, SPINNING MID-AIR TO FACE ME AND BREATHLESSLY SPITS OUT THE WORDS IN ONE LONG UNBROKEN STREAM:

""I have that 10 dollars I found on the floor at the store and 20 dollars left from my Christmas money and I will give it to you as soon as we get home if you let me buy the jacket!!!!!!!"" the look on her face tells me she might die if I say no, so I reach for my wallet, outsmarted by a 10 year-old. The only size they had would have been too big even for her sister but she wore that thing every moment of her life for months.

Still not Slytherin enough? Well I saved my favorite for last: The girls have to trade cooking and dishes. The youngest hates cooking and so always has to do the dishes. However once a week she is required to cook dinner and cannot trade for dishes duty (she must learn some basic cooking skills!). Her immediate response to this was to order dinner from Uber Eats with her allowance/holiday/birthday savings. I allowed this as a lesson about using money foolishly and soon enough she ran out, but that's a different story. Before she ran out she had ordered dinner on her cooking night 4 weeks in a row. I absentmindedly mention to her, ""I guess your sister is never going to have to wash any dishes since you always order takeout.""

Thirty minutes later when the food arrives the youngest one begins to serve us. I'm eating at the computer because it's Friday night and I'm playing Among Us with some friends. I hear a lot of bickering so I take off my headphones and listen ""NO ONE NEEDS A PLATE FOR THEIR FRIES!"" yells the oldest, ""I'm cooking, I get to serve my way!"" retorts the little one.

Soon my food is brought to me. I'm expecting a burger in a styrofoam box, but no. It's on a plate, with utensils, on a tray. With a seperate plate for the fries and small glass bowls containing ketchup and mayo on the side. Drinks have been poured out of their delivered cups and into glasses. Vegetables for your burger are carefully arranged on a saucer (I think she took them OFF the burger to put them on the saucer!) She has used as many dishes as would accompany a formal dinner party to serve burgers and fries and she has, wherever possible, chosen to use things that must be hand washed. Her sister is furious about the hour worth of dishes she will have to do on a Friday night. I later found out she also cut the burgers with my good knives and scooped the fries out with a serving spoon to put them on their plate.

I could go on with her antics and seemingly self-harming willfulness but this is already unimaginably long so I'll wrap up here. I love this child without condition and she is a kind and wonderful person. Funny, loving, thoughtful to a fault, quick to help and never cruel or unkind to anyone. There is nothing I would change about her at all, but I do not understand her mind. She delights me with her clever little schemes and her jokes, and she infuriates me with her lies by omission and her deceptive answers, but I've learned to appreciate her and she's made me not only a more whole person but one who better understands the world and the way others see it and that is an invaluable gift.

4,"A little info about myself. I'm really into doing things for people. I like to go all out for birthdays and holidays and what not. Well I'm feeling kind of low today..and I'm the first to say ""don't expect yourself from others because it leads to disappointment"" but apparently I'm also not very good at the practice what you preach thing. I was mildly hoping for some form of effort from my husband as its my birthday. Our wedding anniversary was last month and I did something for him although I didn't have funds. I made a homemade card, I put in effort and did what I could. Got nothing in return but a verbal ""happy anniversary to you too"" ya know? I told him how I felt. That I was maybe hoping for a little effort. So I guess my feelings are just hurt feeling like this less than a month later. I feel like I put my all in to show my love, affection and appreciation but it's one sided. My feelings are just super hurt right now, we've been together since 2012 and married since 2016.

Apparently most people who are opposed to mask wearing seem to be into conspiracy theories, pseudoscience and other forms of fake news.

During the protests in HK, there was a discussion about new technologies allowing for better facial recognition of protesters. So, to put this conspiracy theory mindset to good use, wouldn't it be interesting to make people wear masks under the pretence that they are also protecting themselves and their privacy from the government? 

They wear masks, helping slow down the pandemic, while in their heads, they're fighting the ""establishment"". Besides, from what I can see, it seems most of the people who don't support mask wearing are also Rep, so it's even more likely the would want to ""protect"" themselves from the now president elect.",10Nov2020,1

13,"tl;dr - I asked eBayer to sell me an item locally so that I could skip on delivery charges, but then I asked him to deliver it to me (or refund) because eBay lied about the location - it's *not* in my city, it's in a town outside of my city.  Embarrassed and ashamed I couldn't resolve the issue.

---

I just bought an item on eBay.  It was a local listing, listed as being in my city.  I sent the seller a message and after some back and forth about forgoing shipping, and them editing their listing for me, I bought the item.  I bought the item with the intention of local pickup, since it's it the same city. 

Except it isn't.  eBay lied to me.  It's actually in a small town on the edge of my city.  That's a problem for me because I don't drive.  It would take me hours to walk there and hours to walk home.  Public transportation doesn't go there.  I can't afford a taxi.  I don't have any friends or family who can give me a ride.

I feel like such a loser. 

I had a ride arranged for tonight.  I could have gone and picked it up tonight, but the guy said that it wasn't possible tonight and that he'd leave the item on his front porch in the morning.  I won't be at his front porch in the morning.  Ebay said the item was in my city, but it's actually a 10 minute drive past city limits, and I have no way to get there without walking for hours.

I told him that unless he can deliver to me in my city, that I would need to request a refund.  After he went out of his way to lower the price of an item, to change a listing's pickup options, etc.  All of that back and forth, only for me to ask him to deliver it or send me a refund. I really want the item, but I can't justify spending money on travelling to pick it up, and it's further than I'd like to ask anyone to drive me since it's literally outside of the city. 

If I could drive, I would have no problem.  If I had friends, I could ask for help.  If I had a job, I would be able to afford a taxi, but then again, if I had that much money I wouldn't be buying this ultra-cheap piece of junk that I can't even fucking pick up.  So embarrassed.  I feel like a complete failure in life.  I can't even fucking arrange a simple pickup without embarrassing myself, without causing a hassle for everyone else involved.  It happens like this every fucking time I try to do anything.  It's so infuriating.

Now I'm here wondering if he's ignoring me.  I'll probably have to ask eBay to step in and get me my refund, since I doubt this guy will waste any more time on me for a measly $40 item. Ugghh I hate myself.  Fuck everything about life. This hell never ends.",10Nov2020,1

31,"Today, I was looking back on photos from my time in college, which was just 5 years ago, as I had an idea to make a scrapbook of memories for one of my best friends who lives quite a ways away. Nearly every time I hung out with my friends, I snapped a photo of us. I snapped silly photos of my friends, just hanging out like normal. And I’m beyond thankful I did. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me, but I’ve come to realize my memory just isn’t right. I don’t remember doing the things in these photos. I see them, and recognize them, and know I did them, but I have no ability to recall those memories, no ability to know what it was like to be the person in those photos. If I didn’t have these pictures, I’d have no recollection of the best times of my life. The only things I’d remember are stories my friends have told. And now that I’m out of college, and well into my career and a relationship, I realized I stopped taking the photos a couple of years ago. And thinking back, there’s just not much I remember. I know the things I did and when I did them, but just don’t remember living them. I don’t remember what the places looked like, I don’t remember my partners’ face while we were making memories, I don’t remember the things I used to, like art on the walls, or smells, or sounds. And now I don’t have photos of those things, so it’s only a matter of time until they’re lost forever. I look at these photos, see the girl in them that I know is me, but I have no idea who she is, I don’t remember her at all. I don’t think the scrapbook will happen, because I just don’t remember anything behind the photos.

My boyfriend brought it up to me a few days ago and I’m overjoyed!!!! The reason I know about it was so that we could be on the same page, we hadn’t discussed it being so soon before. But we’ve decided, we genuinely think each other is the one. We’re so in love. He’s going to do it sometime near Christmas because that’s when he’ll be home! I know he’s doing it but idk when so it’s still a surprise!

41,"Americans don't understand how their own election process works. Democrats have played the game ""president elect"" right on the eve of the electoral college, which completely ignores that elections are only certified by congress in January, specifically on the 6th of 2021 when any objections go through right before inauguration. The reason why the period exists is because of checks and balances to make sure there's no fraud, congress certifies each state and then the election winner becomes president elect on no objections.

What I'm seeing from a lot of people is that they are bickering, fighting, name-calling and acting like complete idiots over the electoral college results. To me that's nuts. For such a tolerant side, the Democrats, I've seen nothing but vitriol ans stupidity, listening to a media which does not decide who wins an election.  Republicans have the right to go to court over objections and the deadline is January, which has always been American tradition for the process. I think the Republicans tend to be cult-like and believe that Trump will win every supreme court case in each state, which is probably not possible as some cases have been thrown out.

What happens if the Democrats win? Republicans are talking about using their guns and going into the streets, some may accept it and sit smugly believing that the Senate is secure and the House now is automatically majority Republican. What happens if the Republicans win? Democrats are already rushing the gun and desperately making fun of people, and will ball their eyes out like infantile children if they lose, if not protest/riot. There's no winning in this kind of nuts tribalist attitude that Americans have.

..

 If Biden wins, it's business as usual of middle eastern wars and selling out the country. Believing that a politician is going to implement all your wishes is stupid. How much times can Americans keep electing people believing everything the politician tells them and keep falling for the same thing over and over again? If Trump wins, it's probably going to be a war in East Asia and selling out the country to the billionaires. There's not much of a choice there. Except what I'm seeing is political tribalism, a lack of understanding in your own election system, and the inevitable riots and fighting.

There isn't a side that is good. Both sides think they are good but believe in political violence against the other. That kind of system is only going to lead to violence.",10Nov2020,1

43,"Online classes.

Home no longer feels like relief after a long day. Do you remember? Walking through the door, shrugging off your backpack, pressing your face into the cushiony couch. I don’t even need to wear a backpack for my books anymore. Home is no longer the place I go to decompress. To get away from the world for a little while. Now, home is school, and school now is home. And I cant get away from either one. 

I graduated high school last year. I didn’t mind the rather solitary summer I spent (social distancing). I worked on myself. I made crafts, read for myself for the first time in four years, exercised, spent time with my family, ate well, journaled, even caught up with old and current friends via video chat and the occasional in-person meeting with masks. I picked up good habits. But somehow, college started and it fell apart. 

I spend most of my day at home since classes are all online. Freshman year is a bit lonelier than I’d thought it’d be. Friends away at college, friends that I always have to reach out to first, friendly classmates whose faces I have never seen. But I’m trying to do well. I’m eating well, drinking water, working out, calling friends. I definitely started out strong and yet began to falter in my focus. I can tell it’s not enough when my mind wont concentrate on my work. When I keep procrastinating and, instead of finishing things right before the deadline, I turn assignments in late. I don’t do that. But now, I guess, I do. 

My life is fine and ok. I’m not drowning in my mind—I know what that feels like—and I’m not dealing with external financial or family issues. I’m really trying to cope with this one change of not physically going to school. The change of not spending the day with friends and peers, having that community, participating in club and leadership opportunities, talking to teachers (now professors) in person, and being in a school environment to help me focus when i work. And while I’m getting through it, I’m really not doing well, even if I’m doing ok. And its ok for me to want to do well. It is! And I do want to do well mentally, physically, and academically. I want to really badly because for once I know what I want to study, even if I don’t have a specific career in mind. I know what I need to do to get there and I know I need to do well in school right now! I want to put in the effort! I want to succeed! And I want to these things all the more because I haven’t always wanted anything in particular like this for myself. 

And I’ll get by, I know. And other people have it much worse, I know. And this will pass, I know. And somehow I’ll figure out how to get my mind to get its shit together, I sure fucking hope. It’s just hard. You know? And it’s hard when home now is school, and school now is home. And home is not relief after a long day, but the long day itself. Where do I go now to decompress? I can’t seem to get away.

In conclusion, my socially anxious idiot self has to get out of the house more often even if it’s intimidating. Not that deep. Also I need to sleep more bcoz I’m pretty sure that’s messing me up for real. Sleep is godly and when you’re sleep deprived you tend to greatly underestimate how sleep deprived you are. Lovely.

It helps just to put it out there. Maybe someone will feel this. And if not, no biggie, I got other things to worry about like that deadline I missed the other day and that message I just got from my professor saying how that assignment is mandatory for the class! Pls don’t drop me from the class Professor I’ll turn it in soon ahhhhh",10Nov2020,1

49,"My mom passed away on Friday after years of illness. She was only 59 but contracted Covid in October. With her death, I've now lost two members of my immediate family in less than two years, as my younger brother committed suicide in March of last year. My mother and I had a troubled relationship, as she was emotionally manipulative and something of a control freak, and we hadn't had a real conversation in months. I feel bad saying that I have a sense of relief, but I know that I'm going to get a gut punch when I go tomorrow to see her at the funeral home. With my brother, that initial view at the funeral home was devastating, and I am expecting the same with mom tomorrow.

It seems like an awful lot of loss for such a short period of time. I can't help but blame the current administration, for poisoning my brother against me (he was right-wing), as well as for the wildfire spread of Covid that ended up leaving me motherless in my 30s. I do not have a close relationship with the rest of my family (for multiple reasons), I am not close with my coworkers and all my real-world friends have cut their ties with me years ago as part of the standard friend loss pattern people face in their 30s. As such, I've had to lean entirely on my partner for support, which I feel guilty about, as my family has always been pretty rude and condescending about our relationship (we are a same-sex couple). My partner understands that I have a host of complex and complicated feelings about the loss of such troubled people, but I still feel bad about it as it almost seems disrespectful toward my partner to not be stoic about the whole thing, if not outright celebratory.

It also doesn't help that the week before mom died, I began my latest attempt at sobriety. I am on medication for anxiety and depression, but it doesn't prevent the bad thoughts from creeping in during quiet moments when I am not actively distracting myself. That's usually what the alcohol is for--setting up that haze of distraction so that I'm more at ease and my world shrinks down to a more manageable size. I know that ultimately it is a fruitless distraction at best, and actively harmful at worst--I tend to wander down memory lane even when drinking, and when I do, the alcohol only makes feelings hit harder. So in addition to pushing intrusive thoughts from my mind, I'm also attempting to push away cravings for escape, however illusory and fleeting it would be.

I used to write all the time and keep a journal--this post is the closest thing I've written to a journal entry in some time. I think just writing everything out and organizing my thoughts for this has been at least a little cathartic. I may try to write again after the services tomorrow--either that, or pursue some other means of distraction to try to push out the fresh memories that will no doubt be permanently etched in my mind.",10Nov2020,1

57,"My question might sound wierd af, but just hear me out before you downvote me into hell, ok? 😅

I got my first proper TV for a discounted price (around 40-50% off) during the holiday sales about 5 years ago. It was a 55” Samsung 4K LED TV from their ”mid budget” range, so I thought it was dirt cheap to buy it for that discount. Please mind that this was before
OLED or QLED started to blow up.

I guess I only have 2 reasons to why I want to sabotage my own electronic devices:

1 - Age is taking it’s toll. For starters, it has had a very noticable bleed (particulary in the lower right corner) since I bought it, and as you might understand it’s not getting any better. 

I feel that the image quality isn’t that amazing, you can’t see for shit whats on the TV because of reflections and poor display lighting on sunny days, and the UI and startup of the TV is starting to get a little bit slower and unresponsive.

2 - I really, really, REALLY can’t be arsed to bring up the discussion with my partner! Me and my partner live together and ofcourse we almost always discuss what we need to buy and what not... except for that one time I bought a Dyson vacuum, which she first tought was unnecessary because of that we already had a really crappy vacuum cleaner, but changed her mind pretty quickly after seeing how simple the Dyson was to use and how great it was.

Economically, buying a newer QLED/OLED from my own pocket is not a problem at all for me, as we don’t really have a shared economy in a traditional sense. But motivating to buy a new TV is not going to be easy at all. She’s stubborn and have a proper ”if it’s not broken, don’t fix it”-mentality.

Despite having some friends in the past I never felt like they would be good friends. I feel like I can’t let anyone know that I’m struggling or feel depressed or need someone to just exist with. I used to. I had a good friend and a partner that I felt I could confide in and call when I needed someone, but it wasn’t enough. I’m no longer friends with that person and I’m no longer with my partner. 

So it’s depressing knowing that I’m alone. I wouldn’t say it’s lonely. It just sucks feeling like I only exist to myself. The only presence I have is in my little room. The only proof of my existence lies in my mirror. 

It especially sucks knowing that if I were to disappear in some way people would either not notice or if they did they wouldn’t know how and wouldn’t care to figure it out. It’s depressing to think about how I could be dead tomorrow, I could have killed my self yesterday, or I could vanish from existence right now and no one would know. 

I have a psychiatrist and a therapist, but they’re just doing their job. If I die then it’s just one lest client. Whatever. It’s not that I expect them to care about me on a personal level.

66,"Lifted pick up trucks are a waste of money, penis compensators, and for wannabe cowboys. 

•Backstory on OP: I currently am in the south for a job I am not originally from here, I’ve been here for about 3 years I have quite the experience with pick up trucks and their drivers•

You may remember me or you may not, I did a similar post awhile ago ranting about my hatred for pick up trucks I’m back again. I was not satisfied, nor swayed with the results I got from the last discussion my hatred for pick up trucks has only gotten worse. I’m here to get some insight from some of you rednecks. 

*DISCLAIMER* this rant is for a very specific group of people. If you have a HUMBLE truck, that is used for work, actively (meaning you use it to make money) this does NOT apply to you. If your truck is actually used ACTIVELY for purposes a truck is made to be used for, this does NOT apply to you. If you have an older beater truck that you didn’t spend a shit load of money on and you use only when necessary this does NOT apply to you. 

PURPOSE OF POST: Let me start off my saying, a majority of people on the road nowadays are not using a pick up truck for it’s intended purpose. I think a lot of us can agree on that. People nowadays simply like the look of said truck. They like feeling “macho” and “alpha” for some reason big truck= illusion of big penis.. I guess? Okay. The intended purpose of this post is not a joke, nor is it me trying to get a rouse out of people, it’s not I promise. Even tho it may seem like I’m joking at times, or just trying to bully people. I’m not, I have a genuine hatred for these specific group of truck driving people and at times I find it quite hysterical. I want answers, I want to be swayed, and most of all I want to be proven wrong because I haven’t yet. In my last post all I got was angry southern people that were quite immature actually and weren’t willing to debate. But without further ado let’s get on to the reasons why I believe “Pick up trucks and people that drive them are the worst.”

-Reason #1- You don’t need such a large vehicle as a daily driver, you really don’t I promise. 

•The people that daily drive trucks are the worst, and it’s a majority of those pick up truck drivers. Why would you chose the least versatile car. It’s harder to make U turns, harder to fit in tight spaces and overall is typically worse on gas than the average sedan. I’ve driven trucks, it’s a bland experience, what’s the difference? I’m slightly higher than everyone else.. crazy. Buying a truck for the purpose of a daily driver is ignorant. For the average joe working that 9-5 job, you won’t be hauling much, besides maybe your over weight southern wife. If you have hobbies that involve hauling (ex. A camper, boat) you don’t need that $50,000 F-150, a simple beater truck will do I promise.  

-Reason #2- What are you compensating for? 

•The people that drive trucks are either the most egotistical or the most insecure people. There is seriously no in between when it comes to these people. You either see that “macho” southern ass hat or that weird little hick that blowing vape clouds out his window revving his v6 engine pick up truck. Let me tell all of you using your truck to compensate for your small pecker something, it’s not working. All off you little southern weirdos using a truck to pick up for the slack on your lack of manhood is not working, because guess what?  That’s what all the other pick up truck drivers are doing. Your stock Tacoma is not gonna get you woman, your f150 with spinning rims is not gonna make you any cooler and the lift on your truck is not gonna increase the size of your penis. Everyone on the road sees through this, you are insecure, have a small pecker, and you don’t have the qualities of a real man so you attempt to compensate it’s not working. 

-Reason #3- The wannabe living the Southern Cowboy lifestyle. 

•It is undeniable that there is some correlation between southern redneck pride and trucks. What do you think of when you hear the word “pick up truck?” When I hear the word, I like to think of an old Ford ranger, hauling some hay across a field, on a hot summer day. An old farmer using his truck for the intended purpose, for work, for hauling. But the sad truth is nowadays that is not the reality of some of the trucks you see on the road. What it is now is people wanting to be seen as that “southern man” or “farm boy” or “cowboy” whatever you wanna call it. I personally do not get the appeal of this, mainly because again I am not from the south, if being a rancher or whatever is considered cool in the south that’s fine no judgement here. I have a problem with the fakers. The people that fake that claim they were raised on a farm, and swear that they truly lived the southern lifestyle in when in reality they haven’t. They are no more country than a homo sexual man from San Francisco. But they lie to themselves and others and put on this front to appear that they are a true country boy. The cowboy boots, cowboy hat, the consumption of chewing tobacco, and most importantly a truck are all apart of this facade. That 18 year old man that was raised in the suburbs of Texas, in an upper middle class family in the middle of a big city, dreams to be seen as this cowboy or rancher to appear more manly. So he chooses to make himself look that way in his image and attitude. This is no different than a person dressing like a “gang banger” just to look tough or cool. You can wear the sagging pants, durags, live the lifestyle, talk the slang. But in reality if your name is Clarence, and live in a multi million dollar home with your parents, and are living beyond a comfortable lifestyle. It’s clear to everyone you’re a phony, you’re not banging. And to the fake southerners, you’re no cowboy. 

-Reason #4- The most obnoxious and worst drivers on the road. 

•This one really hits home, because I experience this every time I am on the road. This one is specifically for the people operating the truck. I have reason to believe that all pick up trucks on the road have faulty turn signal lights.. because when I’m on the road no truck drivers use their fucking signals. I just don’t understand it, it’s almost like it recommends in your f-150 manual to not use your turn signals. I don’t get it. The drivers behind the wheel of pick up trucks are incredibly inconsiderate, they will always ride your ass, will switch lanes without notice *cough cough turn signals* or when they do use their turn signals it’s 000.2 seconds before they are about to turn. This is one that really gets to me because I seriously notice this in all the pick up drivers on the road. I know there are people that notice this too because I have had this conversation with multiple people before. Brownie points for all the truck drivers that chose to park right next to me in an empty parking lot, you know who you are. 

-Reason #5- A waste of money.   

•Why do you need that large vehicle? Can you actually justify that $34,000 price tag on that new tundra? Why are you consciously choosing to buy a less practical and gas efficient vehicle. Do you enjoy burning your income? This is another one I don’t get. I see so many people here blow a ton of money on a new truck, and than mod it to shit, and for what? To be slightly higher than every other pick up truck on the road? To be louder? To waste more gas and pollute the air? It seems like with truck drivers it’s one big dick measuring contest but everyone’s tied there 2 inch schmeat. There is no reason to cash out on a truck. The claim that trucks are “safer” is a myth. Trucks actually handle worse than your average sedan in  inclement whether. Modding a truck has no point, having a stock truck for the average joe is equally pointless. Use your money on something more useful like.. cowboy boots, f*g.

That ends my rant on my hatred for pick up trucks. I’m not sorry if any of this came off as “rude” or “unprofessional” or “immature” I genuinely find people that drive pick up trucks a joke, I see you all as peasants. Do not get it twisted I am not a closed minded individual, I am always up for debate and I’m looking for my opinion to be swayed. Tell me why I’m wrong, or if I am.

68,"I’m not too worried about the breakup itself as I hope we’ll still be friends, but I’m worried about how it would affect his living situation. He was in foster care when he was a child, and his mom who adopted him kicked him out for reasons beyond his control when he was sixteen. She kept all of his important documents including his birth certificate, social security card, and adoption papers. She changed his legal name when she first adopted him, but never had it changed through the social security office as well which causes a lot of problems trying to receive a paycheck as his names are different whenever his SSN is search up. All of this makes finding a job for him or even a place to live extremely difficult, and we’ve had to secretly have him in the house we’re at because we couldn’t find a way to put his name on the lease.

He has zero family to turn to for help if he ever needs it which worries me. He tries to contact his mom, but she’s ignored every single one of his calls and texts ever since she kicked him out. I’m more than willing to help him be it financially, emotionally, whatever he needs. The only thing is that, to be honest, he doesn’t NEED help financially because he’s a very hard worker. It’s more so that anything that ever happens to him with jobs going wrong, not being able to receive a paycheck, or not being able to put his name on the lease, is out of his control. I’m just trying to make sure he’ll have a roof over his head, and make sure he’ll be okay mentally by himself despite all of these obstacles. Foster care alone is traumatizing not to mention the abuse he suffered through the system, and getting kicked out for reasons beyond his control by the woman who’s supposed to take care of him has hurt him a lot. 

I’ve never broken up with anyone before as this is my first serious relationship. What’s the best way I can offer my support to him despite breaking up with him? Should I stay with him until we have enough money saved up so it’ll be easier for him to support himself? I wouldn’t mind still living with him even after we’ve broken up as I feel that would be the easiest until we’re able to figure out the best living situation for him, but I know he won’t want to do that with someone who just broke up with him (understandably so.) It wouldn’t be a dangerous situation for me either way before anyone gets any ideas. As for now I’ve been bottling everything in because I want to make sure he’ll be okay before I break up with him, but it’s very difficult pretending everything’s okay with him when it isn’t. It’s not fair to him for me to pretend like this for much longer which is why I’m now here asking for advice on how to help him best.",10Nov2020,1

Relatively often she tells me what kind of women she finds attractive,  yesterday, as I was going in for a covid test she told me she was talking to some girl she's friends with about how ""pear shaped girls are the best."" I just said, ""lovely,"" and got out of the car and went in for the test. Last night I had a nightmare that she and I got into a huge fight about it and that anxiety kept me up all night. 

I talked to her finally, its been over a year that this has been concerning me, and she apologized. I told her that ive tried to do the same to her just to show her what its like but made me feel bad doing that. Plus I told she only ever talks about what girls she's attracted to and never men and made me question if she was even actually attracted to men at all. She said that it made sense that I was worried about that and that she only wants this relationship and no one else, and I feel the same.

78,"The break up was initiated by my ex and in a lot of ways the relationships made me relook what the truly important things are in a person. It left a deep impression on me; I can’t say that I have fully processed it but I’m confident that I’m 80~90% sorted. A part of me is still scared that it might be too soon to see someone else. 

So I met this guy T on Tinder yesterday ftf and it felt....... real. Real as in unpretentious and as though we’ve known each other in ages. I didn’t have to pretend that I agree with him or that I have qualities that he likes in a person. I laughed so heartily with him not caring about how androgynous I appear. I could toe the line in my jokes and he didn’t get offended. 

He made a move and we made out and damn, he’s amazing. It was THE KISS if you know what I mean. Just right - al dente for the pasta equivalent. 

For a moment, I felt 5 emotions at once - happy that I didn’t have to act ‘lady-like’ on a first date, content that I got to meet someone as weird as me, sad that I might have to let him go because he might not be able to accept my situation, scared that if I tell him he would lose respect towards me. 

Oh and 1 more - I actually felt peace. Like I didn’t feel nervous or anxious. I felt peace when I was around him. 

One more emotion would be... I feel guilty for actually having enjoyed that kiss. I felt like I shouldn’t be enjoying this when my ex and I broke up just a month ago. 

The thing is I have never gotten around telling T my situation because I haven’t got a chance to / he haven’t asked. Not that I am never gonna say it, it’s just the idea that this amazing piece of a weirdo might slip away from me makes me feel a little ...... sad. I kinda wish last night happened like a few more months down the line. 

Through conversation, I got to know that T has taken a lot of time and effort to get over the betrayal from his ex - the story made me understood that it had been a laborious process for him. After knowing that and seeing that he is someone who wears his heart on his sleeve, I am determined to tell him my situation even if it means it’s the end for us. A part of me still wants to continue to hangout with this guy but I don’t know if how he’ll take this information. I just don’t want him to be kept in the dark because if I do and he finds out, it’s going to leave a scar on him again. And I don’t believe in beating around the bush about these kind of things anyways. 

It kinda feels wrong to actually feel sad that I might lose T and actually like kissing T when the break up was recent. I’m not sure what to do apart from being upfront with T and seeing how it goes but yeah. And also, I’m not sure if anyone has felt this way before.

80,"The other night, it was around 10pm, I was headed to my usual skateboarding spot and there happened to be a few other guys there practicing their skateboarding. I'm fairly good at skateboarding and I rarely ever see any locals skating, so it would be good to find some connections that love to skate because I'm always skateboarding by myself. I approached but they inevitably maintained their distance... it makes sense because of Covid-19, but a conversation would've at least been nice. 

It was somewhat awkward and they ended up leaving. Whatever, not a big deal. 

Midnight had rolled around and I was just about ready to head home. 

I was sitting on the trunk of my car on my phone with my skateboard on the ground under my feet. A car pulls into the parking lot. As I'm getting ready and packing up all of my things, a guy around my size pulls out a longboard from his car and starts riding around. I figured I'd at least stick around.

He instantly rides up to me on his longboard and goes, ""Hey man, I don't mean to promote any bad habits, but would you possibly want to match?"" (In my state this means that each of us contribute some weed towards one solid object being a blunt, joint, bowlpack, etc.)

I said abso-fucking-lutely and the night consisted of us smoking, laughing, skating, filming each other doing tricks, and now we're friends. He happens to be my exact age too, and we got along very well. Even though I'm 23, I haven't had a moment like making my own friend in god knows how long. And I haven't smoked with anyone since the pandemic started, I really needed that.

This taught me that talking to strangers really isn't such a scary thing. Or at least it doesn't need to be unless you think of it that way. If you both have mutual business in wherever you are, you are more likely to be compatible in a relationship than not.

I used to be a heavy smoker (pack and a half  everyday for 6 years) then decided I needed to change and cut down, so then I started a pack a day, 15 cigs, 12, 9, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 to where I now only smoke 2-4 cigs a week when I start getting a craving or when I’m having a beer; yay me I guess :)

But someone told me I should start vaping and recommended juule, or stigs (I tried no nicotine/ low vape but it was gross and felt like air and made me crave more, also I hate that the devices would sometimes leak into my mouth and the whole thing with coils was just a hassle) However, my only concern with juule and stigs for example is the insane amount of nicotine. One pod is like smoking 20 cigs worth of nicotine, and I have seen people smoke through em in a day or two. 

While I’ve heard that vape at least doesn’t have many of those filthy chemicals in cigs, I’m worried the insane amount of nicotine would make me more addicted and smoke more (vaping can be like a pacifier and I experienced that) and actually take me away from my goal of minimal-no dependence to nicotine. Also, I’ve been hearing more stories about the dangers of vaping and that we are learning it isn’t completely safe as people thought it was. So what do you guys think? Continue down my road? Or buy stigs.

86,"It’s my birthday today. I am now 2 years younger than whence my brother died l. I have celebrwtere by eating a whole heap of klonopin and Xanax and a bottle of jack as well as a couple beer and blowing money on the pokies or the slot machines I think it’s called in America. It’s 2am now. Tomorrow I will get my bandages changed for my cigarette burns and get more antibiotics because my ankle swelled up like a fucken melon or orange or something I can’t think of a metaphor, then get dinner with my girlfriend which I won’t enjoy at all because our relationship is fucking shit. I love drugs and alcohol more than I love her. I love benzos and alcohol more than I’ve ever loved anything or anything in my life.

I tried to organise drinks with (the one person I guess I could call me lfridnd) but he puts me off saying I don’t l ow maybe I’ll kget back to you really he just maens if something else doesn’t come up I might.

I tried to organise to go out drinking with my sister but she didn’t even want to take the day of work the next day. If my brother was still alive he would take me to the casino and pay for my drinks and my money for blackjack and poker like he did before. I remember the first New Years o was 18 and he took me out and I think it was one of the best memories I have (the rest are ruined by my Xanax addiction and alcoholism), just drinking with him, being at the casino, chain smoking cigarettes on the kerb waiting for a taxi.

I miss him a lot.

I’ll peobably just end up going for drink with my fuckec dad. How pathetic is that. My abusive, anger management problem having dad. My “ I feel so guilty about the fact my son is dead due ion part to my shithouse parenting so I try to make up for it by giving my sieving kids money”. Surviving kids that have all attempted suicide. 3/3. That’s a statistical anonomoy. That’s all due to my dad and mostly my cunt mums parenting. How the fuck else did I end up with depression, anxiety, constant panic attacks, and borderline personality disorder??? Okay the panic attacks and the anxiety attacks are due in a certain percentage of me doing benzos all the time and constantly being high or in withdrawal, and probably the years of dailyn heavy weed smoking and all the lsd I took but u get the point I think don’t you.

I just wanted to do something fun and good. I finally finished uni after dropping out of high school, developing a drug addiction that cost me almost two years of my life, severe mental illness and it took me 5 years to do a 3 year degree. I probably won’t even get a job out of it and I’ll be working the same dead end miserable overnight job I am now that forces me to get high and drunk throughout my shift just to get through it.

I wanted to organise a nice holiday to a fucking island paradise sorta thing. To congratulate myself on actually completing university which I never thought I’d be able to do. I always thought I would be dead by now. Being 25 fucking sucks. But no my girlfriend “ I have my period during that time so I don’t want to go swimming” so I change the date and she says “ I want to go to a market during that week”. It s a fucking market you go to one almost every week. The amount of effort it took to get here. To fucken finally finish my degree. Drug addiction, alcoholism, two years of Failed classes, academic probation, and I finallynfucking did it. I just want to relax on the beach smoking cigars and drinking expedience champagne. But I can’t even have that.

87,"I feel like the best way to describe this is to start at the break up. 4 years ago, my GF of 3.5 years dumped me. I had my life planed out with her, so needless to say my world was shattered and my heart was broken. She was visiting me at school, and we still had a night of sleep and then a plane ride back home. I remember clearly that night I tried to go sleep on the couch but she insisted I sleep in bed with her. She cuddled with me and continued to kiss me. She continually talked about how she wasn't sure if she needed a break or if she wanted to end things. The same thing happened on the flight the next day, she would continue to hold my hand while talking about whether or not we should just take a break or stay broken up. I mention this because it will be important for later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward half a year. We are still talking a little (not about getting back together, we had settled that we would stay broken up), and one conversation I remember us clearly having was about us finding new relationships. I think she still cared about me and wanted me to be doing better, so she wanted me to let her know when I found someone new. We promised to each other that we would tell each other when we started dating again. I had told this to my brother and sister in law about this (as they're the people I'm closest to in my life) and my Sister in Law told me my Ex had some photos with a guy on IG. I had been using a out of sight out of mind approach so wasn't going onto any of her social media. I check it out and it looked like they were a thing, however they had photos for months. Up to the point where their first photo together was roughly a month after we broke up. I was hurt because it looked like she didn't need much time to move on from me, and she had literally just promised me she would tell me if she started dating someone. I didn't want to make assumptions or be toxic however, so I asked if he was the new man in her life. I had good intentions but I don't think the conversation went well. I can't remember specifically how the conversation went fully, other than me asking her how long they had been dating which she wouldn't answer. I know I asked her point blank how long it was after we broke up that she started dating this guy which she also wouldn't answer. Again important details.

&amp;#x200B;

Through the 4 years we were broken up, she reached out to me multiple times. Wishing me well, once or twice asking if we could be friends, and once wanting to talk about dating again. I had played along every time. I didn't want to hurt her feelings, I still cared about her. I still thought of her as the love of my life, and hoped secretly maybe things would work out.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a month or two ago. She sent me a message talking about how she would like to be friends again. We started having conversations and some feelings from the last 4 years came up. I think we both wanted to air some things out, and I needed some closure so I was up to have these conversations and see if we could ever be friends again. I told her how our entire relationship it felt like my emotions were never valid. How I was always the one apologizing to her and how whenever I would get mad at her I would still end up the one apologizing. I mentioned how it was always as if she was allowed to have a reason if she did something that upset me, but I never was allowed to be upset. But whenever I did something, I wasn't allowed to have a reason why, I just needed to see that I did something wrong and apologize (I did bring up a specific example of how one time she told me ""I wish you would just shut up and apologize""). I brought up how her getting a BF fairly quick really hurt me, and although I was way over that by now it also bugged me that she lied to me about it point blank. She gave me her justification behind it. She told me how she had moved on because she couldn't be with someone that didn't respect her emotions. She aired somethings out too. I apologized to her for how I acted. I pointed out how I was toxic or acting unhealthy and admitted to how what I was doing was wrong. I never got that from her, only justifications of how what she was doing was acceptable. I did get an apology along the lines of ""I'm sorry if I made you feel like your emotions and opinions weren't valid, but I want you to understand that I was mad because of things you were doing.""

&amp;#x200B;

I also wanted her to understand why I had such a hard time moving on, and brought up how she was going back and forth between being broken up or on a break. Where I was ready to at least give her space and distance once she said those words, she tried was unsure about things. I told her I wasn't mad at her for it, it just didn't help with my confusion about things and explained how it added to frustrations. She was quick to say the only reason she did that was because of me. That I was the one saying that we were on a break instead of being broken up (which I know is not true what so ever. She had threatened needing a break a couple of times through the relationship. When we broke, I'm sure I did ask her if it was a break or a breakup, but she was the one that initially planted the idea in my head, and then continued it with her actions when she said she was done.)

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this morning and I realized that we had just fallen into the same pattern. That I was hurt by something she did, but her actions were ""justified"". During this last month of talking, I apologized for a lot of the stuff I did while we were broken up, but didn't get an apology from her once  because she felt everything she did was justified. During our relationship and afterwards, there were times where she was manipulative and dishonest about things, but I didn't care because I loved her. I had a moment of clarity while I was showering. It's all the things my friends and family had been telling me, but because she still had some strings to my heart I would deny it. I realized that a good friend isn't someone that would try to convince me that it's my fault that we broke up. A friend is someone that if they heard they hurt you, they would at least apologize and try to have some empathy for you rather than justifying hurting you. They would at the very least try to understand your side of things. Maybe her getting with someone new is justifiable, but the lying to me about it isn't. Maybe she was doing it to protect my feelings, but in my opinion at least it isn't acceptable. It's the same level of dishonesty that she showed through our relationship. Her trying to convince me that I was the one that muddied the waters between ""break"" and ""break up"" showed me she is still manipulative. Trying to make me see everything as my fault. That I am always the one to blame for how she acts.

&amp;#x200B;

Just an hour ago I sent her a long message telling her how I don't want to talk to her until she can learn to take responsibility for her actions, and learn that she can indeed do something wrong for once. I told her that taking her as a friend would forgive her for how poorly she treated me post breakup. How we fell into the same routine, and that I apologized for my actions and stepped across the line to see her side, but she didn't do the same. How based on our conversation during the last month, it became clear that I have been giving her more respect than she has been giving me.

&amp;#x200B;

What she did post break up wasn't justified. Her texting me multiple times asking if we could be friends, or trying to start conversations about dating again isn't justified. Maybe her getting a new boyfriend within a month of dating is justified, but a friend would see how that could hurt me and would try to feel empathy for it. I'm done putting her emotions above mine. I'm tired of putting her on a pedestal. I know that we are both human. We both have flaws. But, when I try to show her what she does that's disrespectful to me and she in turns tell me it's justified and I don't have a right to be mad or hurt or upset; That, to me, is not justified.",10Nov2020,1
88,"Trigger warning I guess: Abuse and suicide

I've only ever told 3 people this story. One of which was a therapist. But I feel like a year on I need to say it. Even if nobody actually bothers to read it.

Last year I was in a bad position. I have suffered with depression since I was 12, and it was slowly getting worse and worse. I was in an abusive relationship, my girlfriend at the time would constantly put me down, several times telling me she wished I would die. She took advantage of my mental issues to get her claws into me and made me think I didn't deserve her and she was being charitable to be with me. A few days before that day was the first time she hit me, but the mental abuse had been happening for over a year at that point.

One night it all just escalated. She told me to die, I left her in the bedroom and went to the living room, found a charging cable for my laptop. And hung myself from a banister separating the kitchen from the living room.

I don't remember much of what happened that night but I remember coming to om the living room floor. My glasses were off and I was surrounded by shadowy figures (Paramedics) who were holding me down and talking to me. Apparently I hadn't been breathing for around 5 minutes and my ex had been doing CPR on me until the ambulance arrived and brought me around. I panicked and thrashed around and had to be sedated.

I woke up a day later in the ER with a breathing tube in, nerve damage in my face, torn muscles in my arms and legs from fighting paramedics, and couldn't move my neck much at all. My father had flown in to see me and it was the only time I've ever seen him cry.

Long story short I was put into a mental ward for 2 weeks which was the worst experience of my entire life. I was assaulted by other patients and after all of that I was discharged straight back to my abusive ex.

Over the next few months things got worse and worse but luckily I had a therapist talking me through it which kept me from trying again.

In March of 2020 I finally broke up with my ex after she admitted cheating in me in what seemed to be another attempt to make me feel bad.

After that I ended up in quarantine in a downward spiral with alcohol abuse. Caught the virus in April, but got through it.

Now for where things start going uphill. I got a job offer I only really interviewed for as practice. I never expected to actually get it. And I got to move to Switzerland. My life seems to finally be moving forward, and I have found someone here who treats me with respect and actually seems to care about me.

And I can happily say that since June I haven't had a single depressive episode. I feel like a completely new person and I honestly don't know how to feel. I keep expecting the darkness to creep back into my head but it never does.

In laying here coughing, thinking I may have somehow caught the virus for a second time. And I'm somehow happier than I've ever been.

Anyway if you read this far thank you for listening to my rant. And I hope everyone gets the second chance at life I did.",10Nov2020,1
89,"Hello everyone, I am a grad student pursuing Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I have narrowed down my therapeutic approach to positive psychology. Although I am still early on in my educational path, I have implemented some of the strategies I have researched into my daily life and have experienced amazing benefits to my mental health.

One of the strategies is ""gratitude walks"". Fresh air, exercise and gratefulness are all ingredients to leading a better day! The walk usually starts off with obvious things you are grateful for but soon blossoms into full conversations with yourself that allow you to recognize how much you really have. After implementing this myself, I have noticed how much my willpower has grown just due to the idea that ""I have achieved so much already, I am capable of achieving more."" It almost *tricks* the mind into thinking you are safe and there is nothing immediate to worry about and thus results in joy.

I made a youtube video defining it in my own words and describing how to embark on your own gratitude walk. If you'd like, please check it out! I hope this finds you well! Sending light, love and positivity!

That's the hardest part. Due to circumstances, I get to see my son's on average two days a week. So here I am feeling like a bad dad because most of the time I am spending time with two that aren't my own. It makes me miss my son's a lot. The flip side of that though is that I do really enjoy doing things with my step dudes. I take them anywhere I can with me, but I am extremely careful to not try and take the roll of their actual dad. 

That's another thing. As much as I do and get out of my comfort zone so that they aren't uncomfortable, I realize that I'll never be as cool as their dad to them. Even though he's not really cool. And I can't bad mouth the guy ever, he's their dad. 

My wife and I do talk about this stuff. It's just hard sometimes man. I just wanna be a good dad and step dad.

I have little empathy and very few true friends, I consider myself someone quite antisocial. In the past my parents took me to psychologists but I never told them what I really wanted to do because I thought they would scold me or put me in an asylum for crazy people but lately those wishes are much stronger than before, now that I live alone in my own home I haven't seen a psychologist for a long time, what would you do in my position? ¿Or what do you think I could do? as additional information i have a 3/10 asperger's syndrome.

A verbal slip during a conversation. I know full well there can be nothing and that she has a fella but it came out anyway. Instantly regretted it and she played it off like nothing had happened ( she is a good egg) but I still did it. It’s pretty reprehensible I know but I sort of feel like now the elephants been delt with and we can move on with our friendship. Which is to be honest new but quite important to me. I just feel horrid for saying it. I feel like I crossed a line and though she has been good about it I am not happy with me about it. She said it’s fine and she had an idea but obviously now it real. She was considerate and kind, witch obviously helped and harmed the situation in equal masseuses. But I can’t get it out of my head that I was so foolish as to let the thing on the tip of my brain slip out of my mouth. So that was that. It was a mistake and I wish I was a better man.

I'm a CS major but I think I want to be a writer. I used to be a decent writer back in high school, I did pretty okay in a class-wide poetry contest. I mean, I didn't win, but I had one of the top poems. Problem is, my attention span is useless. I've been on Reddit for... 5+ years? between different accounts, ever since I was a freshman in high school. I USED to be able to read books easily, now I have trouble focusing. I can't even read Reddit posts longer than a paragraph. I don't blame Reddit entirely, but it has enabled me.

So, I guess the ""smart"" plan for myself would be as follows:

1) fix my diet (which is really hard, since I have a ton of random allergies).

2) quit reddit (also hard for me)

3) read books

4) exercise more (I walk for 3+ miles once a day most days, but my back is suffering from weak abs/computer posture)

HYPOTHETICALLY, if I do all of this I should be in a good spot. As for my major, I plan on finishing- I only have a year and a half left. What sucks is that I have internships this winter and summer, which both sound great, but hot damn, I hate working with computers.",10Nov2020,1

I want to cry but I don't have privacy and also I don't want to be weak so I'll just keep it in. I'm always bitter and angry. Sometimes the smallest thing will trigger me and I'll snap.

I'm stupid - people have told me so and I know it. I learn slower than the average person. I'm boring, not funny. I'm so far behind in life. I know people say you shouldn't compare but that's what society does. If I want to get hired ,they'll compare me. If I want a relationship, they'll also compare me. I don't think anyone understands me.

113,"There are countless metaphors for what the journey of life is. I like to think about the journey from birth to death as a sort of river I am trying to cross. You start on one side when you're born. The way across is a series of rocks in the river that are sticking out for you to jump on. These represent big life goals and they get farther and farther apart as life progresses.

You have a lot of ""rocks"" to step on in the beginning. Your first tooth rock, first word rock, first steps rock, first sentence rock, and so on. But the farther you go, the farther the rocks are spaced out because big life events happen less often. Next may be your first day of school. Then your first time at a friends house. There are a few here and there before the next big one like maybe your first time on a plane or you have lost all your baby teeth. The next big one is driving. Then high school graduation. Now you are in college. Somewhere along the way you lose your virginity. The next rocks are big ones, but much farther apart. Graduating college rock seems pretty far from the high school rock. You barely recognize who you were on that rock.

This is where the rocks get really big and really far apart. Not much action going on but when it does, its huge. Next, and probably one of the biggest rocks in the whole river, the marriage rock. Make sure it is a sturdy one. Usually right near it is another huge rock, the first home rock. Afterwards rocks look pretty scarce. There is probably a first child rock laying around. The next rock is really far and you will probably need a running start: the retirement rock. It is so far away but with a good push-off you can make it.

Ahead there are only about 3 or 4 rocks left to jump on before you reach the other side of the river. Probably a paid off the house rock, first grandchild rock, spouse passes away rock. Now here you are. The other side of the river. Looking back at all those stones you jumped on that led you here. Consider yourself lucky. Not everyone makes it to the other side. Some slip on one of their rocks and fall in. An Early demise. Those who fall into the river pass on before it was their time.

What rock are you on right now? Does it seem like a while since you found a new stone to perch on? Or maybe you just landed on a new one and are looking around to make sure you stuck the landing. I would love to hear where you are and what you think of my analogy.

I know there are other ways to have children but the idea of a father and mother in the house that get along well is important to me. 

I’m attracted to women. Although a relationship with a woman doesn’t seem possible if I’m honest. I like a specific type of personality and to find gay women where I live is still uncommon. I am also overweight.

I’m very introverted as well and it is as if I don’t want to be interested in a partner. 

The gay women I know are just not what I’m looking for, lots of baggage, what I would consider extreme appearances and lots of social media drama. 

I have an uncommon personality type and I am weird in my own way but not outwardly, I like science and am not one bit interested in stereotypical feminine things.

I’m very private about myself and know there is still so much more of my life left (I’m 20). However, I don’t see it going anywhere in regard to relationships and I am afraid of truly missing my chance.

I am young and overweight but I know I won’t change the way I eat because it’s the main thing in my life. It sounds sad but this is my life.

118,"another day another brain loop of the past year of my life .

I drove past my ex's house again today and I think he saw me. It was because the mail carrier was on the street and I was stopping at the 4 way about 2 houses away while he looked like he was coming out to meet her. It was super awkward for me and I'm only 3/4 sure he saw me. If he saw me it was 1 whole awkward. Pretty sure he saw me. 

It wouldve been less awkward if we hadn't had sex 2-3 weeks ago . As always it meant something different for the both of us and I suppose we both have a tendency to hide our motives. Although upon critical thought he hides his motives, I am flaky/hard to pin down.

anyyyway

 a year ago I left him .

we both had a lot of pentup anger toward the opposite sex that unfortunately due to our chemistry did come to the surface quickly. He comes from a broken home where both parents have been married 3+ times. I was raised by a single parent with one side of family well off. Neither of us had healthy relationship models.

Leaving and being on my 'own' for a year has been hard. I've spent my life hiding behind stronger figures for safety. I've had to realize a lot of unpleasant truths about myself and my character. 

The relationship both broke me and gave me the strength to move forward when the time came. I had given up my entire focus in life trying to grab something solid out of smoke. Before I was in my mid 20s and ambitious, cocky. After I feel defeated and unexcited about life. It's taken a calendar to go by to even be able to figure out his games and to recover.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a pretty guarded and closed off person, only letting in certain people I intuit have a chemistry or a spark with. Everyone else I am friendly/fair with and I have a good personality, but I am inherently shy to the point of having a bit of a false persona to compensate. This is something my ex never understood about me. He didn't take the time to figure out much, only to step on my heart and my boundaries for as long as I let him. It sort of defeated me in a sense.

&amp;#x200B;

As a university student I had left school and was working as a waitress. I had had feeling such as ""it's so bad what's the point in fighting anymore"" , felt so isolated and defeated. I moved 3 times in a calendar cycle in 2019 to try and find an equilibrium. All the while tryin to make it work with this person, who I constantly found talking to lower quality women who were I guess friendlier and literally ""easier"" than I was. This offended me as I was givin him a chance to access my heart and be part of my life. He acted like it was all he wanted at first and then it turned out it was the old Pavlov's dog trick.

I drool for the attention fix and I'm trained to wait for it . I really hated myself and him. I felt like marty mcfly to his version of the bully, whatever his name was, who always called marty a chicken when marty was trying to walk away and be a bigger person. And it got to marty everytime; it crumbled his resolve and he would start fighting. That's what it was like with this person. He knew how to push my buttons and he used my own passion against me. 

The level of intimacy was intoxicating but it was at a 20 degree tilt, it was off. He bothered to get to know me like I would get to know someone in my early 20s like an experiment. I wanted him to be serious since he made a lot of promises and was like 5 years older than I was. Oh how naive I was.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I was on an alt and saw some self-serving garbage he had written recently here on reddit because he got another dui or felony or something and effed up his life again.. and there were a few things that really got under my skin... he had written it probably a few days after we hooked up for the first time in a year...there was this sentence like ""...my ex wife said I need therapy, my girlfirend broke up with me and said she needed space and my ex misses me but.."" and I just puked like to be a part of that fucked up trio and to have put myself in this position. He is obviously an insecure wreck who depends on women, any woman, and I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

It really wrecks me to think of how meaningless our relationship really was. Mostly because he is such a soulless lost wreck and he thinks everything is meaningless and I let it rub off on me and it's like a bad funk I can't shake. I have many things going for me right now yet I feel gross, dirty, used, old, ...misunderstood and alone but I'm more used to those. Usually i'm optimistic and happy when I'm working but i've really lost my lustre at life and it isn't even all my ex's fault but he would have guided me straight into the ground if I hadn't changed my own course... 

&amp;#x200B;

It made me sad and annoyed to think of him as imagining I miss him. When we hooked up I specifically communicated how tough university is for me at this point with COVID scheduling nightmares and semester ending early and studying. Coming home late from labs 2x a week... being lonely. I always tell him my secrets and he listens and sort of pushes me into moving forward and then uses it against me later. But I never learn, and I figured I needed someone to talk to and we wouldn't see each other again because we are both so flighty and both of our circles of friends/family forbid us from seeing one another. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had told him explicitly I needed a friend when I saw him. Told him about my roommates not talking to me, my oldest friend and I going separate ways, another friend admitting feelings for me and pressuring me into sex... I wanted my ex to be what he can never be which is someone who could take away my insecurity and pain with the opposite sex and to be a good partner and friend, an equal. A partner in crime. Whatever. I now think neither of us are designed for that and I know I have the backbone to stick to being forever alone at my own loss if I so chose. He on the other hand will always choose to settle for trash. It's only a matter of time.

I realize I don't need him anymore but I still feel so lost after the visceral time we spent and the vision of what he wanted that he tried to lay on me so hard and yet, when I came back to him after his rebound fell thru he ran. He is a coward. Or it's like that song ""you're too much, i'm not enough""... and tbh I don't think I should have to work this hard to get someone to wanna be with me. He had the potential and the initial drive, but turned out to just be a dumb troll with no follow thru and he could never prove that wasn't the case. I'll be forever alone I have enough survival skills.

When he got home, I was asking how to fire up a piece of lawn equipment, and he just blows up about how we are going to be put under a draconian lockdown under our governor and Biden, and how he ""knows what he's talking about"", and that I'm ""fucked in the head"" for suggesting that maybe he needs to take a break from all of this media intake. He has never once spoken to me like that before. I told him that we are worried about him and he blew up. Now he is talking about selling the house and moving.. somewhere, I don't even fucking know. And how he is meeting up with some ""militia friends"" because they all know what's going down, and I'm just stupid and brainwashed. I have never in my entire life seen my father this scared, or this fucking angry every day.

My whole family is worried about him, he won't listen to any of it. I don't know what to do. My mom and I are talking about the real possibility of him just writing us all off and leaving. He's just.. insane now. He truly, with every fiber of his being, believes that this country is under actual attack. And you know what, I fucking blame trump and his blatant encouragement of these conspiracy theories and riling up his voter base that he is under attack.  I fucking blame him and every person that allowed this to happen. My dad was never like this before, I swear to god. It is all so obviously not true and he is sticking to his side because that is ALL HE BELIEVES ANYMORE. Any other side to this is ""in on it"" whatever the fuck that means.   


Am I the one that's just blind here? This genuinely has me questioning whether or not I have just become complacent in this narrative, but everything in me speaks that Trump is just a fundamentally bad person, and I'm not even super into politics. Just the way he speaks.. he acts.. I can just feel the vile nature about him. Am I somehow the biased misinformed one? How can I say that his intense emotions about it are just ""wrong"" while I hold the same true about disliking Trump? 

I feel defeated, I feel helpless, and I feel like I genuinely do not know the truth anymore or even where it find it. And I just miss my dad. I want my family to go back to normal. I'm sorry this turned out to be so long everyone. If you read it all, I just appreciate having a place to be heard about this, because I genuinely don't know where else to go with all of this, it's been slowly cumulating and manifesting these entire past 4 years. It's the strangest thing. Thank you all for sitting through this. I hope no one who reads this ever has to experience this kind of familial divide. It is simply heartbreaking.",10Nov2020,1
130,"I have just deleted all the games in my hard drive, I'm going to delete Reddit and Twitter on my phone too. I've decided that it's not worth it, I spend way too much time here. I'm behind in my first year of college already (I have about a dozen of online classes recorded that I've not watched yet) and I'm done.

This is kind of a desperate move, but screw me if I'm going down without a fight. I am not failing any classes this year, not after finally starting to learn about the field I intend to work in for the rest of my life. I need a solid knowledge foundation, and my trembling mental health together with my absolute lack of self-control is really bringing me down. If I wanna be a competent professional, emigrate and go seek a better life then I sure as hell can give up Reddit and gaming for a while. I'll be back (temporarily) when I finish this semester. Until then, have a good life redditors.",10Nov2020,1
131,"Here is a link to the 14 points of fascism. Trump hits every check on the list, making him a literal fascist. Thing is just like the nazis who willingly died for Trump and killed millions, Trump supporters see themselves as right and can never be shown otherwise.

132,"Like, it makes me feel bad and sad all the time. I find most people really judgal towards others. Look, he did this terrible! She did that, how bad person she is!

He should be closed in jail for lifetime, she should be killed for what she had done.

Look. I agree that people have to be responsible and to stand for their mistakes. I also agree that we all should avoid at all cost things that could possibly lead to bad consequences.

But, why? Why to judge? You never was in other person's skin. Maybe there was a reason why someone did something. Maybe he/she need help. People have different kind of problems, and they should be helped to find soultions.

I think nobody was born as a bad person.

We need to be more empathic, less judgal, and focuse on helping and preventing bad things for happening, instead of enjoying other people suffering.",10Nov2020,1
