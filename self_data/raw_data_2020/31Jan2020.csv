10,"If everything goes according to my plan, I should be out of credit card debt by the summer. This will be the first time in my adult life that I'll be free of credit card debt. But I can't do this if I still have the temptation to use them. ""Oh I'll just buy this one thing. It's only $20."" really adds up. But now I can't do that anymore. The cards are gone. They're all ripped up in the bottom of the paper shredder. And they've all been removed as stored payment methods on all websites. 

The accounts are still open, so in 2-4 years when the cards expire, I'll get new cards in the mail. By then, I'll hopefully have developed better habits. But if I can't be responsible with then when I get them back, I'm closing the accounts. Credit cards are such a trap and I'm done.

11,"Yes, one day we will be Gods. Each of us in this universe proposed to have erupted from the Big Bang will have our own toy universe in about 20 years. Young adults are killing themselves from heartbreak unaware that they could transcend human suffering post Singularity. Girls are cutting open their breasts and boys are taking steroids both for vanity to impress each other. Unbeknownst to them, if they just wait and stay healthy for two more decades, they’ll have an AI create their body for them. An AI which knows far better than they do about what *they* want. Ain’t that some shit? But no. We’re telling everyone to just accept themselves for who they are. Go to therapy. Love yourself. Forget your flaws. Basically, drain yourself of your own humanity. Life is dukka remember. That Indian guy Buddha said so. He’s what, the 6th most important man ever? He said to stop desiring. Desiring is what got us here. It’s nature. Evolution, sex, vanity, jealousy, hatred, *self hatred*. That’s reality. It sucks. Shit, if I didn’t know about the Singularity, I’d try to get away from this trash universe myself. Fuck this place right? Actually, I have tried. Drank bleach. It tasted awful. I drank some more, you know because I’m “strong”. I wasn’t going to pussy out this time. Yep. I’ve “tried” to kill myself before. Bologna. The two previous “attempts” were just “cries for help.” If there were a button I could just press, both times I’d disappear. But if it were that easy to go, there’d be no humans alive. Trust me.

Look, I love my family. I love my parents, my sister, my cousin \*\*\*\*. I just hate myself more. Why do guys like me even exist? How the fuck did evolution think of *us* as a viable strategy? Cruel fucking joke from this stupid world that physicists think is “beautifully simple”. We’re supposed to disappear eventually through sexual selection right? They tell us to just live a meaningful life without love or sex or romance. Get a hobby. Draw. Run! Write a fucking book.... Just don’t kill yourself! We need you!! To suffer for years and years. Ok. Ahh I remember now. There’s homeless people. Kids with leukemia. We’ve all seen those commercials of little kids in a hospital with one arm. Fuck man. Yeah, it’s worse out there. Waaay worse. Ok, here’s a deal. I’ll work on making the world a better place. Just let me keep bitching. You don’t even have to listen. I don’t want sympathy. But if there’s one thing I am, it’s real. I’m not going to pretend that I’m not a piece of shit. I hate myself straight up. I WILL transform my body into the “type” in 20 years. In the meantime, for my own self indulgence, I’ll help the less fortunate. I’ll do it in spite of you fuckers. I will be the good guy and all you basics and simps will just be bystanders. Forgotten in history. And I will write the moral. The happy ending. That is of course, when I can become a tall lanky white guy with a “personality”. A guy who reposts memes from guys like me. I’ll wear a beanie, have glasses, a 26 BMI, the glorious height of 6’1. Dirty blonde, some freckles. That’s what’s in now I think.

15,"I made a series of monumental mistakes in my relationship with my girlfriend that hurt her in ways I can never imagine or fathom. 
We have the most amazing dynamic and potential and I see so much for us, and she does too, but I've really fucked it up. To the point where it might be too late. 

She's voiced her feelings to me many times, and it is clear that she lost all trust in me. I have lied to cover my own ass and thus my word means nothing to her any more. I feel as if whilst I've been with her I have grown as a person and learnt from these mistakes, and literally like I'm a new improved me. But I think this growth is too little too late - she deserves better and the way I treated her was horrible; I shouldn't have had to LEARN to treat her the way she deserves to be treated... with respect, consideration and loyalty.

I really feel that if we were to continue our relationship I would be the most amazing boyfriend. Seeing how much I hurt her seriously broke my fucking heart. 
At the same time though, I understand her fear that I might do something again, or hurt her again. 
I really fucked up and the guilt is hitting me like a truck. I don't know what to do. I am so ready to be raw and start fresh with her, but I think this time I've gone too far. The fact that there is a this time at all is killing me. I wish so badly that I was better to her, because she deserves the fucking universe. She treated me so well - this feeling that this is all on me is horrible.

There's so much more to try and express but it's hard. Has anyone else been in a situation where they really fucked up and they feel this gripping urge to need to redeem themselves? Like, as if their life will never be the same if they don't fix their mistake/s? I'm afraid I can never fix this mistake and that I'll lose the most important part of my life forever. I love her so much, and I can't lose her :(",31Jan2020,1
18,"I was living in a college town, and my friend and I went out in the middle of the night to get cookie dough from the grocery store. We come back out and the vehicle we were driving didn't start . . . No electricity, no ""tick"", nothing. Me, having worked on a few cars before moving there, I asked my friend to pop the hood. The wire to the ground for the battery had been cut right through. We went back into the store, and I bought some electrical tape. I asked if the cameras on the front of the store were actual cameras, and didn't get much of a response. My friend told her dad, and he called the local campus police and got them to come out to us after making a lot of noise.

I was getting the wire wrapped up just as the campus police rolled up. A few minutes later a car full of boys pulled up and asked if we needed help. The police told them that we didn't need their help, and watched me finish taping up the wire. They escorted us back to an area where we could work on the vehicle in the morning and left us there. Had I not known how to tape a battery cable and had the police not shown up, we could have easily been overpowered by the boys who pulled up in that car.",31Jan2020,1

25,"It isn't just lonely.

It's the kind that you feel when you genuinely have no support system.

No family, no friends. No one to turn to when you're crying and alone in your apartment. 

Barely holding a job that makes you feel absolutely inadequate on a daily basis, and you're working your ass off just to earn your paycheck, roughly 65 hours a week on salary. A job where you're constantly being accused of being in the wrong. 

No friends that reach out. No one that I used to talk to on a weekly basis even noticed I've dropped off of existence. Not even my best friend. I tried to reach out to people, I really did. But nothing.

I've tried meeting people in groups. I've tried the internet. I've tried hobbies. And nothing.

It's a crippling isolation and emptiness that consumes you and makes you want to die inside. Then you forget that you already did, because having mental fortitude is a challenge and you've already fought so hard to stick around and move past parental death, past sexual/emotional/physical abuse, past emotional negligence, past a career that will never blossom because employers only look to take advantage of their workforce rather than to help it grow, and past family abandonment.

But ""forts"" are held up with support, and I have none of that. The fortitude is falling and I don't think it will last much longer.",31Jan2020,1

39,"This is a kind of complicated situation so it may be a very long and ranty post, but essentially I am feeling very lonely, and have not had any friends since primary school. A week ago I turned 18, and apart from some family who felt obligated, I  got no birthday wishes. I didn't even have a cake or anything. The whole ordeal was pretty depressing, and 18 is supposed to be a big deal. It's not really because I'm terribly shy, in fact I enjoy public speaking and have made acquaintances in class easily enough, I just never really get to the actual friend stage, This is due to a bunch of reasons including my parents having a rough divorce forcing me to move around the world a bunch, plus me having Asperger's.

I'm now in university, and I've meet a girl who is the first person I'd really call a friend in such a long time. Essentially I meet her in class, and found we shared lot's of interests, so I invited her out, something I never really did before. Long story a bit shorter, I clumsy became friends with her, and was very awkward and immature many times, despite this she stuck by. I even told her about my Asperger's, and she assured me that it's fine, as she is pretty shy and socially awkward herself. Were both shy and nerdy history students, and I generally really like her, and relate to her, like more than I have liked anyone before...

So yeah, I have kind of fallen for her... She's 3 and a half years older than me, and is generally much more mature than me. And frankly I'm pretty certain she does not feel the same way about me. However this is not even my problem. I would like to be in a relationship yes, but if I'm being honest I'm not even sure I'm mature enough to be in a relationship. What I'm really looking for most, is closeness, something I have never found in a friend before so I guess I was looking for in a relationship. Along with this stability and longevity, because I want friendship that won't die as soon we change classes, and something I don't feel like I constantly maintain on my end. 

The problem is that I'm not really sure how much she likes me, even as a friend. A few days ago, I went to the theater with her, and I've sorta suggested doing something else in the coming weeks, but I want to be with her more, and spend more time with her. The thing is, she's not super willing to do things that much, mainly because she's just busy with school (as am I), and I think I have gotten obsessed with her. I'm not really sure what to do though, as she is pretty much my only friend, and as pathetic as it seems, the only thing giving me some much needed purpose to life as of late. I would like to be honest about some of my confusion, and even my feelings with her, but I also don't want to make her uncomfortable, or ruin the friendship we do have. 

In terms of making other friends, and not just relying on one, I know, but frankly I have no interest in making surface level friends to hang out with, I just want one or two close ones. Like I already get basic social interaction in school, so that's not really a problem. It'd just be nice to at least get a wish on my birthday I guess... I don't know what to do, I can't give up on this girl, or just abandon her because ""it's not working out"", it is working out, it's the most a relationship has worked out with me in many years. The problem is that I am not fulfilled, I would like something more but I don't know how to get it.

TLDR: I am very lonely and have not had close friends since primary school. Now that I am in university I meet a girl been the first actual friend I have had in such a long time. Were both shy and nerdy history students, and we have been texting and hanging out quite a bit. I generally really like her, and relate to her, more than I have liked anyone before, and I have kind of fallen for her. But I don't think she feels the same way, nor do I think I am mature enough for a relationship. I'm confused on what I want, but I think that I am really looking for closeness, stability, and longevity, whether it's through dating or friendship, but I'm not sure how in both cases.",31Jan2020,1

A big part of that is that when other people give me tasks that I agree to do, a priority is discussing a reasonable deadline. I think I end up skipping that part when I'm working on my own stuff because I don't really have anyone but me counting on me (or at least that's how I feel about it.)

I said I had to call my dad to pick me up, all in all; I ended up having to explain how and why my parents don't love me and my messed up childhood ended up giving me a mental illness which made my relationship with them even worse. At least before they pretended to love me and care about me and I could lie to myself into believing it. Now I just feel sad alone empty and angry at them for making my whole life an ocean of misery. And I can't get away from them because I have nowhere to go. They've already replaced me with other people.

Talking to strangers on the internet is my only way of coping and every chat now is just lulz shew me ur bagene and I'm too old and too sick for this. It makes me feel like the only person in the world in this crap even though I know I'm not. I have no one to talk to and I can't even cry anymore. My parents don't even care about all the pain and sufferi g they caused me and my brother. I don't know how my brother has moved on so easily if he really has. It sucks that I'm now to them the broken mentaly ill adult baby and suddenly all the damage is my fault. I know it's sick too but I hate that they'll die never owning up to hueting their children and thinking they were good parents. They make me sick and I can't help but hating them. I dont know how to get over those feelings. I don't care that my dad replaced me and my brother with a new family and used his spi eless hipocrisy to chameleon himself into just what he needed to be to make that woman agree to marry him. I don't care that my mom is still leeching off of men and blaming ecerything bad that happens in her life on whoever vilberable being that happens to be around her, which were us for a long time. I don't even care that my brother lumps me up with them and doesn't want to talk to me. I just wish someone would say ""yes, this happened, I did this to you and I know it"" 

I don't  even want an apology. I don't need it. But I know I won't even get that little from them. I'm the bad one for being born, they've literally said it to me many times. It doesn't matter what I do with my life as long as Im not there to remind them how awful they really are. I just hurt their ego, not even their feelings

When I called my dad to pick me up because I don't  have a car and he lives 2 miles away, to drive 5 miles to pick me up, he just went ""ugh..."" like I'm wasting his time. I'm a waste of time for him, I wastes his time and money ""the only thing he cares about besides himself"" by raising me, an investment he assumed would take care of him so he could retire at 50 like he wanted and turned out to have a lot of difficulties and problems in life because he got caught by the cops and left me going through puberty in the streets. And then I decided to push through and go to college and try to gwt whatever decent job I. could get no matter whatever crippling problem I was going through. I was forced to stop going to school because my state was that bad, and only then after lenghty therapy I could face the truth of my life and finally not be suicidal, and then I came back. What a bad daughter. What a burden, what a saint of a father he is gor even picking up the calls of a lost cause like me.

50,"I feel like I'm supposed to be a grown up with a 'real' job but that's not what I am at all. It's terrifying because I think people view me as a competent adult, or that I'm supposed to be one, but I'm really a giant kid that's faked it this far. 

This is exacerbated by the fact that I don't work a 'real' job, and I wonder if I should get one. I had been pursuing this vague music dream since I was a young teen, and right out of college some labels got involved. I ended up biting the bullet and trying out the music thing because it seemed logical at the time as opportunity was there. I haven't made a ton of money -- very little, actually -- but I'm still alive. But I really love what I do, the 'business' gets better every month, and I see so much opportunity for more in front of me. It feels so worth it. But still -- at 24, maybe I should have a salaried job and savings, and that I'm really just delaying the inevitable.  

Then, I have this unshakeable sense that everyone is somehow much smarter than me, or that they have all their relationships figured out. Like, they know how to draw appropriate boundaries, and I don't. And so I don't know when I'm oversharing with friends or if I'm just hiding my feelings. 

I've been going to therapy for maybe six months now -- I started going because I felt 'off' thinking about my dad's death and had been languishing with this strange existential hunger of having not confronted it for over a decade (he died when I was a 9). It's strange to me because some days I feel like I'm an incredibly incomplete or abnormal human being at this age. This isn't normal, right? 

I saved some money (let's be real, I put most of it on a credit card) and took the train across the continent last summer. I guess I really needed to do some soul searching. Maybe it was irresponsible, but I *needed* to figure something out. I sat next to a 56 year old man who told me he was making it up as he went and felt like he was a total idiot in his twenties and still feels like one now. It made me feel a little better.

I’m on the spectrum (not by very much) and people have always just kinda not liked me when I act like myself, people have told my before about thing they don’t like about my personality but then I see them doing the same thing they told  me not too, and just gets to me and makes me feel like people put double standards on me. That is pretty much why I don’t act like myself most of the time , as for my friends, it’s really only two people I actively dislike and the others I just don’t connect with most of the time, and in conversation I rarely contribute because I don’t feel like what I have to say will be listened to or it’s not worth saying and sometimes when I do try and speak I’m just   
Ignored. I have no experience in this situation where I get to a point where I’m realise I’m just not ok with being with people I liked, usually most  of my friendships would end  because after 3 weeks because I would move or they would move or they got tired of me and one of them just took me aside just kicked me out of the group because the ones that actually had a problem were to scared to do it themselves. And it usually takes me a year at most two years to get friends if I go somewhere because like I said I’m bad with people, and I’m not very outgoing. my usual pass time when I don’t have anywhere to be I just sit on a bench and peel leaf stems, I did this for a full two years at the second school I went to. 
I don’t have many skills, I’m a slow reader, slow writer, I’m shit at peeling leafs, slow at typing (like seriously you don’t want to know how long it took me to get to here) , bad at video games even though it’s my only hobby and I’m actually probably worse at making online friends than I am at making real one, in real life you at least need more than three fingers to count all the friends I’ve ever had, I’ve never made one online friend in my ten years of gaming.

To try to make a long story longer we were close,  she had a good relationship with my parents and vice versa. the thing that caught me off guard was how it ended because things were going good for me and for us , well i believe so and then it ends outta nowhere. that was my senior year and on the week of my birthday lol i was hurt. few months later and us not talking she still shows up to my graduation cus that’s what she said she was going to do and we hung out afterwards just talking and catching up and then she hits me with that there’s someone else. mannnnnnn and all i could say is that im happy for her. we were kind of mutual then but i wouldn’t say we’re friends. and that was in 2016. Before i was used to being with her almost everyday etc and getting used to being alone was tough but i become comfortable with being by myself which is still a process from 2016 to now. i came across cool individuals and some not so cool and for the females i had my bad days but the good times makes up for it aha. started focusing on myself more, working on consistency and went back to school trying to stay busy with that and work. thing is this isn’t the first time she hmu but how it goes is we’ll talk for a few days and maybe a week at most then it dies down but picks back up months later and it’s random. first occasions she had problems with the dude she still with and me being a simp i was just listening to her problems and try to comfort her. but now it isn’t like that but more so of it being casual. idk it just feels weird im sure it’s nothing but it’s nice to have a convo with her and talk about life but it’s weird going from being more than friends to just friends. Supposedly she’s down to hang out but idk. i’m dating someone now too but it’s currently a long distance thing. knowing that nothing in life is guaranteed im learning to enjoy every moment and take it day by day but i feel like with things getting better for myself things just get weird again. for anyone that actually read this thanks for your time. i don’t really go on reddit, and hope everyone is having a good year",31Jan2020,1

79," 

I know it probably sounds daft but the documentary had some terrifying cases of this, including a woman who survived it, it was a woman in her 30's and she said she suddenly felt hot in her throat, and then flames started spewing from her mouth. She drank water and the fire was put out, but she sustained 3rd degree burns to her stomach and intestines and had a scar on her abdomen because of the heat of the fire coming from her gut.

The others weren't so lucky and were found reduced to a pile of ashes. For example there was one where a son was talking to his mother upstairs, then he went downstairs for 15 minutes. He then came back up to find his mother was burned to death in her chair, with her legs and arms and head intact but the stomach area was completely burned out and reduced to ashes.

Ever since that I can't stop thinking my gut will suddenly catch fire. The documentary had a British chemist named John Emsley mention that our guts produce a self-combusting liquid called diphosphane but in tiny amounts, too small to cause self-combustion, but in some cases it can produce too much and this ignites all the other flammable stuff in the gut and can blow a hole through the abdomen in some cases as it's more like a fiery explosion.

Another terrifying fatal case was witnessed by relatives and the woman was just reading a newspaper when suddenly blue flames burst from her mouth and gut area before she died. The documentary had a terrifying reconstruction of this, specifically when her relative looked away for a second and suddenly saw flames in the corner of his eye, only to see her spewing flames out of her mouth and abdomen like a dragon, while she was completely motionless/in shock.

Ever since I can't stop thinking about my gut just bursting into flames and burning to death from it. I always have a glass of water next to me in case it happens, and when I go to sleep I have a 2 L bottle of water next to me. I hate being human sometimes our bodies are so badly designed, I've never heard of birds exploding into flames and there's like a hundred times more birds than people.

Whenever I'm talking with friends I get anxious, thinking they might suddenly start having fire bursting out their mouth and gut, then keel over and burn to death from the inside out, and imagining how traumatised I'd be if that happens. This case is one of the most haunting ones for me - [https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1034226](https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1034226)

80,"My girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year, and words cannot justify how perfect she is and how amazing our relationship is. 

We have never been in a fight or anything close to an argument, we’ve never even been mad at each other. At *most*, I’ve been maybe slightly annoyed at her for being late. It’s like she can just do no wrong. One time, I found a French fry on the floor of my carpet, I immediately suspected my roommate and was annoyed, but then I realized it was my girlfriend and just thought “Aw she didn’t get to eat that.” Lol. 

I can’t believe how much our values and desires for the future are the same. I had delayed talking about kids for a long time with her, that’s been a difficult area in many previous relationships for me, and I always felt it was too early to bring up. However, just last weekend she finally asked me how many kids I want, I was honest and said “literally as many as physically and financially possible” and she told me that she wants a big family too. She then jokingly said “only boys though” which was too funny to hear because I’m always joking with my friends and family that I’m only having boys. 

I’m religious and she’s not, but every Sunday morning she is ready for church even before I am. Even on the days I don’t feel like going, she’s at my door telling me that we are, and every time I have to pinch myself to make sure I’m not dreaming. 

I never thought that “acts of service” was a love language of mine, and maybe it’s not, but the trouble my girlfriend goes to in easing my burdens is so amazing. Not only does she instinctively know what I need, but does it without hesitation and even against my insistence. She just always wants to help and won’t take no for an answer and it is just so damn sweet. 

She also cares so much about my career success and provides so much moral support and encouragement, along with genuinely challenging my ideas and forcing me to think. She’s sharp as a whip, and sometimes we’ll get in little debates and I’ll just be totally stumped by her, which I think is just fantastic. 

I think the thing that sets her apart from other relationships I’ve been in is her ability to tell what’s really important to me and her desire to act in accordance with that. To this day it blows my mind to see how much effort she puts in with my family. My little sister has awful social anxiety, and my girlfriend makes an effort almost daily to text her just to chat, and always wants to hang out with her. My parents too, I have never had my parents give such rave reviews after meeting a girl, but they just adore my girlfriend. 

It’s still early in the grand scheme of things, but I honestly want to marry her. I’m not going to propose anytime soon or anything, but I just don’t have a single doubt. This woman will be my wife and the mother of my children one day.",31Jan2020,1

At the camp I met a girl who I very much liked and we started dating a few weeks after the start of the semester. Sadly things did not last and we broke up before the end of the semester. 

Yesterday I found out that the counselors at the camp, who were college juniors and seniors, placed bets on the freshman who they thought would come out as gay. Apparently I was the winner, as in most of the counselors thought I was gay, which is definitely not true. I wrestled in high school, so maybe it takes a little more to make me uncomfortable than normal and sometimes I like to have some stupid fun.

I’m not really sure what to think about that. Do I really act like I’m gay. I wonder if the girl I was dating last semester thought that originally.

88,"Today i went to see a psychologist. 2,5 year ago i stole my parents car and fled to another country. I had a very (actual) toxic friend with whom i spend all my time, for like around 7 years i think. We went to the same school. Graduated from the same school, then got the same job and finally moved in with each other. It was horrible. He used to beat me up real bad on a daily basis throughout years, and i think its kind of a miracle im alive. He broke my arm and my jaw in 2 places and i have several scars on my head on my eyebrow and under my eye and shitloads on top of my head like under my hair so you dont see it. Just to give an example; he used to choke me til i passed out and i would wake up without breath because he was stomping on my stomach or he would trash the whole apartment by basically throwing me around everywhere. Anyways i could keep on talking about what he did but thats why im seeing a psychologist right. So i went there today. I took the rest of the day off and im now home in bed reflecting on what we talked about. What baffles me the most, when telling her this is the way she reacted basically. She kept it professional but she kept saying how shocking it was. That 7 years was such a long time and shocking how this could have occured on such a long term. And she was like: usually when people are going through similar events, they would be absolutely traumatized, and dealing with a lot of anxiety and/or depression but based on what you are telling me you are not depressed or anxious, and you seem to be doing really well, everything considered. And she is right also. I kinda learned to live with it. The first year i had constant nightmares and i was really anxious. But now not anymore. I can think and talk about it without it really taking over my whole mind. She also said it seemed more like i was overworked, because i also told her about my job now and im working too much and im a little stressed. But yea im feeling good about this and i think it is the right time for me now to be talking to someone professionally about it because i am actually able to talk about it now and it feels like a step in the right direction.

Immediately I noticed that people on the subway were treating me differently. I was wearing the same clothes, same long bulky coat, same shoes, and from the back you can't tell anything about me - if I'm old or young, pretty or ugly, fat or thin. All you can see is the length of my hair.

And ever since I cut it, people have been pushing me more, knocking their bags against me more, and just generally acting like I'm not worthy of the same respect as anybody else.

It's freakish and I never expected it.

I've been fatter and thinner and I've seen a difference how I'm treated like that too - people are nicer to me when I'm thinner. I'm talking about a very small difference in weight, and yet it's enough to get people to be nicer to me.

Not that I’m at ease, staying outside when raining, but my habitat is inside. I just like the rain to be there. A quiet, yet inspiring friend.

Gloomy days are energizing for me like sunny days are for others.

Days you are invited to stay indoors. More silent days. Made for reflection.

Purification from the distracting excesses of the world.

When others feel boredom, I feel energies flowing. Energies guarded inside, that find their right environment to come out.

So, I find myself having those energies circulate in my mind, or streaming through the keyboard, in some form. For me, it means to be alive, with purpose.

But today, rain is simply cold. A wet and detached entity that permeates reality. No eyes. No mind. No will.

All that remains is frozen stillness.

I’m pushed into the depths of my emotions, to find only icy caves. Caverns where perhaps someone once lived.

I emerge from there with a different identity. That of an observer. Without expectations, without memory. Cold.

94,"English has suffered many changes through time, such as the appearance and disappearance of new words, which directly impacts syntax, phonetics and so on. Since English phonetics make no sense whatsoever, we will talk about the changes these have suffered through time, and the subtle differences according to its geographical location. 
Nowadays, there are almost 20 native English speaking countries and, according to a World Atlas article, two of them are in the top ten most visited countries in the world. So imagine all the diverse cultures, which at the same time, bring alongside them different ways of speaking (mostly accents), what we now know as idioms. 
It also creates a more pronounced difference when these foreign speakers start a community, like Chinatown. Slowly but surely, the use of these idioms starts to be frequent until we reach a point where it becomes a standard, therefore, creating a new term. 
But foreign speakers are not the only ones that make changes to the English Language. According to the Linguistic Society of America, the main reason of change are teenagers and young adults, the interaction of these two entities make way for new phrases, words, and structures that older generations wouldn’t understand.  
Change is part of a language, so, it’s only natural to have more idioms and words every generation. The only sad part is that some of them are left behind/forgotten in the prior generation.

105,"This morning, I was approached by my roommate saying he intends to move in with his girlfriend after our lease is up in about six months. We have been roommates for about four years now.


You know, it's weird. It is natural over time that people will begin to focus more on their romantic relationships than friendly ones. Makes sense to want to move in together. So why do I feel some type of way about this?


Maybe because I've been kind of envious of relationships for a while now. Was thoroughly convinced I was asexual and aromantic for the vast majority of my life, only recently being more accepting that I might instead just be some version of queer with deep intimacy and trust issues. So until recently, I was pretty indifferent to cynical about relationships after seeing a number of relationships in my family fall apart violently. But now when I see couples together, two folks that are really able to trust and sync with one another, I both deeply appreciate what they have and feel empty considering I don't and can't see myself having that. It is not at all wanting someone to have physical intimacy with; I really want a close and trusting dynamic like that. A best friend. A partner.

I've never experienced attraction to my roommate; he has just been someone both location-wise and emotionally close until recently. So maybe that is the other reason why I am upset by this. This is all a reminder that I am just kind of losing relevance, falling behind. Not growing up while those around me are and are going to do their own thing. I don't want to force myself into dating to try to escape this, and I have too much shit to sort out before I can be trusting enough to even try dating. But I'm not okay with being alone, either.


I get why a lot of you folks get into relationships now. It really must be nice when it works out, huh?",31Jan2020,1
106,"I normally don't talk about personal matters online, but...it's a rough time right now and it's only gonna get rougher. My grandpa has Alzheimer's and a slew of other health issues and now my grandma got diagnosed with breast cancer. A month ago everything was okay. Christmas day, we noticed her arm was swollen and it's all gone downhill so quickly since then. Spread to the lymph nodes, chemo starts soon, modified racial mastectomy, God knows what else is coming if it spreads more. Most of the time it doesn't feel real, like I just have trouble wrapping my head around it and then reality hits hard when I least expect it. At this rate my grandpa will be the healthier one, which is just mind boggling.

Crocheting is probably my favorite hobby alongside writing and now it hurts a little bit because my grandma is the one who got me started. 

No matter how slowly these developments come it won't be easy but it's barely been a month and just been nonstop more bad news after the other. I would've never imagined a swollen arm would lead to this. I'm trying to stay strong because no one needs me boo-hooing around but now I just come home and cry after every time I visit.",31Jan2020,1

109,"16, male. Have some pain on the right side under my chest/the lower part of it. It isn't muscle soreness. The pain feels a little bit ""deeper"". I don't feel it all the time. And the pain isn't like bad at all, but there's some pain still that is easily noticable and i'm afraid of it. Also, I noticed when I breath deep, and the breath out it hurts the most. Yesterday when my mom picked me out from school I had this same pain in the car, but I felt it all the time instead of sometimes and then when I breath deep in and out. And the pain was yesterday a little bit worse. I had it for like 5min of the car ride. Now this just came out of nowhere again, like 2 hours ago.

The pain isn't that bad that I have to take ibuprofen or something like that, but i'm really afraid of this. I feel some ""pressure"" I would say, all the time in there, but it mostly hurts when I breath in and out especially if I take a deep breath. Sometimes it hurts for like 10sec a little bit more even if i would be holding my breath for example, but it doesn't hurt much at all.

And also forgot to mention, when I breath in and out, especially if I take a deep breath, it hurts on the whole lower chest/maybe slightly under it idk, instead of just the right side. I also worked out yesterday and did some chest work, but, as I already said this isn't soreness, and I had this same thing yesterday in the car when my mom picked me up, and at that moment i hadn't worked out yet.

111,"Was friends with benefits.she is one of the few people who can make me laugh and i enjoy just talking to her. Then just friends who would cuddle. She told me about a married couple she is having sex with and i got really upset, i imagine it is much better than when we used to have sex and im buying her dinner and taking her places. A few days later we had some foreplay and touched each other naked. The day after she said how bad i was while saying how great everyone else is at sex. I flipped out and argued for hours. She told me she had no sexual interest in me, i said i dont want to spend money on you anymore but will share. 

Since then everytime she mentions who she is having sex with i lose it and argue a little .told me she is having a threesome on her birthday .we went to the movies, she bought her own ticket and i bought soda and popcorn. Yelled at me a couple times over nothing. i said i dont want to take you anywhere anymore. Texted me and said a friend she likes visited who does not like her back, gave her advice.

115,"Hard to put a title on it. I don't have a family. Not really, at least. A father, brother and a grandmother. Mother died when I was 12. I'm 24 now. None with the best social skills. I see them a few times a year. We never call except to talk about when I want to visit them. Conversations don't flow freely. Especially with my father, you have to really dig and ask specific questions if you want to know what he has been doing lately. Mom was a drug addict, so me and my brother lived in an orphanage (an awesome one, BTW) from I was 7-10. Then we moved back in with our mother, until she died 2 years later and our father was stuck with us. We were fed, and had a roof over head, but that's it. Brother has his own problems. We don't talk.

The people closest to me have always been the boyfriends I've had, and their families. I was always more sad to not see them again than the ex. My social skills got better each boyfriend, and I really do feel I'm quite good, most of the time. I don't know exactly what it is, but I apparently give off a vibe that makes me not approachable. Meaning, in my class, I have good energy with them during class or when we're put together in groups, but I've never been asked if I wanted to go to their parties or do something together after school. It's probably because I don't really want to, so that's fine. But it isn't a vibe I'm giving consciously, so I don't know what i would do if I someday wanted friends outside of class or my boyfriend's friends. I feel like being who I am, maybe because I'm introverted, I don't have any spare time left for more friends. Maybe if there were more hours in a day, but I need my time alone/at home. I don't want to cut down on it. 

My only ""friends"" are my boyfriends friends. Those are just his brother and the brothers girlfriend, mostly. We don't chat outside of in person. We see each other a few times a month usually, either by going to the movies, brunch or a family gathering at their parents house. They are all lovely people.

What really made me think I maybe had a problem, and maaaybe I should do something, is that my boyfriend recently told me what his family think of me. They think I'm a nice person, and they can clearly see how much me and my bf love each other. But they want to get to know me more. They think I'm hard to approach, hard to talk to. I'm too quiet. They're worried I don't like them. 

I personally thought I was doing really well with his family. I had no idea they had a problem with me, if you can call it that. I don't know what to do. I don't know if it's just me, but when we are together, either just my bf, his brother and his girlfriend, or the whole family, they mostly talk about other people in their family. That did this or that. Or this happened to that family member. Or their childhood.

I don't feel like I have any input on these kinds of topics. I'm not familiar with family activities because of how my own family is. So I stay quiet unless I see my chance for a comment here or there. No questions are ever really directed at me. So it feels like it's up to me to change something. I don't know how. I really don't want to feign interest in things I'm not interested in. I don't want to ask questions I don't actually want the answer to.

My bf telling me this, when I thought all was fine, and great in my mind, broke me a little.",31Jan2020,1

Well recently I've struggled with myself since the beginning of January and I completely lost the path in my life.   


I'm living with my girlfriend. We rent a room in quite big apartment and it doesn't cost much (\~20% of our monthly incomes). After the holiday break in December (I'm living in a Catholitic country) I can't force myself to go to work. Every day I wake up at 6 am and prepare some food for my gf, because she goes to work earlier than me. After she leaves, instead preparing myself to work, I turn on the computer and start playing games and watching Youtube. I'm working in sales helpline, but it is so boring. A couple lines to learn and 8 hours straight reading the same text. I hate convince people to buy something. I hate pitching people. Thats why I hate come there, but in December I had motivation to go there because i needed money. As much as I work, I earn as much. Well i worked literally 2 days in January, and the main reason I didnt come there is that I feel that I'm not improving in my life at all.   


Whenever my gf comes back to home, I had to lie, how it was at work. Additionaly I have debts (4 credits) and tuition fee for uni. I can't restore financial stabilization and i pay my debts after the deadline. The problem is that the month ends and I will get literally the money form 2 days.   


Sometimes when I'm bored I send some CV's but completely no-one is responding withing this month.   
Every day I feel like a trash, and I know that at some time I will lose my gf I love, and I can lose trust from the family (they don't know about debts)

I feel like I'm double-faced, because I'm lying myself that next day i go to work, but after that I just do regular things. I can't quit the comfort zone, because I feel the time I spend in this work is unproductive but i need money and can't figure it out how to solve this problem.

Ever since I was little I felt depressed, life never really made sense to me, I hated going to school, and the idea of growing up to work all the time so I could afford to live in an apartment and have everyday be the same seemed dismal (cliche existential dread I know) , anyway eventually I came to the conclusion that the hobo life was the life for me, and I now had something to live for, I waited until I graduated highschool (a year early) and hit the road much to my family's disapproval, I didn't tell them where I was going and I didn't keep in touch with them while I was gone, Ive been on the road about 2 years now and i hitchhike and panhandle to get around

133,"Maybe this isn't a embarrassing as I think it is, but I felt like getting it out and seeing what people think about it. So, I was drunk in a hotel room because I was flying out of a state that I don't live in the day after to my home state. I'm also in my early 20s. I decided to make my stay in the hotel night a little bit more interesting and started drinking. I was bored and horny and started to swipe on Tinder and matched with a guy. Keep in mind, all of my family and friends think i'm straight. It's not that I am in the closet about my sexuality, but I don't find who I wanna fuck to be important, so I don't haven't told anyone because no one has never asked. The same guy I just matched with wanted me to add him on Snapchat. I did mention to him that I was drunk in a hotel room. I added him and he added me back. We started sexting and he started to send pics and videos and then asked me to send a picture of my dick. The worst part was I couldn't get it up and sent a pic anyways... From what I can tell, he didn't screenshot the pic, but he did leave me on read after that. Immediately after that, I felt extremely embarrassed and unmatched him on Tinder. Maybe this is just my anxiety, but I feel like this could somehow get shared to my friends and what not and they will see me in a different light because of it. Is something I should worry about affecting the way people see me? Or will people just think of it as something stupid I did while drunk?",31Jan2020,1

135,"I had a crazy morning.  My mom and I went to Walmart to get a few things for tonight's dinner, and it was freaking PACKED.  I'm not sure if there's an event going on or something, but the entire store was just in full hysteria.  

Anyway, we're at the self-checkout about to pay like normal human beings when I hear someone say ""OW!""  I just looked out of reflex and there was this little girl, probably about 6 or 7 who had her hand on her thigh like it hurt.  Her older sister goes ""Hey man, what the fuck?"" and there's some guy walking away.  He fucking winked and bit his lip at them like he was the shit.  Turns out that he groped the little girl super hard.  By the time everything was over, she was starting to bruise up.

I'm honestly pretty embarrassed of how angry I got.  Seeing the guy just walk away with the most cocky look on his face made me lose it.  It was basically the same face  my dad made after he hurt me.  So I just rushed the dude and was hoping to tackle him, but next thing I know, I'm on the ground with a burning in my lungs.

Obviously with my loud footsteps, he heard me and turned around to punch me.  He ended up getting me straight in the middle of my chest.  At this point, I was literally too angry to care.  I got up and was about to probably get my ass handed to me when the older sister straight up superman punched the dude.  I've seen a few people get KO'd, but I've never heard a smack that loud come from such an innocent looking girl.

So the guy stiffened up and stayed down for a bit while some store employee came to see what the fuss was all about.  The guy woke up after a few seconds.  He looked so confused.  He just stared at the girls for a solid minute before he realized what was going on.

The girls are from the Middle East, so he starts going to town on slurs that I've never even heard of.  At this point, my mom is probing me for any injuries and the older sister is doing the same with the kid.

138,"To get this long story you could either read it All or skip to the (TLDR).

Ok we’re gonna need some background so...
Back in grade 6 I liked this girl, and she had feelings for me back, I confessed to her and it went on for some time, but it didnt work because I had to do my separate thing and didnt give her the much needed attention, (I know I should’ve been better but sorry for everyone who’s aggravated with me), I apologised to her when she was giving signs that it wouldnt work, I was shy around her after that incident, and after some time she got another boyfriend.

Fast forward to the present, I’m second year in highschool now, Im still shy around her, but we talk sometimes now not like before where we didnt talk for months almost going for a whole year! Now I’ve heard she broke up with her boyfriend, and she was interacting with me more often now, and after sometime I heard the truth of the break up, her boyfriend was a total dick.
Now we All knew this From the start, but didnt really know why she chose him, cause she’s relatively a Smart person, so you wouldnt know why she chose him.
Ok back to the story, I heard that he cheated on her because he got popular on social media particullarly tiktok and twitter, (the former one is disqusting ik) and he flirted with other tiktok’ers and instagramers, (HE FLIRTED WITH PEOPLE HE DIDNT KNOW,) now since they’re strangers he mustve flirted with them since because they look good.
He’s done a lot of shitty things like: giving our Class Rep anxiety by saying he doesnt deserve his grades because he gets exempted and he doesnt do tests (he [the Class rep] gets exempted because he represented the School in journalism), he says fake gossip about people, he spouts his mouth about everybody’s secrets.
So yeah he’s a dick.

[TLDR]: My ex who I dont talk to (not because of bad terms) is engaging with me more, after I heard she broke up with her boyfriend who cheated on her because he got popular on social media.
