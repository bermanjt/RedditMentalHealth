0,"I don’t know what it is. So far, in a span of 28 days, I’ve felt many things, and been through many things. 

I turned 19. 
I watched two houses full of puppies. 
And fell down a flight of steps at one of those houses, which made me laugh really hard for no good reason once I got to the bottom. 
I started my second semester of college. 
And probably failed my first quiz of the semester today. Which is okay. It’s not the end, it’s just one grade. 
I said yes to going to my first concert/live event. 
And then was surprised with concert tickets, which makes two live events this year. 
I’ve already been sick. Not with the corona virus, but sick. 
My friend’s mom had a cancer scare. 
My best friend began talking to a boy, which in turn has lead me to feel misplaced. 
Said friend only speaks to boy about life nowadays, and I have been pushed to the side, almost. 
I paid my first credit card bill - a mistake I made only so my family could be happy (I got it to buy Christmas gifts). 
I went to the first work meeting of the year, and one of my favorite residents gave me a hug, and said she missed me. 
I started taking serious care of my skin. I did last year, but now I’ve gone full force.
Oh. And my sims got married. 

In 28 days, all of that has happened. And there’s so much more to come. But I don’t even know who you are. You probably don’t know who I am either. Which is fine, I guess. 

Happy 2020, fellow Redditors. I wish you luck with the next 28 days.",29Jan2020,2

4,"I always have bad thoughts about people who won’t give me what I want or I think are annoying or harmful in some way.

For example, I remember at my grandma’s funeral when I was around 10 that I wasn’t sad at all, I was just bored, but then I realized she wouldn’t be around to give me money at the holidays anymore, which made me feel sad, and then I cried because I realized that I was selfish since the only thing that made me feel sad about her not being around was money.

Also, I have diagnosed autism. My ex roommate also had autism. I still see her sometimes. She used to (and still does) stim by running around and it makes me feel uncomfortable because she runs fast and I can feel her footsteps vibrating when she runs, which I find unpleasant. It’s ultimately harmless but she said she can’t stop it and I’m not entitled to her stopping either but I feel like I am and I feel malicious when I ask her to not do it around me since she can’t stop it.

That’s also not the only thing she does that I find makes me feel annoyed or uncomfortable. I also find other things that she can’t control annoying, like her voice and the way she looks. I often have very mean thoughts about her like “I wish she would fail out of college or get expelled so I would never have to see her again” or “God she is useless”.",29Jan2020,1

Today I sat and wallowed in the apparition of our relationship. Listening to every song I know to bring silence to my thoughts. Silence is all I yearn for since I met you. Before you my mind was as quiet as a monk. But now its like a mom at a small town grocery store after a pta meeting.  However this ticking time bomb strapped to my heart feels as if it’s reaching its final digits. And however this turns out  I hope I can bring forth strength enough to survive friendship.

only to then get a an adrenaline boost , get tons of inspiration only to then fall back to your useless ways. this has happened to me plenty of times as well 

the reality with these kinds of videos are that if consumed The wrong way you end up wasting time , trying to stop wasting tIke

the reality is that if you want to stop procrastinating and improve your life in general , you aren’t going to be able to do it by watching YouTube videos because the only time in which you get the advice and inspiration is by doing the wrong thing.

you can’t laern to stop procrastinating while procraststing

Lately i've been feeling lonely, u know the need of an hug by a soft and scented girl, need some affection, and i tried things like going to parties (as much as possible, social anxiety aside) and dating apps, but i keep finding boring people or girls that are cute but don't have interests in me.

She looked scared at first but totally melted when I just said ""hi, are you okay?"" She said she was so I asked if she could use a hug, which she accepted, and she hugged me for quite a while. Then she said I'm an angel and I left to go home. 

I used to do stuff like this a lot, and stopped because interacting with others causes a lot of anxiety for me. But realizing that simply asking someone if they are okay and giving them a hug makes them think I'm an angel makes me also realize I shouldn't have stopped. 

We're all better off when we help each other. No, I don't know what was bothering her. She didn't offer that info and I didn't think I needed to ask. I think she just needed that hug and I'm glad I gave her one.",29Jan2020,42
16,"My depression has been in a bad place lately guys. I’m not suicidal or harming myself, so it’s not to that degree. I just feel so... numb and empty. 

I’m just not where I’d thought I’d be at 25 years old. Good things: I have a decent paying job in a field I’m passionate about, I have an apartment to myself, I have one close friend I text almost everyday and I have the cutest doggo who loves to cuddle. Bad things: a boyfriend I hardly see since he’s in the army, family that lives an hour and a half away, A father who passed away last year, and no friends who live near by. I guess I always pictured myself to be married with a huge group of friends and a baby on the way at this point... but after I get off work, I just come home and sit on the couch and watch YouTube or Netflix until it’s time to go to bed.

It takes everything in me to do basic chores and to get up in the morning. I just want to be happy like when I was a kid again. But I don’t think that will ever happen. 

And I know some of you are going to suggest therapy and anti-depressants and don’t worry, once my health insurance through my new job gets activated, I’ll continue therapy and Prozac again.

20,"Today was bad.  Reaaaally bad.  My life has drastically gone down hill.....and I'm tired of living.  I don't want to at all anymore.  I've suffered from depression and anxiety most of my life.  Diagnosed.  In the nut house a couple times.  ODSP and all that good stuff.  Today though...lol today was almost more than i could endure.  I didn't keep a promise.  I always keep my promises.  Today I didn't and it made someone's life completely worse.  It's one thing for me to fuck up my own life, but to harm someone else....to ruin their life worse than they already have...is something I can't handle.  

My ex is in jail.  For domestic abuse.  To me.  That's the part where he ruined his life.  Some of you may think i'm nuts for trying to help him.  Some of you may think 'Oh goood looorrd, another stupid, needy, soft moron girl, thinking he'll change for her, so she's trying to free his woman beating ass'.  You would be wrong.  I'm pretty strong.  I don't want to be back with him.  He's sick.  Mentally.  I've done soooooo much research.  He needs help so badly, and I promise jail is not the place to get it.  They have such limited resources.  I'm not trying to free him either.  I was trying to get him moved to a psychiatric facility, where they could better treat him.  And I failed.

He took it to trial.  I promised I'd help no matter what.  I guess i lied because half way through the trial, where i was testifying, we stopped for lunch and when i came back (after bawling for a good full hour), i received news through victim services, who was notified by the crown, that my ex just pled guilty to all charges.  He did so, because as i was walking out the court doors for lunch, i'm positive he probably saw me start to cry.  He didn't want me to go through what his lawyer was about to put me through.

Today I not only failed myself (which i'm use to), but I failed another human being so badly that I question why i'm even here.  I just wanted to help and i made it ten times worse.   That would be the part where i helped someone ruin their life even more than they did.   I hate me.",29Jan2020,2

I’m not one of those girls that says “i hang out with boys cause theres less drama.” I’m super close with mostly guys but i LOVE my girlfriends and i just get along with every girl i meet.
Growing up, my dad aways had a group of friends who all had children my age. The only thing is, they were all guys, 4 guys, and we were all best friends since birth. We’re 20 and still hang out 1-3 times a week and take camping trips. 
I guess growing up with guys so close to me, i just knew how to talk to them as friends and yes i’m a little funny from being around all those dads and my friends. 
In high school i had a few close girl friends but usually hung out with a bigger group of guys who i was more close with. We all only saw each other as friends, that’s it. One time we were all hanging out and playing pool and my friend Tom pointed me and said “you’re one of the boys.” and all the other guys agreed. It’s really fun being one of the guys, i know everything since i’m the most trustworthy. I’ve helped them over the years with all their girl questions and they helped me with my boy questions, we’re completely open. I’ve drunkenly kissed 2(both single) of them but it was platonic. 
There are 2 groups of guys that have told me i’m one of the boys, so i’m not sure what i’m doing to make this happen.
I really like being one of the boys it’s fun.

btw i’m high so sorry for this mess :’)",29Jan2020,2
24,"Psychological**



Some stuff just lines up, and its crazy how accurate it can be. Heres what i mean...



I plan on traveling this summer. Living in my vehicle and backpacking throughout many of the national forests. Just me and my doggo. I feel doing this will allow me to know my ""true self"", and just to be happy, i suppose. Get away from all the anxieties of my current circumstances. 


I listen to alot of philosophical teachings. Mainly, Alan Watts. I was in a brief area of zen while listening to this little bit -



He’s gone away into the forest to find out who he really is, because it’s very difficult to find that out while you’re with other people. And the reason is that other people are busy all the time telling you who you are in many many ways: by the laws they impose on you, by the behaviors they set on you, by the things they tell you, by the fact they always call you by your name, and by the fact when you live among people you have to be in a state of ceaseless chatter. But if you want to find out who you are before your mother and father conceived you, who you REALLY are, you almost have to go off by yourself.



Go into the forest and stop talking, even stop thinking words and be absolutely alone and listen to the great silences. Then, if you’re lucky, you recover from the illusion that you’re just “little me” that so-and-so and you attain a state of Nirvana which means the “blown out” state, the relieved state, a sigh of relieve. Nirvana maybe translated into English as “phew, I’ve at last discovered that I don’t have to survive”. I can survive, of course, but I don’t really have to. Because you discover, you see, that what you really are doesn’t have to survive because it’s what there is! The real you is it, or that. “Tat Tvam Asi”, “That art thou” as the hindus say.

-end of quote

It had me at the beginning, talking about going into the forest and listening. But when he added the bit about Nirvana being translated to ""phew"", i couldnt help but chuckle. All because i constantly say phew. 



I just feel all this is telling me im on the path im meant to be on.

God, with abilities that I occasionally able to use. I can be the strongest person in any when I feel that anger swelling inside and I just feel super human and I can talk to myself and unlock these unheard of powers God. I can lift people up and slam them, I can use the attacks you have blessed me with within my sportive contexts, and I could use them to thrive.

I have defeated the undefeated, I have defeated so many ranked contestants in the sport of wrestling, I have effortlessly defeated so many people, and I have been with in reach of other ranked opponents. But no matter what, these past few matches I have failed myself. It is not about my team. It’s not about representing my team. It’s about myself.

I know what you have made me capable of and I have not been living up to his potential and I’m asking you to help me reach the point where I know I am at. I know I am at the national or international level at the bare minimum. I know I am the greatest.

Get me to the point where I could utilize my anger and overpowered anybody regardless of the size differences, The same way you have allowed me to do this before. Make me the powerful beast that I know I am and I know that I have been before. I’ve been at levels before where I felt like I’m barely tapping my potential and still I am absolutely dominating everyone in the room. But as of late, I have not been at that place. I’ve just been getting defeated.

Maybe it’s my attitude. I allow people to mess with me too much. I could be using this time where people are messing with me to get better. These are people who I know that if I were to throw down with him I would win, but I feel this self doubt that stops me from just punching them in the face. Give me the certainty to go out there and sock somebody to stop them from messing with me.

Give me the work ethic to be able to continue working when my body tells me it can’t work any harder

Give my body the fortitude to continue to work at the level it is capable of performing at when my mind refuses to let me push through.

Give my body the consistency to always be the energizer bunny that it has been in the past occasionally. There have been times where I’ve been able to go out there and give my 100% effort from the start of a match to the end of the match and recently this has failed me.

Give my body the consistency to always have the strength and explosiveness and raw Pulling force to accomplish the feats of athleticism which I perform so inconsistently.

Give me the intellectual capacity to predict the techniques my opponent plans to use, and counter them accordingly, just as in the past you have intuitive we allowed me to respond in situations.

In my young life it feels like my prime is behind me. It feels as though my prime was in the summer when I worked so hard and accomplish things which I no longer am capable of. Just logically speaking this should not be the case. My prime should not be until my late 20s, This is not what you have in store for me. I have so much more than I am capable of accomplishing.

38,"I’m 16, male, junior year of high school. Basically my one major goal I want to overcome is to be less awkward and be more confident in myself. Ever since high school started I’ve been very wary of what people think of me, yes I’m one of those people. I just recently had that self realization that I’m super insecure about myself and that might be my biggest personal flaw. I mean since high school started I’ve avoided lost and lots of social events at school. I’ve never been to formal and I’ve only been to like two football games! The reason is because i never wanted to be in a situation where I’m just standing around awkwardly not knowing how to properly act in the environment. I also just get super insecure when someone says something about me, I have a duck walk and my friends constantly joke about it, I know they’re not trying to be mean but I seriously get insecure about it. Anyway I’ve gotten better as times gone on and since I’ve gotten a job I’ve been relatively more social and talk to people I actually care about. It’s a process but I’m still a always person and I’d love advice on how to stop thinking to much about everything I do.

Next thing I want to talk about is getting a girlfriend. Now I am awful at talking to girls, and I think it stems down to not doing it when I was younger, mainly in middle school, i have noticed every one who “dated, or talked to many girls” in middle school were super good at getting girlfriends. I blame my past for not doing this because when I was in middle school I knew that because of our age it was super cringe to be in relationships but I shouldn’t have cared and practiced back then. Now there is one girl I’ve had a crush for almost 4 years! In my opinion she is by far the hottest girl in the grade and I’ve had so, so many chances to get close to her and it makes me so mad. Now about myself, I don’t want to come off as cocky, cause trust me I’m not but I’ve had several people tell me that if I tried I could get hot girls. In fact a kid who moved to our school district late thought based off my appearance that I was one of the most athletic and popular kids in the grade, which is no where near true lol. Anyway I’m tall, tan, handsome, and have good hair but even knowing all this I’m still awful at talking to girls. Back to the crush she was the first girl to really start befriending me back in 8th grade I eventually DM’d her in instagram and she willingly gave me her number. I vividly remember that being the happiest moment of my life which might be sad but hey I still remember it. However I would only really talk to her when I sat by her and tbh I kinda stopped texting her because I couldn’t think of anything to say which is 100% my fault biggest mistake by far. Later in 8th grade near the end she actually started to hang out with my best friend. This isn’t really bizarre because she’s always and still does have a lot of guy friends, but I totally missed out. If she’s friends with friends then there is a good chance we’ll cross paths well no. :( all through high school I’ve just been awkward around her I even joined cross country which she did but only had one chance to talk to her, helm we even got in the same group for a presentation on a field trip. Now throughout the years I’ve always thought she thinks I’m attractive as she asked to hold my hand as a joke or something idk and if I remember she might have called me cute, still don’t know if it was a joke or not. Now she’s tried to get me to sneak out because she basically best friends with one of my other friends, but I get to worried about sneaking out. I want to try and get close to her because I want to ask her to prom and try and eventually date her. High school is running out of time and I need to act quick but when I talk to her I am always so nervous and never act myself. She is friends with so many do my friends but yet I still fuck up. What do I do?

There were 2 little girls and an adult trying to sell lemonade, but much to their chagrin, a lot of people kept walking by, and admittedly, I was one of those people at first. I kept walking to my girlfriend at the time’s work and delivered her her lunch, and decided that should the lemonade stand be there when I return, I’ll buy a glass. I travelled back the way I came and the lemonade stand was still there, without the adult this time. I asked for a glass and realized all I had was a 20$. After everyone walking by them all day, I didn’t want to be a soul crusher by asking for a glass and then rejecting it for not having the correct amount of cash, so I simply put the 20$ in and walked away.

44,I’ve been struggling emotionally lately and have been feeling very lonely and I’m not very proud of where I’m at in life right now. The other day my coworker who always seems to have his life together and is always happy at work and enjoys life in general stopped me in the back room and said “You know I saw you’re cute face at the registers and all I could think was ‘if I was your dad I’d be so proud!’”,29Jan2020,1

If I won in a way I’m not proud of, that’s it. I need to work to get better moving forward, not sit still wishing the past didn’t happen

I get people have lives and have to address their attention to something else, but at the same time it’s almost hurting when you look back at a text or snap and seen it was sent a couple hours ago, yet they’re active on say Facebook or Instagram. Hell maybe even snapchat as well. I get it if someone is at work or school or has to tend to something at home then they can’t respond, but when you know at a certain time there’s nothing going on it makes you wonder why they can’t respond then.

And it’s weird because I only care about it with one of my friends and with the others it doesn’t bother me. I have knowledge of how her day goes and know when she can and can’t talk, but somedays I feel like when she can respond she just doesn’t want to. Or is probably talking to other people.

52,"So I work back of house at Chick-Fil-A, and there's this guy that has worked with us since July, a few months after I joined. We'll call him Jared. Jared has always been a seemingly normal guy. He's supposedly in college, has a fiancee, and he's always been an alright worker. Over the past month or so though, he would spend long periods of time in the bathroom while on the clock. I'm talking upwards of 30 minutes. To top it off, he would usually claim to be sick when he got back, then he'd just leave for the rest of the night. Me and my buds would joke around after he left about how he was doing it to avoid working or whatever, but it seems oddly suspicious after what I was told tonight, but more on that later.

I always arrive at work an hour or so early to hang out and eat food in the dining area before my shift starts. While I was eating, I saw Jared taking his order in full uniform. The weird thing is, he got it to go instead of dining in, and he just left after getting his food. He wasn't scheduled to work at all today, but he still got an employee meal. I don't know what to think of that. So I started my shift and my manager, we'll call him Justin, immediately told me not to use the back door or to open it for anyone at all, even if they were in uniform. Justin also told me that nobody was to leave the building alone, and that we now had a button that would contact the police when pressed. (It was attached to a lanyard so if someone went outside they could take it with them) My friends and I had no clue what all the new safety stuff was for, so we just joked about it, calling the button things like LifeAlert and a rape whistle.

So closing time comes, and we're doing all the normal stuff. Luckily, tonight the trash was pretty light, so it could all be taken out in one hand. Justin just tells me to take out the trash on my own, but to be quick. He also told me that if I see Jared, I need to *run*. I don't know why Justin picked me of all people to go out alone. I'm a guy, but everyone there knows I'm pretty weak and I definitely couldn't defend myself unless I had a gun or a knife, which I obviously wouldn't have on me in a work setting. Anyway, I take out the trash with no problems and everyone finishes closing. We were told that everyone in the restaurant, Front and Back of house, has to leave at the sams time. when we left, the FOH manager and Justin were holding knives from the kitchen and told everyone (almost all high schoolers, including me) to get to their cars quickly, and they watched us leave while scanning the area.

I really don't know what's going on, but I'm very scared. Jared hasn't been fired or anything, and he's scheduled to work at the same time I am both Thursday and Saturday, so uh wish me luck I guess.",29Jan2020,1

65,"I often feel as if there are two versions of me, two ends to the spectrum that is my personality. Let's call them ""hindsight me"" and ""real-time me"".

Hindsight me is wiser, calmer, and nicer than the counterpart, but it only shows up when I'm alone with my thoughts. Unfortunately, real-time me is the only one people get to interact with, and he's an idiot. He talks too much, speaks without thinking, jumps to conclusions, and often sounds more stressed and agitated than the situation would warrant. He means one thing but says another; gets too stuck on the literal meaning of words and expressions; gets tunnel vision and doesn't realize when it's time to shut up or change the subject. He isn't very good at interpreting body language and nonverbal cues. His efforts to make a good impression often end up making a bad one.

The problem is, I'm not a teenager, I'm past forty. I should've had this insight twenty years ago. I went through life thinking I was smarter than average (don't we all?) but I was just bookish. My emotional intelligence wasn't much to speak of, I now see.

And it still isn't. Just because I realized that my social skills need work, doesn't mean that I automatically know now what to say or do. Only in hindsight am I able to figure out (sometimes) what would've been the right way to behave. It will take a lot of time and effort to relearn how to interact with people.

This large discrepancy between the impression I'm hoping to make and the impression I actually must be making on other people has been there all my life. I've always struggled to make friends, and this makes sense now. I wouldn't like myself either, if I were to judge myself based solely on real-time me.

I've tried to explain this to my wife, but I don't think she gets how shocking this realization has been for me. She loves real-time me: she married him. And though she's happy that I'm working to improve myself, I get the impression that for her it's not as big a deal as it is for me. Maybe this is partly because, though the insight came from hindsight me, it's real-time me who's doing the explaining. (Hindsight me does sometimes show up in my writing, but never in conversation.) I've been having a midlife crisis for years, so this might appear to her as just one more chapter in the endless saga of my mood issues. And maybe she's right, I don't really know. All I know for certain is that I feel like a man with the social skills of a teenager. She deserves a better version of me. I should probably see a shrink about all this, and I will.

One of the most shocking realizations for me was the fact that (years ago, when I was single) on a great many occasions I had been too shy and awkward around women to realize when someone liked me and was giving me an in. I could not read the signs, and even when I saw something that could've been construed as a sign of interest I would err on the side of caution, and do nothing. I hate myself for this. I know I should learn to love myself and accept it and forgive myself and move on... But even though these things happened years ago, I'm bearing the emotional brunt now for the second time. I will move on eventually, but I'm not ready just yet, I'm still grieving. I was so damn lonely in those years, and I kept thinking that no one wanted me when in fact they did, and I was blind. What an idiot!

""But what caused all these revelations?"" I hear you ask. The simple answer is cannabis, loads and loads of it. I'm not recommending anything to anyone and I can only speak for myself, but it has changed my life. I never had any until about a year ago. Since then, I feel it has been rewiring my brain for the better, or anyway doing something to it that's been a great help. I feel I'm now better able to understand how other people see me (though perhaps only in hindsight) and what other people want. I'm still learning and I don't always get it right (and often there's no way to verify if an assumption about someone's motives is correct) but things are looking up.

Does anyone else feel like this? Has anyone else found out they used to be an idiot? And if so, how did you react?",29Jan2020,1

68,"Marisol Lopez, I heard her bawling in the Target parking lot. I sat there in my car for minutes wondering what she was going on about thinking maybe she was in a fight with somebody on her phone.

""Help"" she screamed and I finally ran over. She scared me when she said ""A man is coming"" to a lady from her medical clinic on the phone.

She had a pain in her side like she had been stabbed and she was unable to move, hunched over on her red, mid 90's Geo Prizm. She told me six years ago, when she gave birth to her son she had an epidural and then two seizures and a stroke. 

""I have to go to work"" She said as she cried ""I drive for Uber Eats.” She had just stopped by Target for a chain and a helmet for her bike which I saw crammed in the back seat of her car. She couldn't afford to take another day off because she took time off last week because she was sick and now she needed the money.

The paramedics arrived and I lead them to the car. They asked if I was related and I told them no and they said well I could go so I left to run my errand.

A few minutes later I returned as the last firetruck pulled away. Her car was still there as i noticed the back right window half way rolled down to fit her handlebars. I wrote a note with my email to say I had a new helmet I could give her. When I went to leave it on her windshield the whole wiper blade fell off. It was very old and she probably never had the money to change them.",29Jan2020,1
69,"(I originally wrote this without intention of sharing it, so it's as genuine as it can get. Pass by if you don't like cringe, and thanks internet for complete anonymousness).

This is what it's currently like.

Over the years, I've noticed that I forget the past, and especially how I felt about the routine issues I faced in my regular life, and I only remember either the global stuff, or the most remarkable memories. I wish I could remember some of it. Not for learning from past mistakes or to get some philosophical meaning out of it, but just out of curiosity. It would also help with understanding how I grew up and changed from that point till the present times.
As I'm writing this, I'm not looking back to correct myself or make better sentences - this is not an essay, and I can't get my genuine thoughts written down if I don't let the stream flow. So sorry if this is hard to read. Please don't delete it, you'll want to read it in several more years.

It's currently the end of January, 2020. The internet is going crazy about coronavirus, Kobe Bryant just died, and I recently got into Pokémon Masters. The insanity of my family and disorder of the house only seems to increase as mom and [REDACTED] grow more and more tired, and I can't force myself to take care of the house. [REDACTEDx2] is trying to get us to do stuff with her, but I don't want to - not because of her, but because I don't want to do anything. I wish I was a version of myself that could and would do these things for her because I still remember how valuable it would be for me at her age. 

I can't force myself to do anything. Every day I want to do less and less, I want to disconnect from reality more and more, and I just don't care anymore. Is it laziness or a product of my recent isolation from the outside world? Maybe that and something else, or maybe it's the setback of all the mental health clusterfuck I've had over the past few years. Or maybe I just didn't have the experiences I needed to grow up in a way that would keep me excited and wanting to do things. First I didn't want to do schoolwork, and I nearly failed history on my first trimester, and I'm not passing any classes right now, even though it's past midterm. Then I didn't want to learn, not only programming and science but also new stuff in general. And then I didn't want to take care of my family, and I didn't want to sit at my PC, and now I don't want to be committed to God or get out of my bed. I also don't want to care that I don't care. I remember when I used to feel like I don't want to care about my future or well-being, but now I don't want to care about getting back on track. I don't even know what I want other than for some magic to happen and knock my mind back to where it should be.

I remember back in [REDACTED] when I couldn't make myself go to school, which ended in a complete fucking disaster. Attendance letters, failed classes, family drama, and most of all - I didn't understand what was going on with me, I couldn't come up with an excuse for why I didn't go. As the Red Pill book says, consciousness exists to make excuses for the mind's decisions, but even it was completely out of luck at that point. And now I don't even try to or want to make excuses, I just let my mind do its completely passive thing.

What is it like? I spend most of my time in bed. My sleep schedule is non existent, I can go to sleep at 21, 2, 5, 11, 16, or 20. The first half of my waking hours, I don't even feel like I have any sort of circadian rhythm, and I don't really care what time of day it is. If I get out of bed to do something, unless it's coding or eating that I get caught up in, I want to go back to bed pretty soon. It's funny because I hate being in my bed. The sheet is too warm, my body is too dirty, the pillows are too uncomfortable making my back and arms hurt, and the only thing I can do is be on my phone. My daily life consists of a very limited set of actions, and when I run out of options, instead of having a panic I just kind of give up and come up with something to do on my phone. The set is basically being on reddit, coding, watching Twitch, checking on [REDACTEDx3], eating, making tea, and napping. Now that I wrote it out it's almost laughable how little options there are. And the scariest part is that I don't feel scared or claustrophobic about it. I just feel like it's normal for me to do only these things, as if my life can only consist of them.

I want to get out of it, but I don't know what to do. I want to be free of this prison, but I don't want to do anything to get there. I wish I did better but I can't come up with a plan. I'm failing all of my classes, I have 95 overdue assignments, the material is hard to learn and remember, and I sleep through the class connects. I keep lying to myself saying that no matter what I'll finish them by the deadline, but when will I do it? They only keep piling up and the daily amount is far beyond what I can squeeze out of myself. I can do a quiz or two in a day, and then I just kind of die. I don't even feel like directly disliking the idea of doing it and resisting it, I just don't feel any desire to try to do it in the first place. I'd rather just keep doing my passive thing.

I keep saying that I just want to get past high school and then go to college, and if I had actual motivation to live I'd probably even have a good chance of making something good out of it. I have a talent and I have the resources teaching me the right kind of choices. But, ""at some point it'll get better"" is the only excuse I have for believing that it'll actually happen. I don't know how I will actually proceed, and when will I get out of this mess.

I want to break free but choosing to not do anything is like that time when I chose not to eat when I was hungry because it'll get me to lose weight anyway, and it's not that bad. It's a ""give up"" kind of process, and then I ignore the sparks that would normally ignite an emotion of feeling bad about it.

I'm not sad, not regretful or even angry or disappointed, not wanting to exaggerate or romanticize my problems to feel like they're worth fixing, just completely passive and out of touch with what I'd otherwise be wanting from reality. I don't even wish I could cry or die, I just wish that either I wasn't born in the first place or that I'd gone a better path some months ago, and ended up in a position of continuing my improvement rather than whatever the fuck this is.

I remember when I kind of first realized just how bad it is. When I was playing through ES, I was completely gone from reality, the fictional setting felt more real and, more importantly, much more relevant than real life. It's as if I finally found a life I was excited about having. At that point, my daily schedule got completely annihilated, and I basically didn't do anything other than sleeping, eating, regular Reddit checks, and ES. Now it's a but like that except the world(s) I'm excited for are tiny strings of conversation or information I find on the internet. And I don't have the slightest clue where to even start working on all of this. Guess I'll just go fuck myself.",29Jan2020,1

I have a really strong repultion to being around my mother
I know it sounds weird, and I thought I was just weirdly fucked up but recently my best friend admitted he has a twin brother with who he cut all contact because he felt what sounds like the same kind of repulsion towards him, so maybe thsi is common?

It's not that I hate her, but I feel smothered in her presence. The thought of having her around me is nauseating, holding any kind of conversation with her beyond small talk makes me feel irrationally angry and any phisical co.tact with her makes me want to crawl out of my skin. I used to dread having to say goodnight because she would hug me. Sometomes she touches me without me expecting it and it sends me into a panic. I had to share a room with her last night and I moved my mattress as far from hers as I could and I hid under the blankets all night and couldn't sleep from the awful discomfort simply being in her presence was. Even her coming up in conversations makes me irrationally angry and I shut down. I even seriously considered faking my death and moving to the other side of the world to restart without ever having to acknowledge her anymore (there were a few other reasons but that one was definitely the strongest)
I do't hate her, i'm not mad at her. It's not recent and even though it seems to have gotten worse with age I don't remember a time when it wasn't there.

My bestfriend expressed the same kind of feelings towards his twin brother which is what caused him to cut all contact with him at a young age (i think he stopped communucating with him around age 10 and had his parents put him in a different school around age 13 and he hasn't properly talked to him since. He even denies his existence now because acknowledging him is so uncomfortable and painful).

82,"I left my first job, McDonald’s, last year after a manager was harassing me about my uncle’s death. Every since then I’ve been applying to jobs and feeling all around worthless because I’m not doing anything productive.

I worked at KFC but left after only working three days in the two months I was hired, and worked at Waffle House for two weeks until they told me I didn’t fit their grill position.

I’m tired of working these crappy jobs that barely add any worth to me, I want to do something that I want... Art

Art is my everything, if it was taken away from me, I wouldn’t be me. I study art for hours to learn new techniques and methods, it’s the one thing I always step out of my comfort zone for, and the journey of making a piece feels amazing to me, I want it to be my career... I just don’t know how.

I could go to art school, but it’s too expensive and more and more professionals are encouraging young artists to learn online lately. I’m probably going to continue studying online and just go to community college to improve my foundations. The art professor said that my studies build a decent foundation that the art classes at university can help improve even further, which I believe since while I improve fast because of my studies, I don’t improve as fast as I could because I lack guidance.

86,"I have a more than daily compulsive need to bash my head on the wall, or punch some object right in front of me. When these outbursts occur, i want to act on my instincts, but i don't and it takes so much energy out of me, and it is painful. I have tried expressing this anger through workout or a hobby, but nothing helps. I have obviously tried doing what these outbursts want me to do, but it is compulsive, i get nothing out of it, there is no catharsis. I have acted upon the needs maybe three times in course of 10 years dealing with this issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

This illness has changed me. In desperation to get rid of this, i have found myself to be more forgiving and empathetic towards people in general and who have really hurt me in my life. During my childhood, some people made my life a nightmare. intentionally making my family poor, making us starve and thirst, using my house as an asset of human trafficking and as a brothel... When we got the house back, my 13 year old sister opened up the door to see some police officer, and he wanted to buy sex from my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

I have forgiven them, i have no ill feelings towards these people. Forgiving has helped me emotionally, but the compulsive need to run as fast as i can towards the wall with my head first does not disappear, it is as strong as ever.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, i started to develop (and got diagnosed with) dissociative amnesia, depersonalization disorder and psychosis. These issues would mostly come out during the times i couldn't bare pain from the outbursts. That being said, I have worked on these issues, and the issues now rarely show up. However, i am still left behind with the raging outbursts.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been through therapy for many years now, and although this has helped me with other issues, the main motivation, the main reason why i was interested in therapy in the first place; the issue that i have with compulsive outbursts which i don't act upon - they don't go away. Even opening up, I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding that can help me deal with this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't do anything else but not acting upon it, feeling the urge, pain and all my energy that wastes away. I have worked so hard, to the point that i feel like i do not have any issues, this illness that has changed me to a better human being, it still persists, as strong as it has ever been. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately i am unrecognizable to myself. I could see myself in the mirror, and not know my own face.

Long story short, I’ve been pretty lonely since NYE. It hit me that I have lots of acquaintances and no close friends, and ever since I’ve become aware of the fact I’m not particularly close to/with anybody I’ve been becoming more and more depressed about it (and other things) since time’s moved along. I’m a social person, which I think has led to my problem - I hang out with many people for not very long, which means I have lots of ‘friends’ but no real close friends. I’m not sure how to find someone that I can become closer with. I just thought I’d see if anyone has an idea of how I can put myself out there and find a good friend.

92,"Back in November I met my friends older brother, B. I wasn’t doing good. I’d felt lost and recently was rejected by a coworker who once liked me but refused to give me a chance picking, and rightfully so, a kind, sweet, innocent but also very sheltered girl with no real experience of life

So yes I met B. Instant attraction. I never felt attracted to a guy like this in a long time, due to rejection of my coworker and the sourness I had of guys in general from 2 month long online dating trial. He was an intellectual, sardonic dry humor, cute smile and had so many positives. I was still a bit hurt so I got the idea to just move on pretend I had a boyfriend, B at the time agreed and we pissed my coworker off real good. The sight of seeing me with another guy irked the shit out of him. It was stupid and a one time thing. It helped me move on. However around this time B had a girlfriend, he’d been in almost a two year LDR with a girl in Costa Rica, C. But things didn’t seem right with her, I could tell thus he vented. 

C had slept with another guy(who knows how many times). She only admitted to it when they’d gotten into an argument and she said it in passing with an intent to hurt him. Amongst other issues they kept things from one another, she’d yell at him and make things his fault and he’d apologize for things he didn’t do and she’d hold things over his head and mess with his anxiety. She knew of me and I knew of her cause he’d tell her about his life everyday. I wasn’t thinking, I only wanted sex to be honest, I didn’t want anything else. 

So it happened. she said she didn’t care and gave him a pass noting she cheated on him so now he got to do it. However, after that, things got emotional. I regretfully gave into impulse. 

He was honest with her about me. But then came the emotional part. He started talking about his life and how unhappy he was. He began to admit the mistakes in his life and he looked at me after he said then in shock, and said “I’ve never told anyone any of that before, not even my girlfriend.”
I asked him if he wasn’t happy why didn’t he break up with her. About a week after that conversation he said he did. 

I knew I was a rebound, hell I knew. All I’d wanted was sex, and fun and no commitment or devotion or whatever. so from mid November to mid January that’s what we were. It got to the point that he admitted to starting to develop  feelings for me and yes I did too, but I kept them in check knowing what this all was. We did this behind his brother,J... who is also my friend. No one really knew. We could talk for hours on the phone and just laugh, our personalities just got along like friends do. he’d said on several occasions, “whatever happens between us, please don’t stop being friends with my brother. You mean a lot to him, and well, me too. I don’t want you out of my life.  You’ve helped both of us in so many ways. I’ll always want you as a friend in my life after it all.”

A part of me believed him, I knew I could be friends, after all it’s what I  wanted too if our situation ended. Yet, a part of me couldn’t believe him. He’d changed from a sad weak pathetic boy with no self respect to someone who was beginning to believe in himself  and develop confidence. a part of me knew he’d go crawling back, he wasn’t as strong as he thought he was.

I was the only other person he talked to, besides his brother and family he lived with. B started thinking of going back to school and his brother noted the positive changes he was beginning to make.
Then January hit. B met so if my friends who noticed he was depressed. I confronted him and ask him what was going on. He pushed me away and said he was overworked. A week later a bolt of anxiety ran through me and the thought of “I can’t do this anymore,” hit me. January 10 we talked and I brought it up and we both agreed to end it. The only thing changed was there was no sex. We talked and laughed. 

B’s birthday is January 28, I messaged him on January 22 if he wanted to do anything and he just was blunt and mean and said no, twice. and the next day I messaged him cause I needed his opinion on guitars. I saw he opened my message but no response.... I began to worry he fell into his depression, texted him I was here if he needed to talk... nothing. 

Out of obligation and his brother being my friend, I messaged him happy birthday. Again nothing. Just up and ghosted when before Jan 22, everything was normal. Though h his brother got the sneaking suspicion he was talking to his ex girlfriend... so did I. B said no. So out of curiosity I opened up Instagram and searched for her, and low and behold... January 26 him and her were in at an aquarium smiling. Four days  before was a post of her passport with the caption “a new adventure.” And then a pic of her on a plane. She’d flown from Costa Rica to NJ for his birthday.
You could imagine how angry and upset I was.... I’m enraged NOT over the fact he’s with her, people will make their choice regardless if we agree with them or not.... I’m enraged he just lied to me like that and probably was still with her and didn’t tell me or her the truth.

I don’t know what to say to his brother who was even surprised his brother would ghost someone. The worst if it all... B could have handled this entire situation better. He could’ve said something, anything really. But he didn’t. I’m still going to go over my friend’s house regardless of his brother, B, is there. All I want is to eventually confront B.

I know I’m going to move on and learn from this mess of a situation I am partly responsible for .... all I want is... do you think I’m a who’re like I do? What do I do? Why did he go back? Any thoughts?

i dont know why but couple of months ago i developed this thought that i might have aspergers. like for no reason at all, i just seem to be obsessed with this thought. i cant get over it. it comes and goes. like i have days where i just dont care about it, but then it comes back, and i start rethinking my whole existence. i have been thru this type of phases a lot, and yea, i seem to get thru them. i used to think that i have other mental illnesses, but i used to get over them quickly. the thing is that it doesn't mess with the way i function, so its not that bad, but man when im alone with my thoughts it gets me sometimes.

i dont have any of those symptoms realistically, like i have never been socially awkward, nor i have never felt like ""DIFFERENT"" different from others. but still for some reason, my mind seems to remind me of the worst and the most embarassing memories i have and relate them with this condition. i start to get distorted sense of self.

99,"I [21f] want to start trying dating apps/dating locally but I feel so anxious and nervous about actually doing it and talking to people for a few reasons. The first being I've dealt with really bad self-esteem/confidence issues the last few years. I've been working really hard last year and this year to be more positive and loving towards myself but it's difficult sometimes. I feel like even though I try to love myself I can't validate it because I've never been desired or wanted for my looks. I have family members who tell me I'm pretty but it always feels like they're just pitying me so I'm not negative towards myself. 



Additionally, right now I'm overweight (5'9/190lbs) and have been working towards losing weight at a manageable pace that won't overwhelm me. When I was in HS I lost way too much weight too quickly and after having my self-confidence further destroyed by a boy I fell into a pit of anxiety/comfort eating which I still do sometimes. Besides that though, I've been eating healthier, drinking more water and at least making an effort to move more as well as light exercise.



My question now, is how do I help myself overcome this anxiety and fear of trying to get out into the dating world? One thing I have addressed mentally is that not everyone will be attracted to me because of my weight and looks which is okay. I can't force people to like me and there will be some guys out there who perhaps just naturally don't. I guess I'm just horrified of trying to overcome the hurdle of getting out there. It might be notable to add that I've never gone on a real date ever or even had my first kiss. In addition, I don't really take pictures of myself ever and don't have a very socialite looking Instagram page. A lot of the guys profiles I look at on dating apps are chock-full of very social looking pictures with them smiling and having fun. I feel like it's not even worth trying but I want to try still, somehow. Sorry this is kinda a jumbled mess of a post. Any advice is greatly appreciated and thank you for reading this.",29Jan2020,1

102,"A few months ago my partner was invited to a family wedding across the ocean. The wedding is in the country he grew up in. He wasn't offered a plus one. He wanted me to go with him, but since I'd just started a new job, we have a dog who we would have to board, and he seemed anxious about what I would do for two days during the wedding and reception. Since I wasn't super enthusiastic to go I said he should just go without me. I meant this in sincerity, I know overseas weddings are expensive so I understand he didn't get a +1, since I don't love flying and wasn't keen on using up vacation days at the new job, so I was ok with him being away for a week and a half.


He's always had some FOMO. A few weeks after he RSVP'd he started looking up travel to a country nearby where the wedding is occurring. Since he'll be across the ocean, he decided to spend two weeks vacationing in another country. He invited me, but again I thought about it and decided it didn't seem worthwhile. The country he's going to isn't one I've always longed to go, I'd be spending a good chunk of time away from my new-ish job and depleting my vacation days so I gave him the green light to go but decline to join. A sibling will be with him for part of it.


A week and a half ago I was laid off. I didn't see it coming. I'm suspicious that it occurred so quickly after I gave a doctors note confirming a health condition, but that's another story. Partner is leaving today. He was very empathetic and offered to come back early, but I knew he'd wouldn't get back several deposits and would let his sibling down so I encouraged him to keep at it.


He left today, and I'm worried. I don't think I'll quickly find a job and will spend most of my time at home. Our dog (a young rescue, coming out of his shell) can be a bit of a handful at times, partner paid our daycare for several days so I can drop him off if I feel like I need a break. Out neighbors have offered to keep him over night if I get a flair. Partner has promised to try to video chat or at least send a message twice a day that he's alive. He's going to Asia, but not China. He's promised to come back if the government calls citizens back due to Corona virus or either country says it will close borders.


TL;DR I don't want to do anything to dampen his vacation, I don't want him to think he needs to come back. How can I keep my spirits up while he's away? Or at least let him think things are going well while he's gone?",29Jan2020,1

I overheard one of my classmates saying that the girl who worked there almost didn't serve me but the boss was standing right there so she had to.

I was the darker one and she was the lighter one and my mother would constantly mention that by calling her ‘Mary lightie’ in our language . I didn’t think much of it as it was just an accurate adjective but my thoughts on it changed later as I will explain. Additionally my hair is much curlier than my sisters and my mum would regularly call it ‘rasta’ hair or ‘dreadlocks’ . There’s nothing wrong with that hairstyle but my mom had a dislike towards ‘dreadlocks’ and thought they were ‘messy’ and ‘unkept’ thus implying that my hair in its natural state was the same. She would straighten my hair into oblivion and would always coo positively at my sisters hair. She’s mentioned my nose is too wide several times.  After these additional comments I realized that the ‘lightie’ comment was due to my mums fondness of my sisters light skin and euro centric features. Further more, my mum always criticizes what I wear, Mary is more into makeup and skirts and dresses than I am and I’m more into skin care , health and my style is mostly jeans or loose pants .She states I’m not ‘womanly’ enough and often says ‘make yourself a woman and do such and such,,, ‘.  Also the country I’m from hold lighter skin in high regard so they are always comparing me and my sister. Growing up my mum would always tell my sister to come downstairs if there was a guest to show her off and rarely call me down and when she did she would complain why I didn’t fix myself up when me and my sister were dressed almost exactly the same. .

I nearly hate every minute I'm there, but then there's also really fun times. I'm starting to get along with my colleagues since I opened up about my mental health a bit. I feel like I should just finish the last 6 months, since I'm in a rather good mental state rn. The new job would force me to start over and adapt to a new working space, for 'only' 6 months. But things could be a lot better there, I fear I lose the positivity I have in me at the time and go back to being sad all the time. 
I really don't know what to do, any suggestions ?",29Jan2020,1

124,"Got the idea to write about it, why not, might make me feel better overall.

I am reading ""The girl downstairs"" and i can't stop smiling like a retard. This never happens in real life. Greeting friends by hugging is extremely weird, but i do it, fake it till u make it. Was a shoulder to cry on to a friend on new years eve, felt extremely weird and only thing i came up with is to tell her a koan about ""who knows what is good, what is bad""....... other thing on my mind was how my back hurt holding the hugging position for long.",29Jan2020,1

126,"I’m spiraling right now, so I apologize in advance if this is poorly written.

I feel so ugly and worthless. I feel like I don’t deserve friends. I feel like people don’t deserve to have to see someone so ugly. I feel ashamed of my entire being, and it feels like my body is on fire— like I can feel every inch of myself that I hate. It’s very odd to describe, but it’s an awful feeling, and I don’t want to feel like this anymore. 

I panic just by realizing that I’m alive. I’m not suicidal, but just the realization that I am here right now and I can’t just quickly end my existence for a moment is terrifying and makes me hyperventilate. It feels like being drowned and expecting to take a breath of air but you inhale water. 

I don’t want to see people and I don’t want people to see me. I feel unworthy. I love my school so much, and I feel like I’m finally starting to experience true friendship. I am constantly so inspired and amazed my all my peers and teachers. My school has students from lots of different countries/religious backgrounds, and I am in awe of the diversity. But I don’t feel like I deserve them. The tiniest acknowledgement, like giving me a high five, makes me want to cry because I find it so beautiful that someone would want to give me a high five.  But I feel like I don’t deserve it, and that perhaps they just feel bad for me because I’m so ugly and that my presence makes them feel obligated to give me a high five.

I admire so many things about people, and sometimes I cry because I want to express how much I appreciate their existence, because I feel like I owe it all to them for every “hello” and “what’s good?”. I overthink every action that I do that may have been read wrong and I hate myself for it. It leads me feeling selfish because all I think about is myself and how others view me. 

So yeah. I don’t want to go to school tomorrow. I don’t want to bother people. I don’t want to feel horrible anymore. I want to just hide. And I know that’s not a good solution, but it’s all I can think of. Right now I am alone in my room with the lights of and three blankets piled on top of me just so I can’t see myself. I don’t see how I’m gonna be able to get out of bed and feel myself walk into school. 

I feel so guilty for posting this because I know my problems are so pathetic. There are people going through far worse things than me. Things I probably could never imagine. I know I am so fortunate, and I’m so selfish.",29Jan2020,1
127,"So I had a mental breakdown a while ago. I told a coworker how I dislike and don't trust management. He proceeded to tell management everything and even embellished parts. Since then I went from being OK to having 2 write ups within a month for being late which I know is my fault and is cause. I'm afraid their going to fire me. I can't transfer. I'm more afraid that this will affect other job prospects. Will it be a big label over my head that every employer will know and judge? I'm not in a union state.  If I'm fired with cause will I still be able to get unemployment?

So a little backstory.  I’m almost 20, and I’ve done NOTHING with a girl.  It’s not that often I get a crush, but when I do I fall HARD.  I’ve asked two girls out.  The first one had a BF, and the second one (my crush) rejected me.  I’m still not over my crush but I’m trying my best.  In the past the only time I get over a crush is getting a new one, so I’m trying to meet more girls.

There are these two sisters in one of my college classes, and I’m staring to like one.  She’s cute,  seems friendly, and she’s one of the few people in the class that is actually interested.  Today we had to discuss a reading and we were put in groups.  It was me, her and three other women.  We finished discussing the reading and we had a lot of down time to talk.  We were all talking and getting to know each other.  We had a few things in common and she seemed really nice.  

Of course I was starting to like her even more, then one of the women mentioned her bf.  She was saying how she only hangs out with her bf, and she needs to get more friends.  Then my crush said “Omg me too!  I only hang out with my bf, and he just went into the military so now I can’t see him.  We only write letters and stuff”.  Of course the one girl I was starting to have a crush on has a bf.  It seems like girls I like either don’t like me or is already taken.  It sucks how everybody but me can get into relationships.  All of my close friends are in relationships and I can’t even get a date!  And please don’t say “Her bf is out of the picture...”. Cause I’m not trying to break them up.  That’s not right.  And to makes things worse, it’s almost Valentine’s Day...

My “dating” life sucks",29Jan2020,1
129,"Is it normal to be jealous of people who have lived wild lives? My current girlfriend told me a bunch of stories of things she used to do, like basically every drug you can think of, blacking out, doing insane shit. Now she doesn't do that anymore, and lives a similar lifestyle to me - healthy, safe, well-adjusted. 

I've never done a fraction of the things she's done, and although she regrets all of it, I can't help but feel jealous about what she's experienced. Is this normal? Why do I feel like I'm missing out?",29Jan2020,1
130,"She was a waste of 4 years, lies after lies, false promises after false promises. She didn't care about anyone but her self. 

Not even a week after we broke up I'm so much happier. We had an argument after i broke up with her as she was lying about what had happened over the last 4 years. Basically from my understanding she forgot when and where her younger brother got physically abuse, she forgot when and where we first met and started dating, she forgot the last time we saw each other, she forgot when she moved from where i live to where she is currently living (she said 3 years before she actually did)",29Jan2020,1
131,"Just wanted to get multiple opinions, I guess mostly from people who feel that they've attained or are focused on their personal idea of success.

I once heard from someone I knew that they believed that (paraphrased) they could find personal success and still have a single vice. In that person's case, they said they had to choose between weed and masturbation and they chose the former. I know that sounds kind of funny, and I don't really keep up with this guy that often, but at least out of all the people I grew up with, he seems to have his shit most together. Graduated with little to no debt, works in accounting and makes pretty good money, recently got engaged to a girlfriend of like 5 years. And yet whenever I see him, he's high.

My life path is pretty different from him. I have like $35K debt in my name (though I went to a much more expensive school so it's relatively not much compared to what a lot of people come out of there with), do freelance live sound and A/V work in NYC for bills while trying to get footing in the music industry, and don't have really any relationship experience/haven't dated in awhile. Additionally, most of my post-grad life since 2017 has been affected by my mom being diagnosed with brain cancer, and a lot of my professional choices have been made with her in mind in terms of being able to make time to visit for extended periods.

Without going into my full story, I'm dealing with a lot right now and admittedly do indulge myself. And while I feel like I've definitely maintained a progression of self-betterment over the years and while I'm also consciously trying to give myself space to be present during my grief, it feels like I could be moving faster.

Success is obviously multifaceted and isn't just about if you smoke or drink. But does anyone understand what I'm saying/have personal experience with disciplining yourself while still allowing yourself *one* vice? Does it personally work for you? Thank you.",29Jan2020,1
