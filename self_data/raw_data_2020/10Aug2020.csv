That’s great! I’m so happy for everyone but can we get something straight!? I worked as hard as possible to be clean. To be responsible for my actions now and in the past. To make amends with my family and give them time and dedication so they are happy. To eat healthy and do sports daily!

So why. Is it still so fucking hard? 

Covid is a joke 
Tbh BLM has become a fucking joke 
Politics. joke. 
Whatever I feel politics should be doesn’t even matter I think he end and I can’t change that. 
General public’s opinion is uneducated and uninformed what a joke.
Family and friends are not being safe and think covid is not real. Joke!
I’m about to lose my job
I’m NOT HAPPY 
I STRUGGLE DAILY 
IM TIRED. 

I’ve tried and done everything expected of me emotionally and intellectually and it means nothing I can barely function emotionally. I’m so upset.",10Aug2020,1

4,"I realize this has been talked to death, but somehow I am still shocked. I recognize people have different views on masks. And while I may not agree, I understand there are a lot of people who feel that if they are out for a walk etc and don’t plan to be taking to people or going into a business they are ok to go mask-less. 

So a few hours ago I went to pop into a local mini mart/candy store to grab a few things.  This store seemingly takes safety seriously, they have plexiglass up by the register and signs limiting entry to 4 customers at a time and everyone must wear a mask.  I’ve been there many times recently and everyone is adhering. However today as I’m waking up I see a fat white trash woman walk in with no mask. What the fuck I’m thinking. So I wait for her to leave as she takes her sweet time using the ATM, and buying some junk food and cigarettes (naturally). As she left the store I thought about asking her where’s your fucking mask but I settled for a dirty look which she returned. When I went in I grabbed what I wanted and I asked the owners working there why did you let that woman shop without a mask? They played (or were) dumb and said they didn’t notice she wasn’t wearing one.

9,it’s this boy that i like and we’ve talked on and off for about the last year. it’s never gotten too serious because i never felt like he would be ready for anything serious with me. but recently we picked things back up and he said he was and then clearly he was not. so i blocked him. we still follow each other on social media but i restrict his accounts so that i don’t see them. i would just unfollow him altogether but sometimes i like to see what he’s doing lol. so i saw that he viewed my story so i go on his page and y’all....this man looks so good. he posted a picture. oh god. i want to unblock him and tell him i miss him but i can’t. i need someone to tell me to not do it and go against my urges. thank you.,10Aug2020,1

11,"Growing up, we learned about the rise and fall of empires all over the world, since the beginning of recorded history, at least. Regime changes happen often throughout time, governments and governing bodies change. I know all of that, I have grown up knowing that. 

Living, currently, in a country which, I believe, could be dealing with its first major change to governing styles is blowing my mind!

I live in the U.S., a relatively young country at just under 250 years old. The chances this could happen seem quite good, to me. And the odds it will change again later down the line seem just as good.

This Country is dealing with revolutions of the civil and moral kind, possibly dismantling massive criminal organizations and now we could be in for a Communist or Aristocratic society!? History in the making.",10Aug2020,1
12,"I started uni three years ago. I’m nearly finished with uni now. I feel like my experience was not good enough and I wish it was better. 

In the first year of uni where everyone is suppose to make friends and have fun it wasn’t really like that for me. When I started uni I didn’t drink or smoke or anything. So fitting in with the people there was hard, one time I went to the club in freshers events with someone who lived in my halls. I turned around and they disappeared it was a horrific experience as I was alone in a new city didn’t really know how to get back. I started drinking nd I thought I’ll fit in well but it didn’t really work like that. Later on in the year I got in with the wrong group of people and started smoking weed and experimenting with drugs which I’m not really proud of. At the end of first year I didn’t even really have close friends. 

In second year where people found houses to live with friends I had to find whatever was available like halls or whatever. This time my flat mate was ok, I had some company some friends to chill with. But I always felt alone. If I go out with them or go to the club. Some of my ‘friends’ would tell me that I should go and explore but everyone in the club was with their friends partying and my friends wanted to like go away from me. I just wished the year ends so I can finish uni as soon as possible. 

This year was the final year of uni I have been depressed I had to take some time off uni. It’s been really difficult with covid. I was still with the same friends from second year who made fun out of me. It felt like they didn’t want me to be with them. I’ve always been lonely. I’ve been at uni for 3 years I didn’t even find a girl friend. 

I’ve never had close friends. I don’t have any siblings so I don’t have anyone but my parents to talk about sensitive things to. I can’t tell everything to my parents as they get stressed. 

I always have these thoughts in my head. I’m graduating soon. I’ve done good academically but I have not found friends or anything like that while I’ve been at uni. My time at uni passed thinking that I’ll be away from these people and then I can be free from toxic energy. 

Idk I’ve always wanted to write this. I’m writing it today because I want to get it out of my head.",10Aug2020,1
14,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",10Aug2020,1

20,"I haven't really wasted my time (or at least that's what I tell myself) I just take my college core curriculum not degree specific classes yet. But I need to choose soon, like in the next couple days because I have put this off far too long and I'm about to start another semester with only 2 core classes left. 

I'm really torn, I grew up wanting to be a teacher and the older I got the more people told me how little they make and how impractical it is to live off that if I wanna take care of future kids and my parents. Then I was super into nursing and I liked it and I wanted to be a nurse and then I actually took classes and I hated them because of the people, and I second guessed myself so much, I thought there's no way I'm smart as the other people going into nursing with the straight A's and I didn't wanna waste my time trying if I don't have straight A's because they told me without it there's no way I'd get into a full nursing school even if I did love

Then I looked into other healthcare jobs because I liked the field. At this time I had told my parents I was in nursing, when my dad found out I was dropping nursing he was so mad at me. I wanted to go back to my teaching plan like I wanted when I was younger and I was set on that for a couple months. Then with all the ways teachers are being treated and people telling me do not go into teaching because you're working the same as nurses for like 1/3 of the pay. On top of my parents hating teaching, I started to hate it too, now I'm wanting to go back into healthcare.

I know this is such a privelaged problem to not know what you want to do in college, but this is my whole life, and I have to pay these loans back, take care of family in the future, he happy, so this really matters to me and I think the weight of the desicion has been bringing me down for the past 2 years.

I was just hoping people in these fields, or people who know others in these fields, or just anyone can help me decide between education and healthcare, that's what it comes down to and I have to choose asap because my semester starts really soon and I've just been feeling lost not knowing or being able to decide.

25,"I was curious about the group today. They were always portrayed as a misogynistic, bitter, &amp; sad group of individuals and I wanted to know if it was true. Long story short, it’s exactly what I thought but worse. 

I lurked in the forums and it was more depressing than anything else. A lot of people were self loathing and extremely pessimistic about life which is understandable? It’s toxic and they’re more concerned with pitying themselves. There was an aura of learned helplessness that seeped in every thread. 

Everyone there is interested in superficial characteristics because most are classified as ugly people. They didn’t believe that personality had anything to do with finding a relationship and this is where it went downhill for me. 

If you were short, Asian, Indian, skinny, fat, had an overbite, disproportionate, and anything short of a celebrity? You were ugly and had little chance to find love. It was extremely toxic and people were told that they had no hope if they weren’t super attractive. 

Most were completely convinced that all women cared about was physical attributes, and it was women’s extremely high demands that makes it so they can’t find love. 

I personally posted a picture of myself and pretended to be an Incel. My caption was “5’6 &amp; 117 lbs.” which is true. Every single comment immediately pounced on the fact that I was short, Asian, &amp; not model looking. 

Immediately told I had no hope. 

The strange thing is that I currently have a girlfriend and we’ve been together for more than a year despite me being “below average.”
They also had a strange fixation with height in particular and that was the main criteria from them. Very little supporting words, and the one that came was shut down quickly. 

Their negative and bitter personalities are extremely unappealing, and that hatred is most likely what drives away people. This continuous cycle of “you’re not good enough, you’re ugly, you’ll never be loved” is just sad. And every time they get rejected the bitterness grows and it worsens every time. 

I feel legitimately bad for that community, and incels need therapy. They constantly blame women, genetics, their socioeconomic situation, and country for their inability to find someone. It’s not healthy, but from what I saw most have given up on trying.

I’ve left that subreddit a little upset that people have been brought so low and have to wallow in a cesspool of anger. They don’t want help from anyone outside of their group because we can’t understand the struggle. But that doesn’t mean we should attack and belittle them. Those guys made it bad enough as is for themselves. That is possibly the saddest part of it all.

Tl:dr Incels are sad and bitter, &amp; the subreddit is a perpetual cycle of toxicity. Go help some incels love themselves.",10Aug2020,1
26,"My 8yr old German Shepherd Lily, had to get put down an hour ago. 10 weeks ago she was diagnosed with Lymphoma, she was given 4 weeks to live. She pushed through and fought hard for 6 weeks past her expectancy, unfortunately she was deteriorating quickly this last week. She was such a good dog, and im gonna miss her so much. 

She came into our life 6 years ago as a foster and we got her a new home. In December she was surrendered to the RSPCA 3 hours away. She was still microchiped to mum. So we did a 6 hour round trip to pick her up and bring her home, where she would be loved and cherished. She chased possums, our other dog and loved her balls and treats.

29," For context I'm a 16-21 yr old.

throw-away for obvious reasons. Please tell me what you think I should do. I have a plan at the bottom.

TLDR:  My dad is cheating, I don't want to ruin my own family. I don't want to  risk my future career or college education. I plan to ask the women(s)  to stop talking to him.

I realized  my dad is currently talking to at-least one other women other than my  mom. I realized it by accident when I glanced at his phone (while he was  on it) during a movie. I could see that he was asking for her pictures,  and sending heart emojis and shit. After about a week or two, I've  certainly seen enough to be 100% confident.. This kinda shattered me, in  that I love my family, and kinda want to have a huge family for my kids  one day. One that would hopefully include my parents.

I am in quite the pickle now.

I  am almost certain neither of my siblings know about it, and they are  unlikely to find out in the next few years. I feel i bear a  responsibility to ensure that my family stays together, which would get  destroyed if this news comes to light. I know that I can control how I  act, but I can't control how my sibling or mom does. My mom has got to  know, however, there is now way in hell I'm gonna tell her I know. That  would hurt her very deeply, I think.

This  is personally quite devastating because I really look up to my father.  He is(was) everything I aspired to be. A father of a big family, a  breadwinner, healthy kids, plays video-games, ect... I'm not exactly in a  position to say ""fuck you,  you aren't in my life"" because he will most  probably pay for my college (big emphasis on education, no matter the  cost in my family). On top of paying for college, I want to work in the  industry/career that he has; therefore, staying close with him would be a  MASSIVE boon to my career. Even outside of family life, he would be  extremely useful. He is incredibly smart and well connected, atleast for  what I want to do with my life.

All  this has built up alot of stress in myself, the other day I was looking  at myself in the mirror while I was brushing my teeth, and I just  started crying (this was a few minutes after an argument between my  sibling and him). Whenever something bad with him happens, I immediately  think about the subtext of his infidelity. I can't hear a complaint  about him getting detached from us without thinking about how REAL it  is.

I need help in figuring out  what to do. I can't tell anyone in my family, I can't tell a friend  (because I don't want their view of me or my family to be damaged, and I  don't want my family's financial stability risked), I can't tell a  therapist (because they would know my parents)... I can't tell anyone  who could or will know my family.

My  plan: My only resort is to get onto his phone, and text all of the  women he has been talking to. I'm going to nicely ask each of them to  please fuck off, and not ruin my family. I hope that appeal will work,  as it is the only way I can address the issue with some anonymity. My  dad will probably realize SOMEONE did it. But he'll probably not know  who, there are alot of suspects.

TLDR: My dad is cheating, I dont want to ruin my own family. I don't want to risk my future career or college education.",10Aug2020,1

A few days ago I went to a visit in a friend's house, and there I met a trans guy friend of this friend. He was born a girl, but as he grew up he begun identifying himself as a man. And he's also gay.

I don't really know why, because he doesn't have many body features that seem feminine, but I think he's kinda hot. Maybe his personality is having a hand on the way my body feels attracted to him, because he's a cool guy.

However right now I’m so sick I called the COVID hotline for our community and they wanted me tested immediately even though it was a Sunday.

I’ve been giving orders (and papers) that I am not allowed in public places and have to self quarantine. I should be focused on taking care of myself yet I feel so bad and guilty. 

For one my husband now has to miss work and quarantine with me until I test negative (company policy) he’s up for a promotion and was supposed to have his second interview for it this week. I feel like it’s my fault he isn’t going to be able to interview and told him to ask if they can conduct it over the phone. It makes me want to cry. I think a lot of it stems from my (narcissist) parents telling me I ruin everything my whole childhood and now I feel like I’m ruining this for him.

Then he just jumps straight into rough sex, even as I’m telling him to slow down. Don’t get me wrong I like it like that but not at the very beginning with basically no foreplay. Then he starts hitting a place that really hurt so I told him so he just stops all together and leaves (and flushes the condoms and wrappers down my toilet even though there’s a trash can right next to it 🙄). The whole thing last 5 minutes max if you know what I mean. That was literally terrible. I’ve had a lot of bad sex (including coercion) but this was a new level of bad.

41,"I want to begin this by apologizing for anything that might come off as unorthodox in regard to formatting or structure: I don't really post on reddit and most of my experience with it has been listening to subreddits on YouTube as background noise. I also want to apologize if this is the wrong place to post this. 

My (44) father is depressed and potentually suicidal. I (m24) have known about this for two years, but have never acted or spoken about it because I'm an incredibly passive person and things have seemed fine on the outside. 

I found out when my mother (44) picked me up from work one day. I don't remember why, but she didn't have her car and things made sense for her to borrow mine, so she picked me up and broke down as we drove home. She found out the night before that my father had been closer with a family friend than she or anyone else was aware of. Though my parents weren't officially together (it's a complicated relationship, explaining why they're not together and why they live together is a reddit post in of itself), they had been talking about working things out. 

My mom told me that he had been putting pressure on her about taking care of him because he is depressed and suicidal. My mother is a strong women, dangerously strong. She can bottle anything up and you wouldn't notice anything was ever wrong, nor would she ever need to voice anything about it, so for her to breakdown in front of me, I can't explain the severity in words. 

This happened before my father left for Midland, Texas. He worked there in the oil field for a year until Covid-19. In that time, he has gotten into a few altercations with my brother (22) where they were both drunk/buzzed and didn't see eye to eye. 

My father and brother are the same person in every way. Both need to be in charge of whatever project they're doing. They're full of pride and cannot ask for help, and when they need it, they act like it is owed to them. They need to be the breadwinner, fhe ones who host BBQ's and drink. God, do they love to drink. Its when they drink that they typically fight. This is when my father likes to talk about his 'demons' that have been with him since he was a kid. 

He blames his childhood and parents for his current mishaps and fuck ups. I'm Mexican-American, however my father was born in Mexico, and he immigrated when he was 7, so he's very Amerianized. Unfortunately, his parents weren't. It's unfortunate because mental illness isn't wildly discussed in Latin communities (or many minority communities for that matter). My grandmother was bipolar, and from what I have gathered, may have abused my father and his siblings. She took out a lot of anger on them and it's payed its toll. My father also has a strong sense of family, which is why he regrets putting his hands on his father before he died. 

I can go on and on about things that had led him to being the person that he is today. 

Well, tonight he had too many beers. My mother doesn't want people coming over because of Covid-19, and because she has to work from home and likes sleep. Our neighbors/friends came over after my grandparents left (mom's side, as both of my father's parents are now dead). Eventually, my mom told everyone goodnight and head to bed. My father, who was drunk, followed after her. My mom called for my brother and I, asking us to get him. 

My brother stayed in the kitchen, myself in the living room, not wanting to cause a scene, but we watched him talk to her for a few seconds before disappearing to their bedroom. Our neighbors knew it was time to leave, so they said their goodbyes and left. My mom sat on the sofa and I went back to doing my typical post-work routine of watching TV. 

A few minutes later, my dad walked through the living room, into the kitchen, and back to his room. My mom made a comment about him taking off, so I went to get my shoes and wallet so I could go with him and make sure he was safe. She was right, he had intended to leave, but instead of letting him go and letting me go with him like I had voiced to everyone, my brother decides to call him out on leaving and hurting himself by driving drunk. 

This leads to my dad yelling about how he isn't welcome home and thay he's taking off. I tried to get him out the house by gesturing that we go together, but mt brother, who was sober, decided then was the perfect time to call him out on his behavior. 

This led to my father screaming and getting ready for a physical altercation, as was my brother. I was holding my father back for the time being until my father began talking about how we live off of him and how we don't respect him. My brother commented with stuff that didn't help the situation and after a while, my dad made a move for my brother. I'm 5'11"", two inches taller than my dad, and an unhealthy amount of weight above him so he was going nowhere. 

Well, my brother, literally my hot headed dad's twin, decided this was a good time to provoke our father by rushing forward to get in his face. It was an act of God that I was able to hold them both back with an arm a piece. There was more yelling and them trying to get closer. I eventually tripped and my dad somehow fell because of it. I found my balance, then lost it and fell on him. We raced to get back up but they started going at it. They yelled in each other's face before they began shoving and hitting each other. My brother was able to get my father down, allowing me to shove my brother away and restrain my dad. They went at it again, resulting in harsher language and them both choking each other. I had told my mom to call our neighbor back because I would need help if they both kept going at it (my dog was also biting my calfs and ankles). He came over as if he never left. My dad took one look at him, said ""fuck you"" a few times before breaking down. 

Our neighbor took my dad outside to talk while I got water, cause I was out of breath by this point and my throat burned as if I had been smoking. I checked on my little sister (14) who had made an appearance during the fight, but I told her to go upstairs. She was fine and in bed, thank God, so I went to check on mt dad. He and our neighbor were finishing talking. The neighbor went inside to check on the family then left. My dad made a comment about 'selling the lie' which concerned me. I went in with my dad and he used the restroom for a while. When he came out, he and I talked in the kitchen. 

I dont recall the progression of the conversation, but it involved him being depressed and wanting to shoot himself. He said everyone would write him off, how he is to blame for everything. He mentioned he's a burden, hes told his sisters about how he feels but they haven't done anything to help him. He talked about his pride and asked me what he's done to justify himself being liked by me. He said our lives are different, hiw nothing on my life would have prepared me for what had happened. When he kept talking about suicide, I felt guilty for knowing about his depression and never doing anything about it. I've had my fair share of depression. I know what its like to feel hopeless and tormented by your own thoughts, knowing how depressjon makes you think there's no end. I felt guilty for letting him go through that alone so I hugged him and let him cry in my chest. I then convinced him that we should get some sleep and talk in the morning.

He is asleep next to me and I'm typing this. In most of the reddit videos I listen to, people offer support and advice and I thought maybe my fortune would extend to receiving some of that from yall. I'm going to set my phone down for now and get some sleep. 

Feedback, advice, anything is welcome. I don't know how to move on from here with my family. Im a very passive person who doesn't speak to them about emotional stuff but I'm tired of tbis drama and want to fix it before someone does something stupid.

46,"I preface this by saying I've always been the jealous type. Since we live in a very rural area we don't meet any people. We cut our own wood and grow our own food so we never really have to leave. Sometimes we do. Last time a creeper approached her, I took one swing, and he blew up.

A couple of nights ago we found a cat hiding in the forest nearby. There's a LOT of vegetation over there so I'm sure it's been eating plants or something to survive. I tried luring it with some fish I got from the lake nearby. It's eyes light up and it starts approaching me slowly. It's working! It's on the doorstep of our house where I drop the fish on the ground and let him have it. He immediately gives us a look of pure love so we put a collar on him right there. I can't believe how swimmingly that went. He had spots so my girlfriend named him spotty.

So now we have the cat in our house and this is where all hell breaks lose. Spotty. Won't. Get off. My bed. Since the area nearby is sometimes hard to get through I need something sharp to cut the vegetation when I'm looking for wood. I hold that in my hand and I jokingly swing it at spotty and I barely nick him. MY GIRLFRIEND WAS FURIOUS. After a lecture on how I shouldn't swing things at spotty the cat got off the bed on his own and we promptly went to sleep.

The next day we wake up and we usually start our day by eating breakfast but my girlfriend also wanted to work on our crops ASAP so she goes outside for a bit. I have the house to myself so I go to the trunk with food in it only to find spotty... on the trunk. Trunks only open upwards so we're not getting any food if spotty has something to say about it. Without thinking I grab my axe and I try to scare him off it by swinging it at him... I hit him square on the head. I don't want to be too graphic but I will say he died from it. I don't know what I'll say to her so I try to think of something. When she came back in I gave her some bread for breakfast and I ask ""Have you seen spotty?"". SHE FREAKS OUT. ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO SPOTTY, OUR DOOR WAS CLOSED"".

She's not having my BS so I tell her the truth. I killed spotty. She goes berserk and I hear the biggest lecture of my life. She wants me to move out which is unfair because I've lived there with her since the house was built. I tell her it's not happening so she picks up the axe that killed spotty and swings it at me. Let's just say I lost all my xp for enchantments :(

48,"Our relationship was painful, it was toxic, and it was really hard. Confusingly, we really did love each other...

I poured everything I had into it, all my hard earned money and all my heart. It was not enough, he still wouldn't treat me with kindness. Controlling, suspicious, and capricious to the point of exhaustion.

I couldn't tell anyone how bad it was, untill one day my anxiety landed me in the hospital. I couldn't breathe properly, but even then he tried to stop me from leaving the apartment.

Those years forced me to grow on my own in the solitude of my mind. 

I moved and next week I'll start a job in IT that I've been working to get for a long time. I'm nervous.

Everything's changing so fast... I know things are probably staying the same for him, maybe his admirers are telling him sweet nothings. He is handsome after all.

I feel so disconnected from myself and I can't sleep. I want peace, but I can't find it anywhere now.

49,"I feel like my whole life has been a joke to others including my husband...

I’m 28/F and growing up I was always picked on. During the summer my skin would turn soo dark so kids would pick on me for it. My teeth were super crooked and kids always said it looked like there was a car accident in my mouth so I got braces but my teeth have since shifted back a bit. Im also very pigeon toed so people always laugh at the way I walk including family. If anyone ever had a crush on me it was a literal God forbid anyone found out or they’d be picked on for liking the ugly girl with no friends. I went to independent studies in high school because my social anxiety was horrible from my experience in middle school. I meet my husband there and at the time we had a few mutual friends. Around my Jr. Year I stopped caring what others thought and stepped into my own. A lot of the boys that picked on me in middle school actually began apologizing to me for the way they treated me only because I gained a lot of popularity. Well during I.S my husband asked for my number one day after class (this was way before we began dating) so I gave it to him. The following days so did 2 other guys in our class and I gave it to them also because I thought we were all just friends. Some time after my husband and I began dating I found out I was just a bet to see who could get my number as a joke. Yes, as a JOKE. It breaks me when I think about it until this day but I was head over heels for him so continued with the relationship. My husband (friend at the time) used to walk out of class with me and my boyfriend at the time would be waiting in the parking lot. Again HORRIBLE social skills so I didn’t know how to tell my “friend”/husband to let me go because my boyfriend was watching and waiting for me. I come to find out just yesterday that this was also a joke to him. He kept talking to me in front of my boyfriend at the time to piss him off because he didn’t like him. I also found out that my husband was trying to get me to like him just to lead me on for shits and giggles. That literally BROKE me yesterday when I overheard him telling his girl cousin that. He didn’t know I was listening but they were practically outside the door. I got pregnant by accident with our first kid right when we graduated high school so we kinda just stuck together after that and tried making it work and now I feel like my life has just been a laughing stalk for everyone including my husband. I couldn’t get over what I heard him tell his cousin yesterday so I actually ended up kicking him out this morning because I couldn’t control my feelings. I’m an emotional mess. I feel worthless. I literally feel like if I didn’t have kids I’d go jump off a bridge right now because I feel nobody genuinely cares about me. Nobody ever calls me to check up on me unless they need my help with something. To top it off I have a 7 month old baby and this PPD isn’t helping. I wish I knew why I lack so many social skills and I hate myself for it. I wish I had a way to figure it all out and gain some confidence and get back out there but it’s shot completely.",10Aug2020,1
50,"This is specifically in response to people arguing that kids going to school will increase the risk for older people.
  
As an older person, I think if kids going to school changes the equation of risk for adults I am totally willing to accept it. The risk is already very small.   

Besides the obvious points on education and social development - school is an escape for children from broken home lives and it allows two parents to work without sinking half their income into a trusted sitter.

Along one of the lights, there were black decors, with amorphous shapes. Then I realized they were part of an alien (xenomorph) hive. I start kind of freaking out, but I think ""I still have time, the hero hasn't triggered the event yet"" and get comfy. I think I see movement, but it's hard to tell. I start getting anxious and start shuffling around. Then the hero arrives. I think to myself ""oh, Duke Nukem got to the moon base. It's about to pop of here.""

57,"It's the same each effin year. I feel somewhat happy when spring is finally there, because even though I like the cold, at some point I just want it to end and feel the sun again.




So, spring comes, with it my allergies, which have been pretty fine to deal with compared to previous years.



So the spring goes over and summer arrives and I'm thinking, well this time, things are gonna be better. You will try to get as much sun as you can, so you can adapt to the heat and don't sweat as much.



No, it's not gonna happen. While I have to say that this summer wasn't as bad as the previous ones, it fucks me up even more that we now get a heat wave, which makes me worried if we will actually experience real fall.




It seems like my body tries to make up for all the times I didn't sweat this year and now I am constantly leaking.


I can leave the shower just to go for another round, simply because the sweating doesn't even stop.



We actually had rain last night and now the temperature is rising again, with estimated 38 ° C felt temperature. I hate it so so much and for the love of God, I can't understand how people like this weather and season.

59,"I was crossing a street, I had a green light. I was on a bike. Person in a car decided to drive on full speed, even if they had red light. I heard the sound of tires, the one they make during sudden stop. I sped up and looked behind. I saw a car driving right in my direction, it look like in a slow motion. I had a thought that it looks just like those dramatic movie scenes, where cat crashes. Then it hit me.


It only hit back wheel of the bike tho, so the impact threw me and the bike away, thankfully I only got few bruises. People who saw it thought that I'm dead. They said that I was very lucky. If I was there just 1 second later, I'd be dead for sure. I wouldn't be writing all of that.


They were asking if I'm happy to be alive. I realised that I didn't care much. I wouldn't mind dying there. It'd be a long rest after life, finally finding a peace.


Then I realised that I'd die without meeting my boyfriend (we're in long distance relationship for soon a year, couldn't meet because of corona). I'd die without hugging him or holding his hand or petting his hair. I'd leave him alone and I'd be second girlfriend who he couldn't save. It breaks my heart. I'd cause him so much suffering and he already was through much more than such a sensible, beautiful soul should be. Tbf I'm getting tears each time I think about it, rn I got them too.

62,"I knew it won't workout anyway, why did i fall for the i love you forever crap, why did i bother believing that there was something, feeling there was something about her, i believed her words her charms, but i knew it, she's just temporary masking it with lies.


I (29 M) gf (30 F) is guilt tripping me or just has bad memory making up stories in her head.


We had a deal in our last call that i just wanted a break because i was feeling very uncomfortable lately due to certain events, Like her lying to me on valentine, hanging out with a bunch of dudes twice, and she lied to me that she wasn't hanging out with them, i found out pop'd up caught her redhanded. She freaked out o fcourse. I still tried to find it in myself to forgive her but it takes time, I could not enjoy her presence, it bothered me because in the past she had a history of lying to me and I was cheated on twice. So naturally my mind feels uncomfortable.

I've been sick too lately,i've done some 2 powerful psychedelics which have had their effects on my body till today, (ibogaine / 5meo) So i get vibrations on my body and have difficulty sleeping. So i feel sick most of the time of the year. It's hard to feel sane or think sometimes. I had some tinnitus that gets loud on somedays where it's unbearable that i feel so suicidal.

Either way, it's no excuse for me but my memory isn't the best as it used to be either. But she says i've blant out closed the call in her face and said i enjoy being around other people on our last call.

I really don't remember doing such an act on our last call, All i remember is telling her i'm not feeling well, I don't trust her as i used to, And i explained why, i needed time, She got emotional and cried and told me i'm changing to another person, I told her i'm sorry, I just need time i've been avoiding making time i came out clean since i felt terrible. And i wanted any distraction that would help. And she just felt difficult. She said it's fine she understands and she asked me to promise her, i'll be back soon like i used to be. I told her I promise, I came back to her and she suddenly says she needs a break from me and i'm a shitty boyfriend because i never ask about her. I got confused, we had a deal that we'd have distance and now this? She came up with all these stories that it's COVID-19 and i never asked about her, Even though in the past i told her i don't know what to say about it, it makes me feel worse by thinking about it Hence why i don't want to think about it, and i told her we'll all be fine and it's going to be alright. And then she replied with it's fine you don't need to say anything.

She claims she loves herself now, and she sees me as a manipulator exposed, She has more clarity and i'm just some cringe, While i understand self love is nice and all, but i'm confused why she is be-littling me comparing me with her previous boyfriends on what they do and say. I'm just me with a different context, just because i don't do their actions does not mean i don't love her.

She's had breast surgery lately out of the blue, It was never discussed with me, i felt left out honestly, I loved the way she was she was perfect, I don't understand why it was needed, I honestly don't care about her size, she says it's too small, I honestly see it perfect even if it was flat line or close to flat line. She is easily affected by a show she watchs or things around her, so i'm guessing this breast surgery is my fault, i wasn't there to protect her health :( I feel very sad deep dowinside. I don't feel good. I feel at fault even though i know i didn't do anything wrong, i just should've taken better action like avoiding drugs or talking to her more regularly, I had plans to celebrate her birthday but my memory already reformatted that date too, i am too afraid to ask for it, i don't rely on calender's as i used to have very good memory. But not anymore

She seems very egoic with her self love agenda, and just claims she's always right now and she loves herself, and everything i say is cringe or she doesn't care about what i say, It's a very weird dynamic she's exploded to. Even though in the past she's agreed to i don't need to say hi every morning or night to her and it's alright she understands i'm not used to it, no need to fake that stuff, but i do occasionally tell her i love her, it's still not enough she wants more attention. I have done that lots for the past year, it's just lately my energy and mood hasn't been it's best.

This reminds me something similar happened on our break last time, It was a month break, i come back and she's with a new guy and she sucked his dick while we were in a relationship it was confusing for me back then as well, but we tried to work it out i tried to forgive her even back then but he does pop in my mind every now and then, i thought i'd heal up but this year's valentine made it worse, plus she tried to break up with me earlier this year which also scar'd me with some difficulty trusting her, i don't know if she means it when she says she loves me forever and so, i try to trust, but it's just getting more difficult with these events this year.

We've been together for 5 years, it's been good and bad ups and downs, but this isn't the toughest we faced, I just feel like she's too cocky she isn't doing it in a healthy manner, where she wants to hear or understand my points or others, But that's ok i guess that's what self love is? Good for her, i wish her the best. But i've been feeling down as if i've done something terrible when i clearly know i did not, If anything i feel just pain because my health isn't at it's best and i can't really love myself or my life as it is right now as i've never felt good in a long time now. I feel like i'm just running away from some subtle trip most of the time. I don't want to go too much into details about it, but it's been difficult, I wish i didn't mess with my brains with those psychs.

TL;DR: I asked her for a break since i wasn't feeling well , she agreed on it, i came back and she says she hates and is sick of me prefers someone else because i neglected her? And she says she loves herself more than me with some new egoic agenda, I'm confused. It's just making it more difficult",10Aug2020,1
63,"Leaving your parents and moving into own house

Hello, so I am 21 from India living in the U.K.
Now ever since I was a child my family lived as a joint family. Like my dad, his parents, my uncle and his family and my mum. We don’t live like that now but that’s a different story. 

In the U.K. the culture is to leave your parents nd go and live alone. I don’t understand this. I get living alone will give you some freedom to do whatever you want. But I’ve never thought of leaving my parents or living alone cuz that’s just not how Indians do it. My plan is get a job and provide for my family so we grow together. 

But in U.K. it’s different it’s like you go and start earning for your self. Even after 18 their parents start asking them for rent money if they lend money they want that money back and I just think that’s wrong. I am not sure what is right and what is wrong.

70,"Apologies in advance, English isn’t my first language and this will be looong. So I met this guy, we’ll call him Thomas- when we were still in highschool (17F, 18M) I believe he had just gotten out of rehab and lost a semester, which was the reason we were coursing together. Anyway, from the first approach I could already tell he was trying something out, barging into my conversation with a friend and asking me questions- only me- about said conversation topic, which I honestly answered very uninterested cause I didn’t know him and men make me uncomfortable.

And to sorta put a context as to why- I was molested at 5 and raped at 16 by another student in my school (only a few people knew about this situation since I always went to a private school, and this person came from a very rich family- OH and my country is corrupt as fuck. Don’t come to mexico ever), and I’m also I believe, very attractive to say the least so I do catch attention pretty easily, to my disadvantage. So I always got looks, comments made and well- quite a bit of harassing from guys in my school.

So back to it- once Thomas and I spoke that one time, I think he added me on facebook and after that approached me a couple times- and after speaking to him for a bit I kinda caught a crush on him? He’s smart as hell. When I told my parents about him (I have a very good relationship with them) I found out my dad (psychologist) had actually been his therapist in the 5th grade. And guess what? He had to get therapy cause he was waaay too smart- overstimulated for his teachers, he ASKED questions teachers weren’t prepared for, which ended up in him having some attitude and overall teachers not liking him.

So after that conversation, my dad could already tell I was after Thomas, and warned me about him and how his desire for stimulation could easily get out of hand (it’s the same behavioral patterns for very smart/gifted children), after he said that I obviously did not say a word about him getting out of rehab, I kind of understood where he was going.

Anyway, I ignored everything and started chatting with him any time I got the chance, I was/am absolutely fascinated with the way he spoke and all, he was/is astoundingly smart for his age. And for someone like me to find another person who would be a potential intellectual match, I was basically head over heels for him. I mean- smart, funny and nice to me? After what I had been through, it sounded like a dream.

We quickly became good friends, bonded through deep talks, my secret(s), everything. Without a doubt, I was very much in love with him. And I did tell him, or was very obvious letting him know I liked him. And he took advantage of that. And I was also very stupid. We spoke, arranged to have sex- we couldn’t really get to it since the mood felt weird, I wasn’t exactly comfortable and I could tell neither was he so we stopped, and just chatted out naked. After the sex attempt, chatting was beautiful. We spoke for hours maybe, I still recall it being my favorite memory with him.

Few days later, it was brought to my attention that he had a girlfriend studying abroad. And I was sad, upset, I don’t even know I could feel so many bad things at once over someone you admire and love so much. I confronted him on why he never said a word- and I was obviously brought back to “desire for stimulation could get out of hand”. I felt like I had walked into a trap and just decided to live there, because I forgave him. I forgave him and hated myself for still trying it out with him. 17 y/o and in love with an asshat.

So.. fast forward, we graduated and he left to study abroad, I started dating someone and just cut him off cause he still flirted with me and I had no need for problems in my own relationship. However after my relationship ended, I spoke with him again, and he had already broken up hiw own relationship and it brings us here. 2020 covid pandemic. He came back since the city he was staying in is doing pretty bad, plus it makes sense to come back to your own city right?

Anyway, my feelings for him had gone by my 2nd relationship, It took me a lot of time but I talked myself out of it. But god, once we started speaking again I easily became fascinated once again with his personality. He came by last week and we’ve always had sexual tension, like if there was someone else in the room they would have to leave, its palpable and I felt like if he brushed against me slightly I would melt. He left pretty quick since we both noticed this and I obviously did not want to get involved like that with him again.

But- we’re in the middle of a pandemic, I started sending him post-work out pictures which he would praise me for, I have a very good physique after all. Couple days later we started flirting again, which I am totally okay with. After curving him for years/months, I felt like I was giving away too easily and he would obviously loose interest. But even knowing this, I gave in. By now I can figure out how he’s going to act before certain situations, what he’s doing, relationships, etc. So, one day chatting, he just brought up “wouldn’t you like to be my girlfriend?”, to which, after minutes of just smiling like a goof before the phone, replied: “lol no, that’s scary”. Which actually is really freaking scary to me knowing he would purposely cheat and possibly is just a manipulating tactic to get something out of me.

Well, after that convo, he would constantly push relationship topics, baby topics, flirting, going out topics, etc. It was like living my highschool fantasy except I knew he was just telling me what he thinks a girl who is in love with him would like to hear. Yet, I gave in to the fantasy and after a few days, flirting became one night of sexting. We had already arranged another day to actually see each other, smoke a blunt and possibly- if I wanted to- have sex. But after the night of sexting, he has become...absent. And we’re just friends, why would I even ask him about his absence if it’s not his responsibility to get back to me? I’m just holding off pretty well and giving him space, venting on reddit.

And here’s what pisses me off: I already knew giving in the easy way would draw him away, his personality is made up just like that. It’s 4am and I’m wishing, that I had never fallen in love with someone who is just constantly leading me on because he can’t control his libido. I’m pretty sure he was also sexting someone else that day, and they won. Not me. I know I shouldn’t worry, I shouldn’t care, but he knows how bad I got it for him and using it to his advantage to just have me there as a spare. I don’t know, I have no idea how to get out of this. I’m tired of just being that second option, the spare, the mistress. How can I get out, if I have tried getting out and just fall back into this mess constantly? Do I confront him? I just- really love him as an overall friend, he has heard me for so long and i dont wan to cut him off, but like also- is he actually taking advantage or am I crazy?",10Aug2020,1
71,"Incoming rant.

I'm extremely indecisive, I'm compelled to quadruple-check almost everything I do so I barely trust my own memory.
I'm extremely worried about certain aspects of cleanliness to the point where I completely neglected others.
My rituals for going to bed at night are so long and cumbersome that going to bed is more tiring than just staring at the ceiling.
I get so paranoid about food and exercise that I'll take too much medicine because ""I don't know if it's working"" or if I don't exercise that day I'm simultaneously too weak and too fat and never going to go anywhere. 

If I manage to avoid certainly rituals by will I'm extremely anxious and paranoid afterwards until a certain other predetermined requirement is met.

I can't even eat the fruits from my garden because any time I bite into them I worry I'm going to get ""parasites"" and spit it out :(. I managed to eat a few slices of watermelon but I'm super anxious now and that's why I'm making this post.",10Aug2020,1
72,"This post is a summary of the article [here](https://thelensnola.org/2020/08/04/louisiana-supreme-court-wont-review-life-sentence-for-man-convicted-of-attempting-to-steal-hedge-clippers/)

The Louisiana Supreme Court has denied a request to review the life sentence of Fair Wayne Bryant, convicted of attempted theft in 1997.

In a lone dissent, the soul black Justice Bernette Johnson wrote that Bryant’s “life sentence for a failed attempt to steal a set of hedge clippers is grossly out of proportion to the crime and serves no legitimate penal purpose.”

She also called into question the habitual offender laws, which allow prosecutors to seek harsher sentences for crimes that normally wouldn’t warrant them if a person has previous convictions. She wrote that they were the “modern manifestation” of “Pig Laws” — implemented following Reconstruction, they introduced extreme punishments for property crime associated with poverty, and largely freed ex-slaves.

Johnson also noted the cost associated with the continued incarceration of Bryant in Louisiana State Penitentiary (which was built on the site of a former slave plantation) already totals $518,667.

“Arrested at 38, Mr. Bryant has already spent nearly 23 years in prison and is now over 60 years old,” Johnson wrote. “If he lives another 20 years, Louisiana taxpayers will have paid almost one million dollars to punish Mr. Bryant.”
The justices that declined to consider Bryant’s request for review — all white men — did not issue written rulings explaining their reasoning.

74,"I will preface my post by saying that I am posting this because I feel alone and the things I’ve gone through and my mind being broken makes me feel alone.
My first and biggest issue I gave everyday is eating. I’m not afraid of doing it, and I’m not afraid gaining weight, honestly I hate my body being so skinny. Eating is an issue for me because I do not enjoy it. I don’t remember when but at some point my ability to feel hungry stopped functioning and it was so long ago that I don’t even remember what it’s like to feel hungry. 
My next issue is that I go days without sleeping but yet I am perfectly alert and aware as if I had had a good nights sleep but I didn’t today I the fourth day in a row I haven’t slept. 
Then there is my body it’s self I have nothing noteworthy to speak of, if anything my butt is small I am very skinny the only clothes I can wear are slim fit and skinny jeans otherwise even the best clothes look baggy on me and I can’t find underwear that fits properly. 
I can hardly understand things that are important to people my age and I have to be someone I’m not because of that.
I suffer from smiling depression which means that it’s near impossible for me to say to people I am physically around that I need help or that I’m not okay because of this no one truly knows me.",10Aug2020,1

I got married young, thinking that my marriage would look like my parents did, fairytale love. It didn’t turn out that way. 

I’ve heard people say, maybe you need to learn how to be by yourself. 

I’ve took that to heart. I’ve contemplated on it and here’s what I got:

I know how to be by myself, I just prefer not to. I’m not scared of being alone inside my head, but I like letting someone in there with me. I like exploring and discussing life with someone. I like bouncing off my thoughts and ideas and pains and hearing someone else’s perspective. 

I’m again looking for someone my soul clicks with and it’s a bit scary and sad. I’ve been thinking of those soul connections I’ve lost and preparing myself for the possibility of that happening again. But I think being loved and loving someone back is worth the risk.

83,"My (17 nearly 18) daughter says that a doctor diagnosed her with Ellers Dalos syndrome a couple of weeks ago, and she says one of her doctors suspects she is leaking spinal fluid out of her back. She says she has headaches, ringing in her ears and muscle twitches all day every day. She says sleeping in bed helps her symptoms which I believe is a load of shit and she is being lazy.

For the past year, I notice she keeps 'forgetting' things, last night she told me she forgot to not turn the Air Conditioner on and she said she was 'sorry' I told her she was lying and to quit bullshitting. She then acted confused and kept saying she forgot and she's sorry and she's not doing it on purpose.

I told her she won't keep forgetting things if I kick her out of the house. She then got really assertive with me and told me that I am being 'irrational' so I told her 'don't tell ME who is being irrational, who do you think you're talking to?'.

She replied with 'you're threatening to cut off the power and kick me out of the house because I forget things sometimes. How is that rational?' and that's when I gave her that response.

I told her I felt like leaving home and kicking her out the house would help her, then she calmly said 'no, a doctor thinks an epidura blood patch will help me.' I told her that's a load of shit and the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

She'd ordered food and I told her I hope she chokes on her chips and I will not be forgetting last night about how she spoke back to me like she was on a moral higher ground. I told her I hope she forgets her plane ticket to her dad's country back home so I don't have to deal with her. Just a few weeks ago she forgot what bin to put something in and I told her if she keeps forgetting things or not doing things properly (she blames 'confusion' on this) I will kick her out the house. She always does stuff for her friends but she doesn't want to do stuff for me.

She told me she has 'brain fog' and I told her that's a load of bullshit invented by snowflakes and she told me to look it up on a website, I didn't. She was on her computer later on and I asked her 'are you telling all your friends about me being abusive to you?' then she showed me it was a music video she was watching.",10Aug2020,1

So it grabs peoples attention, and on numerous occasions I've seen customers poking fun at her. This makes me sick, but I try to ignore it...

I probably don't need to mention all the racist talk I've heard in my small town, especially since the protests started. Then there's the matter of how they treat me. I'm not a self checkout machine, I'm a human. You'd be surprised how many people straight up ignore my ""hello"", or ""have a nice day"", and just toss their money at me and leave. It's getting so old. It's also worrisome because I'm in school to hopefully become a counselor or some other type of helping profession one day.

My first boyfriend, of 2 years, had to keep me a secret because his family would not have approved of us. So I was always called the “friend”. We never did romantic things in public and never posted anything about us to social media.

I’ve been seeing a different guy now for over a year. I even stayed with him for 3 months during quarantine. During phone conversations to his friends he would always refer to me as a “just a friend”. Sometimes on weekends he would suddenly tell me he was hanging out with friends and then disappear for about 8 hours to spend time with them. I was never invited and instead just sat in his house waiting for him. I don’t even know if his friends know my name. Both my ex and this new guy have in the past told me to “be quiet” while they were on the phone to their parents as they did not want them to know about me. I’ve always had to pretend like I’m not there.

I’m so tired of feeling like a secret to the people I care about. I’ve never hidden them away from my friends and family. I always talk about them, and my ex used to be really good friends with my friends. 

Every time I think about this is makes me cry. I long for the moment when someone can hold my hand publicly and say “this is my girlfriend”. I wanna post photos to social media. I wanna do cute things in public. I wanna feel like I’m important to someone. I really want to be the best girlfriend I can be for someone. 

I cry a lot about this, and then I feel bad for crying because it feels like such an insignificant thing to be upset over. I haven’t had the courage to talk about this to the guy I’m seeing because it doesn’t feel like my place to do so.

Luckily, the way my work schedule is I end up getting 10 days off. Pretty cool. I don't know many people down here, so I spend a lot of time hanging out with my cousin and his girlfriend. The highlight being when we float the river. My God, what a relaxing experience. Just sitting there while listening to John Denver's ""Sunshine on my Shoulders"" was heavenly. I actually felt happy for the first time in a long while. Honest-to-God happy. My toes ended up getting bit by a turtle while I was just floating lol. There were other people around as I yelled, ""Ahhhh! Fuck!"" They probably thought I was nuts lol. We met some cool guys about halfway through the float that we ended up chilling and floating the rest of the way with. They didn't care that I was autistic or make comments about all my strange mannerisms.

Early this year I left my job of 6+ years due to management issues. A friend of mine helped me get a position at the hospital in his department and I took it thinking I could start a career finally. However, after being here for 4 months, I kind of hate it. Pridefully, I don't want to disappoint my friend and leave a job under 6 months of being there. My mental health, however, says otherwise and I believe I've decided to look for a new job.

But... it's complicated. 

A manager at my previous job is a friend of mine. He checks in on me just to see how I'm doing, and occasionally I go to his store to fill in when I can.  He's offered me a position with the company again with a similar plan to one they offered and didn't make good on last time. I want to believe him but the company left a sour taste in my mouth over last year's problems. 

My brother-in-law has asked me to apply at his workplace in sales. The money is great, the hours are good, but I'm not sure I'll enjoy it. My father wants me to go for it because everyone who works there likes it. I'll have the opportunity to become certified in all 50 states.

And, of course, I can always pick up and move states. I have friends who've offered places to stay and be comfortable until I can get a job.

110,"First of all, i'm on mobile so i'm sorry for the formatting. Also this is my first post on reddit ever so please excuse any general mistakes. I'm not really sure if this fits here but i didn't know where else to post. Let me know if this should be in another sub.

Tl;dr at the end

As the title says, i fostered a kitten for about a month. He was rescued from the street and nobody could keep him so i agreed to foster him. I was determined not to keep him because of limited space in my apartment, i'm away from home quite a lot and just overall not feeling like it would be right to keep him.

Last week i posted about giving him up for adoption and this very sweet older lady called me and let me know she wanted him and today i went to her place and gave him to her. When i left, i started crying uncontrollably. It's been a few hours and i still cry on and off. I just really miss him running around and cuddling with me and giving me kisses and my tiny apartment just feels empty.

I know i made the right choice to give him up because the lady has another kitten and a larger apartment so i know he's gonna be happy and the lady is genuinely very nice and extremely loving and kind. I'm just feeling sad because he was starting to feel like my baby and i'm only realizing it now.

I'm sorry for the wall of text but i just needed to unload a little bit. If anybody fosters or has fostered animals can give me some insight on how you deal with giving the animals away eventually, it would be much appreciated.

Tl;dr: i fostered a kitten and gave him away for adoption today and i feel like i shouldn't have now that he's gone.",10Aug2020,1
112,"I find myself thinking about this a lot.  What is the point of life? Sure, I have things that I find fun, I have friends that I like to hang out with.  But there are also so many things that make me feel like shit and things that I can’t stop overthinking.  My question is why should I be alive if I can be dead? If i was dead, I’d have no troubles, no more worries, and the good things in life wouldn’t matter anymore because, well, I’m dead.  Everything would simply cease to exist.  So what’s the harm in just ending everything right now?  Every argument to not kill yourself seems so worthless because you’d be dead, and like I said before nothing would even matter anymore.

Hey guys, I’m a 23 year old veteran and I’ve been through the ringer. It’s now Oct 2019 and separated Aug 2018 and I haven’t been able to get a job since then. I separated because I was being harassed by my supervisor who was friends with everyone up my chain of command. Long story short they bamboozled me, I was in Germany for 3 years, a new airman with no family and they took advantage of me. Basically after 3 years, they gave me 4 days to out-process 3 bases, then when I left they threw that paper away and signed in my absence stating the military owed me nothing and changed the coding on my DD214. I didn’t find out that the coding had been changed until I was enrolled in college and my GI Bill got denied. It’s been down hill since then. I owe the school thousands because I had to drop out after it was too late. The VA won’t help. I can’t get a job, almost like I’ve been black listed. I feel like a criminal. My car recently got repossessed. And can you believe after all this time I haven’t even gotten my final pay from the military. Yes. A year and 2 months, not even paid for my last 2 weeks of work and my leave days. I haven’t even come close to scraping the tip of the iceberg with this one. Haven’t even mentioned my living situation, it’s been tough. I’m keeping my head up. Thanks for listening.",10Aug2020,1
114,"I (20F) am planning for my future and have collaborated with my fiance (30M) to make a timeline of when our kids will be born: Give birth to kid #1 when I'm 22, Kid #2 when I'm 25, kid #3 when I'm 28 and there's room for a possible 4th when I'm 30 but we aren't sure if we'll want more (maybe we'll have twins before that, maybe we'll just change our mind). I'm trying to arrange my work and school like around that timeline. A career is really important to me and I want to be able to go full steam ahead in my career once my kids are self sufficient enough. It's also crucial to me that my kids have a mother around while they are young. Since I won't be done with university at 22, I figured I could hustle to finish it at 25, around the time that we have our 2nd kid. But if I finished at 25 then took 5 years off to focus on motherhood, it would be so difficult to join the workforce after all my skills are 5 years old. That's why I'm considering slowing the part time college down even more to 2 or courses a semester, rather than 4, and finish at age 28, around the time that we have our 3rd. This strategy would mean I only have a two year gap between graduating and starting to work, and it would mean that taking classes while having kids would be an easier process. It's a very attractive plan but I am nervous about taking so long to graduate college. Statistically, people who have kids before they graduate at all are more likely to not succeed, but I think this plan could actually work.

TLDR: I (20F) have made the decision to have kids between 22 and 28 (possibly 30) but still want a successful career after I give birth.

I would love to hear feedback on what you think of all this and if you or someone you know has tried a similar strategy.",10Aug2020,1

118,"and it still hurts like it did a year ago. Though he was ""just a hamster,"" I loved him and still do love him so much. I adopted him when he was only about a month old, I even knew the exact day he was born: January 8th, 2017. The day he was born and the day I adopted him were the best days of my life, even though I didn't know him yet when he was just born. 


I named him Jamie. He was the cutest little thing, a gray dwarf hamster with a dark stripe going down his back and a while belly. I always joked that he looked like a burnt marshmallow haha  


A couple weeks after I got Jamie, when I would first try to hold him, he was shy. Despite that, he never bit me, not even a nibble. He was so sweet, he loved being pet and his fur was so soft. When I would get home from school, despite being nocturnal, Jamie would run up to the front of his cage to greet me and I'd always give him a treat. I miss that. 


He was subject to countless monologues of mine. I'd tell him about how my day was, drama, or play Daft Punk and EDEN out loud. He knew everything that was going on in my life


Jamie was there for me for my worst days and my best ones. His presence always cheered me up when I was feeling down and always uplifted me even more when I was feeling happy. He was there for me last summer during the worst year of my life. 


The only other friend I really have is my mom, and she's amazing. However, I still miss Jamie. Everyone I've ever become friends with has only been a ""pity friend."" They felt bad for me and thought that by being my friend they'd get some sort of clout. Even though I don't think that Jamie had the capacity to care about me, at least he wasn't with me out of pity. 


Sorry about rambling, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I'm not looking for friendship or anything, I've given up on that long ago. I just wanted somewhere where I could mourn my friend and talk about him. He was the best. 


I miss you Jamie &lt;3

119,"At the age of 18, I moved with my dad to Ohio so he could reunite with my stepmom after they had some marriage problems which they worked out. I started my senior year in Ohio which I luckily passed.
I knew I had to get in college so I could provide for myself in the future. That's when I found out web design. I tried it out by watching a couple of tutorials on YouTube and thought I should pursue that.
Before I moved to Ohio, I started creative writing. I did that for three or four years. i was improving quite nicely. But, for some reason, I was a moron that decided to not take my writings with me!
I've spent the past seven years struggling with everything. I was an idiot 19 year old fresh out of high school, thinking I'd be able to move to Australia working a minimum wage job. I got fired from my first job at age 21 after working there for a year and a half.
I spent the next seven and a half months job searching, which was fucking horrendous.
I then got a job at a casino in Dayton which I worked as a janitor for a month before moving back to Tennessee. That move was probably not a good idea considering that I spent six more months looking for another job. During that time, my parents and I were living with my aunt. During that time, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I was checking out all of these possible careers until one day I said, ""Fuck it. I don't care right now.""
Luckily, I managed to snatch up a cashier position at Hardees. That job lasted for a year when I was fired for trying to solve an issue with a coworker the wrong way. Fortunatley, I got my next job a week later working as a cook at Sonic.
That was god awful. I was making $7.25 an hour while hardly working 30 hours a week and getting paid every two weeks. The manager there was a a mega-bitch because her daughter was a hellion. I couldn't afford to eat on my own and I struggled to pay rent. I was 22/23 and my landlords liked to fuck with me, thinking I was stupid. There were days where I would go without eating.
My parents went back to Ohio and I went with them after a month or two.
After moving back, I decided to put my education on hold and look for a room to rent. Luckily, after a couple of weeks of looking, I found a place to stay.
I decided to quit the job (mostly due to incompitent coworkers and piece of shit manager) that I was at and went to work for Kroger. I got back into school after starting there and the managers didn't want to work with my schedule. So, I failed two of my classes and now I'm in academic probation. I've tried three times to get out of it and they haven't accepted any of my managers' letters. What they need is a note from my manager telling them that they will work with my schedule.
I'll turn 27 in October and I feel fucking exhausted. 2020 has made me realize a lot of things about myself so far. I'm on my 9th job in seven years. I say that I know what I want to do for a career (web development), but then again, I just don't feel up to it. I thik my father has brainwashed me.
I realized that he's a toxic narcissist who wants to bring me down to his level. Everytime I told him what I wanted to go to school for, his response would be ""You don't know how to do that. What do you know about computers? People have been doing stuff like that their whole lives!""
I'd like to get my shit together, but I'm just so damn exhausted even by the thought of that!

121,"Someone I know was recently ranting how their workplace wouldn't let them work from home (they are in a state with less stringent requirements than mine and at a smaller company, probably with a smaller legal team). As someone who is lucky enough to have the opportunity to continue working at near-full capacity from my home, I felt a lot of sympathy and tried to offer some support and guidance. I don't think any of us want to get the virus even if we are at low risk of getting any long-term complications from it, and we also want to prevent it from spreading to protect more vulnerable individuals.

Well I just recently saw a snap story they posted of them at a party with like 30 other people! An indoor house party! Music, copious beer, drunken shenanigans, the whole works! Very few masks, because *you can't drink in a mask* (as if the virus is courteous enough to recognize you are 'between' shotgunning beers and holding off)

Please stop with the mental gymnastics. Private gatherings and parties are believed to be one of the largest spreading events of the virus, more potent than even many public locations. Stop it with your cutesy social distancing social media posts if you can't stop yourself from going all out once a week. This isn't a college course where a C will get you a degree. It doesn't matter if you *follow* the rules for 6 days of the week if you continually break it the 7th. The virus doesn't take days off and doesn't care about your justification for why you needed to unwind. God forbid, I wouldn't even care as much if you were just blatant about your lack of concern, at least then I would know to avoid you until this all blows over. But can anyone be trusted?

One of my relatives works at a wine/beer store and amuses me with stories about how multiple customers a day are buying an entire cart full of beer cases and then giving the 'social distance gathering schpeel'. Okay. I'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt and say there is an outdoor cookout where people are wearing masks when not separated, but I am reminded that this isn't true.

And I have seen the disappointment. I have almost heard the sound of something crushing. She phoned to my psychiatrist. He told two pills wouldn’t do anything bad but still I needed to go to  the hospital. However, she was reluctant in doing that because of the virus. He had gotten angry and told my mother that she should have taken better care of me. I have seen her again. I felt her pain which was way more greater that I once tried to surpass. That was the turn.

138,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

142,"TW: suicidal thoughts, self hatred, sexual abuse, and some other things.

It was just one of those dumb fun things you could fill out. If you filled it out, you could win something I think. I didnt fill it out. I think those things are pointless. I guess if someone forced me to answer, I would give some bullshit reply. I would say my mom or something. Even though that isnt the truth. Not that I hate my mom, but I dont exactly respect her. We have never had the best relationship. She is far from the worst mom, but definitely not a super great one.

Most of the other females in my family aren't the greatest either. They are either super selfish, or just complete white trash. Never really had too many other role models in my life. Maybe like my second grade teacher or something, but I cant remember her name. I dont really have many friends either. The friends I do have aren't great. There are probably some famous historical figures I could name, but I dont really know much about them, other than their basic achievements. There are maybe a few celebrities I admire a bit, but I dont worship celebrities.

The one name I thought of was Casey Glover. None of you know who she is, but she is very close person to me. Probably no one else on earth would pick her. Probably for good reason. She would be baffled if anyone picked her. I wouldnt have thought, I would have picked her, but she was the first person that came mind for some reason. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense to me.

She has been though so much. She was molested as child by relatives. She was beaten with a wooden stick by her parents and told how lucky she was, because supposedly being beat with a belt hurts so much worse than a stick. She was bullied in school. She was called sissy, faggot, and many other things. She was beat up a few times. That is why she is so muscular now. She tried to prove how much of man she was. That is why she attempted to grow that beard. That beard looked so awful.

She is transgender. Transgender people have a 40% suicide rate. She has BPD. People with BPD have a 10% suicide rate. She also has social anxiety (Which may be the worst of all her issues. It prevents her from having many friends. Cause most people to be afraid of her and call her a serial killer among other things.), was bullied in school, and was sexually abused as a child. Not sure what the suicide rate is for those people, but it probably similar to the other two. That fact that she is still breathing is a mild miracle.

She has struggled not take her own her life. She has thought about suicide almost everyday since she was 12. She made a series of posts on Reddit a few days ago about how much she wanted to mutilate her body. Very graphic disturbing posts. She deleted most of them, but left a few suicidal posts up, if you want to read them.

She has had to stand up to all of her conservative family and come out as transgender. She would have rather committed suicide than come out. But, she chose a life of lonliness over death. She had tried to live, like everyone else. Like a cis gendered person. She knew that she had to transition or die. She chose a life of pain over the easy choice of death. She still fights with suicide almost everyday, but everyday she wins.

She has to deal with a world that hates her. Her whole existence is a political debate. Some of her favorite authors that she respected as a child, that were there for her when no one else was, think that she is a plague to womankind. Even with all of this she is still here.

And for the first time ever, despite all the self hatred, she loves herself. I know this because she is me. I know this may seem egotistical. If you have never felt self hatred, I get why you would think I am full of myself, but for the first time ever, I respect myself. I couldn't forget this moment. I had to save this moment. Share with some strangers. Thank you to the 3 people that will read this. And to three people reading this, please respect yourself. Respect everyone around you also, but you must respect yourself.",10Aug2020,1

145,"My grandmother passed away today. I feel really fucking sad.

I talked to her a week ago. I visited for the day and helped her put up decorations.

I spent a lot of time with her until I moved away (part of becoming an adult)

But I feel awful. I hope she was happy. I hope she never felt neglected by me. I’ve always been very sweet to her. I love her so much. One of the best women I’ve ever met. So kind and giving. I hope she felt loved. I hope she wasn’t scared. I wonder where her spirit is now.

I wish I could hug her. She knows I love her. I just wish I had more time.",10Aug2020,1
148,"So recently my bf and I have broken up and I won't deny the fact that it was 100% my fault because I cheated on him. However I only cheated on him because there were so many different sus things that he was doing but I liked him too much to even breakup with him. He had so many girl friends and he would always hang out with them but would never hang out with me. Whenever he called me we would talk for 5 mins before it went completely silent and the only thing I would hear would be the dinging on his computer because he was texting other people. He told me that so many girls slid into his dms and he claimed that he always curved them but he never mentioned the fact that he had a gf so was he really curving them. On national gf's day he went out and got pancakes with another girl. He also rarely showed me any attention or affection. 

All of this lead me to believe that he was cheating on me and it made me so insecure. A week ago one of my old flings hit me up and asked if I wanted to hu. At first I told him that I had a bf but then he said that my bf wouldn't find out and I was tempted. So that night he came over and we didn't do anything but we just chilled but then after that day he came over everyday pretty much and we would hu and then just chill into morning. I only agreed to this because I loved the physical affection he would give me that I craved from my bf but didn't receive. I know that there is no way to justify the fact that I cheated and I deeply regret it from the bottom of my heart and I would never do it again. 

Anyways he found out about the fact that I cheated on Saturday while we were hanging out and I won't go into detail about how he found out but the person who called herself my best friend exposed me. After he found out he just left so when he went home I begged him to give me just 5 mins to talk to him and explain why and he did and after he hung up I figured the whole thing was done. Later that night he ft me again to get closure but it basically was just him insulting me and telling me to kill my self. Every time I mentioned how he made me feel insecure he'd turn it on me saying I wasn't valid in feeling like that. Anyways he eventually hung up and I thought that would be the end of it but he ended up calling me again at 5 in the morning demanding I tell him everything that happened or else he'll tell my parents everything and ruin my entire life. I came clean about everything and he got even more mad. He then demanded that I show him my entire room and even my closet and under my bed bc he thought my ex would be there. He then made me prop my laptop up in a place where he could see my entire room and ordered me to stand in front of him. He made me put my phone down so I was empty handed and I basically just stood there. He then started threatening me saying he would ruin my entire life and tell my parents everything if I didn't tell him my snapchat and instagram passwords so he could look through them. After he found nothing he made me give him my icloud password so he could look through my photos and text messages. He couldn't see my text messages for some reason so he made me screen record my chat with my fling and when he saw that my fling was criticizing him for taking things too far and milking things out he flipped out over the fact that I was still talking to him while on call with him. After all this he said he'd consider us getting back together just so he could torment me and cheat on me as well. He then hung up but called me back 2mins later to tell me we were done.

Today I found out that he sent this to his friend. ""I've been so bored during quarantine and I already knew that she was gonna cheat on me so I've been emotionally distancing myself and now that I've been presented with this golden ticket of opportunity that justifies anything I do to her, I'm going to ruin her life and make sure she never cheats again."" 

I totally understand that he is upset about the fact that I cheated but I'm starting to think that he's not upset about it bc he actually loved me but bc his pride is hurt and he is taking things too far. I also heard that he treated his previous girlfriends really badly and is super manipulative. What am I supposed to do in a situation like this?",10Aug2020,1

151,"I’ve always been the sort to pop random questions to my friends. I found it interesting how various friends (male and female) answered that question “do you love yourself”? Many responded that they don’t and don’t think they ever will. Others were surprised that this was even up in the air- “huh, who wouldn’t love themselves?”

More importantly, I realized that many also define self-love in different ways. Often, it relates to acceptance of one’s own flaws and insecurities. It might be about physical insecurities (e.g., body size, acne etc) or about emotional insecurities (e.g., personal inadequacies).

To me, self-love means prioritising your needs over others. Of course, I don’t mean it in a selfish manner. Rather, it’s about not forgetting to care and stand up for yourself when you need to. We may focus on fulfilling the needs and wants of others but suppress and neglect our own needs and desires. For me, I often find it hard to say no to others. In the end, I find myself in (unnecessarily) uncomfortable situations that stunt my personal growth. I think one classic example is staying in toxic relationships.


I’m still working on it. I’m still trying to come to terms with how I’m a work in progress and that I should be kinder to myself. I’m flawed and that’s alright as long as I can work on it or accept it. If I can instantaneously comfort my friends about similar insecurities without much thought, why can’t I do the same for myself?

I wanna know whether you love yourself and what that means to you. It would be great if you could also share any helpful strategies or advice!",10Aug2020,1

153,"My son is into pro wrestling and he and his friends play wrestle all the time. Recently he had some friends over and they competed like they always do. For some reason they asked me, his mother, to compete against the winner. Since they're only 11 I thought it was cute and obviously safe but damn... The kid was stronger than I thought, I didn't stand a chance. I had to tell them I went easy on him but I doubt they believed me. Is it normal for kids that age to be stronger than me?

Idk, he just makes me happy. Really happy. He’s so sweet and kind, and checks all the boxes. I’m 19, he’s nearly 20, and we both go to the same college.

157,"my lifes view has been shattered in the last few weeks. at the end if it all is money, i will need repiars that i dont think insurance will fix. if i call and they deny then thats bad as well. its not like, the storms blew things apart but they exposed problems that likely led to worsening. im feeling incredibly uncertain and losing confidence. whats worse is i cant conduct myself through these times. in calling comoanies that dont call back to, being frozen on what choice to make, through self hate for not putting 2 and 2 together...i was so preoccupied with work and then drinking, then  other avoidance of family stress that any time i did have to myself i was numb or just trying to cope. i know its all my fault and now i cant fix it. what once was a home now feels like im living in a death trap. ive thiught about selling but it feels like no one would want it but if i magically renovate then sell i lose...WHATEVER I think i should do always has more downsides, i can barely hold a broom in my hand to tidy up without feeling anxiety. every but of a clutter feels like trash. im seeking  therapy but im incredibly alone in all this even though i have a spouse. they lean on me and in have no one to be a friend, mentor, buddy...i always felt sad that i didnt grow up with the part if the family where they taught you how to change the oil in a car. this situation has ripped open old wounds of how new, dangerous territory just beats me down. i thought i was over this. i really wish i had friends and family to rally around me. im barely working well enough either so the pin to this whole situation may be me getting fired. nithing bad will happen if i can learn to function with feelings from terror to despair and wish to escape...i cant leave or kill myself though, at least i dont feel sad enough to kill myself though ive felt like maybe its time to opt out and see what i leave behind. did i say im seeking therapy? i just feel like no one cares about me.",10Aug2020,1

It leaves me feeling like I sound suspicious or I end up oversharing because I’m worried about them not believing? Idk.
