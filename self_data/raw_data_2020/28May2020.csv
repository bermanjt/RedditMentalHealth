3,"So i had a onn 8 inch tablet which was brand new. 16 gb storage, 2 gb of ram and a 1.3 ghz quad-core processor.

&amp;#x200B;

It had been working perfectly well for one month.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, a system update occured, and it flipped the screen the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

Well i tried entering recovery mode, which i had to go on google to figure the crap out, and finally was able to do it, but that was flipped too. then, after i reset the tablet by looking at a bunch of wording that looked like arabic, the screen has still not flipped back.

&amp;#x200B;

I called walmart and they said that if i had bought the protection plan, and i said no. So, i had only 15 days to return it.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the assoicate at the counter when i bought my tablet never even mentioned about the protection plan.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm P\*\*\*ed because I now cant trust them with my money anymore. MY TABLET IS NOTHING BUT A PAPERWEIGHT NOW and it's just another $64 down the drain. That tablet just simply did not cut it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do and am furious with them because they never even asked for a protection plan on their own brand of devices and can't even give me any information on who to call as a last resort.

&amp;#x200B;

ugh. i used to love walmart.

&amp;#x200B;

now... not so much,

Do you guys have any ideas?",28May2020,1
5,"I’m not sure who else to ask this question to so here it goes. I’m very confused spiritually and don’t even know what I would consider myself to be. I was brought up a Christian and even from a very young age I always had questions. I believe in God somewhat, it’s more so a hope than it is a belief. I am quite haunted by the fact that I may never see anyone after death. Honestly I would have rather been just born a normal person that didn’t ask all these deep questions and just accepted what I was told but instead I ask these questions that no one has answers to. This is more so me just asking for others points of view than it is a question.",28May2020,1

8," I have wanted my own room for a long time 12-19 years to be exact. Once it was the case bc I wanted to get my fam off the streets, then because I wanted to get away from her abusive boyfriends who always beat the shit out of her. After she left me, it was a room to get away from my fosters.  A room where I wasn't bossed around or  torn up every instant I messed up. I found the closest thing to love I have found with another troubled individual. He isn't too bright, but I think the way the past hurt my memory it slowed down his ability to learn. I have a sister who doesn't mind my moms chaos enough to leave yet. She wants to make money. maybe in the military. 
 I think heads like ours don't do good in that environment. She says I am the only stable person in the family. The only person she can count on. Maybe I am the only person she has besides herself. Although, I hope I am not.
Because I can't tale care of myself right now.
I've tried, but it just seems my optimism is constantly shredded.
Guys, I made it to a good college and I got into the chem Eng. program with honors. I found a foster community who make me feel less alone, but I think I am sabotaging myself too.
I needed to put so much into chem. Eng. I didn't wanna be a slave to hw anymore tho, so I thought maybe I should change major. Its been 3 quarters into that process. I have changed classes but I am technically still in engineering. I haven't been doing too good at school. I failed chem, I am on academic probation. Right now, I am failing stats. It won't affect me if I put it as pass no pass though thankfully so I am still kinda safe, but I don't know how I am doing in Spanish or Sociology.
 Right now, I am sick with a possible UTI complication or a head case. 
I have been crying beacause the room I have just started renting is insanely hot. It's gotten me kicked out of my own room and secluded to the living room in front of the AC which only makes the bills me and my housemate make increase.
I feel defeated and I think I am self sabotaging. 
My sister called in and we've begun planning for her to move in with me. 
My guy just tells me I can do this. I look at his grades and I feel panicked. If I drop out or wind up getting kicked out of here I cannot help my sis and I can't secure his future with my success either.
I am scared that I am spiraling down or out.
Pls help or advice me.",28May2020,1
9,"When I was young I told my story to get attention. I wanted people to notice me, to think I was special, to maybe even feel bad for me. 

Now it’s the story of my growth, my backstory, and represents all that I’ve had to overcome to get to where I wanted to go. 

When I was around the age of 5, I remember bawling my eyes out as my mom walked down the stairs of the home we shared with my grandpa and a few other people. She was packed, and was leaving me. 

I remember he telling me “I’ll be back to get you soon.” Over and over again. 

After that I had to live with my grandpa, who was overall mentally abusive. He told my grandma that if she didn’t come and get me that he’d send me into foster care. 

So she did. After that I lived in the mountains with her and my slightly older uncle where we worked as campground hosts. 

Everyday we could get on our golf cart and would go to each campground picking up every single piece of garbage, we’d clean the bathroom, etc. 

Sometime during all that my new stepdad and my mom fought my grandma for custody. My grandma fortunately won, because my stepdad wanted to send me into foster care anyways. 

So my grandma was my legal guardian after that. 

We moved around a lot, mostly to trailer parks, then to my grandmas boyfriends, then to the trailer park, then to my grandmas boyfriends, and it went on and on and on. 

My grandmas boyfriend, or POS, whatever you prefer to call him, was an alcoholic, and his daughter was perfect no matter what she did to us or my grandma. 

In 2009 is when my mom had my little sister, she was born premature (probably from both of her parents abusing drugs) and actually was doing surprisingly well for 14 days until my grandma won legal custody over her and my stepdad pulled the plug on her incubator out of spite. 

I do not remember much of that time, but I was told by my grandma that I fought them constantly trying to protect my little sister at the funeral. 

I got so upset that I accidentally knocked over her coffin. 

My grandma told me that I fought them so hard while she was being buried, literally tooth and nail. 

My mom was murdered by my stepdad in 2010. I do not remember much of the funeral either, but from what my grandma told me, it was terrible (I don’t want to talk about it). 

Sometime after that we moved to Nevada, where POS ended up stealing a whole bunch of my grandmas, mine, and my uncles money, he also raided our storage shed that we had back home. 

He took many of my grandmas stuff, like power washers, tools, her grandpas fishing poles, etc. 

They also broke snow globes that my mom had bought me as a baby, and threw other sentimental things around. 

Around that time, my grandma had finally broken up with him for good, but the nights got so cold that she allowed him to sleep on the floor in the trailer on a carpet. 

My grandma told him not to turn on the gas heater, since it could blow us up in our sleep. 

I remember waking up to a weird smell, and hearing something weird, so I told my grandma and he was kicked out for good. 

She told me that I likely saved everyone’s life. 

After that we moved to kind of like a duplex, where life was pretty enjoyable for a couple years. Nearly died to scorpions that I was deathly allergic to a few times, but overall it was one of the best places that we’ve lived. 

While we were living there, I finally got curious about who my actual dad was, I had never met him and completely forgot until then about the possibility of me having a dad ( I was slightly dumb lol). 

My grandma told me that my mom would never tell anyone who the father was, during the time she got pregnant with me, she had dated a few guys. 

One she dated for over 3 years, where they tried for a baby for all of those years but “failed”, one was one of his friends, and I think there may have been another one. 

She said that I looked almost exactly like the daughter of the second guy in terms of a few things when I was younger. 

I had the first guys hairline, etc. 

So we met up with my potential grandparents after my grandma got in contact with them, since this guy was dead, they were both going to do a test to determine if I was related to them or not. 

It ended up being basically 100%, so obviously I was his. This meant that I was an orphan though.(this was in 2011). 

We moved around a few more times until somewhere around 2015, when we rented this pretty large house up on this hill. 

Around that time is when my dads dad died, which sucked super bad because I had just started to bond with him. 

He wanted me to have his fly tying tools and a box of his amazing handmade ones. My dad and my grandpa both got into tying flies together. My dad was a mechanic, so I got his truck, which is still the 2nd only thing I have of his. 

My grandpa wanted me to have all of this stuff, but my grandma gave it all to one of my cousins, who then gave it to me for my birthday in 2017. 

Around that time is when I found out I had carcinoma thyroid cancer, and I had the first birthday party that I’ve had in my whole life where my family (surprisingly) got together for me. 

Not much drama was surprisingly caused, but I still disliked most of the people there, did appreciate everything they did for me though. 

In July of that year is when I got my surgery. They removed my whole thyroid and all of my parathyroid in a 9 hours surgery. 

The doctor told my grandma that he didn’t know if I’d live through the night. What was in my neck was basically mush, and he just basically got out what he could. 

In the hospital the nurse was stealing my pain meds, which left me in severe pain. My grandma told the nurse that if I didn’t get my pain meds right then and there that she was going to go and complain (to somebody important, can’t remember now). I got my pain meds instantly right after that. 

I also had intense heat issues, where if I I even moved, it felt like I was having heat stroke. 

I basically passed out from heat on my way from the bathroom to my bed one time, and my cousin and aunt had to pack me to my bed. 

I got off those icky opioids instantly after leaving the hospital, even if they got rid of most of my pain, I hated how they made me feel. 

I had probably a week or two of those guys I was supposed to take too. 

After that I got this issue where my spinal pressure was so high that it was making my eyes become detached from my brain. 

So I had a spinal tap done that left me in severe pain for like a week. 

My aunt died not too long after that from overdosing on alcohol, while taking medications. 

Last year we finally bought a house, and moved here in August. 

Slowly I have begun the process of healing. 

In January of this year is when my best friend died, my dog Roxie. This left me devastated for like a month or so, but it was the wake up call that I needed to finally do what I wanted to do in life, plus to make moves to better myself. 

I bought myself an iPad mini so that I could pursue art like I had always wanted to do and began working on my emotional state so that I could finally be happy. 

Now I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my whole life, and I will be 19 in about a week or so. 

So yeah! Hopefully no one else gives up out there, because I know that I have given up at times! 

TL:DR: My drugaddict mom left me with my grandpa, who then passed me onto my grandma. I lived with her and she got full legal custody of me. 

My mom, sister, dad, Grandpa, dog, and aunt died. Plus I had thyroid cancer to boot. 

Now I’m happy and am pursuing my career in art!",28May2020,1
10,"It just feels like everything I do somehow annoys her. Or is like some kind of offense towards her. In every instance, she is the victim and I’m the criminal or something. 

Today my mom had an argument with some people at her work. She’s a teacher so she always deals with angry parents and stuff and I understand why that could aggravate someone, but whenever she gets upset, it ruins the entire day because she’ll take her anger out on me, my sister, and everyone she encounters that day. 

She ranted to me about the situation after it happened and said she’d rather quit but obviously can’t. Then she stormed out of the room and my family and I left to go drop my sister off at her gymnastics practice. My mom had asked the day before if I could go with her to run errands and I said yes because quarantine boredom. 

Anyways, on the way there she had the worst road rage and was basically honking and yelling at every opportunity and it’s just so uncomfortable. She was also texting the whole way there and my sister reminded my mom that she was going to be late. My mom completely went off and said that my sister was lucky that she even had the opportunity to go to gymnastics and that my mom paid for it. She said that my sister didn’t have the right to treat my mom “like that” and speak to her in that way but my sister wasn’t even doing anything. 

When we get there my sister had to wait outside until one of the coaches came outside and checked her temperature. The temperature came up as 101.7 because it’s hot outside, and so the coach said they’d wait to do it again, but the coach had to tell my mom. And my mom got so mad at the coach. 

She went off about how the checking of temperatures is stupid and that the quarantine is stupid and wearing masks doesn’t make sense and that the coach was being ridiculous for the temp checking and whenever she does that it’s just so hard to sit there and have her yell at people. The coach apologized profusely and waited for her superior to come and back her up.

The superior came and they checked my sisters temp again and apologized to my mom again and everything was fine. My sister later told me that the coach said “not many people intimidate me but your mom does” and my sister apologized for that. Kinda sucks 

The whole day running errands with my mom, she was either on the phone texting or mocking me anytime I said anything or just said everything in a backhanded manor. It was just insane and really hard to deal with. 

I’m just so sick and tired of everything that my mom does. And it’s for the littlest things too. Like one time my mom got these ice creams that I didn’t really like that much and I didn’t mean anything by it, I just said they weren’t my favorite but I’d still eat them. 

Later in the week I told my mom I wanted one, and she replied, very seriously “you aren’t allowed to eat one, you have to ask someone and see if they’re willing to give one up.” And I just left because it wasn’t worth it. 

Later on my sister told me that she was dividing the ice creams, there’s six of them so they each get three. My mom went to get one and was like “what?! This is all I get?!” My sister explains it and my mom replies “are you sure?....you better not be tricking me and giving one to (me/my name).” Like what the fuck man. 

I’m just so tired.",28May2020,1

12," For the past week or so I've started working for my local school district's buildings and grounds department for a summer job. The actual work itself is not the problem, its just weed whacking, basically. What is the problem though are the guys working for the school district. They are all 50 something years or older and they are some of the most racist, sexist, and homophobic people I have ever met in my life. Basically all of them have no problem saying the N word. I've heard the N word used multiple times by the men there. I also dread walking in there in the morning cause I know they will have the morning news on, and if there is some crime on the news and the perpetrator was black...oh boy...here come the racist remarks again... and at lunch break, one of the guys always has on ""The Price is Right"" and just loves to make creepy sexual and racist remarks about the women he finds attractive on the show ( I wish that bitch took her shirt off on camera, She's got nice tits! Not that other one though, she's just a fat \*N Word\*) . Its just really depressing cause besides the disgusting casual racism, the guys are nice to me. They help me out with the work and give me useful advice for weed whacking and such. It's just, once I learn that someone is a big-time racist, kinda hard for me to appreciate any help, ya know? I guess I should have expected all of this going in, with these guys being blue-collar workers and all (no offense to the good people out there who are not racist but work a blue-collar job) but I dunno. If another week or two goes by and I'm still working with these closeted KKK members, I think I'll talk to my parents about this shit and quit.

16,"Everyone deals with depression, anxiety, stress, basically all those bad emotions but I guess the extent of it differs for each individual. 

🙂 Thank you for not letting me feel alone with my problems. I always thought I was so weak and was not strong enough to change. Each day I look at what mistakes, the regrets and traits I need to fix about myself in order to become stronger. I am still “to nice”
but thinking of scenarios in my head of how to stand up for myself in situations helps. I’m starting to realize that even though people label me as “to nice” it doesn’t matter. Why? Because I am being “to nice” by being smart. I’m not going to run my mouth off or be rude if not given a valid reason. Even so, kill them with kindness. Be the bigger person. Yes, sometimes my chest feels heavy from stress and anger but I want to learn how to control my emotions, not let people affect it. I want to learn how to control my breathing, my thinking and live calm and happy. 

Even if people shit talk amongst themselves about me, if it’s not said directly towards me, why should I care? That shows me that those people do not have the balls to confront me. 

I’m tired of being all talk of how I would change but I was the same old weak person at the end. Realizing more and more that everyone battles a different war, makes me feel less alone. People that struggle help me realize that with strong willpower, I can change.",28May2020,1

23,"
So i was unknowingly the other woman in an affair a couple years ago. I don't condone cheating and it ended very very messily when his gf and i met at a party. No contact ensues except for one or two short run ins at a festival and a semi awkward dinner ( they're both still friends with my bff who strictly keeps out of the whole subject). I think they had it out with eachother but she decided to stay with him. Whatever. Takes me a bit but i do my best move on.

FFW to a couple days ago. Gf wants to talk to me bc she feels like something is not quite settled and her bf won't answer any questions. I feel the same and since I'm happy with someone else i want this over with. Also i don't want it to be awkward for my bff to have to keep us apart. As we're talking i realize she doesn't know that we had an affair and her bf lied to her. 
So i, as the other woman, am stuck telling her the entire sordid details. I tried to stay as objective as possible and didn't badmouth anyone except for telling her he lied but i couldn't lie to her. It probably pretty egotistic of me but while i feel terrible for having to tell her i want to keep talking about it so she knows the extent of what an asshole he is.
 Noone who's met him who i've told would have ever imagined he was such a manipulative lying cheat. He   can be so charming and charismatic that everyone just ignores any red flags or inconsistencies. 

The problem is that it still bothers me a bit to this day bc i want revenge. He's the only person I've ever actually hated i think. I want to pay him back and have him feel exactly how he made me/us feel. Simply put i want him to hurt. 
Usually it's fine and i'm just happy but every so often i feel like i want him to hurt, but idk how to go about it.

My bf is obviously unhappy about it. I told him what happened and he thinks i need to get over it and that it sounds like I'm 'holding on to my past relationship'. I think he doesn't understand my thirst for revenge.

28,"This was removed from r/casualconversation and r/talesfromretail for violating their rules. Hopefully it's fine to tell this story here.

You ever have those moments where you're just sitting around, minding your own business, and then from out of nowhere you're smacked in the face with a random memory from a decade ago? Yeah, that just happened to me and I feel like it's too good not to share.

Full disclaimer: The behavior in this story is insanely inappropriate and I don't condone it in the slightest. That doesn't mean I can't see the humor in it.

So, my former friend James is white. When he was a teenager, roughly 20 years ago, he worked at a supermarket with his best friend David, who is black. This particular supermarket was somewhere near the Mason Dixon Line, in a predominantly black neighborhood, in a town with historically high racial tension.

James hated working there with every fiber of his being. David hated it too. Their manager was, by all accounts, ""*literally* Satan."" They'd had enough, and being best friends they decided to quit at the same time, but not without putting on a show. Fortunately, David had the perfect plan.

It finally happened on a summery Saturday afternoon, when James and David knew the store would be at its fullest. While conservative housewives were filling their shopping carts with all the necessities for a post-Church Sunday barbecue, James grabbed a [pool noodle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_noodle?wprov=sfla1) from a nearby display and joined David at the very front of the store, past the registers. Nothing could have prepared those shoppers for what they were about to witness.

Without warning, David stripped off his shirt and threw his hands up on the glass wall facing the parking lot outside. James raised the purple pool noodle high over his head. ""What is your name?"" he demanded.

""Kunta... Kunta Kinte!"" replied David proudly.

""Your name is Toby!"" James brought the noodle swiftly down from the sky. It connected with David's bare skin with a resounding *twonk*. ""Say it!"" 

Onlookers watched, stunned and horrified. David howled and sobbed, ""Kunta Kinte! *Kunta Kinte!*""

By that point, security had rushed over to escort the two boys out of the building while their unwilling audience was left to process what they had just seen.

James told this story at a house party ten years ago, and I didn't want to believe it at first. That was until it was corroborated by two of his former coworkers and even David himself, who seemed both embarrassed and proud of his grand scheme. I haven't seen or heard from James in over a decade, but I like to think that he and David are still best friends.",28May2020,1

I'm not a super frequent poster, but my account definitely isn't inactive. I like to look at other people's posts to see what they're up to. I can't help but feel like maybe I did something to offend them or make them not like me.

But then what do I do once I finally accomplish that (if I continue to doing so)? And more importantly, what in the world do I have to show for it exactly?

I am busting my ass, using all my energy focusing on doing all this meaningless shit so that someone can come look at it and say “oh, that’s cool. So anyways,” or moreso that I can just make the experience of using my laptop more fun for myself when it’s all done. And that’s if I’m even satisfied with the final result! If I don’t like how it turns out in the long run, even after hours of work, I’ll scrap all of it and flush it down the drain, therefore truly making it all for nothing.

Imagine all of the things I could have done with all of that time. I could have played more sports, I could have written a song, maybe even written a book if I really wanted to, I could have been getting homework done, I could have been out and about meeting new friends. But I’m such a homebody who is for some reason terrified of leaving his comfort zone, living a little and trying new things, and if I died today, all I can say is that I clicked a mouse and pressed keys on a keyboard millions of times for years. I could have found a girlfriend, people to hang out and do things with (be it outside or at each other’s houses).

This needs to stop. Not one day eventually, not even soon, but right now. I’m not wasting my time doing bullshit that requires tons of effort but in the longrun means absolutely nothing. If only I actually realized I was doing this sooner, I would have been able to catch myself and done all of the things I wish I had instead.

There is literally no excuse for continuing this kind of behavior. I want a life, and I am going to not only seek it out but stop wasting so many and much of my precious hours and time away on meaningless bullshit. That’s all. Have a good day/night.",28May2020,1
31,"I know I chose the absolute worst time to go, but my girlfriend and I have been cooped up in our apartment in Philadelphia since the Pandemic started. We’ve done pretty much everything in Philadelphia to keep ourselves occupied during the pandemic, so we decided to take a little road trip to New York City. It’s only an hour and a half a way so we figured why not. The streets were dead, even less traffic then Philadelphia. And we just drove to all the main touristy locations. We didn’t even get out of our car. We couldn’t have been in the city for more than an hour before we came back. I thought it was cool to see everything but I probably should have waited for this shit to clear up. Was this a dumb move of me?",28May2020,1
32,"When it comes to closure, we’ve all been lied to. Society has force fed us this idea that we need absolute closure before we can move on with our lives. We have this painted picture of a perfect sit-down discussion where everyone receives the clarity they were looking for all along. We share our story, shake hands, and move along with a grin and a sense of accomplishment. Then we are cured. The heartbreak feels less broken and the confusion seems less confusing.

It’s a lie.

Endings are messy. There are loose ends that are destined to stay frayed and unkempt, ones that we could never tidy up, no matter how hard we try. Closure doesn’t come to people who are still on opposite sides, shouting over the fence and hoping their story is heard and accepted. Usually, embarking on a path for closure just ends with more hurting, more rejection, and more frustration that things never really got sorted out like you hoped.


Well, ideally, we go forward anyway. Forget trying to leave things on a high note so you can feel better about how it all ended. You don’t need that. What you do need is to be confident in the fact that things turned out the way they did for a reason. Be confident that you are meant to move on from this, no matter how the broken pieces landed. It doesn’t matter if you wish you could go back and word things differently or change the way everything played out, because you absolutely can’t change any of it. Forward is the only direction to go.

You can create your own sense of closure for yourself",28May2020,1

52,"Here is a back story
This year (I’m a freshman in college nyc) I got caught smoking weed and she was furious. I had to go to two different therapists and so on as she forced me to go saying she will not pay for my school unless I do. 

After months she still tries to get me to do what she wants saying that I have to do it or she won’t pay for my school anymore. Keep in mind I would rather not have her pay so I can grow up and do it on my own, but with how much she makes a year I am unable to receive any fasfa to afford college on my own. 

My boyfriend has offered to let me stay with him and his family if I want to go back and get away from my mom and her hold over me. We all sort of think that she is acting this way because she doesn’t want me to go back. It’s definitely not because of corona, as she herself surrounds/goes into other peoples houses and is not following social distance rules when it comes to her work. It just seems like she has some other reason for me to not go back. She says my mental health is not where it needs to be when I’ve been completely fine, I just don’t wish to talk to her because I dislike her and find it riveting that she keeps trying to make me feel like I’ve done something oh so wrong. 

I guess as far as advise would go, I’m looking for someone else to look into the situation and tell me if I’m being unreasonable with dropping her, and leaving to go to college on my own terms without her help. It’s been really tough on my mental health as she causes so much anxiety in my life. She constantly tries to hold money and literally even my relationship with my boyfriends mother over my head. (Which we have a good relationship and she supports me in staying at her house while I try to find a job/go to school etc) my mom just threatens to tell her all the “horrible things I’ve done” like smoking weed... it’s just been one thing after another with my mom and I really can’t take it anymore. I just am completely lost at what to do. I’m also going to school for photography so I don’t necessarily need a degree but I do want one to kick start my career (just want wanted to also say that)

This whole thing with her being so crazed was first due to we smoking and then me not wanting to stay with her in her house and be miserable all summer while I wait for school to hopefully open. To me, it’s just not worth waiting anymore given the circumstance of the virus. I just don’t know.",28May2020,1
53,"Recently I decided to open back up to the world of dating after many years alone, and truly, happily so. I worked on myself a lot and became someone who would be worthy of love. Someone who loved themself, didn’t need someone else, but wanted that still.

And I wanted to share that. So I tried.

We started talking. She was so many things we shared, she was so much more, and our every exchange felt both equal and giving.

After a few days we couldn’t resist meeting. Even with a pandemic. Even with me being immunocompromised. I wanted to try.

We met. It was wonderful. We made each other feel wonderful. She opened up to me about the rough spots in her life, like I had shared mine with her.

She left. I said to drive safe, asked her to text me when she was home.

She did. She said it was perfect. And then she said it shouldn’t happen again.

She suffered at the hands of someone before, is what she told me. And it put her on the path of building herself back up, and she realized while telling all this that she wasn’t ready to be vulnerable again. She told me she has too much to work on with herself and she would lose herself if she allowed herself to be with me.

She said maybe in another life the stars would have aligned. She said we had a real connection. She said she was sorry.

I told her I wanted to try. I told her that, I understood if she couldn’t. I said all I could do was be honest with her and myself, and couldn’t ask anything but the same of her. I’ve known others who have suffered. I didn’t want to pressure her. I understand what she told me and I respected it.

She spoke honestly. She said we shouldn’t see each other again.

So we’re stopped. I’m reeling. Whiplash. Bliss to broken.

I know life goes on. I know we can both be happy still, and that’s all I ever wanted.

It still hurts. I haven’t felt that way about someone in years. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that way about someone actually, in all my relationships. I can’t recall ever being more comfortable.

I opened myself, on the off chance that...

It happened.

It wasn’t the right time.

About 4 years ago, I discovered meditation. I mediated 3-4 times a week for 10-15 minutes. It doesn’t sound like much, but it changed my life. 

I was always relatively successful, however, I was also insecure and anxious. I sought external approval constantly and it ate me up and spit me out. When I began to realize of this desire to please others, I tried my best to stop it but nothing worked, until I found meditation. 

I understood my thoughts more; I aimed to please myself in terms of morality; and I was fair. Truly fair. I would approach arguments willing to lay down my own argument in the interest of inheriting a better answer. I asked questions to learn from and about others; I asked questions to *hear* a response. 

Recently, I’ve discovered that I’m defending my own arguments in the most fruitless ways; I block out others when they speak; and I am not fair. 

Maybe it’s the stress from covid, anxiety creeping up again, or minor signs of depression. Whatever it may be, I’m going to fight back to restore myself where I was. I’m proud of catching myself slipping, which admittedly may be the hardest part, but I need to focus on improvement. An active, positive mental health effort.

60,"This is a long story but I will try to keep it brief. The way that college has been turning out has made me feel very regretful and guilty about the choices I've made. 

In freshman year, I went to an out of state college. I had a really good scholarship from working really hard in high school in a difficult advanced program. I was doing pretty well at this college, and the thing I wanted to do most at this college was study abroad for a year. However, plans started to get derailed in spring semester when I began to experience anxiety attacks. Almost constantly, my chest felt like it was being compressed and I could barely breathe. 

I associated the anxiety attacks with the school and felt like I had to leave because of it. There were a ton of things I loved about this school, but the combination of anxiety attacks, uncertainty, and pressure from my parents made me choose to leave it. I transferred to my state school for in-state tuition despite not liking my state.

Things at the new school started rough, but I eventually became good friends with some people. However, COVID-19 threw things for a loop again. Because of COVID-19 and financial situations, I might not be able to study abroad. I do not know what to do if this is the case. I could possibly return to my previous school, but I do not know if the anxiety attacks will flair up again if I do (planned to go and check during spring break but that was cancelled because of COVID-19 too). I could stay here, but I feel like I have wasted all my opportunities.

I keep trying to find something that will show me that the sacrifice of changing transferring schools was worth it, but I just can't find anything.

TL;DR

* I feel like all my effort in high school went to waste. While I took the advanced program mainly because I enjoy learning, I still feel like I wasted all the effort and health that I sacrificed in order to take them. I am more or less in the same position I would be had I done nothing at all in high school.
* I feel guilty whenever I have to take out loans or spend money because I know this was all because of my mistakes
* My indecision is making me incredibly unsure about everything. I have no clue what to do.
* I regret not getting mental health help sooner when the anxiety attacks were happening. I mentioned them to my parents and they ridiculed and laughed at me.
* I feel like I am throwing away opportunities that can only happen in college and that I won't be able to do later in life.
* I keep trying to find something that will show me that the sacrifice of changing transferring schools was worth it, but I just can't find anything.",28May2020,1

64,"It’s 4 am in my neck of the woods right now. I’m losing sleep over this. So here’s the thing. My boyfriend of 2 years was heading out on a business trip this week. And the two days before he left for his trip, he started name calling me. The words he called me are disrespectful and uncalled for. He had the audacity to proclaim that he was joking. Even after I worked up the courage to politely ask him to stop because he is hurting my feelings... he did not apologize, he just kept going.

So when it came time to drop him off at the airport the next morning, and before he got out of the car, he kissed me and said he loved me. Me shocked. Quickly saying love you too, all the while thinking, *you do??* because it sure as hell did not feel like it just a mere 24 hours ago. And crazy to popular belief, he hardly texted me. Had a decent self courtesy to say “I landed.” And I wanted to talk to him and asked if he could give me a call that night to talk. Did not hear from him until this past night where the message was “sorry just got done, didn’t see this till now” 

So this is what I would like to say: really? You just saw my text just this very moment? When you are constantly on your phone when we are at home. Did you just see it now? Or did you just work up the nerve to text me back? Do you seriously believe that you have done nothing wrong. That you called me more derogatory words than you have ever called me beautiful in the two years we have dated? Also, news flash. If you’re telling a joke to a person and they don’t laugh?? It’s not fucking funny. So shut up. Apologize. And don’t do it again. You had your chance to apologize when I asked you to stop. And you failed. So I hope your trip goes well. Live it up. Because when you get home, we are having a serious talk. 

So to those of you, who like to joke around.. if someone asks you to stop because you are hurting their feelings. Fucking apologize. Explain that your intention wasn’t to hurt them, and move on. Don’t attempt to joke about it again. The topic is off limits. And if you can’t see that? Then I feel bad for you.",28May2020,1

He said that there is reason to cry and be upset about it if I am not going to be proactive and change myself, and went straight to playing on his phone. It honestly just made me feel worse.

I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother... A wife..and  just a woman in general!! 

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH. I ALSO CALLED WIC TWICE ACTUALLY, AND TALK TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND EXPLAINED MY SITUATION AND THEY CHECKED AND THEY HAVE NO SAMPLES OR EXTRAS OF ANY KIND OF FORMULA.  THEY GAVE ME THE SOONEST APPOINTMENT THEY COULD WHICH IS THIS COMING THURSDAY. BUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING NOW BECAUSE WE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SIMILAC NEOSURE NOW. I HAVE NONE TO GIVE MY SON SO I HAVE BEEN CALLING MESSAGING AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH THE $24 TO BUY A CAN TO AT LEAST LAST TILL WIC APPOINTMENT THURSDAY.",28May2020,1

When you have an animal is going through a sudden diagnosis of an aggressive cancer, the way in which you process the diagnosis but also treat the symptoms can be challenging.

Whether or not he is eating well lately and what you suspect his pain grade is can inspire hours of investigation bordering obsessive compulsive behavior and implementing many different strategies of treatment akin to science experimentation.

This medication may work well with appetite but causes drowsiness. The other helps with his pain but he can't sleep and has no appetite.  This other one does both but is not helping the tumour slow down.  Morality and belief structure is eventually called into question.

Rupert has a tumour in his jaw bone that I had removed in an operation only to have it return with a vengeance 5 months later. As someone who has found themselves in a life where animal companions play an important role in daily interaction, sitting by idly as your pet suffers is unavoidable;  if they don't eat, it's a few days before its critical.

Rupert's been prescribed a pain killer Buprenorphine to make the end of his life more comfortable-- when required.  At even a small dose it is potent and transforms him from being stuck in a ritual of sitting in awkward postures and appearing restless to more or less being enveloped in love with the presence he hasn't exhibited since he was a kitten.  

While animals hide their pain very well, you can't help but notice when your cat is choosing to be alone more, standoffish, not eating as well and, well, just different.   It is liberating to administer a solution that for the next 12 hours will transform him into the cat you forgot he was since his health began declining.  A temporary trip of feeling like a savior.

Rupert is one of a few percentage of animals to which this drug in question, when administered, presents negative side effects. On the recommended dose from our vet he cannot sleep until it has cleared his system.  What starts off initially as a state of pure bliss where all he wants is cuddles and to be held for hours (I do my best to oblige) evolves into him laying down, eyes slightly open, exhausted yet unable to sleep for up to 18 hours. 

Thankfully the current strategy of steroids, CBD and anti cancer immune supplements has reduced his tumour size and he is a 'normal' cat again or at least for the time being.

Prior to this treatment plan my only option was to administer a day of pain medication, give him a few days to recuperate and re-administer.  Adjusting dosage didn't help either. 

The negative side effects had me question - was it really even worth it?

Was the couple hours of bliss where we would hang out and share these finite moments together really worth the difficulty he would experience there after?

Is being able to sleep with what I hope is moderate discomfort better than being a high insomniac?  


Did I really have his best intentions in mind or was I becoming attached to seeing him high and the subsequent experience of him acting like a kitten again as to escape the psychological burden of being with him as he is approaching his death?

Furthermore, is that all that he is to get out of the dying experience?  To simply be drugged, blissed out and showered with affection at every waking second of his day until we ultimately have to put him down when he will no longer eat?

Is he meant to experience the pain of his cancer and all I am doing is prolonging his life so he may endure more future pain?

And why not just keep him drugged as much as possible until we say our goodbyes?

These questions in their own right can be discussed in depth but lead me to a summary.

&amp;#x200B;

Why are you here?

Why are any of us here, living?

What is your belief structure?

If you think we are here for no reason, there is no god, no purpose other than what we make of it, naturally the idea of drugging Rupert for the entire experience of his death, even if he is in small amounts of pain as surely being what resembles a kitten again is far superior to the stickiness of his decline seems like it should be a no brainer.

BUT  


If there is a 'divine' purpose or meaning for us to be here, then that purpose also includes the experience of death.  While we should do our best to make our pets 'comfortable', if overdone through drugs, are we also then robbing them of a very important experience as the purpose of being born also includes the process of our own death?

Was my own selfish desire to see Rupert happy and blissed out going to negatively impact him in where he finds himself in his next life?

I suppose it is important to point out that through my life experience and study I have developed a  belief in reincarnation adkin to Buddhist philosophy. While the months leading up to the totality of death feel as though they are years when you are present with a being going through it, our lives are but a 'blip' in space and time.

If you don't believe in 'god', reincarnation, heaven -- whatever, is it safe to assume then that there is little to no reason to control your impulses for pleasure outside of the societal consequences or in other words 'if they don't hurt anyone'.

If we question why we are here and that answer contains within it a sense of 'learning' or 'to experience' - is the experience of death not too then included in that and death includes all the downs of death, not just a roller coaster of morphine until the cord is cut?

&amp;#x200B;

This predicament along with helping a being that is going through the dying process serving as the material manifestation or 'idol' if you will of impermanence calls a lot into question.

Being with him for what on most days is 20-24 hours a day thanks to the corona virus lockdown has cut through a lot of my bullshit.  

In the face of impermanence and my own eventual death that I too was confronted with those same questions.  Am I just living my life oblivious to the nature that I am here to learn and spend so much of my time seeking pleasure that inevitably will be my downfall?

This, along with consistent meditation, isolation, study and living moment to moment with the mindfulness of my own death has been the sword that has cut through all of my negative habits or vices.

No more attachment to porn, video games, marijuana, social media, sex or physical possessions.  In almost an instant that I in which was 'not hurting anyone', triggered by boredom and otherwise, has lost all of its habit energy in my life once and for all.   While these were not what I consider huge hurdled in my life that held me back, they did make me feel as though I was something of a high functioning addict.

There is still so much to work on, the vices don't simply stop there, and when new problems or circumstances arise I can feel the pull to justify going back to the life that was left behind, but I am beginning to taste real freedom.  I am beginning to hear the whispers of a life that the voice of my own mind has been drowning out through the projections of my desires.

I was talking to a massage therapist yesterday who told me how hes in his 50's and still gets high every day, but it's not as bad as it once was.  When I discussed how I had stopped all together and the reasons why, he was intrigued but said he could not fathom ever doing it himself.  He explained the best he could do is 'one or two tokes a day' and gave me a quick run down of the ritual.

While I listened without judgement, reflecting onto my own life and struggle with vices and the many justifications we give ourselves, and a sense of 'why stop?' that is rooted out of a sense of not knowing what we are missing by continuing, the thought occurred:

 ""You end up building your life around your habits""......

72,"So, yesterday I mentioned to a cop the fact that I was told someone would follow me home and slip into my bed. It wasn't really a joke to me since someone else mentioned pretty much exactly what was described about 15 years ago and I have had people snooping around my basement windows before. I've since blocked them with pillows considering I don't need the little natural light that shows up down here and I used to be a gamer. I keep the pillows there in case my drumming is too loud.

I genuinely think it's creepy as hell even if my own girlfriend, were I ever to have one would to just show up unannounced. I'm starting to feel extremely uncomfortable because I got up to use the restroom this morning and the basement door was wide-open.

Either my dad opened it to check the air conditioner, which I can find out later, or that literally effing happened. I'm going to check the house later in the morning, but this is kinda freaking me out. Quite a bit.",28May2020,1
73," The main issue for me was caring about what other people thought of me. I tried to please everybody, and it took a huge toll on me over the years. I would do everything at my job, taking up every task I could because that's who I was at that time. It took time and effort to control it. It all started when I quit the job I actually loved to start working on myself. I understand not everybody can just quit their jobs like that but what I am trying to say is to start from something, make a huge step in something and that will push you to start improving and working on yourself. And because you took that big step you will no longer be able to go back.

I write extensively about the stoic philosophy of not caring, have a read and subscribe to my blog at the top of the page, it would mean a lot to me. Thank you

74,"Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I have no idea where else I can express my emotions. 

It’s been 2 months into my country’s lockdown, and we have another 1 more month to go. The place I live in right now is cluttered and disorganised. Due to the family circumstances and culture, I live with my parents, grandparents and my other siblings. My siblings and I share a small room and I do not actually have my own personal space. The house is always noisy as my grandparents watches the telly every waking hour of their day. The TV is never off. 

The noise and clutter is getting to me and it is seriously impacting my health. I cannot leave my home without breaking the law (and potentially getting fined). When it gets overwhelming, I want to cry but I can’t as I don’t have a private space to cry. I guess this is my private space to rant. Thank you.",28May2020,1
75,"It seems everyday people in positions of power abuse their power to make the vulnerable suffer. It hurts my heart seeing it and I feel powerless with all the injustice happening around me. I can't go to sleep every night knowing there's someone out there being oppressed by another, feeling hopeless. Whether that's through police brutality, violence against the homeless, violence against children, violence against women, violence against minorities, violence against elders, war crimes, animal abuse; it's happening all the time and I feel like I can't do anything to stop it.

I want to do something to help these people. I NEED to do something to help these people. No one should be afraid for their life in the hands of another person. The most I've done is spread awareness online and attend a few protests, it's nowhere near enough, I doubt it even put a dent in the injustices happening. It feels like the world is against me and against the people who need support the most. What am I supposed to do? The whole system is at fault. I'm just one person, there's nothing I can do to fix an entire system. It all seems so much bigger than me. Sometimes I feel like things will never change.",28May2020,1

78,"When I first found out it was early August 2018 (I was 12 at the time) when I accidentally saw messages on her phone from an unsaved number. These were explicit and adult messages and to see that broke my heart and made me very angry. My mother is an alcoholic and she only recently got into AA, after numerous interventions. Because of this I already had a rocky relationship with her and it has caused me problems with friends and family, as well as heavily impacting my mental health. Over the next few months while my mom was passed out drunk I would go through her phone trying to make sure I wasn’t misinterpreting things and I just ended up find more and more things that proved she was having an affair. My dad worked as an overnight security guard at the time so it gave her the opportunity to drink and smoke in the backyard. 

  
Anyway, turns out it was one of her ex’s from high school and he was her best friend‘s brother. In December I broke down and confronted her about it and she said it was over. A few weeks later I found out it wasn’t and I got angry again. In March 2019 I broke down again this time yelling at her about this guy and her drinking problem, and my dad ended up knowing but some how I was the bad guy. I really thought it was over but months passed and the main problem was the drinking, but nobody ever talked about the affair even when I finally convinced my parents to let me go to therapy (It was mostly for the drinking stuff). 

Then when we were driving one day, my moms phone rang and it was that damn phone number. I stayed calm, hung up, didn’t say anything, and she had the audacity to say, “good thing you didn’t pick up, it was probably a telemarketer.” At that point I was numb and I had fallen into a deep depression that I didnt have it in me to fight. I didn’t see that number for a while. 

Finally at the end of August 2019, after her repeatedly saying she wouldn’t stop drinking and a family session with my then therapist, she decided to get sober. This only happened after her parents had to come and everyone had a large intervention, as she had started day drinking. My dad, sister and I ended up staying in a hotel that night, and I was angry and scared she would do something completely reckless. She’s now been sober for 9 months but recently I have seen that phone number around in her phone. I don’t know if I can trust her. Just earlier today I saw she was in the phone with him. 

I thought the affair would end with her drinking but I don’t know anymore. Her sobriety seems to have just helped her cover things up.  


TL;DR My mom had been having an affair and is now contacting the same guy again. What should I do?

There was a girl who was student of the week we will call her Jan, kids chosen would bring in toys,books,clothes, photos  of things they liked/loved. When I asked if I could play with her doll she said “brown/black girls can’t play with my dolls”.  I didn’t say anything to my parents for a few days and when I finally did they took action however it was just a conversation that ended in white tears and ishugging it out I was 5. This very incident was a source of humor for people over the years. My dads friend owned a car shop in Detroit one day my dad younger brother and I were outside waiting for him. My dad was playing with a tool eventually officers rolled up asking my dad information and arrested him. My brother and I were put in the back of a separate car and asked for my mothers information. But I didn’t know her work number and kept repeating the name of her company it was like the 90s or something. Eventually we went home and my father came home later that night but we never discussed it. It was just something that happened in a long series of ~happenings~... I remember when a boy referred to music as “white music” in elementary school..... I remember in High school when driving with some ~friends~  they yelled at a black man out the window “where the weed at” this mans feelings, humanity, peace and sanity were of no bother or concern for them it was just so “funny”. During my Junior year a Senior a girl had been rejected from a University I believe due to them not filling/sending applications in correctly regardless(they didn’t get in) many people in the school were so upset over it and use the excuse of “Affirmative action” meaning what someone else black or brown got the spot bc of their race they did not earn it nor deserve it and something was stolen from her?........... what?!?! People literally said “The university of Michigan is racist against white people” (look at their stats)People said these things out loud for no regard for mine or other bodies that looked like mine. Can you imagine what it’s like to be told you’re unworthy because of someone else’s failure? When I was in my 4 th year at University there was an incident where a student dressed as a “cholo” he was called out by a Black/ Latin student and the one receiving backlash was the man calling out racist behaviors? My white rooomate at the time said “ it wasn’t an appropriate time to call him out” she is/ was (unsure of how she is now but) a “white feminist” in the colloquial sense not just because she’s white. I mean if we had been talking about sexual harassment she would not have suggested that him being called out was “ inappropriate for the time”.  My last year living in the dorms I was taking the bus to class in the Springtime and sat next to a grad student who lived on MY FLOOR she said “I didn’t know you were a student I thought you worked in the office”  And even though I lived on her floor and shared a communal bathroom for at least 6 months at this point it didn’t matter. After graduating Alumni are allowed access to libraries I needed to print my resume and because I lived a block away I went to the Law Library before getting ready for my interview (wearing sweats a hoodie). When I asked where the printer was I was asked “Is this where you need to be?” I show my ID and exclaimed my alum Status and went on my way. When my brother was 18 he had a job and bought an airsoft gun it looked like a rifle as he and a friend left the house I told him “B, remember you’re a black boy” Like Tamir Rice Except my brother was able to become a man.... I and many others have been told that we’re being emotional and victims to that I say Fuck you. On Monday people all over the world viewed a man be murdered outside in the middle of the day and honestly it didn’t seem like his murderer and his 3 accomplices dealt with much of a struggle. Gregory Floyd begged for his life he a grown man asked for his momma his momma. I can’t and won’t pretend to imagine what it’s like to feel so helpless and alone and to be so afraid. This is emotional! It is sad! It is enraging! It is heartbreaking and it can bring you to your knees. However to those who call us victims WE ARE. However on the flip side of that you couldn’t be any more wrong.... you see watching men, women and even children die over and over and over and over and still have the ability to live a day to day life doesn’t make us victims it makes us heroes. You see I’m an emotional person but when I was younger I didn’t cry a lot I was able to hold it in but as I’ve aged I don’t need to hold it in WE DONT NEED TO HOLD IN OUR PAIN OUT TEARS OUR ANGER they call us out on it bc feelings are used and weaponized they try and make us feel weak. I’m sure that all the tears I shed combined with those my black and brown brother and sisters would flood the world it couldn’t be contained.  But feeling isn’t weak. It takes so much courage to actually feel to look at life and accept our mortality and the mortality of others is hard. And to know that our existence that means so much even if we our 1 in (Instert number here)(please click the “I” lol). It something that should be celebrated. All I know is I’m tired..... 
For those who are gone I weep and for those still here I wish to keep...

I know, I heard you. ""First World Problem?"" ""Oh please you never made an effort in life?""  Give me a break. I spent so long trying to be fit into this racist society that only benefit the majority race, and they will never change and they had to fuck me over countless of times for their own ""kind"". I was a bully victim and called fat and ugly in school for years so for years, I spent most of my allowance that i starve myself to pay the cheapest gym membership available nearby just to keep myself fit, participate in the toastmasters club and won competitions to boost my confidence and yet in my count of meeting women which they never met me before, i can heard them from gossips and some of them who clearly dont know how to gossip with poor voice control, I have heard it 78 times and even till this day my tinder profile never had a single match in my life despite I didnt add in any shitty request or even demands in my profile. People always misjudged me for what i looked like. I feel like a freak and watching all of those horrible people i know who treated their girlfriends and wives as trophy, sex objects and degrading them, it made me wonder how these people could even find someone. I came from a poor family, so i worked so hard to get my scholarship and to reduce my fees and even worked while studying to pay my fees. 

I did later realised my parents took my savings from my part time work to beautify their daughter with jewelry, make up and surgery  to score a man that she wanted to pose a rich woman and she fucking made it. Meanwhile, they decided to fuck me over and tell me to get over it idiot when i needed my money back to pay my phone repairs,Despite, my first class honours and even my ranked as the best student in the university, Obviously, I had to run away but i needed a job. So, I applied for jobs every single day for a year and no one seem to reply me back for an interview or responded after the interview. This led me jobless and my parents always sugarcoat highlighted that my sister is paying dinners (She only paid 3 times in a month period and the rest is mostly my parents) and decided to high road me as a leech every single day.

Recently, I was told by my parents that they are going to need money to migrate their daughter to marry her husband so of course they robbed me blind and she is leaving in a couple of months. And they collectively made a decision (obviously without my consent) to entrust me the duty as a son to look after them until they die because they did their part of raising me so its my turn ow. My sister could get a way scot-free with her inheritance of everything (she got the house and everything that my parents own) while i got nothing except the duty. Its a shit realization that my purpose is to become the end care taker and for years, i have being a dutiful son, i did my duty to make them proud to brag about their child who is ranked the highest in his university, sacrificed my own money just to save their face from being looked down as poor, I never revealed my sickness and my mental illness yet because i know they will hated me for bringing them a costly medical bill and a headache, I did whatever they told me to for years without question despite the double standard treatment and how much they pushed too much surveillance on me and invasion of my privacy just because of one story they heard that my idiotic cousin took drugs and fled with the family's jewelry  I know they love daughters and not sons but i never question them because i wanted to be loved like how she was treated. But they will never know despite how much I wanted my pain to end badly.

Last night, I wanted to end everything because who cares, no one ever does. They will use me, i have no purpose in this racist society. So I locked my door and decided h\*\*\*ed myself  with my bed's metal frame but the frame decided to break. Then i moved to the metal shower head (which is embeded in the walls), it failed and lastly the i tried for the last time with the window grills but it broke and the whole grill crashed on me and knocked me unconscious. I woke up the next morning with a bad bruise on my neck, a banged up ankle and still Im not dead yet.

93,"Hey everyone. I'm finally ready :)

It feels good to say. 
I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for the last 2 years, and i'm ready to do whatever it takes to be better.

I'm 18, and i'll be 19 next month.

I was going downhill as high school progressed, and in June 2018, i left.

I cut off my school friends, and i've spent almost every day since, alone in my bedroom.

For the first 6 months, it wasn't too bad. I spent allt of time making music.
But by 2019, the loneliness got to me.

2019 was the loneliest year of my life. Every day was spent inside, trying to drown out my emptiness with music, videogames, and social media.
I tried a few times to find a job, but i didn't have any luck.

At the end of 2019, i did meet someone online, so at least i have 1 friend now.
But i'm ready to make more.

I've started exercising, doing yoga and meditating.

I'm opening up more and sharing my feelings to people.

I've started making music and art again, instead of just mindlessly consuming content!

All i need now is just to surround myself with encouraging people.

I live with my mum, dad, and brother and they have alot of bad habits, and toxic attitudes :/

I also want to work on my issues with my appearance.
I have alot of acne scarring and it's hard to be confident in front of people when i dislike my face.

I just wanted to put this out into the world so i can intensify my motivation!

If you read this, thank you very much.

If you have any advice or encouraging words, i would greatly appreciate it :)",28May2020,1
94,"Hi all.

Last year, I learned about “mental models” that billionaires like Elon Musk, Ray Dalio, and Charlie Munger have used to their success. So I did some research and tried to apply them in real life. It’s been 6 months now. Now I know that mental models are effective in learning faster and solving a hard problem.

What is a mental model? It’s basically a person’s thought process and a framework. But there are many kinds of mental models, so depending on the subject, the approach and the process is a bit different.

Since you don’t have much time, let me summarize many hours of blog reading for you :)

* Accelerate learning
* Use mental models to develop an intuitive understanding of natural and human processes
* Learn a little bit about a lot of things. Know something about everything Apply a model across different areas – lets you be innovative and creative
* Extract meaningful information through the use of a mental model
* Understand an overview of almost anything through the use of these mental models
* etc…

&amp;#x200B;

Out of many mental models, I’ve learned and applied the following.

1. Occam’s Razor

* In simpler language, Occam’s razor states that **the simplest explanation is preferable to one that is more complex**. Simple theories are easier to verify. Simple solutions are easier to execute.

2. First Principles

* First-principles thinking is one of the best ways to reverse-engineer complicated problems and unleash creative possibility. The way is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.

They were extremely effective in understanding a new subject that I can keep going back to for a quick glance.

What do you think. Do you find yourself utilizing a specific mental model often? Or do you struggle with it. 

If you have a useful mental model in terms of learning and breaking down a problem, plz share. Eager to learn",28May2020,1
97,"I just wanted to write this out. I don’t like talking about my PTSD with people because I don’t like feeling like they pity me or think differently about me— but this makes me really happy. 

For the last 3 years I would get the same recurring dream: a replay of the night I was sexually assaulted by my ex, but in the dream I would be trying to fight him off. My arms would feel like lead. I would try to swing a punch at him and my fists would go limp on contact, unable to do any damage. When I woke up from these dreams my arms would be sore and tired, like I had been lifting weights all night. Over three years I went from having this dream every night, to every week, then every month.

I’ve been with my partner for a little while now. This is the most stable source of love and support that I’ve ever had in any relationship— romantic or familial. I feel safe with him. I feel strong with him, even when he takes the lead. 

He appeared in the dream last time. It was the same thing. I was pushing, trying to punch, but nothing was landing. My ex was laughing. Then i noticed that someone else was behind me. I knew it was my partner. I don’t think any words were said, and he didn’t move. He just watched me steadily and when I looked into his eyes, I knew what he was telling me. 

“I’m not stopping you.”

He wasn’t going to stop me. He was going to hold me back from fighting for myself. He wasn’t going to tell me I shouldn’t fight or defend myself. There was no guilt. 

I landed a punch. A solid punch that made my attacker back away. Then I woke up. 

I haven’t had that dream since. It’s been 4 months. The longest I went without the dream before was 5 weeks. 

I feel like some kind of weight has lifted from my chest. I can breathe. I can joke a little more now instead of getting triggered. I told my partner about the dream when it happened but I don’t think he understands just how significant this is. That’s okay.",28May2020,2

Well how about I mix your two passions into ONE. I know what you’re thinking, there’s no way he can mix Howie the hunk Mandel AND sandwiches! Well guess what, my brain did. Introducing: Howie ManDELI. Now picture this: you’re walking down your favorite street and your tummy gets the grumblies, uh oh... you need some food. Your eyes lay upon a small building with a colorful atmosphere and a name that speaks to your soul “Howie ManDELI”. You become excited. You gleefully walk in and all you see are pictures of Howie covering the wall. You are overcome with joy. You make your way to the counter and order a simple turkey and cheese sandwich. You wait for your meal while basking in the eyes of Howie. Finally, your sandwich comes to you. You’re greeted with Howie’s face toasted onto the bread. A smile lays upon your face as you dig in. You take your last bite and savor every last nutrient. And what do you know, Howie’s face is engraved on the plate. You are the happiest you’ve ever been. 

You have just experienced heaven.

100,"I really do wish I could kill myself. Not because I’m depressed. I may not have many friends but I’m hardly lonely. I have a caring and loving family whom would give their lives for me. Though we don’t have much money they’d buy me anything if I’d ask. I’ve never been a victim to bullying. Never been raped or sexually assaulted? Never experienced tragedy or anything of the sort.

Sometimes I wish my parents didn’t raise me right. Raised me to be someone who deserved to die. That way I could actually go through with it. But they ended up making a decent human being who cares for people. In the end that’s the only reason I don’t do it. Because I’m scared.

I’m not scared of dying. If I could die without any repercussions at all, I’d have done it a long long time ago. I’m scared of what my death will bring. The saying “death will only breed more death” would reign true if I end up taking my own life. 

My parents would feel like they failed in raising both their kids.

I feel my mother would go next given the fact she’s already depressed and blames herself a lot. Not to mention her, albeit rare, suicidal thoughts which I seem to have inherited from her. She still blames herself for my runaway sister. I blame myself for that too. And it would seem I’m making the same decisions that she did. Though she isn’t going to kill herself.

My father would presumably be next after my mother. My father, whom I’ve never known to cry in my 17 years on this god forsaken planet, still cry’s for my runaway sister and still prays at night for her safety. He would become a man who had lost his daughter, his son, and his wife. I fear he’d take his own life as well. Until only my sister remains. Perhaps he’d find comfort in drink again. As he did before he gave it up for my sister and I. But I feel that’d not be enough. It’d more likely just make it worse.

I’ve thought about my own death countless times for the past 5 or so years now. And it always comes to the thought of what will happen after. Because I’d then be responsible for my family’s eventual demise. 

Even so, can I still put up with this life I’ve mistakenly been given? Can I still live in wait for an approximate 30 or 40 years after my parents eventual deaths? I’m not sure I could.

I’m only a junior in high school and I can already see my education in the toilet. Even if I do get my education, I’d still have to get up for a job that I’ll hate and end up despise.

It is going to be my fault for everything though. I put myself in this position. And now I’m intentionally digging the hole deeper. I have only 4 hours left to potentially pass my junior year. Still with 8 weeks of school work to do. My procrastination problem has reached its peak. I’d like to think My laziness is inate but I also know that’s how I made myself. I’ll most likely end up failing this semester and make it up next year only to repeat the flawed process 

And what do I blame? This damned virus.

It doesn’t justify the decisions I’ve made. Or not made in this instance. But if I were still to physically go to school, I’d have passed without a doubt. It was only ever homework I refused to do. And since ALL my school work became homework, this damned pandemic inadvertently fucked me over. But I did it to myself as well.

Perhaps my parents would stay alive if the virus took me instead. That way they wouldn’t feel as though they failed. But even then I’d probably survive. And give my parents an unpayable medical bill considering we have no health care. They already have enough financial problems as it is. 

I suppose one can only hope. Right?

Then I hope for my death to be swift and soon.",28May2020,0

3 years ago, 2017. 

I was in a small one bedroom flat with my boyfriend, 2 dogs and a baby due November 17.
Shitty childhood: abuse, trauma, neglect for most of it and under the care system.
I hated life and was suicidal every day. I weighed 16st (around 100kg) because I was depressed and comfort ate the previous two years. I also didn't work, nor care to, neither did my boyfriend at the time. I wore old shoes, one pair, one jacket, no haircuts, cheap clothes and not a lot of them.


Present, 2020.

I now live in a very spacious 2 bedroom flat with lovely neighbours. Ive put time and effort into decorating it just how I want and I've never felt more at home. I am now on medication for depression and have been doing much better, also going through therapy. I've lost 3.5 stone.
Dumped the old boyfriend and I've had the current one for a year and he is amazing. I have too many trainers now, my child wants for nothing.

I work and study, gained my HND at grades AAA, that means university in October! 



I never, ever expected to be ok. I came from a shitty childhood and it fucked me. But I'm okay. I'm better than okay. I'm 23 this year and even though its a bit late, I managed to pull myself out of rock bottom. On my own.

I'm so grateful to be given this new lease of life. I love you all and I hope we are all on our own journey make strides we never thought we would.💕",28May2020,6

Committing social suicide making unpopular social justice on social media. And it never got me anywhere. At worst, people had the attitude I didn't do enough. That I needed to do more. 

So I now say fuck it. I've embraced my role as a shitbag. I'm not only a Tory voter but I'm a member. I embraced my role in football and became a Leeds fan because let's face it, people hate Leeds. I'm unabashedly English and not apologetic about it.

I think our public leaders-and most leaders globally- don't care about the well being of the people and I feel so small and helpless. How can I enact change when the force I am fighting against has more power than I could even comprehend?

I keep telling myself that the world and my country has faced hard times before, and challenges such as these are where growth come from.

I try to stay away from the news and other things that depress me but I am also scared that becoming ignorant to the truth will make the problem worse.

* Please, please, please **call out white supremacy when you see it (that includes your bosses, friends, family, and other conversations that make you uncomfortable).** Marginalized minority groups cannot shoulder the entire burden of educating everyone else. The work has to be done within communities.

* Examine your relationship with white supremacy (Yes, it exists. No, you're not colorblind. Yes, you live in a system where it directly impacts you). 

* Donate money and resources to black people, especially for their emotional labor for volunteering to educate you. 

* **Stop** posting about being an ally. That's a clear signal to black, brown and other marginalized people that your ""support"" is conditional and performative.

Sometimes I don’t even realize it until I’ve spent a good amount of time just thinking about anything and everything. I’ll have full blown conversations in my head sometimes and I’m not sure why it happens. I noticed that once I stopped taking my anti depressants like a year and half a ago (they didn’t help at all they made me feel more numb.) that this really amplified. Sometimes I think I suffer from DPDR (depersonalization/derealization disorder.) or at least have some forms of it, it’s not nearly as intense as others.

I’ve been thinking on going on medication for a type of attention deficiency (maybe I have ADD) because I’ll have a hard time focusing on certain tasks because my brain will wonder.

110,"I'm in my 20s and I have social anxiety and it's really spoiling things for me. I'm very personable and okay with talking in small groups. I don't think any of my work colleagues would ever assume that I have social anxiety. I have a solid group of friends and I feel totally fine joking around and being very open and extroverted around them.

But I find it deeply painful to meet new people. I worked in retail for 3+ years before I moved to my current office role, and while I improved somewhat, I struggled with talking to people very deeply on a daily basis. Even after years on the job, my conversation was stilted. The only way that I managed to cope was by developing stock phrases that I would use when people came to the counter. But when people spoke to me and said even a single sentence 'off script', it's like my brain would just stop working and I'd freeze up. I recognise that 'exposure therapy' helped me massively, but I'm still not where I want to be.

I'm already in therapy and I've come on leaps and bounds in all areas of my life. I'm happy with my appearance and feel good about myself as a person generally. But if I'm honest with myself, my social anxiety is still very debilitating, and that's hard because I'm not sure how to deal with it. I want to go to events and join clubs to really engage with my interests and make new friends and maybe even meet people to date (eg. I've always wanted to try rock climbing, go to a book club etc.) but I just find it physically impossible. I know that the typical advice is 'take a friend with you' but that has never helped me, it makes me feel worse because there is someone extra there to see me floundering.

I'm embarrassed by how much my quality of life has improved during lockdown, because it has meant that I don't have to interact with anyone. I decided to try and push my boundaries a little bit while I am in the 'safety' of socialising online instead of in-person. I recently tried to join a zoom event and when I saw all of the faces with their cameras on I just couldn't do it. I couldn't sit there with my camera on and I couldn't sit there with my camera off because I would be the only one doing it. I started to sweat all over and got hot and then cold. I felt like I was starting to cry. This is always how it goes whenever I try to go to something. I get to the doorway and this feeling overwhelms me.

TL:DR ive been going crazy learning about space but i cannot possibly watch everything, so out of what you know if you have an interest in the subject, what are some of the craziest things you have learned? 


I have been losing my mind and sanity every night learning about how batshit insane the universe is to try and comprehend watching documentaries to put me to sleep.. 

Theres so much out there i mean look at how crazy even mars looks.. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/grrnh0/the_clearest_image_of_mars_ever_taken/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Theres trillions of stars and galaxies in an area too big to ever be able to comprehend.. theres so much out there and we know almost nothing about it.. dark energy and matter is out there that we still cant understand and something like 70% of the universe is made of it.. 

I cant even put into words the way it makes me feel, that we are just another planet.. of possibly an infinite amount.. there could be people, or other intelligent life forms out there RIGHT NOW that are wondering the same questions we have.. “are we alone?” There could be millions of entire civilizations on other planets that are either so advanced we cannot detect them, or tribal ones that aren’t nearly as advanced as us yet.. 

There could be a species of aliens that are 65 million lightyears away from us literally looking at dinosaurs roam our planet 

If you could be teleported to 65 million lightyears from earth and had a telescope pointed at earth, and if you traveled 1 million lightyears per minute you could watch the entire planet evolve from dinosaurs to present day in an hour as you made your way back to earth

We can almost SEE the big bang with a telescope, we can see almost 13 billion light years in the past with our telescopes.. entire planets and galaxies could have exploded and died off and we wouldnt know because they could be 1000 light years away.. 

We are so insignificant in the universe, and yet possibly the only significant species that exists.. everything blows my fucking mind.. aliens that exist in different climates and atmospheres could look completely different.. 

If there was a planet that had twice the oxygen levels as earth and was sustainable then the people would literally be giants.. each more than 2 meters tall.. theres so many variables and so many outcomes and possibilities and weve hardly even scratched the surface.. its absolutely insane",28May2020,1

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.

I find that enjoying their presence is everything I needed to feel whole. It’s so natural to have fun❤️ and feel comfortable and confident. It’s when I’m comfortable and confident that I am my best self, able to enjoy my partner and my life which (on the surface) is getting better and better.

Keeping me in fear, keeping me enslaved to the idea of losing him of him leaving or cheating, of being harmed, of people I love dying.

I judge myself so harshly. All the time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

And then apologize for apologizing because he always says there’s nothing to be sorry for. And then I apologize because he’s right, and because here I am again not remaining calm instead of getting overly worried, for bombarding him with sorrows and worries and the need for constant reassurance. Bombarding him more. Draining him. Overwhelming him. It’s a never ending cycle. Until now. Until he just couldn’t take it anymore and left...

If only I could’ve seen him. He says I’m tearing him apart... 
I haven’t been listening. I haven’t been hearing him, been being what he needs, what he asks for. If only I could get out of my head and see him. If I could focus on him. On us. We used to have so much fun because I was focused on us. On loving him and having fun with him. I keep pushing for us to go on dates and do things outside of the apt, because when I do, it becomes much easier to do. We’re so fun! Even just walking in Walmart resurges my passion for my man. Because he’s just so cool. 😎 And I’m cool. 😎 It’s just a joy to be around each other, cutting up, having the best time of our lives. 
I wish it could be like that always. But my mostly it’s just me, asking again if he loves me, or if he’s cheating, or if he’s leaving. Over and over and over and over.

120,"td lr ; A stimulus would be perfect right now

ttl dr ; Because we’re starting to get back to economic normalcy and A stimulus will keep us from bleeding out in the meantime

There is no doubt that another stimulus bill of two to three trillion dollars, pretty much the same thing as before, is a slam dunk investment.  We’ll get that money back within a year or two tops, and even in the worst case we’d only have to wait for three years to get it back.  We’re giving ourselves a loan, and we need to pay it back, and we will pay that loan back in three years maximum.  It’s not a bad loan.  Impossible.

Un-hitch “another” from “stimulus”.  It isn’t “another stimulus”, that is a fictional notion, it refers to nothing, to something imaginary, like Superman or the Hulk.  Not real.

There’s only a stimulus.  The reason there’s no “another” stimulus is because to suggest that there is, that “another stimulus” is nonfiction, is to commit the fallacy called “sunken cost”.  When you spend money or another resource, that is gone; which is something we agree with, but the sunken cost fallacy or error is to continue to give it mental space, and then when we think about a decision, this mental space weighs in on the decision making process, and provokes incorrect choices unless it is mitigated.

The mitigation is to simply acknowledge that it is a real threat.  There isn’t any expensive or tricky solution, it’s very basic.  And so, in the light of this tendency we have toward this particular fallacy, “another stimulus” is therefore fictional.  There is only A stimulus.  That’s the only idea on the table, it is not a choice between “another stimulus” and “no stimulus”, it is between no stimulus and “A stimulus”, and that choice, to me, is obvious.  A stimulus right now would be perfect.  It looks like with masks we’re going to be able to return to something economically in the next two months of much greater activity than the last two months were, so if we can get A stimulus now, then that ought to tie us over until we can get much closer to economic normalcy.

The idea is like “flattening the curve”, but economically.  An economic peak is terrible economic weather, which means a destructive reduction in spending, and if we have a stimulus---NOT ANOTHER STIMULUS---right now, we should be able to avoid terrible economic weather for long enough, that we will be able to emerge without getting the peak, A stimulus will flatten the curve economically, it is absolutely guaranteed, and we can get back to work with less urgency, which will inevitably result in more safety and fewer accidents and injuries of any sort (this is part of the payback of our loan to ourselves, with A stimulus), and people will continue to spend money, and spending money is the blood of our economy.

If we have A stimulus---NOT ANOTHER STIMULUS---then we won’t lose too much blood, and we’ll heal up and get back to work.  But if we bleed out, then we’re in for a bout of terrible economic climate change, that will take much, much longer to emerge from, compared with how soon we will emerge from this shutdown, if we have A stimulus---NOT ANOTHER STIMULUS.",28May2020,1
121,"Don't think people realize the trauma and general negativity that can come from mean-spirited comments. I was told by different people in different times of my childhood that the color of my skin wasn't desirable, enough to where it became something I regarded as truth. Classmates in school, relatives, random people I happened to meet. And goodness, Having to hear that you're too dark, that you're ugly. The names I was called. The jokes that were made. I figured that even though I was a chubby middle-schooler, even though I had a gap I hated, even though I couldn't dress to save my life. Those things weren't as damning. Those things could be fixed in theory. In the end, I'd never be able to get rid of this skin I was told to dislike. 

As you would expect, my confidence was very low in middle and high school. I loved living, I just hated living as myself. It took other, brave, bold, brown and darker skinned people, showing themselves in their natural beauty, to truly gain an appreciation for myself. My dark skin was unique and made me who I am. It can't be changed. I still deal with the insecurities as they are natural to have, but 13-year-old me would look at 26-year-old me and be very satisfied. 

More need to see that their comments, as innocent and small as they may appear, can have lasting effect on people. If you've said something negative about someone to their face, it's probably not the first time they've heard it. If they don't appear to react to it, just know they're dealing with it under the surface. It looked like I didn't care about what was said, and I tried to ignore it, but defenses break easily with repetition. So hopefully someone sees this and can apply it to someone they know. Give them a better outlook of themselves, if able.",28May2020,1
122,"I'm pretty sure my life is going to collapse at some point. I don't know when, but some day it's going to happen. With the pandemic I just do a lot less and every day I should have done more than I actually do. So everyday the pile with things I have to do just becomes larger. And I don't even have a lot to do, but I just don't do anything. I'm just saying to myself I'll do it on the weekend, but then I won't do anything on the weekend. And I already lost a chance to do something with my life earlier when I dropped out of college. I love to do what I'm doing, but I guess I like to do nothing at all even more. Well I don't really like it that much, but it's so easy to not do anything else than watch series and play games all day. Especially when everything is going wrong I'd rather just watch a series and not think about what is happening and make it worse than to do something about it. Well in the short term of course, not in the long term. I just wish I could not have to do everything at home where I have my annoying mom, dad and sisters, especially my mom why doesn't she get that I have to concentrate? Well she's probably stupid or something idk.

Then there's my job, at least I can still work there so I'm happy about that. I don't really need the money, but I work there anyway. Well maybe I'll need the money later when I do start buying a lot of stuff, but not right now. The job is boring af and every time I go there I just zone out, that's really weird. I just go into my own thoughts and don't remember anything I did about that time. I don't know if I like my colleagues or hate them, I guess almost all of 'em are all right. I just don't have anything with them so I'm pretty friendless there. I have always been lonely in the place where I live, also in elementary, so I guess it's not the worst. As long as they just do their thing and I do my thing and they aren't going to be awful against me at least, which they luckily don't. 

Well yeah so that's basically how my life is going during this pandemic. I wish I could somehow go back to my old post. Like half a year ago I made another one in r/self and I'm curious about the me from back then. It's not that long, but quite some things have changed. I actually believe it was almost a year ago, now I think about that. I don't know if I have grown that much in time, but I am having a better life at least mentally, or so it feels like at least. I'll save this post for my future self, it's fun doing these. If you're reading this thanks for making it to the end! I hope you're making progress as well, take care!",28May2020,1

131,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign? Also I’m very quiet but she would sometimes talk over me/interrupt when I said something 

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence / :",28May2020,1
132,"Long post ahead, I’m a mess. 


So, I have pretty decent life. Very loving and supportive family that would do anything for me. I have a full time job in my field that pays decently well, I live alone in a nice apartment with my dog and plants, I’m only 22. I have my own car and pay for 90% of my living expenses in my own (thanks parents for paying car insurance and phone lol!!). I graduated from the university I wanted to go to in a rather difficult but rewarding field. I workout 5 days a week, I have many friends that love me and that I know I can count on. I have traveled a lot and usually do roadtrips often. I compete for fun in obstacle races and kayak once a month at least because I love it. 

I have “struggled” a bit in life. I’ve been in situations that I’d never wish on anyone. I struggle(d?) with an eating disorder for most of my life (I’m doing great now though!). My dating life is less than ideal, which I know has hit me a lot more (basically dating someone for the past 5 years on and off that, while we love and care about each other a lot, I know they’re in love with someone else, but that’s another story). I hate being alone. I’ve struggled with alcoholism and have abused drugs a few times to help me cope in times I feel like this, but I’m tired of it. 

I feel like I just can’t do life anymore. I can’t concentrate at work and it’s showing a lot. I feel like I might get fired soon because it has been pointed out. Since before the pandemic I’ve been struggling but this feeling just completely broke me now. I think working from home broke me, I just started back up from my office last week and I thought it’d get better. Nope. Usually I can pinpoint what makes me feel like this (usually relationship related issues) but right now, it’s the overwhelming feeling that it’s never going to be okay. I wanted to think it was just my relationship issues again because it started hitting me again once I realized my SO might be talking again with this other person, and the feeling of “I’ll be alone soon again” hit me, but after thinking about it for a bit, it’s just a pile of feelings and things I could very easily take care of, but I just can’t bring myself to. I’m literally sobbing in my office at work as I type this. 

I could easily work and just do my job, but I can’t concentrate. I’m to the point where I’m just losing it throughout the day, I just randomly forget what I’m doing because I get lost in my head. Today driving to work I nearly (I literally had to reverse) ran a red light, because I got lost in my head and I just didn’t see it. 

I could leave my relationship and find someone better, but I’m scared to because I really love this person and I’m tired of losing people I truly love. My friends always tell me to leave her, and they offer me their support and company, but I can’t bring myself to reply to their messages within a few days, to the point I’m so ashamed of waiting so long to have the energy to reply to a “hi” that I just don’t. But they know me so they try again. 

I could go to therapy but every time I try I just can’t make it or just get too overwhelmed and can’t go back a second session. I have had a tooth ache for a week, which has never happened in my life, but I can’t bring myself to make a dentist appointment because I’m scared of what it could be. I’ve been having a lot of unexplainable health issues but I avoid the doctor just because I don’t want to find out what it could be. Not even sure why. 

My biggest fear in life has always been death. Thinking about dying makes me panic. I would never take my own life, I cannot do that to my mom and dad. Or anyone that knows me, I just can’t. But damn I don’t know how to cope with this anymore. I don’t want to drink again and I don’t want drugs either. Being alone always drives me to those things, but I’m at a point where I don’t want to do those things either, because I’m just tired of waking up the next day and repeating it again because that’s all I can do to not feel like this. 

I have read of other people having similar feelings to this in this and other subs, but I want to know about those people that got through similar situations, how they did it? 

I’m so exhausted of existing, and I really wish I could appreciate it because I have such a good life that’s just being wasted right now. Any advice/words of wisdom would be helpful.",28May2020,1

(Sould I practice 'fake' smiling (Yes, I'm serious)?)",28May2020,1
136," Okay, I just watched the entire series, and I have a lot to say about it: 

For one thing, a lot of these ""victims,"" are nearly JUST AS BAD as him. Specifically I'm referring to the women recruiting their FRIENDS to be sexually manipulated by a wealthy, powerful, older man. I don't care if they were only 16-18 years old, that is OBVIOUSLY OLD ENOUGH to CLEARLY AND CONCISELY understand what you're doing. 

I've been 16. I've known a lot of teenagers. Most of them, myself included, were kind, loving, and wouldn't want to see ANYONE in unpleasant or dangerous situations. (Let alone friends!) 

Secondly, labeling EVERY WOMEN he had sex with a ""survivor,"" is an INSULT to ACTUAL SURVIVORS. Because A LOT of these women were OBVIOUSLY HOOKERS, looking for easy money and drugs. 

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the women SHOULD be labeled survivors, because they UNWILLINGLY suffered TRAUMA by HIS actions. Now THOSE women have my empathy, THOSE women are survivors. 

BUT, if you were assaulted by him, and went back to him, REPEATEDLY, I'm sorry, but you weren't assaulted, you aren't a ""Epstein survivor.""

You were looking to USE Him for money, and he was looking to USE you for sex. That's called a ""deal."" 

But, now that the money is gone, it's a Greek tragedy, right?

The one-woman said, SERIOUSLY, ""I was traffic'd 7 times to this friend of Epstein....""

Oh, okay. I guess he left you in his suitcase? Shipped you around to his friends. Then they'd repack you and send you back to him? I guess in ALL those ""traffic'd"" situations, you never had the chance to go to the police?",28May2020,1

I followed the quarantine and since I live in a low infection zone, when we went to yellow I hung out with the same 1-2 people going on hikes and hanging out by rivers. Basically just staying away from people but still being active as we could be. And theyre not sick. I think I got it from work.

I work in a warehouse where I’m in close contact with about 30 people everyday. My fear now though is that I’m gonna lose my job. I was lucky enough for them to stay open and give us tons of work all during quarantine when so many people lost their jobs but idk now. I’m told another coworker of mine got a test yesterday.

My main concern is my family. My mom is extremely stressed about getting it from me, and I’m most concerned about my grandparents. My dad decided he knew it wasn’t Covid and had my 89 year old grandma stay over for 2 nights because she’s home alone. I stayed downstairs the whole time but whats to say we didn’t touch the same surfaces? Theres no way.

143,"Well, so much for that. In light of a deadly illness that’s wrecked the U.S. economy, I’ve opted out of attending a local LAC that I’d earned three scholarships for. 

It’s a real disappointment, especially since I’d considered it to be the most ideal school for me. It was 15 minutes away from my house, and I really liked the feel of the campus. 

Unfortunately, they’re planning on having everyone attend in-person this Fall, with no option for remote learning. 

So my mom gave the admissions counselor a call today and told them no, that I had made up my mind on not going. It sucks because it took so much to convince my mom to let me go before the pandemic started. Every other day it was back and forth with her about whether I was going there or the local community college, which I’d also applied for in April. 

The reason why the CC is such a viable option is because my state allows residents to attend one for the first two years completely free, provided you transfer to a 4-year school right after. It also allows you to take online classes at home entirely, which I think is safer during COVID-19.

144,"I think it's funny that people wish this. I don't think I ever want to return to my childhood. It wasn't the worst but I feel like a lot of traumatizing things happened and there were extended periods of anxiety like: 

""is my mom gonna divorce this white hilbilly soon? They've only known each other 5 months, he's racist to my family, and he keeps touching me"" 

or ""is this 3rd husband of my mom's gonna keep verbally attacking me? He's overly sensitive, just because I don't feel like talking in the mornings you have to call me a ""dumbass retard"", and do I have to keep walking on eggshells around him until I go to college?"" 

Or ""is my mother gonna keep stalking me in college all because she doesn't like that at 18 years old I'm finally dating and she doesn't like any of the guys I'm with because 'they don't make enough money to support a woman'?"" 

Or ""is my mom really gonna try to stop me from moving to another state to live with the only guy she even remotely liked and using her husband to double up on me and put me down?

I never thought to tell my biological father what was happening and now it's too late because he's no longer in this world. I never told him the full story because as a child I was convinced that he couldn't take care of me like my mom could for whatever reason. Whenever I told him the smallest of those things, he would get very angry at my mom and a fight would break out. I would take peace over venting about my feelings anyday because my summer vacations with dad were a break from dealing with home life turmoil with my perpetually-angry mother. The sad thing is that my relationship with my mother is somewhat stable now that I'm grown and out of the house, but I can still find myself resenting her at times and I don't want to but I do. One big reason why I want kids is because I want to outdo her which I honestly don't think will be hard and I low key hope it's a girl like me. I don't plan on having one until a few more years when I'm clear to 30 years old, but I do think about it a lot. I don't want them to look at their childhood like I do at my own.",28May2020,1

151,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence / :",28May2020,1
152,"About 3 months ago I was playing basketball got hit in the chest pretty hard and experienced slight pain but that was expected, nothing I haven’t experienced before. I’m also a daily cannabis smoker . About a week ago I experienced really weird chest pain and was so scared I put my bud down ( I never do that ) went and layed down but was even scared to go to sleep as I thought something bad could’ve happened. I definitely felt my heart racing. I’m not sure if this is anxiety as I know I deal with it. Or something I should actually be concerned about. It’s kinda weird I can smoke sometimes and be fine and then next thing you know my chest feels really weird. I was thinking maybe a collapsed lung but I figured if it was collapsed with me smoking something would have happened to me by now. Also was thinking a allergy to a certain strain because it seems I experience it more when I smoke a certain strain ( not 100% sure ) but I didn’t read anything about chest discomfort being a symptom. I don’t have any problem breathing it’s just the feeling in my chest. I also seem to experience it more when thinking about it as I’m constantly reminding myself. The feeling can be felt anywhere. Sometimes left side sometimes right but it’s usually in the middle. It’s been a underlying feeling this past week but has had its spike on Monday, Thursday and last night which is what alerted me because I figured I might just be feeling my chest discomfort from playing basketball way back.",28May2020,1
154,"I’m 20 and went to the grocery store with my dad and he’s usuallt kind of creepy and embarassing as usual like he keeps calling me baby really loud to where everyone nearby can hear for example. But then he did something like reallt weird. So I was putting the groceries in the checkout belt, and then suddenly he is like directly behind me and I’m done putting the gorceries there so I try to say excuse me and get out of the way but he just stands there creepily. So I had to squeeze through between the cart and the counter to get out of the way and it was just so creepy and is bothering me. I have since confronted him about it through text but he is probably going to call me weird and invalidate my feelings like he always does. I’m wondering if this sounds like maybe it was just a tight space and he was not hearing me say excuse me or if it sounds like he was trying to like be right there on purpose? I might just be overthinking it because I hate him and hate people in my personal space but idk. and idk what to do about it to make myself feel better.",28May2020,1

156,"Backstory on me, I am a welder and mechanic down home country boy and ive always been physically active and i have also done plenty of stupid things in my time. Ive had 4 back surgeries and i smoke and drink. However relatively speaking I am a very healthy young man. But I have noticed its getting worse. It started sometime last year even to a point a woman i was seeing asked if i had speech classes as a child. Which i did, however when i asked my mom and dad(63&amp;61) neither could remember what for, i do pronounce words very strangely. Still. But its gotten worse and it feels like my brain will just click off mid sentence and I have to FIGHT to get that word out or i give up. Does anyone have any insight?",28May2020,1
157,"It's rare that i actually feel this way, i'm not usually a big fan of anniversaries, but my cakeday reminds me of the wholesome people whom i have met here! And all the nice comments people have given me over the past 2 years, basically i'm kind of venting right now cz it would be weird telling this to someone that's not here on reddit, i love you all and i want you to always remember that better days are coming, remember that one smile can change someone's day and that positive self talk is what keeps you going through tough times! Here's to many years to come.",28May2020,1

159,"Hey all, I have an opoortunity to lose my virginity, I went to school with this girl and we were friends. She goes to the same highschool as I do and people call her a slut. She is bi and has multiple boys/girls who make out with her and have sex with her individually. Now you see I’m a very horny individual and I have never been in a relationship but she’s like:  hey man u cool we can hang out sometimes ;) which she stated before is what happens before the hookup. What would you do in this situation I’m really torn on this one",28May2020,1
160,"i (21F) recently had to have a hard conversation with my roommate (21M), which one could only expect to go horribly, given that it's a known fact amongst our friends that trying to speak to him basically will never work, and he most likely will turn it back on you in some sort of way, while skirting responsibility. when i said my piece, he hung up on me and continued to be argumentative to a point which should not have caused this much of a snag.

unfortunately, he is more the ""dominant type"" and has such influence over our mutual friends, it's kind of sad. one of our friends (21F) who lives in the building next door and would often discuss these issues with me/listen to me vent about him has stopped responding to my texts, and will come to the apartment to hang out with my roommate; when she leaves, if i am around, she will basically run out the door as to limit her interaction with me. now it seems i am a forgotten -- or shall i say ostracized -- member of the friend group, and i am reduced to a life of sitting in my room without having a human to talk to, burying my head in books and the occasional youtube video. can't really say the most enjoyable position to be in during covid's reign is one marked with a lack of friends.",28May2020,1
