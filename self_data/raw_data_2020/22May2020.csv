0,"I get way too offended when anyone is rude/mean to me on Reddit, I know that's totally ridiculous but it's true. On my other (main) account I participate in a daily thread for my city where everyone is super nice, I've posted about my struggles with recently moving, being alone, looking for work, etc. I defended another user on there and someone called me out for occasionally deleting my comments when I ask for advice -- not sure why they even see that as a bad thing -- and they basically said I'm weird just like the user I was defending. I looked at their profile to almost immediately see a post where they were super anti-trans. So now I know they're just not a very nice person in general.

Idk why I'm even posting this since it's not exactly interesting but I've already written it out so here we are",22May2020,2
1,Am living in a nightmare right now. Am losing my mind what's left of it. I just wish I felt safe enough to sleep. I need to sleep. I just......wanna feel normal again tho it's too late for that.

2,"Haven't been drunk in a while, but a friend visited me for the first time in a couple of weeks. I've had a bottle of wine and a handful of beers at this point, and I don't feel that good tbh haha. I really have to sober up before I can properly go to bed! I men getting drunk with friends is pretty fun, but it doesn't feel like the worth it to feel so drunk and shitty for that lol.",22May2020,1
3,"idk if I'm allowed to include the name of the subreddit because of the rule against ""witch hunts"" 

anyway I found this subreddit which is for screenshots of posts that are like ""and they said [x group of people] can't do [y thing]"" but really absurd because no one actually says that, eg ""who said said a farmer can't wear gold and catch turkeys"" (actual post from there). so I sorted by top like oh yeah this gonna be good

but... so many of the top posts are screenshots of women, people of color, disabled people, etc celebrating that they are doing things that,fir various reasons, it's hard for people in those groups to do.

eg. ""who said a quadriplegic can't practice medicine?"" really? you really can't think of a single reason a quadriplegic might be told they can't become a doctor? really?

some of them even have in the screenshots people replying like ""Hitler is the one that said brown eyes can't be attractive,"" ""the taliban is the one that said hijabi girls can't get an education,"" just really whacking you over the head with the fact that these are in fact things that people say, and things that affect a lot of people's lives. 

i came here to laugh and instead I'm just cringing at people's lack of empathy. how they look at marginalized people celebrating getting past systemic barriers, and they just laugh at those people for claiming there are barriers at all.

it's part of a larger problem where people in... I forgot the word, centralized? groups... accuse people in marginalized groups of making up their problems and ""making everything about race"". also i didn't forget the word, the word is privileged, as in privileged to not have those problems, but I didn't wanna immediately write that because so many people shut down at the word privilege because of this exact issue, they can't handle the idea that other people might have problems that they don't.

and posting this might not be a good idea because I expect some assholes to come out of the woodwork and call me a sjw f/*gg/*t for (gasp) acknowledging that people born in different circumstances have different experiences in life, and idk if I can handle that right now.

8,"( before I start for those of you that don’t know what ocd is its basically patterns or rituals that a person follows to relive temporary fear or anxiety about a situation)

I know this is wrong but pls read because i really need anyone elses imput on the situation

I don’t even know where to start.. My mom has Never been a stable person. She has had very bad anxiety and ocd issues for along as I can remember. In the 16 years that I have been alive she has never gotten help for it. The only was she deals with it is taking it out on other people. She has always had very weird ways of doing things to prevent dangers that aren’t real. She passed that trait down to me. I have dealt with A LOT of mental health issues from since I was very young. It started with just the ocd when I was about 8, I was repeating the same patterns (like shutting the front door just the right way/ number of times because I was made to believe that if I didn’t someone would break in and tons of other things like that) that I saw my mom doing because according to her that was the only way to be safe. the more time went on the more terrified I got. I was so scared that I would do something wrong and my whole family would die or my house would burn down because of me forgetting to turn something off or lock something. My mental heath problems snowballed from there. Over the years my ocd turned into constant anxiety and social anxiety, which turned into depression and anorexia, which turned into cutting myself and suicidal thoughts. By the time I was about 14 I didn’t have a single friend, was Hating my life, Hating my body, Cutting myself and seriously considering suicide daily. On top of all of this my home life was hell, My parents were screaming at each other every day, my dad was cheating on my mom, Divorce was constantly discussed, They were occasionally very violent with each other. Chairs were thrown across the room, at least 4 cell phones were smashed, my mom had to call the police on my dad multiple times. All of these things felt like the weight of the world on my shoulders. Eventually I had had enough. I talked to my mom about it. She told me that my problems were ‘’ a heart issue’’ and ‘’ I just needed to get right with God’’. Those words hurt me so much. That night I had a panic attack because I thought I was never going to get help because she didn’t believe me… She didn’t believe me. Eventually after more months of suffering she agreed get me meds… from Whole Foods. She said she googled my problems and that I should start taking a vitamin… so I did and nothing got better. I mean what do you expect its a vitamin. So than she agreed to finally take me to a therapist. The therapist said that I should start taking a prescription medicine. My mom was not sold on the idea. She acted like I would be a drug addict if I started on meds. Eventually she agreed and after some time it helped a lot! I was starting to feel myself again! But I still had bad weeks, bad months. My mom took it upon herself to decide that i had enough treatment and that I was cured. my mom stoped taking me to the appointments or even letting me know when i had an appointment after some time. she would always say that she ""forgot that i had an appointment"" or that she ''didn't feel good'' so that she wont have to take me which made things super weird between me and my therapist and completely ruined that relationship . She never took my mental health as a real concern even when i was suicidal. when i started taking meds for it she acted like i was a drug addict and she still make fun of me for it. i was always and still am super frustrated that she just decided for me that i had gotten better and no longer needed a therapist.

Which brings us up to the current times. She has been 10 times more crazy than usual. she flips out at the smallest things and i feel like i have to walk on egg shells to not do anything that sets her off. She screamed at me for putting a gallon of milk on the table the other day because apparently that gallon of milk was not safe for anyone to touch but her. She freaks out when anyone touches the groceries or even goes by the front door. I haven't been outside in 4 months... 4 MONTHS not even in my back yard because she thinks that it's too dangerous. i'm starting to realize that my dad isn't as bad as i thought he just snapped after dealing with her insanity for 20 years of their marriage. She is extremely temperamental and when she's mad she refuses to talk about it she just screams because louder = right... If you try to talk to her about anything that shes doing she screams cuss words and for you to shut up, then she picks apart whatever she can about you and goes to cry in the corner so shes the victim. I'm getting so tired of this constant gas lighting and manipulation from her. i cant take how controlling she is any more... and i don't know what to do about it. My mental health has been not great lately but i know that i can't see a therapist again because of what she did last time.

10,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence / :",22May2020,1
11,"I usually never express how I'm feeling to anyone, I'm a 16 year old and I feel as if I've failed so far and the future is not bright. 
I come from a poor family where only my father works and my mother doesn't work, they decided that they wanted me to go to a paying school as no one in my entire family has gone into higher education or has a high paying job e.g engineer. I went to this school , let me say that my social skills are not very good, I have anger management issues and when I think back onto my actions I feel very guilty sad and depressed, I think this is because I've missed out on my childhood, you see when I was younger I was never allowed outside or at a friends house to play or go to any birthdays, I still am not allowed hence never really had friends, i think this is because my parents do not want me to end up on the wrong path, I have not tried to explain or go out with friends as once when I did for just a bit after school, my father came looking for me and when he spotted me he beat me up badly in front of them this is once out many times. Well going back to the school part I feel very ashamed and hopeless as my behaviour at the school was not good, and I was always surrounded with people who's parents were doctors engineers etc so I was usually under pressure to do well and always felt ashamed if I didnt do as well them, I was bullied by them for being from a poor family too, and teachers were quite harsh due to my behaviour. Believe me I tried very hard to study and learn but I ended up doing average my parents said very upsetting things to me day in and out like I would never be anything, no one will ever acknowledge me etc, i studied hard for my exams many months, everyday , when my grades arrived i was not too happy i got average, and my classmates got very high grades. Overall I actually feel hopeless I dont know what to do, I've always wanted to stand out and make everyone proud. I feel as if these 17 years could have been filled with some enjoyment but it's been quite dark there are other things too but I dont feel comfortable saying them even online.",22May2020,1
12,"Hey guys. It's my birthday today... just turned 19. Quaranbirthday, blah blah, blah, I hate my birthday anyway. Or so I've always thought. 

But I've been questioning my life to an insane degree lately. Why don't I ever care about birthdays? Why didn't I want to go to prom? Why didn't I give a shit which college I went to? And now I feel totally lost. I've always been a straightedge mofo--never kissed anyone, never had a real friend to talk to, haven't made a single friend at my commuter school or in high school. I'm alone on a daily basis and play video games all day. I've gained 20 lbs. in the past two months--no, I'm not tall. 

I guess I don't really know how to get to the point, but in my life I just don't know where to start. I **could transfer out**, but that would mean giving up medical school probably (I'm in a guaranteed med undergraduate program, and hate it here). I am lost in my **sexuality**\--I just don't know what to do anymore... I'm so obsessive about it. I feel lost in **being social**\--I put so much effort to putting up appearances, but it feels awful inviting people to do things. I feel like a **total neckbeard**\--I'm going to die at 40 at this pace. What's wrong with me?  


Please give me advice... I keep asking people what to do, and I just feel stuck, like I can't start. I feel like giving up. I'm just so fucking weak and useless and unmotivated.

First let’s get to the obvious, it’s not a one time service where you get a “spot” nah it’s like a cellphone plan. You gotta constantly be paying to keep it and even then there’s “add ons” the food, the snacks, the gold club thing, etc. 

Having a connection to the outside would make it hard asf at first but then once you get over it it would still be hard knowing your friends/family keep going and you’re stuck literally there. Always the same place, the same people, same everything 

Idk about y’all but my idea of fun/happiness is freedom. Go out for a long car ride when I want, having the ability to choose to not eat junk food, or once In a while getting the junk food of my choosing and In Cali there’s zero shortage of choices of junk food 

The hair thing? Being “glitched” into sticking up in the beginning? That implies that you CANT change the way you look(in a good way) idfk about y’all but I love changing my body for the better. Things like working out and actually changing my body, styling my hair in a different way once it gets old, growing my hair a bit longer or a bit shorter from time to time. Idk about y’all regarding this but, from time to time, having a “bad hair day” is satisfying. Like waking up, your hair is bad asf and you wouldn’t want to go out like that but right there in the moment, it looks funny

18,"For privacy reasons and because the last thing I need is some Reddit horde attempting to track the video down, I'm not going to name this actress, so don't even ask. But suffice it to say she is a HUGE inspiration to me and I absolutely adore her. Well, last night I had the opportunity to do a live chat with her via a webinar platform, and going back and watching the video now, I just feel sick. Everything about me was awkward, from my voice to my ugly ass FACE. I know everybody says they look ugly on camera, but I mean it 100%. I looked positively revolting on there, and especially when placed next to this beautiful woman, I looked like an ugly, fat FREAK! We've been chatting for a few weeks over social media, so I can't even imagine what she thought when she finally got to see me face to face, especially considering my Instagram photos actually look GOOD, since I take dozens in order to get the perfect shot, and go through the effort of finding a nice filter. I have no doubt (even though she was as gracious and kind and sweet as could be) that in her mind she was secretly repulsed by what popped up on screen. She probably thought, *wow, this is the fangirl that I've been talking to on Instagram these past couple months? EWWWW.* Not to mention the god-knows-how-many other fans there were watching that livestream! It's honestly EMBARRASSING as fuck, and everybody else looked perfectly fine and normal, and then there was me, looking like a SPACE ALIEN, ugh...they were probably all laughing at me and thinking about how hideous I was.

I also didn't have makeup on, because 1) I wasn't really anticipating going on camera. I (naively) assumed that the Q&amp;A would be held solely via the chat box, but no, the next thing I know, the host is asking to pull me up on screen so I can ask my question, and 2) It was the middle of the night and I was literally streaming the whole thing *from my fucking closet* so that I wouldn't wake up the rest of the house in the small (haha) chance that I did go on camera, or had to speak or something. Don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly grateful to have gotten to talk to her. I'm completely over the moon at getting to know her a little bit, even if only via social media, but it's really times like these that make me realize what an abnormal, disgusting monster I appear to be, especially on camera. I honestly can't even bring myself to go back and watch the video, because I just feel like crying when I see my ugly ogre face on screen. Ugh, I'm hoping my revolting features didn't scare her away or anything. I hope she still likes me after this, because I humiliated the hell out of myself last night simply for existing :(",22May2020,1
19,"There's been countless examples of abuse that I've seen others dish and receive in real life, and to be honest the internet has been no different.

I love to have a place to open-mindedly discuss problems, solutions, just chit chat, and be in good vibes. It seems as though that this possibility is even starting to escape the grasp of Reddit, my former go-to place to chill and get away from life.

This is just ONE out of the many examples that I could provide. My list would be endless so I'll spare you.

Just a while ago I posted on r/excel asking for advice for a problem. There were several people who were cool but then the mod comes along with a pissy attitude and tells me that my post might be removed because I used the word ""urgent"" and that my ""urgency"" was nobody elses concern. It was the most pissy and mentally retarded thing he could have said, because my problem is one that MANY can face in MS Excel, and their solutions would definitely help people to come. I basically told him off and went about my way, but it made me feel like I was in Nazi Germany for a second. It seems like you cannot do or say anything with somebody making a rude remark or having a terribly bad attitude.

I think I'm deleting my Reddit account tonight, because this place no longer serves as a place to ""chill"" and escape for me anymore, but more as a place to spark anxiety and panic.",22May2020,1

i think about our relationship quite a lot. there aren’t many days that go by where i do not think about her or come across a memory of us or even appear in my dreams while i sleep. although i am over it and have been with and loved many people since us, i was worried this was going to be hard on my heart.  

it is very clear to me now that this connection was not meant to be. i grew so much and i have evolved into a whole different person, but she still remains the same as i remembered her. she is still the same old person. talking with her felt like talking to a past self in a way. i used to be so much like her and although we are the same age i feel like i am years older than her when i interact with her. idk if that makes sense 

but our connection just isn’t there anymore. i am so proud of how i have grown and changed as a person since our relationship ended. maybe in the future she will have her moment where she evolves from a hard time into a new person, but for now i am okay with where we are. she can stay being her, but i have got way too many plans and dreams to stay stuck in tenth grade with her.",22May2020,1

Family that treats me a little bit differently but don't make me feel appreciated. I never thought I'd get to this point. I was such a happy kid in middle school, thinking I was going to crush high school, and that I would be having the time of my life with girls and my best friends at college. Instead, here I am, finishing up my second semester at community college, struggling in literally every aspect of my life.

I really want to cry but it feels like even my tears don't want any part of my life. 

Fuck my sorrows. Please, cheer me up with the most romantic, movie-like, optimistic, and amazing stories about how far you've come since you were 19. Perhaps my tears will respond to joy.",22May2020,1

41,"I’d like to clear this out first, I don’t have a depression. I had recently taken a test but I do have mild anxiety. 
Once I used to be really excited about everything and I was this excited kid that couldn’t shut up. I used to get overly excited about TV shows and books. While I still like them, they don’t excite me enough. For example if a new season is coming out, I don’t count down the days anymore and I even tend to forget about it. Very unlike the old me. 
Besides this I also write and I used to be able to form stories in my head once while doing other stuff but now I’m not able to come up with a story unless I sit down and work on it. 
I just don’t feel like I’m the same person anymore idk. Is this just me growing up? Have any of you gone through this?",22May2020,1

43,"I've(18F) always had a pretty hard time letting other people in and believing anyone else could help me, but its starting to worry me that i may never be able to trust anyone and be happy. 

I dated my best friend of five years after liking each other that whole time and my inability to let him in and just, try to count on him like a partner led to us breaking up and I cost us a friendship that meant a whole lot to us both, and I'm worried I may ruin my current relationship with my really sweet and wonderful boyfriend of almost 4 months because I still am too afraid to open up.

I find it really hard to ever talk to anyone when I'm upset or why, I've even ended up conditioning myself to be unable to cry about things that upset me and I don't get attached very easily anymore to keep myself from getting hurt. My first real boyfriend at 15 ended up in a pretty nasty break up last year and for the last year or so of our relationship it was mostly fighting and me crying a lot because of him and getting hurt because of how he treated me and now I'm afraid to ever try to love anyone like I had loved him because he wouldn't love me back, and he never really listed to me when I tried to talk about problems with him. Whenever I tried to talk about what was wrong with me when he upset me it always ended up with me bawling my lungs out and him being really annoyed with me for acting like such a baby and being upset over stupid stuff too often. Now instead I just, try to convince myself nothing bothers me anymore so that I don't risk getting upset over something dumb ever again. 

But things do really bother me sometimes and now I just can't ever accept that they do or admit that I'm feeling bad or upset, and worst of all is I can't ask anyone for help or to just comfort me because then i have to be a problem again and risk annoying people and driving them away.  

I don't want to feel so alone anymore, I just want to be able to let some one help me feel better instead of hiding everything and always taking care of myself for once.",22May2020,1
44,"So I’m in my late teens now, but the most significant chapter in my started in late middle school. My dad came into my room late at night worried, and said something along the lines, “I don’t mean to wake you but i think your mom is cheating on me”. He showed me texts on her phone saying many suggesting things to another guy. I don’t know why he came to me, and I never saw him so worried before, even at 12-13.

They began to fight a lot, and my mom began drinking more. She is a severe alcoholic (story for another time). My dad was kicked out of the house several times and vice versa. Long story short they decided to get a divorce. My mom got a boyfriend before the end of the divorce, but my dad doesn’t even have a girl to this day. 

Fast forward, we moved two times, and I wasn’t allowed to see my mother. As we had a PRE observe us, my mother was given the choice to give up alcohol or lose custody of me and my sibling. She did not choose us. The only time I spent with my mother was in a visitation center for 3 hours a week. At this point, everyday I didn’t get to see my mother, she called me for a half an hour crying about how my father has taken us away. 

Through the years, she’s gained and lost time for how well she obeys court orders. To this day I get to see her for 3 hours on Wednesdays, and over nights every other weekend. Going to her house feels like visiting a zoo, you go for a little bit but fun time ends and you have to go home eventually.

Now don’t get me wrong, I love my mom, and she is a wonderful person. She is wise with (some of) her knowledge and is clearly there for me. I used to trust her much more than my dad at times.

I have left out several bits of the story whether forgotten or to long to explain, but it’s been recently where I have been stressed out.

Around late 2019 I got a DUI, as I started getting into drugs and alcohol around freshman year (another story for later). But this has been quite a big deal in my life, my court date is soon but I have gotten over the emotional worst part. My family was very upset initially but supportive of my change which i respect. Me getting this DUI is relevant as my mom has to dive me home after the visits, and she is often drunk. A week or two ago i confronted her, saying it isn’t worth getting a DUI when my dad can just pick us up, so i called my dad over to drive us. She began crying by the time my father went out, hugged us goodbye and went in the house. right before we left she came back out, visibly holding a gun ( .22 cal that i knew she owned) trying to threaten my dad. This brings us to today, where i found out that she had gotten arrested for DUI. I know she can’t handle this financially, let alone my several Fee’s from DUI as a minor. Sometimes i fear overnights at my moms house, as she could do something irrational to hurt us, I’ll leave it there.

47,"I received an email on Monday about a new arrangement for some Microsoft teams live class. It will be at 9 am every Thursday until 16 July. My teacher has stated that we must have our face cams turned on. I always have my microphone and camera turned off and just type because I’m not comfortable nor confident with showing my face or voice to some silly live class.  I also really don’t want to attend. I’m at a new school, my last year starts in September, but I hate it here, I’ve already been bullied and it’s difficult to make friends here too, this lockdown has meant I’ve been able to follow a schedule that my teacher emailed me and I’ve been fine with that and forgot that my school even existed. I’ve had 3 live classes with another teacher and only attended 1 class. I’ve been told that classes are recorded and you can rewatch them in a shared area, well when I joined I specifically said I don’t want my face to be recorded or have photos taken of me and uploaded by the school. So do I HAVE to turn my mic and camera on? Do I even have to attend my new live classes? I find independent learning suits me much better. I understand the teacher wants to teach a new topic but I just don’t feel keen joining the class. What’s the worse that they could do to me? Maybe it’s worth noting that I am 1 of 6 kids so mornings especially 9 am is busy and my mom often requires my help. What should I do?",22May2020,1
48,"Hi all. So my boyfriend is a musician and he just released a song. He’s been working on this release for almost a month, and he’s put so much effort into it. It released today but his current manager just isn’t putting the same effort in. His last release flopped (5k views compared to his a song before that with almost 100k views) due to the manager and he’s now thinking this song will do the same. He needs to find a new manager but in the meantime, he needs as many views as he can in the first few days to be put on editorial Spotify playlists.

52,"Up until recently, I lived with a girl in a flat-share in central London. 

When the lockdown first started, she refused to abide by the rules. Her family were doctors in Brazil, and they insisted that the greatest threat wasn't to public health, but rather to the economy. For that reason, she insisted on going out every day as normal. 

I was like ""okay, but Europe is the new epicentre, this country is in lockdown, and you can definitely do your part to protect the more vulnerable amongst us..."" 

She continued using public transport, seeing friends, internet hookups, going to the store daily. The whole time, her argument was that I didn't understand the science, that I needed to listen to her doctor family, the media was blowing everything out of proportion, that it was just common flu. I used to wonder if they got their degrees from Disneyland... because what doctor would tell their kid to do this...

I never feel more alive than when I forget about my life and am immersed in someone else's fantasy. I can fill myself with stories and imagination, for the rest I'm empty. 

I have no friends, I struggle to make connections with people and never had a relationship or intimacy of any sort at 32. When I talk to people, I feel disconnected and don't understand them, but if a fictional character goes through a bad episode I empathize in full. 

I would be lying if I said I used that alone time to do something productive, I have no social or artistic life, I'm professionally on the bottom ladder and am irrelevant as a person. 

I traveled, but doing so alone all the time feels empty after a while. Give me a good picture or painting of a landscape and I can lose myself in it. 

I'm cynical towards people if they are real, I'm more thoughtful and reflective of them if they aren't.

**TL;DR** - Talking with girl off app. Attracted, interested, but so concerned over possible compatibility issues.

-----------------------------


I'm 25M and though I've had a 3 year relationship from 22 to 25 (that ended 8 months ago), I still feel inexperienced in dating and relationships. That relationship was my first everything. I learned a lot, but still feel like I didn't learn much and that I don't know much of anything about relationships and partnerships.

To describe myself, I'm a really quiet, nerdy person so to speak, with a small set of hobbies I enjoy, and not a lot of friends, but that's by design. I never really fit in anywhere growing up, and basically did things my own way. Never liked socializing, never liked going out, hate dancing, going out to bars/clubs/parties, social events in general. I'm also a non-drinker and never had a sip of alcohol (not changing this). Never thought I was really weird, just different than the usual, and just minded my own business.

I'll admit, those things do give me trouble with relating to people, especially in dating. A lot of times, it feels I have to hide who I truly am, or just present a false image or a front because thus far no one has been interested in the real me. I've spent time in therapy over this, and still working it out. I really want to be an authentic me, but I still worry about women accepting a guy who's a real homebody, doesn't like all the social stuff, and spends a lot of his time building up his non-profit and living out his passion coaching robotics and inspiring kids in STEM. That's my true passion and joy in life, and it means so much to me that I'd never give that up for the world.

Even with my hobbies and going to competitions, volunteering all over, I never meet people through my hobbies. I've accepted that, and know that traditional means of finding a partner and companion won't ever happen. It's not my focus when I go out and do these things as I just love competing and seeing robotics teams compete, and I enjoy that. But I can't help but wonder and wish that sometimes I'd find someone that's into robotics as much or even somewhat as much as I am. Alas, not where I live.

Dating apps aren't much better for me. I don't receive a ton of matches to begin with, and when I do, the message conversations tend to be short and fizzle out. They'll just take longer to reply, or just fade out and ghost. It sucks, but I keep trying because I'm not going to be successful in this avenue just being woe is me. I can't force anything and don't want to, but I do know for myself long term I want a relationship, marriage, family, etc. Not into casual stuff.

Recently, I've been talking to one girl from Bumble. From the start, it was kind of different than my usual convos. Most of them feel superficial and cheap, or I'm putting in more effort than I'm getting in return. In this case however, it wasn't. There's more than surface level conversation. We've talked politics, travel, and I feel I've learned more interesting facts and tidbits about her, but with room to still learn more.

We've transitioned to texting, and albeit just through text, I can tell she's incredibly intelligent, and interesting and well rounded, and well traveled. Compared to me, who just is an engineer, doesn't have the opportunity to travel much, etc. Through our convos, I've started to notice a sense of attraction and feeling growing.

I've tried to be careful though, because at this point, it's just an image, a fantasy. I've reminded myself multiple times to be cautious and to realize that ultimately, I still don't know her that well. We have a lot of stuff in common, and there's still more to find out. I haven't found myself excited or intrigued about someone in years.

But with that, I have major reservations and I find myself having conflicts and confusion about things. I don't plan on doing anything while my state has a stay at home order, but I would love nothing else but to like actually meet her in person and see if there's something there. I know she travels between here and her home state every couple of weeks, but that's literally just a 2 hour drive. The main concerns and confusion I have are the following:

She's so well traveled, and also incredibly accomplished. Like did study abroad (twice) and language immersive undergrad. On top of that, I don't even feel intellectually on her level at all. Like there's just a level of difference between us. It's been fun asking questions and learning more from her on topics and discussing stuff, and she says she doesn't mind all the questions (and we both ask a lot), but I can't help but feel like a dumbass, or someone not as cultured because a lot of my things focus in very specialized areas. Hell, I don't have my college degree even but I've managed to do well in my career (6 figure senior engineer, and leadership roles are expected in the next few years)

But more than that, is I think the difference in our outgoing-ness and hobbies. As I stated before, my hobbies are very solitary and mostly alone, or take up time where I'm on the road. I also need a strong bit of alone time. I don't like dancing at all, and I'm incredibly self-conscious at a lot of stuff, and harshly self-critical. She loves dancing, the travel, yoga, singing. Hell she sings and plays an instrument. I get told by my family that I'm no good at it after they encouraged me to do choir.

There's probably a lot of putting on a pedestal that I need to curb and correct, but ultimately I'm struggling with the thoughts that yeah she seems awesome and would love to meet up with her on a date, but that I don't think I compare, namely because we enjoy things different ways, even if we have good discussion on a lot of big topics. I also feel this confusion and conflict that even with all that, that I should still try, and I don't know what to do.

I know this is a long rant, but this is definitely something I needed to dump out of my head.

58,"Fuck uni man, its exam seasons though because of the virus they're being treated more like 48 hour assignments.

I barely know what tf I am talking about and I'm keep having to look over my notes which I dont even understand at this point.

67,"My ex died seven years ago and I still can't get over what she said (numerous times). She was 191 cm, or 6'3 1/2"", tall. Also full figured and a redhead with blue eyes and pale skin. She was incredibly beautiful and extremely sexy. I'm a short dude; a pathetic (_-height-_), and my shortness is my biggest insecurity. I loathe it in words I can't describe. It makes me feel like a weakling; a mouse among lions. Especially considering most straight women I've ever met don't want t date a short guy under six feet (184 cm) tall. And yet, my ex always used to say that height was irrelevant to her and that if she _had_ to choose (as in, was crafting the perfect man and couldn't just leave the height option blank), her ""ideal man"" would be between 5'9""/175 cm and 6'1""/185 cm.

Like... _How?!?_ We all know women aren't attracted to short men in general, let alone shorter than them. Sure, a five foot tall chick would be willing to be with a 5'5""/165 cm guy, only because she found him ""relatively"" tall, not because she finds it attractive. If a guy is shorter, it's pretty much impossible to get a taller girl. And so, not only was my short, manlet ass shorter than her, but she was also taller than usual. How she didn't want a 6'5""/195 cm to 7'0""/214 cm guy, like literally any other woman her height would desire, I cannot fathom, for the life of me. Like, at all. Not to mention, she always wished she was short herself, specifically 5'6""/167 cm. 

So, how could she not-only not want a taller guy given her own disliking to her height, but state her 'ideal guy' would be short to decent height. I mean, 6'1""/185 cm makes sense, but anything below 183 is unattractive to most first-world women in general. Like, I can't figure it out. Especially since this is one of those ""first impression"" things. It's the equivalent of saying a woman finds obese, ugly, or dark-skinned (I mean, charcoal-dark) men attractive. I mean, sure, it's hypothetically possible, but not conceivable. Like someone's favorite movie being Suicide Squad. My ex's favorite movie, in this case, would have to be The Last Airbender and even that makes more sense if you consider the person likes bad movies ironically. Only, she wasn't being ironic.

I'm a little guy who most successful American men are taller than (unless they're Mexican or older Asians) and most unsuccessful American men are the same height as. I have literally zero value physically in regards to my stature. So how she could say she was attracted to something that is almost universally unattractive to straight women, I cannot understand. It breaks my head to think about it. I can literally comprehend the size of the universe easier than I can understand her saying she found short guys attractive. It just breaks the laws of women. It shouldn't even exist. And yet, my ex was one of them. I'm still kinda annoyed at her about that, all these years later. Leaving me with an unsolvable enigma like that.",22May2020,0

70,"I have thought that i'm too good for this society or this world for my whole life. Through to the end of high school I was certain of it, and slowly but surely it's been dripping away until now at 28 I can finally admit to myself that I am just some guy. I'm not the hero, prince charming, or the One. The fantasy games and movies have been selling my my entire life are fantasies indeed. I'm not too good for this. I'm not smarter than everyone. The rules apply to me. I do not deserve special treatment.   


I have always believed (and my mother is at least partially responsible for this) that I am special. That brilliant title has always radiated about me like a holy blessing, until my faith was shaken. It's taken half a decade but that faith has finally crumbled and I see myself as just another guy.   


On the one hand, it's good. My self perception is more accurate. I'm less entitled and spoiled and i'm more inclined to work on things that I may not be the best at. I don't have a huge title to uphold and it's a huge relief.  


On the other hand, it's the death of my spirit. I'd always known I was the hero of time, the one to save everyone, to solve the biggest problems the world had with my heart of a lion and soul of a warrior, and that dream is dead now and it hurts. It's naive and unrelated to reality of course, but it felt real. I believed it so much that there was no doubt in my mind, and I miss the security and confidence. Now i'm not a hero. I'm just another dude on just another computer wasting just another day. I'm not letting the world down, because I can't save it. I only have power over my teeny-tiny patch of the duvet of humanity, and it feels so insignificant in comparison to what I used to feel I had dominion over I just want to give up. It's a great fall from a height that had no basis in reality, but it's a great fall nonetheless and I'm currently in shock from my wounds at the bottom of that drop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot ask this question without sounding like a pretentious dickbag, but I AM a pretentious dickbag so it's inevitable: How do I live like you? How do I make peace with just being some dude? How do I mourn the loss of my imaginary special status? I assume this is a leap most of you have made at some point before the end of high school - is it worth the jump? Would I be better off attempting to salvage what's left of my bullshit self esteem basis, or is there some relaxing calmness in being not responsible for saving this world? I seek your wisdom, reddit. Between the most upvoted and most downvoted comments there's usually all the best perspectives outlined. 

  
Please help me, I love you

74,"I’ve always been scared. Scared of how my peers perceive me. I’ve strived to be the best I can be, but not “too good” because I didn’t want to stand out, all so I could fit in. Changing how I look or speak so I wouldn’t be “different”. 
I minimized my skills, I even acted less intelligent than I actually am to fit in with my friends. It’s just so tiring to try to fit in and for what? 
To be like every other person? 
It took me a while to realize the fact that those things that make you “different” from everyone else, are the things that are most beautiful about you. 
The moment you realize how special you are, is the moment where your life truly begins. You will flourish with happiness and excellence. 
If we were all the same life would be so boring. Embrace who you truly are. 
So be bold, be brave, and don’t be afraid to show your true colors and be who you really are. 
No more masks or facades, I want to see the real you, the beautiful one that’s hiding under there.
 You are most definitely worth every ounce of who you are.",22May2020,1

This time it's about screenwriting. 20 years ago my wife and I were a touring musical act (she is a professional saxophone player). From that we developed a musical tour of the Civil War. We put it on tape and it languished there. Lately we, in collaboration with her brother, turned it into a video which is premiering on youtube right now.

A year or two my friend tells me that she use him and that kinda change how i feel about her i still love but i feel i wont get that trust back.

77,"Alright. I found out that my best friend from high school passed a couple of months ago. For some reason, I thought about her and wanted to see what she was up to. I remember she deactivated her Insta about 2 years ago because she wanted to focus on school. I googled her and to my shock, she passed away 2 years ago. She was only 20. I had no idea she died. The obituary stated her death as a suicide which took me aback. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back in high school, she and I were always gossiping and making fun of other people. Yes, we were bullies. I remember we used to pick on this one girl and call her a funny made-up name because it suited her. We would run away from this girl when she tried talking to us or approach us. We also talked about our other friends behind their backs. To sum it up, we were not nice people in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

We also used to skip classes together and we were both worrying about getting caught but thankfully we were never caught. My best friend would sometimes say jokingly about how she was going to kill herself before she reached 50. She said she didn't want to die all old and wrinkly. I thought she was joking at the time but now thinking back, I think it was a sign of her depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

After we both graduated from high school, we didn't talk to each other as much because of general college life stuff. I was at a state university and she was at an out-of-state university. I ended up switching colleges just as she enrolled in the state uni that I just left. She would post pictures of herself partying and having fun on her Insta. I remember kind of forgetting about her while as I was at the other college because I was in nursing school and I was stressed with school work. I remember my best friend would text me to hang out with her at the state university but I would always say no because I was tired and I needed to study.

&amp;#x200B;

I regret saying that now. I wonder if things would've been different if I hadn't switched colleges. The obituary stated that she felt alone and that she was stressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a few months since I've found out that she died. I still can't believe she committed suicide. She was basically like another version of me. The exact same sense of humor and we just clicked instantly. I doubt I will ever find someone like her again.

78,"To start off, I had a panic attack last week and have been highly anxious since then (getting much better tho) and my dreams have been all over the place. I thought this dream would give me anxiety, but it oddly made me feel at peace. 

It started with some of my old classmates from HS just sitting and doing homework before class started when all of a sudden a UFO was hovering above us, we thought it was just passing by but it actually was landing. 

when it landed, the aliens were coming out and they were disguised as humans, but with less whites in their eyes. At this time, I thought I’d be getting major anxiety in my dream like I did the others, but I just sat and watched and wanted to hear what they had to say after the government released those photos of a UFO recently. 

As they approached us, they didn’t shake our hands, they put their hands together in a prayer position and bowed and said we come in peace. They began telling us that they have been here since the 1930s, disguised as humans and saving our world. They were actors and doctors and other known people helping to make cures and bring awareness to certain aspects that needed attention in our world. That’s why the government just released a photo to the public, because they are getting ready to reveal who they really are. 

The main alien that was in my dream told me a secret about the weather, and I can’t for the life of me remember what he said. He made me promise not to tell anyone. They went back on their ship, and then I woke up. Not anxious or scared, but more so at peace that they’re not here to harm us, but to help us, and just realizing wtf I just dreamed of. 

Kind of weird to read, but the dream was one of the most vivid dreams I’ve ever had. It made sense on why we’ve spotted them from the early 1900s until now. Not saying this is all true, but it feels accurate. Thanks for listening.",22May2020,1

82,"I'm a midwestern college dropout who managed to transition from an English major to a coding bootcamp graduate. I got lucky and landed an internship at a little local company with a boss who knew he could train me. Then I quit that job after almost 2 years because he left and was replaced by a man who, while nice, treated me like I couldn't do anything. Plus, it was a toxic work environment. Then I got even luckier to swing a job at a company that's know to be the best in the state at what they do. Almost two years later and I love it here. I have an amazing boss and small dev team who are helpful and have taught me so much. Until I started working here, I was about to give up on being a developer. I didn't think I could do it. They helped me realize I could with the right guidance.

The other day I got an email from a recruiter at a certain major tech company in Silicon Valley. I took a call with the recruiter yesterday who said he saw my profile and wanted to reach out because they're looking for people like me who don't fall into the stereotypical ""Ivy League computer science degree &gt; internship at major tech company &gt; working at major tech company"" path. So, in a few weeks I will have a technical interview with one of their engineers to see if I have the skills to go on to have an official onsite interview. I actually have to study for it using the practice material they sent, which is amazing because it's just another thing that will help me grow!

 Whether I make it through the technical interview or not, I am incredibly grateful to even have that kind of opportunity. Hell, even if there are thousands of people who get technical interviews, I am still elated to be one of them. I never, ever imagined I would be here, no less be in this position at 24yo.

83,"Hello! I'm looking for advice. I'll try and keep this succint and relevant. Am, ok. So, dated an alcoholic leech who bled me dry (boy A). Then moved to a gaslighting verbally abusive lad (boy B). So far, so by-the-book. I'm 90% ok now, three years later (33, female, for context).

I am curious though - before boy A, I was a supremely confident, almost bullish person (I still am for the most part). I don't understand why I stuck around for either boy A or boy B - if I saw someone else doing that I'd think they were mad. I went to a therapist, once, and I didn't find it useful. Everything he told me, I've found online, and he was far too willing to blame a lot of my emotions on Boy B. I don't think I'm the wreck I am *because* of Boy B - I think I stayed with Boy B because *there was something wrong* with me, else I would have walked.

Anyway, who cares, right? Except now, like, if a lad ghosts me, I take it really badly. No one knows, I have far too much pride to let anyone know, but it eats me up. If a friend, or acquaintance, or relative, slights me, I absolutely shut down. I have this reputation as a supremely rational, intelligent person who doesn't entertain any nonsense, but it's like I can't afford to or I'll fall apart entirely. I'm now so intent on cutting anyone out who hurts me in any way that I 'm getting more and more insular and unlikeable. and cos I'm unlikeable this will keep happening, and I'll deserve it.

I guess, I get triggered? There was this incident where someone was shouting around me (a date's ex), and I just walked away, very calm and rational. 3 hours later, in Tesco, I was shaking and crying. This is a ridiculous way to be living, and I hate how self-indulgent it is to be so concerned with myself all the time. I've found a few coping tools online that work, but can someone give me a verbal slap in the face to get a fucking grip? This is manifesting itself into jealousy of other people's good news, and I avoid most social situations cos I'm the boring joyless one. I have a long life left yet. Has anyone been here and got back to normal?

87,"My 23rd birthday is tomorrow, May 23rd. I’ve been waiting years for my birthday to finally fall on a Saturday, and this year it finally did. And it’s quarantine.

I don’t love attention, but I do love partying. So for my birthday I usually have a weekend where I just go to a city and hang out with my college friends. I never get many gifts, except from my boyfriend, and I don’t ask for anybody to buy me drinks. I just like parties with my friends. I never even would buy balloons. 

I’ve been having a really hard time in quarantine because I’m in my childhood home with my family, and there is a lot of tension. I resent my parents for a lot of things, so I’m not looking forward to spending the day with them.

We were just going to barbecue and eat outside with me, my boyfriend, mom, dad, and sister. But now it’s supposed to thunderstorm. And I said before that I don’t care much for gifts, but everyone forgot about my birthday until last week and shipping will take months for anything to get here.

I just feel so crappy because it’s been two months since I’ve been with my friends, and I barely see my boyfriend. He was supposed to come tonight after work (late) but he just bought a new car. I’m happy for him and it’s a great deal, and it just kind of fell into his lap so he absolutely needed to take it. But now I just feel like my birthday is being overshadowed by everything. 

He’s very selfless and if he knew I were this down about it, he’d feel terrible. But he’s all caught up with his new car, is asking me to come with him to his house 2.5 hours away on Sunday, right after my birthday. Is talking about getting his car all fixed up next week. 

I feel like the only person who’s focused on my birthday is my mom, and like I said, there’s a lot of tension and resentment there so I don’t want her attention at all. 

And to top it all off, I just quit smoking weed this week to apply for jobs because I got laid off at the beginning of quarantine, and I can’t afford my bills soon. So I’ve felt super depressed all week, waking up sweaty, can’t sleep at all. I can’t afford to buy more weed, or buy myself a birthday present.

I worried that, if I was ever in an emergency situation, I would not be able to help or I'd do something wrong and make it even worse. Fast forward a few years - I'm 16 and backstage in a community theatre dressing room with two fellow cast members waiting for the show to start in 5 minutes. It was me, a girl I went to high school with (""Jane""), and a woman my mom's age (""Alice"") just goofing off and laughing like idiots. We were cracking up when suddenly Alice goes completely silent. Her eyes went huge and she started to grab her throat in a panic. She looked like a fish on land, unable to breathe. At first, we thought she was messing with us. Then her lips started turning blue. That was my ""oh shit this is actually happening"" moment. I looked at Jane and she was frozen and looked like the guy from The Scream painting. I yelled at her to go get help and call 911 but she was so scared she couldn't move or speak. I'm not proud to say that the next thing I did was turn to Alice and say, ""I'm going to give you the Heimlich now but I swear to God, if you're messing with me, I will end you.""

I wrapped my arms around her, stuck my fist under her sternum, and gave a giant thrust. Nothing happened. I was petite but she was a tiny bird of a woman and I was scared I was gonna break her. But she still wasn't breathing, Jane was still completely paralyzed and I didn't know what else to do besides keep going. I gave three or four more thrusts but, again, nothing. Alice started to get weak-kneed and I was having to hold her up between thrusts. I screamed for help and squeezed hard twice again, accomplishing nothing. Alice was barely hanging on at this point, no one had come to help, and I knew that I was about to have to transfer her to the ground and do CPR. I very, very much did not want to do that. In a desperate effort to avoid having to do yet another first-aid maneuver that I was entirely unqualified for, I ditched my concerns about breaking her little bird body and jerked my fist so forcefully that I was pretty certain I just punched her in the heart. I heard an ungodly, gutteral sound that somehow warped time because everything switched to super slow-mo. I watched a peppermint shoot out of her mouth and float through the air. I swear I could have counted each of the red and white stripes before the candy finally made contact with the wall on the other side of the room, shattering into a million bits (which, apparently, is what triggers the realignment of space and time, because everything snapped back to its original pace). Alice gasped and gagged. Jane suddenly reanimated and says, ""I'll go get somebody!"" What a great, and not at all way-too-late idea, Jane. People flooded the dressing room, Alice was shaken but ok, and we were on stage for the opening scene five minutes later. It was a wild ride that I'm totally fine never taking again.

I was just a shy kid trying to keep my job but I was being used. and I was left unemployed after that, I was still going to school but I didn't and could focus so I just got my financial aid taken away and since I was working I was aware how back it would affect my life down the road. anyway, I have left schooless and unemployed for a year, I was so out of it when I started I couldn't believe how brutal things had gotten I was anxious and weak as hell in that time the only people I had to hang out with are the rejected ones and it didn't help because I knew I was never that type of person but I was alone they were around so I would stay with them. ""not a good idea"" its when I started smoking pot at 22 and 23 were the heaviest I would consume it until I managed to pay for some classes to keep going to school. and I would still work at the 8 dollars an hour job until my grandfather got me a job an as a janitor in his building I worked for him for about a year and I was in a haze most of the time because my life was not the way I wanted it to be everything sucked and I could Fucking appreciate what I had because ei would drink or smoke weed whenever I could I got fired at 24 and got on well-fare for a little until I could find another job I was still going to school and just kept dealing with strange people I'm really not supposed to deal with I had a girlfriend at the time and well it wasn't much help I was fucking messed up and I had her as support but I was in no position to be in a relationship. I was viced hard and then I got a job at advanced auto parts still paying for classes out of pocket. I managed to get by with a few classes I knew if I took more I wouldn't be able to take it.  so at 26, I left again since I had a small break and got another job at the airport holy shit writing this dispersing and I wanted bec faster and get an associate in something I didn't care at this point my head was toasted I lost that job because of my manners and I would clock in with more time than usual to get paid a little more. I started to work for my dad and got my associates in arts. at 27. I did it and started to go to university I always wanted to go as a kid.  and im still home because I was lost yet again in finding what I wanted to do but I hadn't gotten any psychiatric help yet until only 3- months ago I started to take medication and it brought me back to how I was when I wanted to go that university it took mess long it did because I didn't believe in the pharma I had been brainwashed into thinking it was bad and I and my family thought we could fix it without help. and now here I am I feel ashamed im still here. like what the fuck was all of \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^this? and im waiting for school to open up again to give it another shot I feel horrible still depending on my family im in a nightmare I could have avoided if just would have had a clear vision I got brainwashed like most millennials in to think we are special ""YOU could be the one to change the world and not be told how and what else is there if you don't without beating the shit out of yourself because being selfish is bad and you could always do better. did I mention that every time I try to study it's like a trauma that doesn't allow me to fully relax and absorb my information? at my house and I can't afford to move out just yet.",22May2020,2

120,"like I’ve been working for a long time now on my hobbies and loving myself and being ok spending time with myself so i should not be needy right? wrong. And it’s weird like I’m so selectively needy. I’ll push aside everyone else who doesn’t meet my picky standards and find like one or two people who do. Then we hit it off but I just can’t shake the feeling often of like what if they dont like me what if i made a fool of myself what if im actually ugly and they notice that? they didnt respond for five minutes what did i do? And it’s a lot better than it used to be, but I still like wait for whoever I’m talking to just wake up from sleeping so I can chat with them because I’m just needy and idk why.

i imagine moving out of my toxic parenrs house would help with this but seeing as its not rlly an option right now what do i do about thisss",22May2020,1
121,"I hate not working for a couple days because it gives me time to think of all the ways I’m failing at life. It’s only day one of my 4-day weekend and I already feel the depression and anger and anxiety building. I’m so bitter and jealous and defeated and exhausted and there’s no one in my life to talk to. 

I regret choosing to chase my dreams and accomplish shit. It’s getting me nowhere. The people in my life who have lives I envy got knocked up young and trapped the right man into marrying them. All I do is work or sit at home thinking about how alone I am. I have a boyfriend but I think we’re both unable to just end it even though I can pinpoint the exact day 2 years ago that the relationship died. When he told me that he loves me but doesn’t like me as a person and wanted to marry me once but now just can’t stand being around me. 

I have student loan debt I need to pay off, so I’m looking into side gigs but even then I’ll be working my ass off for years to get rid of that debt. I started my career super late in life so now I’m behind on everything. By the time I’m where I want to be in life I’ll be close to retirement age. And I hate when people try to say “it’s okay you did it late, everyone progresses through life at their own pace” because that’s bullshit. It definitely would have been better if I had just graduated HS, graduated college, worked, and started a family in that order just like everyone else. I am not where I want to be and I don’t have what I want because I wasted years trying to “go at my own pace”. Now my days are spent working to avoid feeling all of this, and the occasionally having too many days off to allow it all to sink in and make me feel like shit.

I wish I was just a regular, kind, wholesome average person who did everything in the same order on the same timeline as everyone else. Why did I have to try so hard to be “different”? Take it from me, just use the life formula that has been proven to work. Don’t try to “forge your own path” that’s bullshit and it rarely works out.",22May2020,1

124,"This happened a few months ago at a family gathering but now it came up in my head again and I'm cringing. There was anime playing on a tv at family members that one of the kids put on and one of my uncles asked 'what was is anime' so I said "" Haven't you heard of hentai?"" (In my head i said anime)   and they didn't say anything so I kept explaining how its Japan animation, etc . Then in the end I said "" I'm suprised I though you would know about hentai since your both of your son and daughter watch it"" . I didn't realize it until later that day what I had said instead and all i wanted to do was bang my head against the wall.",22May2020,2
126,"In my early teens, I thought that my dad was trying too hard to be a funny guy and connect with us and usually felt ashamed when he says dad jokes when my friends are around, but I always loved him and appreciated that he is always here to support us. Months ago, I was walking with my dad and he said a joke, not bad one but not a good one either, and I thought that he actually wants to be close and there is no reason to be ashamed, that's how dads are. We started talking more and found out that we have a lot more in common.

My mom, she's a wonderful woman, and she is one of the main reasons of why I love animals so much. She used to catch frogs and grasshoppers when she was a kid, so I thought this may be something genetic. She also read her zoology textbook when she was pregnant with me, so I thought this might also be a reason. But then she told me a few months ago that she used to put an ant on my hand when I was a kid so I get used to handling animals and bugs. IDK why but I felt happy about it. Also, I had a project of building a skeleton and she was so excited to help me, I never saw her that excited, it warms my heart.

That made me love my parents even more and view them as humans and not just parents.

**TLDR:** I love my parents and now I love them even more because we have a lot in common and I see how much effort they put in raising us.",22May2020,1

128,"I'm 34, about to be 35 and my whole life, every relationship I've ever been in, I've tried to foster open communication because I know that is crucial to a relationship surviving things. I've been there, I've tried to be that open and communicative person in the relationship in order to work on the relationship however, no matter how hard I strive to be that person, I never find anyone willing to give me the same. Does this quality actually still exist in other people? Because I'm starting to lose hope that I will ever find someone that compliments me. I wanna give up. And the sad part, I'm currently in a relationship I really want to work on and I really want to flourish with this person, but they don't seem to see that I need help for us to both get by in this world.

131,"I've been on reddit for almost a decade as a user. A few weeks ago, I decided to apply to be a mod on my main account, cuz I wanted to give back. I got accepted to mod for two big, active af subs.

Well. I can't say I'm surprised, but I am truly humbled by the quantity &amp; fervor of people channeling their pain through trolling. It seems compulsive, honestly. All day, trolling others in threads, trolling the mods... look at their history, it's just rage for days... shitting on people they claim to hate, complaining, bitching, calling people names. As Eckhart Tolle would say, pain bodies everywhere, out here feeding thru the ether, helping each other grow.

But y'all don't know who you're dealing with. I SEE you, haha. I understand pain. We all have it in us to be trolls, to channel that energy outwards, especially when triggered. Trolling or not, most people expect others on the internet to be horrible to them. Most people expect unkindness. Sincere compassion is the last thing anyone's prepared for. So here's what I do: I just refuse to get angry, and respond only with kindness. It's not that hard---the more someone acts out of unkindness, the more compassion I feel for them. Often I feel pity (but of course I don't tell them that, cuz that'd be mean).

I try to stay present, I respond with as much sincere, thoughtful, resolute kindness as I can muster. And while I don't always respond, but if I do, I am kind. It doesn't always work, but it works more often than it fails. My goal is to remain a slowly advancing, impervious phalanx of militant compassion.  

So. Before I forget. And before y'all tell me that I'll never be able to sustain this, that everyone on reddit is scum, that they'll grind me down eventually... note. to. self.

**You know who you are. When they're deeeep under your skin, and all you wanna do is permaban &amp; block some prick who's just slid into your DMs after tracking you down in a rage, cuz they simply can't stop talking shit &amp; you're their target... pssh. Remember who you are. Don't let *anyone* trick you into making *anything* into a problem. I'm here, your better self, and I got your back. Look through their bullshit, locate their humanity. Be a channel of the peace. If anyone can do it, I'm certain you can. &lt;3**

P.S. I do kinda understand why mods get such a bad rep. So... while I can't change other mods' behavior, I *can* promise that some of us are decidedly *not* punitive tyrants. Some of us really do give a shit about being fair. Some of is are doggedly committed to remembering that we're all just people out here, tryna get by. If that's not a reason to be compassionate to others, I don't know what is.",22May2020,2
