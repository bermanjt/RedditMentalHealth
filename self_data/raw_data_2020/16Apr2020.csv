Bit of a late post as was busy playing WW2 zombies.

I felt positive vibes all round today as I prepared myself to have another positive day.

Lockdown is starting to bug me now as I used to love going to see movies at the cinema.

Had no tears at all today over her which shows I am moving on.",16Apr2020,3
1,"R/Coronavirus doesn't give a shit about mental health, so I'm posting  this here.

It seems the CDC is oblivious about people's mental lives. I have social anxiety and it's been going through the roof since I can't see my friends anymore. I'm stuck with my toxic mom. I was hoping to move out next year, but I guess I can't if my job is in jeopardy. Governor Murphy of NJ believes we will be living through a world of FaceTime, masks, and testing upon every entry into establishments forever. This is ineffective for me. I've tried therapy and counseling through FaceTime. Not only is it ineffective but my mom humiliates me whenever she finds out I'm seeking mental health because I don't trust her (I don't).

I guess I can forget about making any progress in my life. So much for 28 years.",16Apr2020,1

Wow, I’m so excited. I have plans to move out soon (fingers crossed that doesn’t fall through!!) and I got accepted into my top choice x-ray school...my life plan is finally starting to go my way",16Apr2020,8
8,"Im not just your regular kind of jerk. I mean I am an all out despicable disgusting human being.  You know maybe if I took a second and calm down you wouldn't hate the world so much.

Maybe. I dont know though, I can't take a second to calm down. Action must be taken. I have too. I cant stand by idle as these women continue to not sleep with me.

Who can blame them? Im not disgusting physically and this isnt a pity party. I am a gross emotionally.  No woman wants a man who could do the things I do to women. Its awful. What's worse is my behavior will continue, because it doesn't matter.  

I've had very hot girlfriends and im just mad that the girlfriend ive had for the past 5 years isnt hot, stinks, and is fat.  Its like shit, what did i do to deserve this?

I did alot. For many years I treated women like nothing more than a cum rag, to a guy. He doesn't understand how hurtful it is to a woman to be treated like that. A guy would like that. So it doesn't make sense to him.

I now understand that.  Ive been treating my gf like shit for years. Its awful, i dont ever call or show affection, i dont go over to her house, i dont even know her birthday.  

Then why.be with her?  Cause im human and a male and unfortunately that means i just cant say ""hey you"" okay.   Doesnt work like that.  Females could never understand.  

Its the exact reason im cheating and not breaking up, its not like i can pick who i cheat with. I have to work on a bitch for weeks or months to get in.

So you women think all guys are jerks who just want to use you as a cum rag. But you dont think for one second, not one second would you dare put yourself in a guys shoes.

You are an accomplished woman, nice house, cars, kids, etc.. but no dude is fucking you.  You dont get it but you just keep on.

Years go by and no dude is still fucking you, you are very attractive, clean, dont have bad habits like drugs, alcohol, or gambling. Your shit is together but still after thousands of guys you messaged not a single one of them wants to fuck you.

You start to get frustrated and send out messages you would never normally send out. Hit on guy well well below your league and even those guys arent interested.

What do you think is going to happen?  You think you are still going to be just as motivated and happy years from now? Of course not.  

So how dare women make things like niceguys and creepy pms.  The funny thing about that is yall were talking to them to begin with so whats that say about you?

I send out very articulated messages bases on your profile, but see, as a guy i have zero way of knowing if you are a bot and even if you are a girl then youll drag it out a few days and turns out you are a prostitute.

So what fucking hope is there?  I dont have game perse, but i know how to attract. Im good at what i do and i know women find it attractive. And i know women are attracted to me. I know because one girl who isnt bad looking at all. Alot better than my gf, offers to fuck me on a daily basis. But if i was going to drop my standards i would just stay with my gf.

Another hot girl i know is into me, but see im old enough to know not to bring up sex.  Im making it her idea.  So im just a friend, waiting for her to outright ask like the other girl.

Thats the only way ive ever picked up women, them asking me out after working with them for a few months.  Its been years at the job and nobody yet a couple of close ones, but they quit.

The only girl i ever met and slept with online is my gf, maybe a few others before her.  So i only have experience in real life.

Ive read all the tips, my profiles have been hilarious to prestiged and i dont get it. Im only on one app currently and one site, but ive only met prostitutes and bots on the site so im trying bumble.

I put on there i have a gf who im not seeing. Im honest and upfront. It doesnt matter anyway. I dont really care, i could send out messages to every girl on the app ""wanna fuk?"" And get the same results.  

There is really no reason for me to be nice and considerate, you arent fucking me anyway? You stupid bitches think all guys are just rude by default. Its years and years of being considerate and waiting and not getting, its total bullshit.  Yall would be a billion times worse.  A billion times worse if the roles were reversed.

I tried thinking about not being superficial, look where that got me. Fucking some fat stinky ugly chick for years and still treating her like a cum rag.  Even my hottest gf told me she was only with me cause my size, i didn't realize at the time how i was being a jerk and just using her.

Ive known but it never really sunk in.  Im a jerk. Like a total a hole.  How in the world can i expect any girl to love me if i am just going to treat her horribly.

Most people wont understand this but i had a gf before and i took her to plays, bought her flowers and day retreats and fancy restaurants and that jazz, like alot. I probably was a monster to her.  That doesn't sound right to maybe alot of you, but despite the fact i did all those things, i still just wanted sex all the time and not even letting her come onto me.  

I was an idiot then, now and days i let them come onto me, but they arent. And i get it.  Im a monster, i really a troll. There is some guy who is ugly, dirty, but more than willing to treat women with respect, yet women will fuck him over me in a heartbeat.  

There is good news though.  Even better news actually, because even if you were ugly physically there are still alot of things you can do to make yourself more attractive, but you are only ugly on the inside.  The good news is i can change that.

And its not even that complicated, its not easy though.  You have to come back and remind yourself what an a hole you are all the time.  You have to remember you are the problem.

Sure probably alot of women on those apps have problems, but so does everyone. Nobody is perfect.  The deal is some people on those apps are alot better at dealing with those problems.

Im doing what I can to deal with my problems right now, by letting myself know that im the one holding me back. Im the one who had to explain to me why my life is like this.  Nobody else. Just me. Im responsible for everything that has happen to me and I always will be, so if thats going to be the case. I better make damn sure im responsible for what happens next.  

Im not putting up with my shit anymore, period. Im done with my bullshit ass attitude that has done nothing but hinder me.  Why do I want that? Cause it feels good? You know what else feels good? Blowjobs from really hot chicks and good news for you, you had them before, which means you can have them again.

If you had the right damn attitude you would still be with that hot chick. Thats your fault homie, yours. So remember your shitty attitude is the reason you havent had some hot chick blowing you the last ten years, okay?


Are you happy about that? You cool? 

So here's what i want you to do. Take 3 days off of the apps or dating site take that time to think about your insecurities.  

We are going to make you flawless. It will literally be impossible for an attractive woman not to sleep with you at some point in the near future.

But you have to do what i say, you have to. You must or I can't make any promises and its on you. You will be the reason.  

1. Take a few days off and let your dick heal, even if you could hook up now some girl would think you have a disease cause you masturbated so much your shit is bleeding. Okay. Dude. I know you need to be prepared and im glad, but chill a little.

2. Dont ever again in your life treat a woman with any type of disrespect, any. At all. That means anything. She didnt say thank you? You want to lash out, IDGAF then you must not want some hot chick fucking you, remember that when you are ready to be an a hole.

3. You dont realize it now but over time as you are more reserved, your mindset will actually change too.  Eventually you wont even have to remind yourself, you'll naturally let it roll off your back.  

4. Dont do the dating apps, you already deleted alot of them before and you dont need but one good one and thats it. Do your profile funny and complete and then leave it alone. If they hit you up you know what to do, but dont hold your breath on that stuff. Matter fact, dont even think about it, just do your swipes and go on.

5. You've been doing good, keep it up with the asking for numbers, you know what you are doing, your problem is your attitude and whether you realize it or not these women sense you are a monster. You are disguised very well, but they sense it, underneath.  Youve been wondering why you haven't been getting any? Cause they know idiot.

6. Wtf is wrong with you.  No seriously wtf? How are you going to know your attitude directly is effecting your life and ignore it.  Really? Stop man. Now. I already told you im not putting up with your shit anymore, you punk ass.  What you gonna do? That's right ignore it and work on being nice. You want that pussy dont you? Yeah, remember that shit okay? Dont forget you want that pussy bad.

7. Listen man, you do what ive said already and you and I both know you are going to get it soon.  You must do what I say though, the second you want to think out sex or objectify and disrespect women, the deal is off.  Off completely, thats your fault, dont fuck up.  

8. I told you it was good news, you already know they are attracted to you, every woman smiles when they see you. You are blessed, so what is YOUR complaint? You talking about how easy these women have it, you fucking piece of shit ugly troll mother fucker.  I know you dont see it, but they do.  Remember thats what you prayed for, for every woman in the world to love you. I gave you that and YOU WANT MORE? DUDE dude.. what can I even say? You are lucky God loves you so much because you are so greedy and ungrateful. Remember that. You are the blessed one, dude you really have no idea how many people would kill to look like you? Any clue? Talking about your smart, stupid mother fucker.

9. So you remember this shit. You do this and we got a deal. The woman of dreams, you have no idea, she is coming for you, she's attracted to you, because she sees what you will become.  She sees you changing and making a legitimate attempt to change for the better. She'll see that even though you are changing because you want pussy so bad, you are changing none the less.  Thats all she wants to do man, is make you into a better man. 

10. Dont get mad, remember if you dont do what I say deal is off and its your fault, dont say nobody told you. Now relax a few days let yourself heal completely and im going to remind you that she likely has slept with a million guys compared to your pitiful 20 or 30. Shameful.  So you mad about that? No? Good, you do want that pussy.  So even from now until she meets you, a few days, shes going to bang out 50 dudes, you mad? No? Good.  Even while yall are dating she decides to bang out other dudes, did you make it clear you wanted to be exclusive? No? Well then you cant be mad can you? Good. Your calm. Even better.  Im telling you man, aint nothing hotter to a woman than a bad guy changing for the good moreso, because of her.",16Apr2020,0

Being depressed your entire life is weird. You just take the world at face value, and you grow up thinking that everyone sees the world how you do: bleak, overcast, and filled with guilt and shame and sorrow. ""However, isn't that just how everyone sees the world?"", you think to yourself often, as you seethe with hatred towards your reflection in the mirror. 

But life goes on, and that is just how things are. You see people around you succeed at school, succeed at relationships, and you just generally think that other people just are smarter and know what's going on. You blow off work, and simply just can't even fathom how anyone puts in more than the minimum effort to do anything. Middle school comes and goes quickly, and then so does high school... and then what next? My parents wanted me to go to college, so having never truly thought about what I wanted, that is what I did. I was going to work in a lab, become a chemist, and live a ""normal happy middle-class American life"".

Except... wait. I had NO idea how to study or to put effort into my work, or any notion of even needing to balance my social life with my classwork, and everything fell apart my sophomore year.

I talked to a school counselor, who immediately told me to go see a psychiatrist to get tested.  I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADHD. I had to undergo a rigorous 5 hour screening, and in the process was administered a series of tests and I was shocked to discover that I was not dumb.

No, I had found out that the reason that my life had always just been the same dull, gray color,

This sounds like were things began to turn around... but no. I was sent into a deep spiral of depression from the realization that on paper I was smart but as pathetic as it sounds, I genuinely could not fathom having to put effort into everything I did, for the rest of my life.

Fast forward, until 6 months ago, I broke up with my ex of 2 years and had to move back in with my parents after she claimed the apartment we shared as hers (long story). Then, I got kicked out of school because my grades were so bad, then I got arrested for a marijuana DUI about a month or two after being home, and that is when I finally hit my all time low.

I had several days in a row where I came very close to just ending it all, and I shit you not, the only reason I really decided to stay on this Earth was because I thought my parents would be responsible for paying my student loan (I know now that they are released upon death), but just that thought of leaving them and then making them pay my debt every month well into their retirements was just too much to even imagine.

So I started therapy, and around the same time started thinking about my relationship with the world. I realized that on some level, I had never considered that each of our own realities are essentially fabrications of approximations of the true nature of life, and thus you inherently can somewhat control reality as well. So I began telling myself every day that I was smart, capable, and could get through this day without wanting to give up entirely under this mountain of student loan debt and overwhelming despair. 

I started intentionally pretending to be more confident than I actually was, and eventually those habits became patterns and those patterns became routines and then about 3 months ago, I realized that my feelings of inner turmoil and anguish had begun to subside. 

I had never really acknowledge that I had these constant feelings of discontent, and I then began to target these now that I wasn't so depressed that every single day was unbearable, just some days. The thing that you tell yourself over and over while depressed is that you aren't good enough, when the only person in the world who thinks that is you. You tend to get trapped in your own head and create these crippling cycles of your supposed misfortunes to come. 

I'm not here to tell you some bullshit about the power of positive thinking, I'm telling you that to get over depression, you have to do something that makes no sense to your depressed brain: accept that each day is unique from the last, and that not only can unexpected things change your entire world in the snap of a finger, but that you can take part in that change yourself.

So where am I now, and why did I write this?

I wrote this because about a month ago, I started trading stocks. I cannot believe this is legitimately the final sentence, I get to write in my life's journey so far, but I by accident have come across a 100% legitimate, if undervalued way of investing. I did not want to say this until after I was done testing, retesting, and racking my brain for logical fallacies, but today I found undeniable proof via a somewhat similar strategy that I have just set myself up to make about $800 a week starting off (with the $500 in my investing account). I may never have to work again, and if I hadn't stuck around for this long, I wouldn't be writing this right now (and you wouldn't be reading it either!)",16Apr2020,5

18,"I'm 13. Right now school isn't a concern but that's what I need help with. I'm an asshole, and a clown. Since I'm picked on by kids because of my looks I'm constantly defensive and cranky, and I've made some bad first impressions because of this. I'm normally a nice person at heart, and every time I accidentally be mean I instantly regret it. However, I don't say sorry for some reason.That's all there really is to the asshole bit, so now to the clown bit. My whole school life has been defined by me being a class clown from the start. I was a good student in elementary yet I was always the ""funny"" kid (I know this sounds super egotistical, sorry). Since it was so easy to make kids smile, I just stuck with it. But now my sense of humor has changed, and so has everyone else's, and I'm left hanging. It's a habit. I can't stop. Every interaction with my friends is comedic, and they don't even laugh half the time. They're starting to talk to me less. All the bond and similarities we had were comedic related. Since I have bad internet, and I don't have a PS4 or a phone or whatever it is they have, only the short time at school is what I have. Since nobody likes me other than this group of people because I'm an asshole, I have nowhere to go. And they notice that. My friends are still only friends with me because they pity me. Its sweet, but it kills me even more. It proves that I'm such a prick. I've kinda accepted that there's no going back now, and no way to fix my relationship with my friends because of limited communication, and with everyone else because middle school kids are ruthless. Anyways, I still want help from you guys to help me stop being such a clown and resorting to humor to build relationships. My mom says we're moving soon anyways so hopefully I can start a new life.",16Apr2020,1

I have always been afraid of streaming because of the stigma about female gamers. We don't get a lot of respect in the gaming community, unfortunately. I'm not overly feminine (don't wear makeup or act like a lady lol, I'm just a lil ugly too haha probably a solid 4.5 below average looker), and a lot of female streamers get back lash for tons of stuff like being/acting ditsy or feeling like they have to flash the cameras or wear revealing clothing to get subscribers or donations... I'm definitely afraid of that same backlash...

27," 

Hey there, I'm going to start this out with I've had a rough year, a really rough year. It all started last year in March when my grandfather passed away. It had been tough watching the once valiant man who basically raised me wilt with time. I knew it was coming but that didn't seem to stifle the blow. Three months after that, after dealing with it just being my mother and I having to pay the bills and me taking over all ""manly"" responsibilities, the school I had gone to for three years shut down. The place where I made my greatest friends, people I consider brothers, the place where I finally embraced who I was and also showed me my purpose in life. Was gone. I ended up going to the high school I did music and theater through, I still had friends there, but it wasn't the same. All while that was happening I had to worry about college and more importantly paying for it. I've never really had a lot of money, and it became one of my biggest stressors trying to make my dream school an actual reality. I had such big hopes for myself, I knew if I tried my best I'd get in, and I did! Though soon after I found out that reality had just cashed its check for me. There was no way I could go without having debt hangover my head for the rest of my life.

So I started applying for scholarships by the bucketful. I ended up getting two! That same week I started getting really close to this girl I met through my new job. She was astonishing and way out of my league, we got really close, and I think I fell in love. Everything was on the up and up! Sure my schoolwork took a toll on me, and I knew that I most likely couldn't go to my dream school, but I had this one ball of happiness that made everything worth it. Then my mom went into the hospital.

I was freaked out, and since I really didn't have anyone other than my mom to lean on emotionally, I texted the one person who I thought would be there, and she read them, and then left me there. We didn't talk much after that night. I ended up having to sacrifice a lot of my savings for a car to keep the bills at bay. After my mom got out I started slipping. Because of the hit my savings took, I couldn't get a new car anytime soon, and having conflicting schedules with my mom I couldn't work as much to regain them.

Last week I was notified out of 400 scholarships I had applied for, I got none. My senior show, my senior prom, and a bunch of other things have been canned due to COVID, along with my social outlet of school. My mom and I have our first vacation ever planned for the end of May, it is the light at the tunnel for all of this. If it goes I don't know how'll I'll handle it. My friend told me life is graphable as |y=(10Cos(5 π)+x|, and it's always going up but will always swing down in places. Hopefully, this year is going to swing up once summer hits. Just maybe.

41,"I moved to a different city away from my family at the beginning of December to start college again after having taken a year off. Classes started up in January and for those first few months, everything was great and I had just started to make some friends and was on the verge of getting an actual social life, but then COVID-19 came along and shut everything down.

Now, I have no one to talk to. I live a few hours away from my family. I'm stuck in my apartment with a roommate who's been ignoring social distancing orders and bringing tons of people over, while the roommate I actually liked decided to stay with her family until things start to get back to normal. I'm considered high risk so my anxiety has been terrible, I've had legitimate anxiety attacks a few times over the past month. I've always been awful about working from home and the only thing that kept me motivated to keep up with school was when I could work from class or stayed after school in the library to finish my work. Just anywhere but my room was an ideal place for me to work. I was doing so well for the first few months and now I just feel awful because I've barely done any school work in the past 3 weeks, and I'm afraid I'm going to fail now. I already flunked some classes the first time I tried to go to college a year ago, which is why I decided to take the year off to figure out what I wanted to do. Now I just feel like I'm about to disappoint my family all over again and I don't know how to kick myself into a work-from-home mentality. I know if I work really hard for these last few weeks that I can pass but I just can't seem to get myself to do anything.

Overall, it just feels like I was FINALLY getting my foot in the door in life for the first time and now it feels like life just threw me back to where I was before, and my mental health is as bad as it was a year ago. I know this all just sounds like a bunch of rambling but I really needed to get this off my chest.",16Apr2020,6
43,"I'm sitting in my living room right now bawling my eyes out. I had the most terrible 2019 and I really wanted this year to be better. But its not.

I started last year having my heart shattered into a thousand pieces by who I thought was the love of my life. He showed me all the happiness and joy in the world and then just decided he doesn't want to be with me and that we were just incompatible. Two years to to realize we're incompatible? I believe I am a pretty strong person and came out of that well. I blocked him from everywhere and stopped talking to him while he incessantly tried to keep contact. And I got over him. 

I got better and then I started speaking to guys again. I wasn't looking for anything serious from the get go and just wanted to put myself out there. But this new guy kept making things more and more serious until I started taking it seriously too. I find out 8 months into the relationship that he had a fiance all along and broke his wedding off while we were still together. He continued seeing her for 2 more months even after calling the wedding off and I had to find pictures on his phone in Feb 2020 for everything to unravel. He blocked her after getting caught and begged and pleaded for me but it didn't matter at that point.

I have somehow managed to get dumped and cheated on in the same year. I have been fine for the most part but it is all coming back now and I'm realizing how utterly sad and lonely I am. I cannot stand to see any couples on Instagram and Facebook anymore and feel so bad for myself that I have gotten to this place. I have actually grown up getting a lot of attention from guys and still do, but it has really gotten me nowhere. And I'm sick of hearing from people that I'm too good and so strong. So what? How has it helped?

I feel extremely suicidal this evening, like I have failed everything. I know those guys and how they are making me feel is not at all worth losing my life over, but I feel pretty damn worthless right now.

47,"I originally posted this to /r/badroommates but honestly I feel like this is more of a bizarre tale than a bad roommate tale, even if it's a bit of both. Figured you lot here might like this.

--------------------------------------------------------------

I live with my cousin Chris, and I'll be honest with you, he's weird. I've posted about him a few times before, if you'd like to get caught up on my problems living with Chris you can do so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/did78l/my_cousin_moved_in_with_me_his_health_problems/) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/evn2av/my_cousin_moved_into_my_flat_and_now_refuses_to/). You can even read about his belief in black people being immune to the flu in the comments of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/drtwp6/my_flatmate_has_the_flu_but_im_vaccinated_am_i/).

If you don't feel like doing your research on Chris, I'll just brief you on him right quick. I originally wouldn't be so forthcoming with this information, but at this point I don't care. If he finds the post then so be it. We're both expats working in Belgium, I'm from the UK and he's from Suriname, where my parents are from. Chris grew up on a ranch and with ridiculously strict parents, even by Surinamese standards. When he first moved to Europe, he underwent a radical change. Tasting freedom for the first time, he became a wildly degenerate party animal. He also now fancies himself something of a Black Nationalist, much to my annoyance as I'm constantly being reminded of how Eurocentric I am, and how every time I criticize him I'm looking at him with my ""white eyes"" or it must be the ""white in me,"" despite us both sharing the same white great-granddad and being roughly the same amount black otherwise.

This particular issue started two weeks ago when I hung a Dutch flag (the aforementioned great-granddad was Dutch and Suriname is a former Dutch colony and still has a heavily Dutch culture) on my bedroom door. Chris demanded I take down the flag as it represents the subjugation of our people and that I might as well hang up a swastika flag while I'm at it. I would have happily moved the flag into my room, but the swastika comment was just so silly I didn't want to at that point.

A few days later, I decided to get groceries for my long-distance girlfriend. I came back the same night, as it isn't that far, and Chris was asleep. I woke up the next morning to hear Chris speaking frantically on the phone in Dutch. My Dutch is not very good so I didn't pick up a lot of it, but he was complaining about me, first complaining about my flag, but then outright lying. The gist of it was that I wasn't letting him move out because I was threatening to get him fired (he works for my dad) and that he didn't have any savings left because I stuck him with a bunch of costs out of nowhere (haven't the foggiest where this even came from). Some more minor lies came out about the how he's responsible for the cleanliness of the flat, but even though he's never cleaned, I let those go as I don't really care if whoever he's speaking to thinks I'm messy.

I came out of my room, and I've never seen a black man turn white so fast. He instantly got angry with me, telling me I lied about being away for the night (I never said I would be). I asked him what he meant about me threatening him and sticking him with costs, he just said that I don't speak Dutch so I don't know what I'm talking about. He ignored me the whole rest of the day.

Alright, I'm getting to it, I promise, just let me tell my story.

The next day, he told me he was going to stay with his sister in Amsterdam because he was so disgusted by my Dutch flag... [hold for laughter]. He said he'd be gone for the next two weeks, and that when he returned my flag had better be down.

At this point I caved, as funny as this has been, I reckon it's just not worth the tension. I put the flag inside my room and went about my day.

Two days later I woke up to see Chris' lights in his room on. I yelled in ""Alright Chris, the flag is down, can we be mates again now?"" No answer. Whatever, he's still mad, no problem. An hour later I get a text from Chris about some random thing, and he slipped in that he was still round his sister's. Weird, but okay, I guess he left his light on and I didn't notice. The next day I woke up to see Chris' light off. Alright, now he must be home. I shouted into his room to ask him how his sister is, no answer. Am I going insane?

Yesterday I opened the fridge to see a six-pack of Heineken in there, hadn't noticed that before, it's not like Chris to leave a beer unopened, very strange. I came out of the shower to see that a can was missing from said six-pack. At this point I'm thinking Chris has to be home, so I shout into his room again... nothing. Now I know that either I'm going mad or he's pretending not to be home.

As I'm writing this, I've just woken up, I've been lying in bed for an hour or so, it's about 09:00. My bedroom door is ajar and when I began writing this post the room outside of it was almost completely dark. About 15 minutes ago, as I look up from my phone, I see a beam of light coming from under Chris' door to slightly illuminate the hall outside my room.

I banged on Chris' door right then and shouted ""Chris, are you okay?"" Still nothing. I get a text from him a few minutes ago: ""[His sister] wants to know if you've gotten her a birthday present."" I yell ""No, not yet, Chris"" through the wall. Seconds later he texts me again ""Are you just going to read my message and not respond?"" I text him back that he knows what I said. He read the message and didn't respond.

Sorry for the ultra-long story, I'm working maybe 2 hours a day because of the pandemic, I've got all sorts of time on my hands and wanted to tell some people this story, and I figured you lot might get a chuckle out of it.

48,"I’ve been wanting to lose weight, for a long while actually, but especially during quarantine. My biggest issue however has been myself. Anytime I think about exercise or anything it’s like I shut down. I don’t know if it’s because I’m just lazy or what. I mean I love going on hikes and kayaking and camping. But just thinking about going on walks, jogs, doing sit-ups, or anything of the sort just completely makes me want to never leave the couch. I know a big part of it is that I’m a little scared that even if I try my hardest I won’t be able to lose weight, or stop myself from eating things that are unhealthy that I enjoy. I feel like it’ll help my self esteem and confidence if I lose weight, and I have a fashion sense that I’m not currently comfortable trying to pull off with the way I currently look- not even close. But I also feel like I’ll never be able to be happy with myself even if I do lose weight, I think I’ll just find a new thing to hate about me.",16Apr2020,1
50,"Hello everybody,

I hope you are ok (cause I don't believe anyone on this fucking planet can look at itself straight in the mirror and seriously say ""I'm totally fine"").

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm not fine. But I think I'm probably doing better than most. My life is at the same time chaotic and balanced, I mean I feel like everything in my life is extremes. Extreme inner chaos and peace. Extreme outer chaos and peace.

&amp;#x200B;

About outer world, well, no need to talk more about the current world we all live in. But how fucked up a world is when billionaires are asking for donations? At the same time I'm at my parents home in beautiful, peaceful Normandy and the only noises I hear outside are singing birds in the sunshine.

&amp;#x200B;

About inner world, I had to deal with so much rejection in my life that I worked tirelessly on improving myself. The problem is that I don't see what I can improve in myself alone anymore. Yesterday I deleted all my social accounts cause I realized it wasn't bringing me anything anymore. I can try to be the funniest, the coolest, the saddest, the meanest, the most creative ... all I get is to be ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

I even deleted my websites and YouTube/Vimeo accounts cause I thought to myself :

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, if you guys can't love me the way I am, you don't even deserve to enjoy my work"".

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, I know it sounds pretentious for a dude with a sketchy username. But it's not like I care about what you think about me. Cause I'm already facing judgment every single day.

&amp;#x200B;

So, all I'm thinking about is getting my revenge. But don't worry. I digged so much into me that I can't even feel hate anymore, seriously. I have anger but no hate. Cause now I can understand why I've been rejected so much in my life. It's about ""alignment"", like I'm never really aligned with anyone, so I suck it up, get back on my feet and start walking again like a star, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Like everyone should do.

51,"I’m 22 and I want to say I’m pretty much ready to go. Not suicidal but if I just stopped being around one day and no one really ever saw me again I don’t think it would matter that much. Even if I did and I don’t think I could ever bring myself to do it cause of what it would do to my family, I don’t think it matters in the grand scheme of things.  Like sure everyone would be sad for a maybe a month but that would be it, from my beginning to the time I was gone that would be my life story. 

It really hasn’t been a horrible ride I’ve done a lot  good things and met a lot of amazing people. I’ve done a lot of volunteering work through scouting and have tried to help a lot but in my head I really don’t see myself amounting to that much. And it really pisses me off hearing people say that I’m gonna go out and do great things. Im not smartest or really that fairly good at anything but a lot of people around me seem to have that down. Ive never been jealous of the people around me, i want everyone to succeed in their own way. I just don’t think that’s in the cards for me.

I’ve switched majors more times then I can count and I still don’t think I’ll be happy with what I’m doing now. One of the main reasons I’m going to college anyway is because I don’t want to disappoint my parents. They’re the best people I’ve ever known and I’d hate myself forever if I ever let them down. But I don’t think college is for me. I really don’t see myself being good at anything.

In highschool I was at least half decent and sports and damn I was strong back then. But I’m not gonna be some triple A athlete that times long past. 

So I don’t know what’s the point of going on really. I’m not that good at much, no girl really stays attached to me for longer than a month so there’s that to. I mean I feel like anybody else would’ve already done it but here I am just going through life. I hear these are supposed to be the best times of my life but I’m ready to go.",16Apr2020,1

im at college now, 18

i was lowkey the most popular one, at first, (its my first year) i knew everyone, was literally the only one talking at first, i introduce people to each other and shit

basically, the way i am, is that i might lose enthusiasm in shit. like, the time went on, i got bored of this shit, the people i see. and i just get quiet. i think that its out of desire to create something new. i lowkey just stop talking, not in a weird way, but it confuses people, and thats the point. i like it. it creates ""drama"" (not really, but you get the point)

now, the bad thing is it that people lowkey forget the way i used to be. they like : ""you so quiet and socially reserved"" when lowkey i used to be the one to introduce them to each other.

now, i dont see it as an achievement or anything like that, but i find it kinda disrespectful

yes i get it, they might have really forgotten it, but dunno

also another bad thing

things really start to cool off.

when i used to be the main one (again not saying it in the prideful way) now im on the sides. and lowkey, i start to feel shy

it causes frustration in me and angers me

conflicts arise, i start being rude

53,"So this morning I woke up to the biggest puddle of dog piss I had ever seen. My floor is made out of tiles so the piss just kept flowing trough the rills and covered more area. I let my dogs out the night before like I always do so I have no ides why this happend (hasn’t happend since my younger dog was about 9months old). The piss alone was bad but I also had my bumbag that I use on my hikes laying on the floor, a 5 euro bill and my precious stuffed animal which had fallen on the floor while I slept. All 3 were soaked in piss. Fucking horrible start.

Then now my weed man just told me that he’s dry (even though he told me yesterdam thag I could come pick some up today). The power is out for some god damn reason in my entire street and with corona and all I’m sure it’s gonna take forever to fix. Worst part: my mom and I went shopping for the next two weeks yesterday and our freezer is filled with veggies and meat and bread and all kinds of stuff that’s slowly defrosting now in the summer heat without power. I’m also starving and the only bread I have is frozen but the oven doesn’t work because the power’s out. Feel me?

Plus we just found out that a man in my neighborhood died of corona yesterday (he was 97, don’t worry). It’s sad because when we were all younger as kids we would often go to his house (giant lot with his own tiny forest) and he would do these tree workshops with us and stuff, it was really fun. He was kinda known to the whole town as the friendly dude who makes his own honey and teachers nature stuff to kids. He also had goats, which we kids were allowed to milk and feed and stuff.

55,"Hello, I just want to share my experience. I am not educated in this field, but this is the only encounter I had with a healer who does not sit in a hospital. When I'm (scarcely) sick, I seek the help of a doctor or take the medicine I have at home, but others may seek an alternative healer (maybe also when traditional medicine fails them), so please respect that :) Now onto the story:

When I was 10, my family went on a holiday to a pretty village under the mountains. One day we decided to go to a nearby town, because there was a swimming pool and it was hot outside. Now, it is a bad idea to run around the swimming pool and my parents constantly reminded me of that. But being the dumb kid I was, I did just that. And then I learnt why they were always saying that. I slipped and fell backwards. I hit the back of my head really hard on the floor and all the surrounding people were suddenly quiet and looking at me. I was shocked. My mom came to me, helped me stand up and then out of nowhere a man came to us. He didn't say a word, he just cupped his hands over my head, closed his eyes and for good 30 seconds he was moving his hands over my head. Then he left. My mom and I exchanged this 'what?' look and we continued our day as if nothing had happened. I was okay and interestingly I didn't feel any pain at all on my head.

Back when the  Kinect came out for the Xbox 360

Used Kinect as at the time it was all I could afford 
And they gave me one but when I got home 
My brother help me to put it in the Xbox 360 I had at the time and we found out that they left a wire out when they give me the used Kinect so the next day I went back to see if they would refund me for the used Kinect and I was told sorry we cannot take back used Kinect so at the time I left GameStop upset and angry and still holding a Kinect I didn’t want so I went to the nearest bin I could find and put the used Kinect into it and walk away

61,"I remember being younger and hating the idea of being friendzoned.  Most men can relate, like ""im not trying to be your friend, im trying to be your lover""

A man doesn't think like a woman, he doesn't realize it a good thing to be friends with women.  As many as you can.  A man thinks improving his physical attributes that will turn a woman on. It'll help, but she is not a dude, so she doesn't think like you. So why are so many dudes placing emphasis and focus on physical things when women are attracted to the personalities?

As if being short, ugly, bald, or any other physical attribute is the reason women dont sleep with you.  Its because you dont realize your mindset is the reason they arent sleeping with you.  

You treat women like objects, trying to up your count, disrespect, when all the while had you stopped and treated them like, I don't know, YOUR GUY FRIENDS you would already be sleeping with them.

Stop thinking if I do this maybe she'll fuck me, or if I do that maybe.. no maybe you should call her dude and bro and let her call you one night, stupid.

And the women need to stop thinking all men want is to fuck and thats it.  Actually most dudes, like yall, want a relationship, they just dont know how to be in one.  Yall make fun of them in creepypms and niceguys, but the text shaming isnt any better.  

They are just dudes that want some but dont know how to go about getting it.  The whole friendzone mindset is holding them back.  They dont get the more female friends you have the better chance you have at one of them calling you up.

It’s kind of sad that I’m turning 21 whilst the world is dealing with COVID-19. But I wanted to use this time to say that I feel sorry for anyone who has an upcoming birthday.

The whole COVID-19 situation has changed the way we live as we know it. We can’t do the things we love, and go to places we wanted to go, and we can’t celebrate or go out with our friends.

And it’s a lot harder to celebrate your birthday when you haven’t got any friends at all. That’s the case with me, I was bullied in school, was homeschooled from the age of 13 which meant I didn’t get the chance to meet a lot of people, which led to me having no friends.

If anyone else is in the same situation right now, I feel for you, and I hope that you happen to meet some really nice people one day so that you can celebrate in an amazing fashion.

I know something's wrong with me and I'd like to know what. I plan on seeking professional help after covid ends, but for now I'd really like to hear different perspectives from you all. I'm asking this because something clicked inside of me today, after remembering that my best friend once asked me ""are you sure you don't have ADHD or something?"" and my bassist sometimes jokingly (?) says I have asperger's.

It's quicker if I make a list of things I do and things that happen(ed) to me, in no particular order:

* I'm a master procrastinator. I'm currently finishing university 2 years late because of this.
* I have a deeply rooted routine and I find it super hard to break from it.
* I'm intelligent, intuitive and creative. I play two instruments and I'm learning a third.
* I have zero passion in the things I'm studying. My real dream is playing music my whole life, but I've never taken steps to enter the music world/business out of fear. A fear of failing, a fear of making a leap of faith, a fear of leaving everything behind and making sacrifices.
* I tend to dabble in pleasant activities instead of working my ass off.
* I run away from responsibilities.
* I get sidetracked and distracted easily.
* I'm fidgety and I can't seem to stand or sit still.
* I'm unreliable because I don't seem to care about the outside world.
* No man is an island, but I think I could be one, until I feel lonely. Only then I feel the need to ""connect"" with someone, but as soon as that is satisfied, I have no problems becoming an island again.
* I reply to emails and texts after weeks or months because it's like I'm afraid of something. Of a flowing conversation maybe? To be covered in responsibilities or things to do maybe? To potentially have awkward moments in the conversation maybe?
* I have little to no empathy, I suck at reading emotions and providing emotional support.
* I'm super rational, to the point where someone once compared me to a robot. Not good.
* I have like five people whom I really consider ""important"" in my life.
* My best friend once told me I'm emotionally stunted.
* I have low self-esteem and I don't think highly of myself.
* People say I'm modest, but I'm afraid it's not true modesty.
* My current girlfriend told me I'm devoid of emotions, things aren't going that well now.
* I was over-parented by my mother as a child, she was suffocating, anxious, controlling and always did things for me instead of teaching me how to do them. She was always proud of me as if I were some kind of perfect child, had enormous expectations of me, was always worried that I would engage in ""bad"" activities (""bad"" was a very loose term for her, everything was bad apparently), banned videogames and swearwords in the house, still treats me like a 6 year old child. She is passive-aggressive and always guilt-trips people. She gave me a lot of attention when I was little and was always careful not to neglect me, but at the same time lived (and lives) in her own world and it seems like she always cared about her ""reputation"" and how others would see her more than anything else.
* I never seriously confided in my parents, not because I don't trust them, but because I have a weird relationship with them, as if they were my teachers and I were their student (they're both teachers btw).
* I'm afraid of being abandoned in relationships, to the point where I blurt out promises and excuses and bend over backwards in order to take the relationship back to a ""stable"" situation. Then, when I'm comfortable, I tend to slip right back into my old behaviors.
* I'm anxious and I tend to get needy and possessive as soon as someone I care about pulls back.
* When I'm out with friends, or at a social event, or even at a family reunion, I drink a lot. I never get drunk or embarrass myself in front of others, but I keep filling up my glass, I drink more than I should (unless I'm the one who's got to drive home), to the point where I'm usually tipsy before the second course is served.
* Sometimes I get really horny and masturbate a lot of times a day, for days and days. If I don't control myself, I might find myself browsing porn websites for hours on end.
* I'm really good at adapting to new situations.
* I'm really good at breaking habits, IF my habit is out of reach. Out of sight, out of mind works really well for me. I might spend a whole day on reddit, youtube and facebook, but put me in a room without devices, and I'll gladly spend a week there without complaining. If there's no alcohol in the house for a month, I won't drink for a month and I won't crave it. Same thing for basically anything else (except music).
* I have a weird sense of humor and I'm capable of adapting to different conversations, unless the topic is football or some other boring shit. I could easily spend hours talking to a wide range of different people with different personalities.
* However, I immediately notice if someone ""resonates"" with me or not. It's rare for me to find a person that ticks all of my boxes. If they don't, I'm still nice and respectful, but it will be harder for me to ""let them in"".
* I'm a people pleaser, I find it hard to say no.
* I suck at putting up boundaries.
* I find it hard to open up to people.
* I never speak up for myself, thus building up resentment over time.
* I bottle everything up and after months and months I explode in an unpredictable way.
* I haven't cried for years.
* My best friend told me I'm aggressive and I have a hard time managing my anger.
* My girlfriend told me I sometimes get passive-aggressive.
* I lose contact with most people. I either stop replying or I don't check up on them.
* I sometimes feel empty and like a failure.
* I've never been suicidal.
* I feel like I really need to grow up and become a man, but it's easy for me to relapse.

If something else comes to mind, I'll edit the post.

To counter some of this bad stuff, I've started a daily plan. I have a bunch of actions I'm going to carry out EVERY DAY, like meditating, exercising, doing an act of kindness, studying, etc. For now it's going well and I'm feeling a sense of fulfillment and purpose after doing these activities.

Still, before I go to therapy, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks in advance.",16Apr2020,1
71,"This will be a long one. It’s something I need to get out because quarantine has me thinking a lot these days and I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been really close with one of my best friends for about 6 years. It was to the point where whenever we were in the same state, we would see each other every single day. We were like family in a way. 

My friend really loves to travel and so do I, so we had been talking about maybe traveling over last summer. I decided I was going to take a trip to Russia for an acting program. I was super excited, and it was a summer program that was open to people from other universities. I convinced my friend to come on the trip too, and we were talking about traveling to some other European countries after the six week program. We were both super into going to Iceland together for the first time, which is an important detail to understand why I was so hurt by everything. 

It turns out I wasn’t going to be able to afford to travel more after the program and I told her that. She was pretty upset about us not being able to go, and I apologized but told her that we could travel together the next summer after we both graduated (which looking back on it wouldn’t have happened this summer either because of Corona, but obviously I had no way of knowing that then). I also reminded her that we’d get to spend six weeks together in Russia. I could tell for a while after she was still upset about not being able to travel but as the trip got closer that seemed to fall away.

Fast forward and we’re in our first meeting for our acting class. Friend and I are feeling awesome, if not a bit jet lagged, being in Moscow and meeting our teachers. We’re all waiting for our translator to arrive and when he walks in the door I am immediately smitten. I think he’s one of the most handsome guys I’ve ever seen. I mention so to my friend, who remarks that she doesn’t see what I see but to each their own. 

As the days go on and we work with him more, I gradually find myself starting to get a crush on him. This really freaks me out because it had been a long time since I’d had feelings for someone, and so I confide in my friend why I’m freaking out about this. The last person I had intense feelings for turned me down, and started a years long relationship with my best friend at the time. They were always incredibly physical in front of me and it really hurt me because they both knew that I was trying to get over my feelings for him. Not only that, but my freshman year of college I was sort of starting to like this guy who I invited to my birthday party with a bunch of my friends. Not long after I told him how I felt and he didn’t feel the same way; I come to find out he’s trying to date one of my friends who he met at my party. That was easier to get over, but it has made me terrified of catching feelings again because my biggest fear is that those situations will just play out all over again. I will be forever doomed to fall for people who I’m not good enough for, but my close friends are. I know there’s nothing I can do about their feelings for my friends/lack of feelings for me and I don’t hold it against them but it’s just really messed with me up to this point.

So I explain all of this to her, and she tells me that I have nothing to worry about because she has no interest in him whatsoever. She eases my fears a bit and then we move on. I get up the courage to talk to him one day to ask about recommendations for bars/restaurants, and he ends up joining us. This kickstarts our time together, and for the duration of the trip i see him and spend time with him about every single day. My friend is there every moment, too. 

It starts getting to the point where I’m really falling for him and I’ve been talking to my friend about him all the time because of it. It was exciting and scary for me to finally be able to feel these feelings again. One day we’re sitting in a park by the dorms, and out of no where my friend starts drilling me on what my intentions are. I mention that I’d like to tell him how I feel, but because of the fact that he’s our translator in class, I don’t want to put him in an uncomfortable position professionally speaking. She asks me what would my goal be in telling him, and what I would want out of it, if I just want a fling or what? And I mention that I wouldn’t be opposed to a fling while in the country, but that I really feel something for him and would be willing to try a long distance relationship. She tells me that’s unrealistic and not attainable, and it rubs me the wrong way and sort of puts me down for a while, but I move past it.

We’re a couple weeks in and the three of us are like peas in a pod. We’re inseparable, we go on walks until curfew at the dorms most nights, and we even pull a few all nighters outside of the dorms to hang out with him at parks and just spend time together. Never once was I able to get time alone with him but I didn’t think anything of it because we were all friends, and knowing our time together was limited, I wouldn’t ask my best friend to give up time with the friend we had quickly become inseparable from. She asked a few times and I said no, that if I needed the alone time to tell him my feelings I would let her know but that I was probably going to wait until classes were finished just in case it would make him uncomfortable. She constantly encourages me to tell him my feelings anyway, but I decide that at least waiting until classes finish is better. 

During all of this, oftentimes after we all hang out together, she complains that she thinks he doesn’t like her. She says she feels like the tag along friend and that she thinks he’s rude and doesn’t like the way he speaks to her at times. I try to reassure her that he doesn’t mean anything by it, he’s the kind of up front person who you would know if he didn’t like you, and he wouldn’t bother to spend time with you if he didn’t. He also is the kind of person who doesn’t realize how his tone of voice comes across, but that he doesn’t mean anything by it. Still, for the duration of our trip she constantly says she doesn’t like his attitude and that she feels unwelcome around him, but the three of us continue to spend almost every moment together. 

In our alone time, she lets me confide in her everything I’m scared of. I tell her all about my feelings for him, the things I find wonderful about him, the things that annoy me but that I can’t help but find endearing regardless. She still says that I should tell him my feelings but that it makes sense to wait until after we no longer have a classroom relationship. I tell her all about my past experiences and why they have left me so scared to get invested again. She listens and responds and makes me feel fortunate for having someone to really open up to about it all. 

One night we’re going to see a play and my friend and I have been talking on our walk over, and she mentions to me that she that she finds him physically attractive. This throws me off, as she had said many times to me quite the opposite. I understand that people can grow attracted to someone they may not have been attracted to initially but this came out of no where for me. As we’re waiting to go into the theater, she says that if things don’t work out or if I decide I’m not going to make a move, that she might try to sleep with him. This sends me into a panic attack because I can feel history replaying all over. I feel all sorts of horrible things and I can’t focus at all during the first act of the play. I leave the play at intermission to get some time away from her and take the long walk back to the dorms. I go to a friend in the dorm and he helps me get through it. 

The next few days are very strained between my friend and I. I’m taking my anger and hurt and sadness out on her but I don’t have the balls to tell her the real reason because I’m worried I’ll look like a paranoid freak. Looking back on it I know it was wrong of me not to tell her the truth and I regret that. I tell her it’s the stress of the program, and mention it also has to do a bit with the guy, but I don’t say that it’s directly because of what she said to me.

Things go on and we’re coming to the end of our classes. Right after classes were to end, we were taking a week long trip to St. Petersburg. He wouldn’t be going with us, and even though we were both sad about that because we’d gotten so close, I thought it would be a good time to work through my feelings and decide if I was going to tell him how I felt when we came back. 

On the train ride to Petersburg I noticed she was messaging him a bit, but I tried not to focus on it too much. We get to St. Petersburg and the city is absolutely gorgeous. Our days are filled with tourist stuff, and it was all optional so there was a day or two where we decided not to join in because we were so exhausted from classes, and also while we enjoyed Petersburg, we both missed Moscow and we missed being with him because we would be leaving Russia soon, and didn’t know when we’d see him again. Our time with him was limited and we would rather spend our time with the people important to us than seeing palaces. 

One night while in Petersburg, we’re up late talking and I mention to her that I’ve been thinking and that I was planning on telling him how I feel once we got back to Moscow. She immediately tells me it’s a bad idea and I feel like I have whiplash. A week ago she was telling me I should be honest with him about my feelings and now she’s coming up with every reason she can why it’s a bad idea. I tell her that I’m going to regret not saying something to him, and that at the very least the closure will be worth it, but she argues back that I could ruin my chances with him by telling him my feelings so close to when we’re leaving. She says that it would be better to wait until I have a chance to come back, and to tell him then. That doesn’t make any sense to me, because in that time he could meet someone else, and if he didn’t feel the same now then I wouldn’t be hung up on wondering what he would have said if I did tell him. She won’t let it drop and just keeps repeating that it’s a bad idea. I finally say that I’ll reconsider and the whole situation leaves me feeling really anxious. 

We move out to the hallway of the hostel we’re staying at, and continue having conversations about how we’re going to miss Moscow immensely and how happy we’ve been here. We talk about how lucky we are to have made a friend like him and how upset we are that we’ll be leaving him soon. She makes this remark to me that is super vivid in my mind now: “I’m so glad that I don’t have romantic feelings for him, I can’t imagine how you must be feeling about leaving right now.” On our way back from St. Petersburg she is messaging him one on one a ton, and it starts to freak me out. I feel like a crazy person for being upset about it, because she told me nothing would happen. But I can’t help but notice how much more he seems to message her and how little I’m comparison he talks to me. 

We return to Moscow and spend our last few days with him. On our first night back from hanging with him, my friend complains to me again that he was rude to her and that she doesn’t feel like he actually values her as a friend. I talk her through things and help her see that that isn’t the case. By this time I had lost count how often she would complain about his tone or the way he said something. I remind her about the good things and how he can be, and we go to sleep.

We leave two days later. I don’t tell him how I feel and to this day I regret it, not because it would have changed anything but because it might have saved me a lot of heartbreak if I had. In the end it was my choice and my mistake not to tell him how I felt, and I can’t act like I own him or anything; everything that happens from here on out in regards to romantic relationships happens in part because of his feelings and I recognize that. But I won’t forget the fact that the biggest reason I didn’t tell him is because my friend talked me out of it.

On our plane ride, my friend says she left a sweater of hers behind and that she would need to get it from him somehow. She jokes that maybe they’ll just meet up in some random country. A few hours pass and that joke turns into her saying, “So, me and (Guy) might be going to Iceland together.” This is upsetting to me for the obvious reasons. She says I’m of course invited and I tell her that there’s no way I can afford to do that, that’s the whole reason we weren’t going to Iceland in the first place. We haven’t even landed back home yet and she’s making tentative plans to travel to Iceland in a few weeks.

This sends me into an anxiety attack when I’m home and I end up confiding a lot of this to my mom. She and I have never been particularly close due to some issues in the past, but for the first time I feel like I can tell her everything. The one good thing to come out of this is that my mom and I have become closer. She thinks it’s sort of nuts that a 20 year old woman would go meet a guy she’s only known for a few weeks, alone, in a foreign country. I see where she’s coming from but explain that we spent all of our time there together and became way closer because of it. I tell my mom about my obvious fears, that something will happen between them because I didn’t say anything to him, and that I’d like to believe my friend wouldn’t do anything but the whole situation has me scared. I explain to her how this is the most I’ve ever felt for anyone before, and how I was scared that everything was going to happen all over again. We end the conversation with her saying she’ll consider helping me pay to go to Iceland with them as long as I have a set plan to pay the money back afterward.


The next day, my friend says she has something to tell me and asks to come over. I say sure and don’t think anything of it until she’s sitting next to me on my bed in silence and not looking me in the eyes. And then she says “(Guy) told me he has feelings for me”. I would like to say I took in the news and handled it well, but the moment I opened my mouth I immediately started sobbing. I felt like my insides had just been ripped out. To this day, I’ve never cried harder in my life, because my worst fear was playing out again right in front of me, only this time it was ten times worse.

My friend didn’t even wait a whole day before telling me that even though nothing was set in stone, she was still planning on going to Iceland with him unless I asked her not to. And then she said the words to me that immediately made me realize that I would be crushed no matter what: “If I don’t go on this trip, I just think that I would resent you”. We had countless discussions about it. Every time I told her that if she wanted to go then she should go, that I didn’t want to be the reason she chose not to. I asked her why she felt she has to go so badly and she said “I just want to travel, it’s an opportunity to travel and I don’t want to waste the rest of my summer”. I knew this was a full on lie, but I didn’t call her out on it. I asked her why it had to be Iceland, why couldn’t she wait, we were supposed to go to Iceland together for the first time and now she was planning on going with the man who I just spent the last 6 weeks confiding in her all my feelings for. She just said that we could go to Iceland together some other time. 

A day or two later is when she finally was honest with me and told me that she has feelings for him. She explained that Iceland was just for two weeks and that she just planned on exploring things with him there and then going back to life without him when she came back. This hurt me even more, because she knew how badly I was hurting from him and from the fact that they were going to Iceland, and now she’s telling me that it’s only for a two week fling? That all of the pain I’m feeling is worth two weeks of “what happens in Iceland stays in Iceland”? 

In all of this, her biggest question and concern was if we would still be friends. She didn’t want to pursue anything if our friendship would end. I told her that things would change for a long time and that I would need time and space to be better again, but that I didn’t want our friendship to end either. I told her that I would try my absolute hardest to make sure our friendship didn’t end but that I couldn’t guarantee it would be the same.

She went to Iceland with him. They both had a fantastic time. They stayed in touch. She went to Moscow and stayed with him over her fall break. They got closer and closer. They went to Thailand together. He came back to LA with her. I thought I was okay until he visited me in my hometown, and I realized that I was not over the whole situation and I was not over him. It’s been a few months since then. My friend and I had a conversation and she apologized for a lot of things and I apologized for a lot of things. We both acknowledged that we handled things wrong in the situation. She apologized for telling me that long distance relationships were unrealistic, considering she is currently in one with the guy I’m still not over. I’m still a little bitter about the fact that she said that, I won’t lie...

The whole reason I wrote all of this out is because quarantine has left me with nothing but my thoughts and feelings and I realize I still have so many negative feelings toward her after all of this. I have been trying to move on by focusing on my school work and being in plays and doing internships and therapy appointments. But I still feel so deeply betrayed by her. I fucked up and made mistakes, and I know I can’t expect her not to pursue someone that she’s interested in and who feels the same about her just because of me. But I think what still bothers me so badly is that I feel lied to and manipulated by her. If she had been straightforward from the beginning and told me that she was interested in him too, I still would have been hurt as hell, but it would have been better than what happened. But her behavior was so strange the whole time we were in Russia, and then she told me to my face that she would resent me if she didn’t go to Iceland because of how it would make me feel. 

She wants to have everything be back to the way it was. Honestly I just wish it was too but I don’t know how. I want to stop being so angry and bitter at her all the time. I want to stop having feelings for the guy and just see him as a friend. I logically understand that nothing will change by me being mad at them. The only person I’m hurting with these negative feelings is myself. But I don’t know how to let go of them. I want to be able to forgive her and move on, even if I feel like I can never fully trust her again. But I don’t know how.

Because of quarantine this has all been on my mind a lot lately and I feel like I can’t get it out of my head, so I feel like I just needed to post it somewhere. It’s a novel length post and if no one reads this far then that’s okay. I already feel better having it out.",16Apr2020,1
77," 

I've decided, made up my mind, I will do it once I get my family well settled. We are financially good so that's a relief.

I've been really unhappy, just can't find any motivation in life. My family made me break up with my gf of 3 years because of different religion. I did and do everything for my family. They've been using me my whole life for their gains but I never uttered a word because I love them. But now it's just getting too much, I've lost identity totally now.

I have a masters in Aerospace and wanted to do PhD but they didn't let me. I helped my sisters get jobs and took care of them and their kids and now they have started to take advantage of me.

I'm not posting it here to get attention or to make people beg me to not do it. I just wanted to post it so I can have some final discussions or take advice on how to do it the best way etc.

So if you've got something for me, I'd love to hear it.

Please please please don't try to stop me just so you can feel good about yourself doing a good deed.

I love you all.",16Apr2020,3
78,"I am grieving the loss of something that I have loved with all my heart (we're talking about a hobby, not a person or relationship). I think about it everyday but I just lost interest in it and it no longer makes me happy. I am having a really hard time coping. It was the only thing I cared about and now I lost it. Some people say that, with time and space, you can relearn to love something again but I highly doubt it. Every time I lost interest in something, it never came back. Once you've 'checked out' mentally, there's no way back. I really wish it wasn't true but that's the way things are.

79,"We’ve been trying to get pregnant for over a year now. It’s starting to cause, or surface,  problems. 

My wife seems to blame me...I feel blamed often about things but that’s another topic..
I think I have a physical issue. I’ve been scared shitless to find out for a while. I’ve told her several times about the issue. I’ve told her my fears. She’s watched me ball over in pain. She’ll say “aw I’m sorry” and the occasional, “you should get it checked out”. It feels like she’s always saying, “get over it”.

I gave in to my fears for US! and I just got health insurance 2 months ago. Let’s just say I’m paying out of the ass now for coverage and I’m easing in to my new doctor before I ask how my balls are looking. But I am trying to be proactive. For us, again. Just to note. 

Then the hits about the fact that I smoke weed came in. She thinks maybe that’s why we’re not getting pregnant. She’s told me she’s worried about me smoking when we have kids... I don’t remember giving any reason for anybody to think I would not make the right choices in my life. I’m proud of where I’m at and who I am. And all of choices so far. Spending my life with her has been one of them until recently. 

The final nail in the coffin was last night. She brought up the idea of me stopping smoking while we’re trying because she thinks it’s why we’re not pregnant. My response was “ok, we can try that.” She mentioned just eliminating that, and I said “yeah that makes sense.” Apparently I’m an asshole. She literally told me that she wanted me to respond in a specific way with specific language. I asked her if she was literally looking for me to respond exactly how she was reiterating and she said “yes”. Meaning the only answer acceptable answer to her was in exactly the same tone and excitement as her sarcastic reiteration. Wtf is that? Am I programmed robot? Is she? Are there really people out there that can’t be satisfied unless someone does or says exactly what they want to hear in the exact tone that they want to hear it? It’s all getting a bit too needy for me. And blame-y and just fucking tired and old. I feel like I’m in high school sometimes. 

Full disclaimer as well: 
Easter morning I found a letter in the works, in the nightstand. To me. “I only think about myself!” It hurt. A lot. Again, I’m selfless to a fault. I’ve been doing things for years that I would never do for me, for US. I have often felt like I’ve made sacrifices, from day one, and she has not. Now she’s asking me for more. I might be at the end of my rope. 

*In a nutshell, my wife is not the most emotionally supportive. No lie, I feel like shes down right selfish sometimes. We’re not getting pregnant and it causing big issues with our trust, language and support. I feel no trust and little support. And the language going around is toxic and finger pointing at best. I’ve been sacrificing since day one and trying to make things work. 
Any ideas or thoughts would be so appreciated. If I’m an asshole, someone tell me. I’ve been feeling lost. Thanks for reading!",16Apr2020,0

95,"What is right in terms of subreddit rules and what is morally right are not always the same. Hypothetically speaking as an example, if you are banned from /r/politics or /r/news just because you posted a normal article link or a comment critical of China's incompetence in handling the virus but a mod with pro-China sympathies abruptly bans you, is that morally right?

Another example would be going into /r/sino and debunk some of their dangerous disinformations in a gentlemanly behavior, only to get banned.

In a wider degree there are cases where breaking the law is the only right action. If the law or rule says you have to kill all people that are of a certain skin color, then it'll be great if sufficient people stand up and say that such law is not only silly but immoral. Breaking into a cabin if you are lost in the woods while starving and hypothermic. Same can go for stealing a vehicle or break a mandatory COVID 19 lockdown to send a critically ill person to hospital. This is called the defense of necessity.

Throughout my entire time on Reddit I noticed that more often than not default and large subreddits would be prone to such an abuse save for some lucky exceptions. More likely than not if you are banned from these places then there are no ""alternative subreddits"" available to replace the function of the old one from your perspective, in terms of size and topic.

Rules are useful to maintain social order but they do not necessarily dictate morality and/or justice. If you want to blindly follow it history has proved you can end up on the worst sides of humanity. If you pay attention to history class chance are you'd learn that rules and laws aren't made to make the world more just and right; they're meant to make governance of a given area or whatever easier. I'd argue that the same can also apply to Redditsphere.

Provided that you refrain from performing further offense in the given sub and stay low whenever possible I don't think it's wrong to evade a ban from a given subreddit if it is a product of an abuse of power in the first place. Reddit usually compare your accounts IPs and user agents upon a ban evasion report so it's better to do it via a public network or a VPN.

I've noticed that most of Reddit are cool with bans no matter the reason so this can qualify as kinda an unpopular opinion.",16Apr2020,5

Everyone is talking about how crazy they're going - I find it annoying. In my darkest moments I'm happy about COVID19 - at least now everyone has to be as miserable and lonely as I feel. But this is wrong and harmful for me and anyone around me. I don't really believe it, anyways, I'm just a hurt little man who lives in social isolation. I pick up pathetic ideas to justify continuing to wallow. 

It's my fault. I made awful choices my entire life and now I get pissed when things don't go my way. How delusional! I've accomplished nothing because I've aimed at nothing. I have nothing because I did nothing. Very simple. There's a million things I want to say here, so much to work through to get even a little health mentally, but basically I'm just deciding to do something meaningful with my life. I've gotten to where I can take responsibility in life, finally, but that's not enough on it's own. It's time to take action. Some day someone will miss me when I'm stuck at home!

I already know basically what to do. I think we all do - exercise, eat healthy, find meaningful relationships, and find a source of income I can be happy about. Hell, I've done all these things before! I'm on a journey to figure out why exactly I dislike myself enough to not do the things I need to do - and how I can start loving myself. It's cliche but meditation has been a wonderful place for me to start before. That and some good books that help explain why things are the way they are goes a long way.

But let's also establish policies allowing people to choose to self-isolate until this thing is over.

States in the farm belt are beginning to reap the rewards of their refusal to implement safety measures as cases spike.  

When this is all over, and the virus has ravaged the idiot-fringe, the more intelligent among us can come out and put this country on the correct path.  The social darwinists among us will be culled, and they can celebrate their success.  The rest of us will be safely at home watching in horror as the ""I would gladly watch my family die to protect liberties I can't even define"" cohort get exactly what they ask for.

This can continue forward as well.  States that don't want to invest in education, healthcare, infrastructure, etc. don't have to.  We can lower federal taxes, giving states willing to tax room to do so.  This means that welfare states that refuse to tax their citizens can't just steal the tax dollars of states who are.  The current system allows people to avoid seeing the consequences of their party's policies by covering the deficits through theft of other state's incomes.  Under a more federalist system, they will have the choice of moving to states that act rationally, or staying in their self-imposed shit-hole.  At least that way there would be options, rather than depriving rational states the ability to build out quality social systems.  Hell, rational states could even implement moving assistance for people who want to move there and get quality education / jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's begin from when I was a kid.

I used to go a Good school from my kindergarten and I still remember someone my innocent days how fool I was and other kids with me.. how I felt inferior to toppers etc. One of the moment I still remember that I had an argument with a girl in class 1 (after ukg) where I was accused for 1st time in my life. The teacher supported her and I was still processing what the meaning of the word she's accusing me with.. (contents of this darama irrelevant so skipping it).

Fast forward to 4th class ...I had an issue with walking at this age and started limping with pain at left thing joints.. it stayed for few months so people started observing me and found it was odd and my father thought I was acting.. well it turned out to be orthopaedic problem due nutrition/blood circulation issue and I was treated accordingly which means I had to drop out school during middle of my Unit-2 exams. So good bye friends and school...after skipping 4th class being treated I joined Directly 5th class in different school now I become more inferior and everything was new took hard to get used to here and fast forward 8th class 3 months in and Financial crisis so dropped out. Self studied at home and join a tutorial for my 10th. Then I missed diploma seat because of unawareness of what councelling was lead me to Join Intermediate Vocational (course AET) and here I took sometime but was fun felt like Freedom after 10th studies become easy a bit..

I was shy never talked to girls but there'll always be someone who start conversation in a Co-education. I haven't been in such environment from last 3-4 years like real academic so was shy but opened up later on I got appreciated lot by many people and used to participate in debates and won.. things felt better.. if someone initiate I can pick up but can't initiate conversation with others who I haven't spoke... I got crush on the one who talked to me first time from opposite gender and that first years people started rumours about us but we were just friends but something made her runaway some false accusations so broke up even though never been together .

2nd year I lost trust in friends mostly girls I thought everyone around are liers and enemies except my Best friends.. I got another medical issue here appendix even though I have never had any unhealthy stuff you can say I follow certain warnings.. the cause is indefinite can happen to anyone so got over it still completed my studies properly.. I tried to confront her but it never happened..

Then directly went to 2nd year diploma..

My maths is bad and this means diploma was tough for me choose mechanical and no girls here and in 2 years I completed it but by final year I still got a backlog of maths of 2nd year!..

In a supplementary exam cleared my maths. But a year got wasted here and my first childhood crush a distant relative got married  at this point I only talked to her when we were kids.. never after just encounters during any family events.

Destiny made me Confronted my 2nd crush and we are friends again but not like before.. you know if a string is broken it can't be attached if it's attached then there'll be a knot between..she never gonna know my thoughts I decided it and it was foolish of me anyway I realised during my 2nd year of Intermediate.

One of my friend met me in a bus added me to a group of my 1st school. My childhood memories and friends I had bet to recognise me in a school photo by my name.. none did I silenced few people I already know so others could guess..

Someone lost the bet I made them change the dp for a week that's how I found my current 3rd crush.. this around the time I joined diploma... I remember the small chats She's cousin of the girl I had argument in my 1st class and it got to point I couldn't make a move because opportunities ended I felt like I was introgating and introducing myself after that nothing I can do as I don't have options left or guts to ask anything more.

The school group died out later on but I used to say happy new years or so once that number had no what's app anymore.. so hello darkness my old friend now after 3.5 years due to Lockdown and stuff someone created new group and added me so its back to the point which triggered me again got her new number and I'm kind of person who genuinely hates TikTok and photography etc an absolute introvert... She's quite opposite.. I hate everything about her but I can't get rid of my feelings.. it's consuming me I'm not sure should I try or not.. I'm thinking a lot of possibilities and reality.. it's out of my league.. I know that she has good reputation among those school friends and her family is rich mostly... Our family has gone from a high point to low because of my unfavorable situation which also due to accusation on my father and he had to defend his reputation.. which flipped the table..

I honestly don't know the impossibility of finding a genuine love but I'm overwhelmed by Something that I don't recognise and it driving me nuts.. I console many people they say thanks later on if it helps them for someone it clicks immediately... Now I don't what happened to me . I'm thinking of multiple tangents unwillingly..

I know it might not be possible for me to win her that 99.99% or even 100% this still doesn't stop me to give up.. I want to express and I'm not capable of expressing.. I'm waiting for a click to get out of my fogged up mind.. or whatever this is.. and can't afford psychologist so any Genuine answer from whoever understood my blunder of text here would be appreciated!

117,"My mom was concerned that she might have COVID-19 because she has a high fever, so she went to the hospital to get herself tested. However, my mom said that the doctor that went to see her was acting strange. The doctor said, “Yes, you have COVID-19.” But no tests were made to confirm that. The doctor then said to stay home and she tried to immediately discharge her. My mom said that she doesn’t live alone, and the doctor said whoever lives with her probably already has COVID-19 too, and that we all should just stay home and rest. My mom felt it was strange that the doctor, without any tests, would say she has COVID-19 and still try to discharge her as if it wasn’t as serious as the news says. She also thought it was strange that the doctor was not even wearing a mask or gloves while going to my mom’s room and confirming that she has COVID-19. The strangest thing was that the doctor said there are no testing for COVID-19 being done in the whole nation, and she literally told the nurse to discharge my mom because she has “other important patients to take care of.” So I am a little confused at this doctor’s attitude. Does anyone know why the doctor acted like Coronavirus is not a serious issue? I thought we would be safe when we went to see a doctor for these difficult times, and we always watch the news to see any updates of COVID-19 cases and deaths...

121,"I recently got dumped after almost a year relationship. Before i get bashed and yelled out because one year is not even that much, let me tell you about myself. I used to occasionally date only for sex and hate myself, without being in contact with my feelings and be a very misanthropic person. My ex-girlfriend was one of those people that always smiled and could cheer you up whatever your mood was. For her i was able to grow up as a person and a human being. I slowly fell deeply in love with her after 3 months. Whilist i could tell you every single details of our relationship, i will only say that for weeks before the breakup we actually considered moving together. I was actually starting to see that person as the one that i wanted to spend my life with. Because of the virus she had to return to her family (about 630 miles from where we lived). Everything was smooth, we talked each day on the phone, joked and whatever long-distance couples do. Suddenly a night she called me and that's where things started to go down. She told me that she wanted to change her future career, that she didn't feel fulfilled and that she didn't want to be a dead weight for me. I told her that i loved her and that moving with her whatever the place was, it wasn't a problem for me, i'd have gone to hell and back for her. Long story short it seems that it wasn't enough. Couple days later we talked and she told me that she didn't feel the same way i did (i don't know if she said it just to ""make me feel better"" or force-cope with it). She was not my first girlfriend, but i'm afraid that she was my first true love.  
More than a week has passed and i'm stuck in a slow motion loop. I can't get out to run or do whatever activity because of the virus and everything seems empty and useless. I have no willpower to do anything. I feel this empty void inside of me like i'm useless and no one will ever love and want me again.

123,"I love skating and I am serious about that although I only skate for one year after 31 but I’ve already got some major accomplishment. And in last June 2019 I was going to L.A. Fitness in Stoneham MA to work out and improve my mussels of core and lower body. The first day I went to that gym I can feel some weird atmosphere like people are smirking at me which give me a thrill so I wear a baggy white tee the next day instead of the workout tank on the first day. And on the second day when I was in the locker room I can hear a white girl with a pony tail who’s not faraway from me with her friend talking very loudly said “You can’t look too easy so that guys won’t...(the rest are inaudible and I feel weird about that but I didn’t think a lot at that time)”. And the third day the same girl who’s skinny and with dark circles under her eyes, around 5’3”, blonde hair with dark roots standing beside me when I was changing in the locker room whispering beside me said “She’s here for sex” and I was like “ What’s wrong with you, and I am really not in the mood of talking” and just put the ipods in my ear and go. And the rest of the week are peaceful, I work out a lot and determined to shape my body into a standard skater’s shape which involves a lot of lower body workouts. 

And then the disaster begins at that Sunday afternoon, I rush into the gym to get some last-2-hour workout and I wear a “re:re:re party in the gym” graphic white tee for fun. When I start working out abs I saw a huge bald white or Hispanic guy passing in front of me and walking around slowly in Jeans which is weird because everyone else wears workout outfit and he’s staring at every one in the gym when he’s walking around and somehow it makes me feel that he’s looking for someone to fight with or showing his existence or something. And he saw me and looking at me and then walk around for a while and then went to a half bald guy with long hair and long nails and said loudly:“I’m not going to have sex with some chic if she’s looking at me” and then looking at me and I was like too shock to make any respond. My mom always told me that don’t talk to weird people so I just try not to get involved in anything so I didn’t say anything. And that half bald nasty guy which is his friend smile in a very gross way and that makes me a little bit scared too because I don’t know what kind of people they are. And I am a mother of a 4 year old and married for 5 years and I never, never expect people talk to me like that. Usually people are respectful so I don’t know what’s wrong with his brain. And the staff that works in the gym just laughed and seems very amused and he didn’t help me when the huge guy is still talking about me with his friends in the weightlifting area. To be honest why he just shut up and let me concentrate on working out and we all mind our own business? I was very annoyed because no one disturb me working out for skating! But I just remembered what my parents taught me “don’t talk to weird people” and I even didn’t looking at his face because I really want to keep a distance with any troubles like that. 

And I just went home and then come back the next Monday but the disturbs didn’t stop. Apparently someone said something to the people in the gym and they are all laughing at me and showing their abs in front of me and I didn’t expect that unwanted attention so I was confused and a little bit scared because I feel that they wanted to eat me alive! So What I did is that I write a complaint letter to the front desk to express my anger and demand them to let that huge guy to apologize to me. They checked the surveillance camera and they’re like “Oh that Reed(or Red I didn’t hear it clear) we know them let’s just ‘talk’ and see” and just let it go, and those guys continues to disturb me when I was doing late night workout as if I don’t have the right to be there past 8pm. I have to go to the ice rink in the afternoon and the summer course for architecture soon begins at that time so I was trying to figure out a way to work out at night but they just assumed that I staying late is because I want something and that skinny girl who bullied me in the locker room went behind me and call me slut and all I wanted to do is go home and cry—I really confused because I was polite and avoiding talk to weird strangers and totally don’t deserve that humiliation. Of course I was angry and let it out on Facebook by posting something(then deleted) but they insult me Frist and that makes me confused very much because I was just minding my own business. And then I just quit the gym and ask for a full refund of the initial fee and the front desk girl refused to give my money back. 

I really don’t understand why they don’t let me go even I always avoiding any form of contact with them. I am a perfect victim in this case because all my life I’ve only been with 2 men one is my ex boyfriend and one is my husband and I am a very conservative person and totally the most opposite of slut. And why they blame me instead of blame that bald guy? I didn’t do anything wrong. They’re like “it must be your fault, it must be you did something wrong”. No, I didn’t do anything wrong, and I dress probably, and I trained with concentration and determination, and I didn’t talk to anyone. I am a perfect victim. Even I am a perfect victim they still blame me. What happens if those who are not that perfect being a victim? Do they deserve that humiliation?

And why there are people feel so good about themselves? My husband is a MIT graduate, handsome when he was young and tall always, and I didn’t see him feel so good about himself that any women on the street looking at him and he’s yelling to his friend “I am not having sex with her!” And those who are cultured and polite and good looking, I didn’t see them feel so good about themselves too so I was really confused. Really. And I am starting to feel that it is because I am Asian.

124,"So this is my first post ever so not sure this is how it works or if I'm doing this right. I'm nervous to even post this because I don't know if this will help but I'm willing to try.

So my gf recently broke up with me about a month ago now. I thought we were great together because the first time we went out we just clicked. Couldn't get enough of being in each other's company. After our first date we just keep Looking for opportunities to see each other again and go out on dates. We went out a total of 7 dates and were super into each other. 

After a couple of weeks we decide to make things official. We were both genuinely into each other. Or so I thought. After only a couple of days she tells me she doesn't feel like a relationship is for her. She tells me that she's still not over her ex and that she doesn't feel as strongly as I do and that she feels more like friends. This really really sucked to put it lightly. We had so much in common. I liked this girl but she didn't feel the same way. This wasn't the best timing as well because just after this my job has been put on hold because of COVID-19 so I'm out of work. Not to mention the fact that I don't have very many people to talk to at the moment. Feeling lonely right now. 

It got me thinking about my last Ex because it ended somewhat the same way (Although we were friends for sometime, we ended up together for 2 years). I even had a dream about her a couple of nights ago. I don't wanna think about it anymore. I'm over her now which is why I started dating again. At least I thought I was over it until this dream came up. I'm just very confused right now. (This didn't get in the way while I was with the girl I recently broke up with) I feel like I'm doing something wrong but I'm not sure what it is. Sometimes I feel like I'm just not worth another person's affection because if they were as into me as much I was with them, I feel like they could've made more of an effort as much as I have. Both of these break ups were so sudden as well. 

I don't know what I'm looking for here by posting this. I guess someone I can talk to. I know that I'm young and relationships come and go, but I can't shake the fact that I don't think I'm good enough. I hope this post can help me somehow. Especially if I can get some genuine advice.

I have online friends but I'm wary of making new ones, there's so many ways to hide who you are online, which is a risk I don't feel good taking. Regardless, I don't have problems with my online friends.

It's in person that I can be a little cold and prickly (I've been told) and my attempts at being warm are overeager and put people off. I guess I don't have good instincts for this kind of thing. I make friendships and they fade all the time, not without effort from me.

I really feel like this is a skill best worked on in person, but, there's quarantine. I go to work as an essential worker but that's different, my coworkers have to act like they like me even if they might not (no idea).

128,"I'm a 21 year old American. I've never traveled outside the US and have barely traveled at all. I've only been on a plane for the first time recently and that was from Milwaukee to DC and back. I want nothing more than to travel though, and I want to plan and save up for a trip within the next couple years. 




1. First I love big cities. Chicago, New York City and DC are my favorite places I've been. I love the hustle, the crowds, the art, the events, the people-watching etc. I love how many things there are to do and see. I'm looking for somewhere that has at least one city in the maybe the 1 million population+ range. I want a city that's very artistic though. Since I'm a classical musician and art enthusiast I want to be able to see art exhibits, concerts, museums etc.


2. I love natural beauty too though, and being in nature. I'd love somewhere where I can get the big-city experience and with relative ease get to amazing landscapes and nature for hiking, camping, etc. I know those really contrast but I'd love to be able to experience both on the same trip


3. I love history and would love a country that has a long history I can learn about and experience.


4. I only speak English and Spanish. It doesn't have to be a country that dominantly speaks either of those, but somewhere that's at least somewhat accessible for an English or Spanish speaker.



5. Somewhere that's mostly fairly developed and safe. For my first international trip I don't wanna take too many risks.


6. I love food and trying new foods and want to experience it somewhere else in the world. 



Right now one frontrunner to fit the criteria is Germany. It seems like I can definitely get the experience of being in a historic and artistic big city, but then fairly easily access other parts of the country by train. I also think there's a lot of interesting history in Germany, and I know it's relatively easy to get around as an English speaker, and I'd be willing to try my best at learning basic German in the next couple years leading up to it too. I don't really know about the art scene in German cities or where is the best for it, but I know a lot of my favorite composers throughout history have been German. and I also don't know much about German nature or landscapes but it seems like there are some beautiful places. I also love German food and beer to death. 



Other places I've considered: France, Austria, Spain, Ireland, The Netherlands, Japan.



I'm open to suggestions though. This is something I've always wanted to do, and I want to prove to myself I can do it. I'll soon have my debts paid off and I have no kids or committed relationships, not in college yet, and have weeks of vacation time saved up at work. It just feels like something I need to do.

129,"Okay so obviously everyone has a lot going on right now. 

Personally, I was laid off my job due to the coronavirus and I've been having trouble getting my unemployment so far so I have no income. I'm isolated like a lot of people and have too much time with my thoughts. I discovered I suffer from abandonment trauma from my childhood (I very recently started talking to a therapist about this). 

My boyfriend (26M) and I (24F) have been dating for 3 months (friends for 10 years) and he comes over to stay with me as often as possible. Lately, being alone majority of the day every day I feel panicky and anxious. I want him here with me. I have been relying on him too much to the point where I'm pretty much a different person that when we started dating. I've spoke to him about my abandonment and originally he told me he wanted to be here for me. He has been slightly more distant since then and of course my natural instinct is to cling more and its been a never ending cycle the past few days. 

I sat down to talk to him in depth about what exact I have realized (me putting every worry, feeling, emotion on him and expecting him to make me happy is NOT fair), and what I need out of support from him to help me get though this process easier. I asked for good communication (I don't need to know a play by play, but if you are busy just say so and get to me later, or allow me to communicate my feelings without him being annoyed or ignore me) and for some extra reassurance every now and then so I feel that security with him. I feel like these are common things that are almost expected in relationships. He understood but told me he might not be able to do that for me. I asked him what I could do to make things and his life easier on him and he told me he wasn't sure that he didn't know what he wanted. I can't be mad at him because I put soo much on him. I told him that that was something that he needs to think about and figure out. He ended up telling me that we are okay and that we are going to be okay, gave me a few hugs, and he stayed the night over with me. 

At one point I got quiet, he asked me what was wrong and I told him I was scared. Again he told me that we were okay. I want to believe it, but the fact that he couldn't tell me what he wanted from me and our relationship I can't help but be scared. This was all last night. So today I haven't been texting him first or blowing up his phone and he's staying at his place tonight. I'm trying so hard to stay in the moment and remember that my feelings aren't facts. I know he likes his space and I'm trying very hard to give it to him, not just today but from now on. I think we both would agree that a fun, happy, loving relationship is ideal and I want us to get back to that so bad, that's how we were during our ""talking"" period (3 months) and our first month officially together. After that that's when I felt myself slipping back into my old super emotional almost controlling ways and developed an anxiety-attachment to him (it all goes back to my abandonment trauma). What can I do besides continue to heal myself to help him and our situation? 

TDRL; I recently and currently healing from abandonment trauma from my childhood and my anxiety-attachment is coming out with my current boyfriend (26M who has a “kind” avoidant style attachment) and driving him away. We've talked about what's going on, but how can I help him and our situation?",16Apr2020,1

I was just telling myself how my attitude was holding me back in everything, everything.  I forgot, I used to have a piece of paper above my front door so I would see it every morning on my way out. It said ""attitude is everything""

I had forgotten all about it.  I decided not to put up with my bullshit anymore and I fucking meant it.  I had enough of that life.

I even knew yesterday as I was telling myself my dream girl is on her way to me because she can feel im changing and its time.  Up until that point literally had the worst luck, but it was my shit gross attitude towards everyone.

So why since I genuinely feel im going to change, which I proved to myself today by enduring personal attacks and still keeping calm and composed. Since then, this woman im talking to seems extremely promising.  She is the one asking for pictures, shes also the one who is going to ask me over.  Why? 100% because I changed my outlook.  It was me.  Im willing to bet many more women will come onto me from here on out because ive made this decision. I really feel like that.

If you want to sling attacks at me, im pre apologizing for anything ive ever said that might have offended anyone.  Also though, I don't think anyone is more deserving of being degraded, belittled, and humiliated. I definitely earned it.  Again though, these are for me.",16Apr2020,1

143,"I've been going out with girls from uni, I've been going out with girls from Hinge, I've been going out with random girls from the pub. I've been on 15-20 dates in the past 6 months. Some of them were attractive, some not so much. Texting was mostly dead, but I managed to kiss a few of them on the first/second dates. My kiss to sex conversion rate is 0%. I only had sex once with the least attractive girl just because I wanted to ""break the curse"" (hadn't had sex in 5 years), and I didn't even have fun. I've been on a few dates with this girl, which I've kissed, and we call each other during the lockdown, watching Netflix or whatever, but she rarely texts me and takes hours to reply.

On the other hand, my flatmate was focusing on school 100% up until 2 months ago when he got Hinge, and started matching with some pretty hot girls right away. Because of the lockdown, he's only been on a couple of dates, but ever since he's been texting non-stop with 3 girls (one of which I went out with, and couldn't get out of my head for 2 months), and they've been sexting, sending nudes, the whole nine yards. 

How the fuck? My flatmate is pretty smart and fairly good looking, but a bit reserved, and definitely not someone who would start sexting. I'm either super dumb or super ugly. I've been working out 5 days a week ffs. What is it about me making me so unfuckable? Once or twice could be a coincidence, but there is a pattern shaping up... Thank god we're stuck at home, cause I'd have to slit my wrists if he starts bringing girls home.",16Apr2020,1
144,"I   don’t know  if this is the sub this  belongs on but I’m 16 living with just my mother who is very emotionally and sometimes (but rarely) physically  abusive towards me. I am majorly depressed and have bad social anxiety so I don’t really have any friends. I believe I have a bunch of disorders that are undiagnosed but I haven’t gotten the chance to be tested for them yet. This is not an excuse for my confession but an explanation of the circumstances surrounding me. That being said I have two guinea pigs I have been neglecting badly for their entire lives. I haven’t cleaned their cage in that time. My two guinea pigs are currently living in their own filth like actual pigs thanks to me. There are flies all over my house. Their cage is also safety hazard for them; my grandpa built it for them because the old one had an open top that my cat would climb into. The bulk of the cage is on legs so there is a place for storage underneath. This means when I open the door my guinea pigs could fall out onto the floor about two feet down and seriously hurt themselves. It’s happened once and my one guinea pig seemed okay but I’m not a vet so I wouldn’t really have known. I also don’t have a feeding schedule, I just feed them when they start wheeking and sometimes I don’t go to them because I just want to sit and suffer knowing what a horrible monster I am. They don’t get hay everyday like they’re supposed to either just when I remember to ask my mother to buy it. There are also some incidents in the past that I feel need to be brought up. When I was younger I used to hold them under their arms and then I’d stretch them into their backs until they started screaming. I always hated myself after; I did it because I was curious about hurting them I guess or I wanted to vent anger I had on them. I haven’t done that since I was 13 and I’ll never do it again. Another incident happened when I had one of them on my shoulder like a parrot and they fell and I think they may have broken their leg. My mom refused to take them to the vet. The last incident happened when I noticed some sort of scab on one of their paws. I was never in the habit of maintaining a clean cage for them (but I never left it dirty for whole year like now) so they often had dry poo on their nails which was very satisfying to pick off. I don’t believe this hurt them but they never should have had dry poo on their nails to begin with. So I thought the scab was dry poo and I picked it (he screamed) and his paw started to bleed. I got a towel and held his paw until it stopped bleeding and I thought he was alright. Today, I hate myself so much for so many reasons. I think about my guinea pigs everyday and how awful I am to them. I want to surrender them. They are old now (6.5 and 4.5) and sick because of my neglect. I am struggling with my mental health and I can’t take care of them, I never could anyway. Please I know after reading this you will probably hate me but I need advice for what do now for the sake of my guinea pigs.",16Apr2020,1

Last night I had a dream that I was dating a toxic boyfriend, and when we broke up, the guy I had a crush on appeared in front of me. He took my face in his hands and said the other guy was an idiot and he was so lucky to have me because I was the most beautiful girl. He kept saying how pretty I was and that he wished he could have me. It felt so real, my heart raced and I just kept saying “Really?” in disbelief and then he disappeared.

149,"So some backstory, I’m a 16 year old female, live a pretty healthy lifestyle, eat well, exercise, sleep pretty decently, the whole shabang.

I’ve never been one to care too much about my looks too much, but one thing that I’ve always strived to take care of and keep nice is my hair. Its been fairly short for as long as I can remember and hasn’t been past my shoulders since I was five. I have semi thick and wavy hair.  

Recently I’ve noticed that it’s started to fall/thin out quite a bit. Every time I run my hands through it three or four strands come out, I wake up in the morning and there’s hair on my pillow, and every time I wash my hair there’s about a ball of hair that comes out. I was looking through old photos (not that long ago, from only two three or four months) and there’s a huge difference. It also looks and feels quite thinner now.
It’s not like there’s bald spots, but for example when I put my hair up you can see my scalp even thought you never could before. 

I’ve taken a blood test and most of the results came back normal, only that I was vitamin C and D deficient, which I am taking supplements for now.

Opinions? Any ideas of what this could be or what could be causing this? What could I do to prevent this/help my hair become healthier? 
It’s really something that’s important to me and it’s kind of heartbreaking to watch this happen and not know what’s going on or not be able to do anything. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",16Apr2020,0

152,"So...my marriage has become frustrating (shocking)...

Due to this wonderful virus I've been home for the past 3 weeks. Which have been wonderful. 

I just got the call today that I'll be heading back to work as of monday ( I'm an electician). And my wife is just about to finish grad school and starts her job may 1st. 

As I told her today that I have to go back to work. Which mind everyone, I have been the soul income for our family of 3 for the past 4 years while she attended grad school.  She proceed to get mad/frustrated with me that I have to go back to work and that my schedule isnt flexible enough.  Her job, while she CAN work from home I know is a new task, a new adventure into this world.... but she can work from home.  

We have a 3 year old who's day care is currently shut down and she is being very selfish and un-flexible with her schedule but expects me to tell my boss that I cannot work (after being off for 3 weeks) because of her job. 

She has gone to seminary and will be a pastor for a church.  Mind you everything is closed and is over the internet via zoom for meeting or what have you. While I wholely and completely respect what she is doing for a career, I find it a little bit of bullshit that she expect me to just not work because she is starting a new job....

I get it I do but the selfishness of this is driving me mad and she currently is not speaking with me..
