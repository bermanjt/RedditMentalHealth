Periods. Oh my fucking god, periods. 

Now, I'm lucky enough to have quite tame menstrual cycles compared to other women, but nothing's more alluring than having to spend several days throughout every single month taking care of my bleeding vagina. Having to buy menstrual cups and pads and deal with the side effects is just unfair.

Breasts. 

Ugh, having breasts is both a literal and a figurative pain and the bigger they are, the worse they are. I remember the freedom of having small boobs when I was younger, only for them to grow to nearly the size of my own damn head, and all the frustration and inconvenience they bring really fucking sucks. 

Do you even know how expensive bra shopping can be? Tell me about it.

Beauty standards. 

Ugh, our appearance is so freaking important to our worth according to society. I, thankfully, have learned to say fuck you to those standards and hope that other women will follow through in greater numbers as times goes on.

My body, my choice.

Something like that. Having the government tell us whether or not we can have an abortion. If it was the other way around and men were the ones who had to go through pregnancies, I guarantee you all those men in government would either legalize it without argument or have them done in secret (which they probably already do with their wives, girlfriends, mistresses, etc. anyway.)

Among other things, but I don't want to complain too much or else all these internet misogynists will come out in droves to attack me with their verbal effluvia.

Fuck being a woman.

Don't bother commenting with your own points, as I won't be responding. My cynicism is far too great to even consider a friendly debate, because fuck everything.

3,"I’m a young guy and went to my job adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview. and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I’m very shy and quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

◾️the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again and she even filled out the whole application form for me for it and I didn’t ask",16Aug2020,1

Nothing is more obnoxious than a group of overly proud people spouting how great they are. Here in America, you see it with people who say how great America is and how we're number one in the world.

This type of mindset breeds an US vs THEM mentality, which inevitably leads to conflict and hostility when enough people get involved, and it can only lead to disaster from there.

Don't be a nationalist stooge. Don't believe in the propaganda that these groups constantly advertise.

Fuck Nationalism.

7,"I have crazy bad menstrual cramping that’s giving me all-over body pains, I have a bad pink eye infection, it’s 100+ degrees in my room and I don’t have AC, and I’ve been so very depressed :( I wanna cry so badly because there’s nothing I can do about any of this.",16Aug2020,1
8,"From his annoying voice to the enormous fan base who turn a blind eye to the fact that he tries to engage in sexual activity with minors and groom 17 year girls. I can’t stand how much praise he gets, the majority of his music or his attitude. I don’t understand what about him makes his shitty actions okay, even the toxic behaviors he admits to in his own music. Someone help me understand why he’s like a deity",16Aug2020,1
9,"Sorry if this isn’t the right place to post! I’m new to reddit but I hope I find some answers :)

So I like this guy and me and him hang out a lot. We stay the night at each-other’s houses, we go out to places, go to parties together and all of that. We flirt a lot in person and on line. We make jokes like “oh if only you weren’t boring” and he says “Don’t get my hopes up”. Anyway, I am incapable of making the first move you see, I do little things like lean in slightly, look him in the eyes and place my hands in certain places. But he still doesn’t make any moves. Does he think of me only as a friend? Or maybe he doesn’t notice my little ‘prompts’, I don’t know! 

Sorry for the lengthy paragraph! I ramble a lot... What do you guys think? Is there anything I can do to push him to make a move or should I just leave things as is? 

Thank you !",16Aug2020,1

Blind Faith Descent
Sengoku Komachi Kuroutan",16Aug2020,1
12,"There's something about having a candle next to you, let alone one that smells like cinnamon cookie, that's so comforting. I used to think scented candles were overrated but now I 110 percent the hype now. My candle has been ""on"" for almost 24 hours (most of it is gone) and I just feel more relaxed with it by my side, even if it did't have a smell. Very nice, would recommend.  Five stars.",16Aug2020,1
13,"I deleted my last account which had over 300k karma just for fun. 

So, why do you care so much about imaginary points?",16Aug2020,1
14,"Am I just craving male attention? I don’t consider myself attractive at all and  my first experience ever with a man was in January who ghosted me. We met up for sex,but we didn’t go through with it.I contacted him for two days asking for an explanation as I had gotten my hopes up thinking he would be my first boyfriend.(I know that sounds extremely stupid, please don’t judge me,I haven’t been taught much about relationships and people with ulterior motives)Since then, my mind has been preoccupied with dating. Every time I follow someone on Instagram, I do it because I find them attractive and want them to consider me the same. I am currently in a relationship now,but I’m just settling.Even when I am in public places if I catch someone staring at me or if a hot guy walks past me I hope they might ask me on a date. And no, I do not have a good relationship with my dad, I do have “daddy issues”.",16Aug2020,1

Blind Faith Descent
Sengoku Komachi Kuroutan",16Aug2020,1
17,"Have you ever thought of commiting suicide, and why?",16Aug2020,1
18,"My father and I used to watch Shark Week every year together when I was little. My favorite part of the day was to cuddle up with him and watch nature documentaries like this, and he really enjoyed this too.

Unfortunately, he's not the man he was 10+ years ago, and I haven't spoken to him in years. I don't regret my decision, but these memories give me a certain feeling of warmth and comfort. It hurts a little, but at least I can hold onto that feeling when I scroll through the channels and find that it's Shark Week again.",16Aug2020,1
20,All i am is a burden to everyone,16Aug2020,1
21,"Okay, I was going to post this in Am I the asshole, but I kind of was and just want to vent. Here’s the story. 
I work at Dunkin’ Donuts and it’s an okay job, but it’s not perfect and I deal with assholes and this was the day I had a big one, IMO. 
So obviously we have to wear mask. I wear mine and gloves for the entire shift. I have to readjust it because I’m talking while taking orders and nobody ever complains, but yesterday an asshole customer came in with his kids for ice cream. 
I get my mask adjusted and change gloves and get ready. Everything is going fine until he says “You’re not wearing your mask correctly.” I assumed he was joking and I just readjusted it no problem and went back to the ice cream. 
Then he starts shaming and chastising me for not wearing it correctly, that my gloves weren’t changed (they were) and that I’m a terrible employee. 
I finally just said “Okay, you don’t want me to make your ice cream. Fine. I’ll get someone else because I ain’t dealing with this.” And stormed off. 
Another employee went over and guess what he bitched at them! And mind you this dude is cleaner then me. He wears his gloves, his mask, his apron, etc. 
I just walked too the back to calm down and cuss the guy out where he couldn’t hear me. 
When I got upfront he said he would be reporting us to Facebook about how we’re unsanitary and rude. (Okay I was rude, but he did start it lol). We all had a good laugh as the guy spent 15 minutes apparently on Facebook until the manager confronted him. 
And that was my day at Dunkin’ Donuts on a busy Friday.",16Aug2020,1
24,"He died in March. I was living 3 hours away at the time when I got the call. They told me it was bad and that I needed to come now. I felt so helpless. 
My boyfriend drove me home, drove like a bat out of hell the whole 3 hours. But, when we got to the hospital, it was too late. My dad met us out in the parking garage and I asked ""Is he still here,"" and my dad just asked for a hug. I shook my head and asked again, this time, with tears rolling down my face, ""Is he still here???"" 
I've never seen my dad cry. He looked like a little kid. He grabbed me in a hug and I cried and screaming into his shoulder. It had to be a dream. Just a horrible dream. 

We weren't able to have a funeral for him because of COVID. No funeral homes were hosting at the time, the only option we had was cremation and to post pone the funeral. 

We must have reschedule the funeral at least 4 times. My dad was afraid that we would keep putting it off until it never happened. But, finally, we picked a date, and it stuck. August 15th. 

I had been dreading this day all week, I knew it was going to be hard. I had already mourned my grandfather, and now, it was like my healed wound was being torn open again. I mean, I can't even go to my grandparents house to see my grandma because I'm terrified of seeing his chair or his glasses sitting on the table. Of all his little half finished projects. 

It's like COVID said, ""Nah, you didn't mourn enough. Let's do it again."" 

At the funeral, I was in charge of putting the pictures together because I have ""an artistic eye"", but really, I think it's because everyone thinks I'm *strong*, when really, I just don't know how to show emotion. I bottle everything up until I'm alone and let myself feel it. 

But, I couldn't even put the pictures on the table. I couldn't even look at the little box that contained his ashes without breaking down. I eventually abandoned the photos and sat in the pew and just waited for it all to be over. 

I cried through the whole thing. Tears just would not stop falling. Even when my dad was trying to make people laugh with the funny things my grandpa would do, I just sat there, crying. My dad mentioned how my grandpa had surprised me with chocolate mousse because I had been craving it all week. He made it just for me, no one else. At that point, I was openly sobbing. They would rack through my body quietly while everyone around me would shed a few tears. 

I'm so hurt right now. I couldn't stay at my parents house afterwards with everyone laughing and joking as if we didn't just have our hearts ripped out again. My boyfriend and I are now making the 4 hours drive home (we moved even further away for his job), we won't be home until 2 am. But, I couldn't stay there another minute. 

I had just begun to be close to my grandpa. I love hearing his stories of when he was a kid. The simple stories of how his mom would send him to the store for bread was like a published work to me just because of the way he told it.

A few days before he died, I was at work and I thought to myself, ""I need to call grandpa."" And then the thought got pushed to the back of my mind and didn't surface until I got the call. 

My healed wound is open again and it's bleeding freely and I'm not sure how to carry on.",16Aug2020,1
25,"I’m so hyped. I tried for years with no success and eventually gave up. However today I was procrastinating buying books for a class so I decided to try to concur the impossible instead. With a little help from youtube I finally did it, I learn to tie a shoe!",16Aug2020,1
27," It’s 7:54. 6 minutes before the end of your shift, the first day off in 8 straight days. Dead tired from this 12-hour shift you’re mindlessly approving your employee’s timecards on your computer. Each click reminding you of each second passing until you can finally relax.

“Hey John,” your radio buzzes.

*Dammit.*

“Yes?”

“There’s... uh... someone here who is upset about our mask policy. Could you please talk to her?”

*Another one.*

“Sure, direct her to my office.”

You close out of the last timecard and stand up, taking a deep breath to deal with another argument you’ve had 1,000 times during these past 8 days. You open the office door and there she is, like always, with that menacing scowl and stupid bob. The same dumb bob that reminds you of a bully from middle school whose parents couldn’t figure out how to get him a proper haircut.

“Hello, Ma’am. I’m John, the manager of this Kohl’s. What seems to be the issue today?”

*Blah blah blah*

“I’m terribly sorry about your inconvenience, but we need to follow corporate policy,” you say calmly, as you’ve had to do over and over and over again for months.

*BLAH BLAH BLAH*

That’s it. You’ve had enough.

“Ma’am, please step into my office and we can discuss this further.”

She agrees, walks in, and you shut the door. This is the final straw. You grab her arms and push her back against the door. Looking into her eyes you don’t see fear—but excitement.

You grab her waist and feel the fabric. In one strong pull you rip off her shirt, exposing surprisingly supple breasts.

In shock, her eyes show even more excitement. A glazed look almost, as she anticipates your next move.

You unhook her bra in one clean pull, letting her bosom relax in front of you. Without a second thought you grab her again and start sucking her nipples while she moans in pleasure.

“Turn around,” you say, but physically turn her before she can respond.

You have a slight disgust at the sight of her jeans but you don’t care. Pressing yourself against her you unhook the button and pull them down.

Wow, her body actually looks great. Who the hell dresses these people?

Your cock is rock hard at this point. A culmination of the past 8 days of stress and needing the release. You rip her panties in half in an almost caveman fashion. You lift up her rear and shove yourself deep inside her, feeling her body comply to your actions.

“You’re a bitch, Karen. And I don’t give a damn what you think.”

She moans in orgasmic pleasure while you take control of her. Thrusting deeper and deeper, unleashing all of that pent-up frustration. She, too, feels a wave of relief she never felt. All of her own pent up frustration dissipates as she feels you deep inside her, swelling up.

“Turn around,” you command. “Get on your knees.”

She complies, so caught up in the moment. So caught up in your aggression—your passion.

You look at her below you, that goofy bob still pissing you off, and you ejaculate. Covering her face in cum. Some of it even landing in her hair, some of it landing on her chest. Watching little bits pool at the edge of her nipples.

She looks up at you, on her knees, mouth open, eyes fuller than you’ve ever seen before.

“And that, Karen, is why you have to wear a mask.”",16Aug2020,1
28,"TRUST ME, I'm not kidding. 

I made this site to run a fun social experiment, do some fun-raising (pun intended) for important stuff, and maybe make a bit of money in the process.

In short, the internet community needs to come together and contribute to uncover the exact coordinates of where I stashed the dinero. Once the coordinates are uncovered, whoever gets there first and digs up the metal container can keep the whole loot.",16Aug2020,1
29,"I can’t remember which subreddit it was on. All the information I can give you is that it took place in a parking garage at night, the guy filming focused on this person in an odd Slendermanlike costume except the head had weird tentacle-shaped protrusions on it. The person slowly makes his way around the garage to this door near the “creature” and has to unlock the door with a keycard to get in and the thing notices him. He gets inside while the creature is looking in the door at him and the guy gets in an elevator and the video ends. I apologize if that was a horrible description, but it’s the best I could do. Can someone help find this so I can save it and show a couple of friends?",16Aug2020,1
31,"I have a problem, I'm trying to go to sleep but each time I try and sleep it feels like I'm going to die, I can't breath either, when I’m laying down and close my eyes I’m so tired but when I open them I’m awake but weak, my body feels like it’s giving out, my heart feels like it’s not beating and or I’m not getting any oxygen, my head feels light headed as soon as I open my eyes, I don’t k ow what this is and what to do, I feel dead inside.",16Aug2020,1
32,"PRE-DEATH 
I'm was trying to go to sleep but each time I try and sleep it feels like as if  I'm going to die, I can't breath either, when I’m laying down and close my eyes I’m so tired but when I open them I’m awake but weak, my body feels like it’s giving out, my heart feels like it’s not beating and or I’m not getting any oxygen, my head feels light headed as soon as I open my eyes. 

AFTER THOUGHT
The feeling was worse then explained, it felt as if my head was going to blow off, my whole body just stopped working, my heart, my lungs, my everything, nothing was working, I sit up or even open my eyes, I’d fall back light headed and tired, I couldn’t breath like as if my heart wasn’t getting any oxygen. I was terrified and just wanted it to stop, I don’t know how or what stopped it but I’m glad it’s gone bc I was scared for my life. 

I’m better now but I was so scared and now I’m shaking and wanting to cry and idk what the hell happened..",16Aug2020,1
33,"Nobody is reporting him I’m starting to think reddit just has a lot of pedophiles and it fucking disgusts me, it’s literally just a bunch of creeps harassing women so can y’all please mass report him",16Aug2020,1
34,"This is a preference.

I don’t understand why people like purposely burning their tongue, some say that it’s that like getting a kick out of it, and the kick is inducing pain on their tongue by eating a plant that causes burns as self defence. 

I personally don’t like burning my tongue.",16Aug2020,1
35,"I took my neices for a walk today. They are 3 years old and 2 years old. During that walk, I realized how much we as adults take for granted. My neices stopped every 2 minutes to look around and go ""wow a tree!"" Or ""wow! A flower"" or ""wow auntie! A bird!"" The walk should have taken about 10 minutes but it took nearly 45 minutes because they stopped and admired  everything around them. 

The look on their faces and the joy in their eyes when they saw something that most adults simply ignore everyday truly made me realize that kids see the world as such a beautiful place! They are so innocent and they deffinitly see the world theough rose colored glasses. I thought it was so cute and worth sharing. :) 

Thanks for reading!",16Aug2020,1
36,"I dated my best friend for a few months. Prior to us actually dating, we've discussed dating before. We decided to not go through with it because we worked together. But then he quit the place where we both worked, we started dating a few days after, and we told each other that we've had feelings for each other for a long time. All seemed right with the world.

We broke up because he's in school to be a physician assistant and he didn't think he had time to be a boyfriend. Maybe he is really busy or maybe he just doesn't want to be with me. I really, really miss him. He was the first boyfriend I had that was a healthy relationship and being with him made me realize I deserve so much more in a relationship than my other exes led me to believe. I told him that I hope we can stay friends. I occasionally text him but it feels one sided. I still have feelings for him. I'm in tough position. Being in a relationship with him, made my feelings for him stronger so this breakup hurts even more. At the same time, I don't want to regret something that made me realize I deserve so much more.",16Aug2020,1
37,I expect this to be taken down. I’m alone. I have no one but my last bag of ramen. Who would miss me?,16Aug2020,1
40,"I don’t really like to tell anyone about things like this and I’m not sure if I’m wanting to continue talking to my girlfriend about the topic but I am honestly scared for life. 

I’m diagnosed with bipolar depression and I suffer from hallucinations, quite often recently. And I may be seeing a therapist soon because I canceled the sessions with my previous one. I’m scared I may have schizophrenia or something like it, obviously I’m undiagnosed with that but I’m quite worried about my mental health.

Most of my hallucinations are auditory but occasionally they will be visual and it’s terrifying for me. My auditory ones usually occur when I’m trying to sleep, or even sometimes when I’m just going about my day. It’s usually many distorted voices, strange ones that I don’t know talking trash about me and telling me how worthless I am. I don’t know where all this stemmed from, I’ve had a great life (currently 15) and I’m in a very loving family. I feel so useless all the time and I’ll honestly be happy most of the time then just go through these episodes (quite often) where I feel worthless and have a lot of suicidal tendencies.

Unfortunately, I have a pretty big history with self harm and I hate so much to destroy the body Allah gave me but I can’t help it. I remember one time when I just blacked out, I don’t remember doing it but I was in the bathroom and had 9 cuts on my thigh, this happened about a month ago. Or last night even, i just was in the closet. I have no recollection of even going to the closet. I was just in there, hugging my knees. I literally talked to my girlfriend a few moments prior.

This is a bit unorganized but my visual hallucinations, while they don’t happen that often scare me the most. It’s usually very distorted faces, or even when I look in the mirror sometimes my face looks terrifying and disgusting. 

I’m sorry for ranting, no one will read this most likely but I just want to get help. I think about suicide A LOT but I don’t want to die.",16Aug2020,1

43,"Okay obviously this isn’t an important aspect of my life, but I had 20k karma the other day, then I made some stupid comment that got me over 6k upvotes. Now I’m only at 23.5, what gives?",16Aug2020,1
44,"Just some late night thoughts when you start feeling a little sad.

I have always struggled with loneliness and codependency in my family, friendships and relationships. I always struggle to find people that accept me for who I am or are interested in me. 

For friendships, I struggle to make new friends that are meaningful connections that aren’t always me initiating it. I have a few close friends in college and a few life long friends from high school, but the idea that I have no one and I’ll spend my days alone and wasting my time eat away at me.

I struggle with depression and social anxiety which is not a fun mix, but have been trying to work on it this year. After a time when I came closer to suicide than I would like to admit, I realized I don’t care how pathetic I look, I need to keep trying. Despite my words, I feel less desperate than before, I’m not clawing at people trying to make them stay while being a sad insecure mess. I feel a bit more free, as if I have nothing to lose and I honestly don’t. 

I continuously start conversations with different people, try to find ways into finally being in a group chat by making them myself or revitalizing them, I ask people to hang out. It’s tiring sometimes trying to think of ways to get people interested in me, but I can’t stop trying.

I’m trying to accept I’m the type of person with minimal friends, one where I won’t always have bustling days after school with the same group of girls. My best friends are at different schools making new best friends, but I know they still love me. People might not get close to me but the short conversation they give me fills my heart. I’m a lonely person but I love to be alone and my bouts of sadness are not because I’m worthless but because I’m still healing.

I need to have hope because this is all I get.",16Aug2020,1
45,"So long story short, I've been liking this girl from my hometown for YEARS and since we're back from college because of corona, we finally met up one night and somehow she reciprocated her feelings for me when I expressed them to her.

We're going on a date later this week and I'm actually terrified of not living up to her expectations of me. She's way out of my league and her ex was honestly pretty attractive, so I feel like one of those memes where it's like ""her, her ex, her dad, etc."" and I'm just so average.

I'm usually pretty confident, but I think some insecurities are coming out because I've been simping on her for so long, and now questions are nagging me like, ""you're not as attractive as she thought you were"" or ""maybe you're not gonna be good enough at sex"" or whatnot.

I don't know what to do or think and I would really appreciate any thoughts or shared experiences from y'all. Thanks!",16Aug2020,1
46,"Weird i know but in the summer ill want a nice crisp cold breeze along with a ride on my sled and smell of some pine being burned in our wood stove. While in the fall i want a nice spring morning, you know the smell. And i want the roads to be all muddy with a bunch of snow plow piles around, and the birds chirping. BUT in the winter I want a nice summer evening at my friend's hunting cabin sitting around the fire, maybe shootin' off some fireworks and some clay pigeons. And in the spring I just want that cozy, warm feeling of fall, with the beautiful leaves, and seeing the geese overhead leaving for the winter. Maybe I just want all the seasons at once. I think my favorite season is all of them.",16Aug2020,1
47,"5 of us who haven't really left the house since March except our jobs (all customer service, we've been working through all this) were finally able to get together tonight sort of. We spaced chairs out in my friend's backyard, wore masks, never got closer than probably 10 ft but still had a great great time talking in person.



It makes me so frustrated that so many people (a lot of my own friends and family) ""haven't been able to do it"" and are out at bars, restaurants, parties etc. without masks or social distancing like nothing's happening.


All of us have struggled a LOT through all of this, but we still managed to keep safe. If we can so can anyone else.



Didn't mean to make the post negative, it was still a great time even if we still had (the reasonable minimum) precautions in place",16Aug2020,1
48,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this type of question but I'm hoping for some conversation from some like minded people. I'm a woman of a particular age (30+) and I've gotten to a point that I am so disillusioned by life and the many interactions I face everyday that I'm asking myself what is the point? Not because I'm thinking of hurting myself or anything, but everyone around me seems to be concerned with meaningless interactions on social media with strangers. Random hookups. ""Savage"" lifestyles where you get people before they get you. Meanwhile I have begun to develop trust issues because I feel like I don't matter to anyone. All I want to do is support people and love them but I fear I have to hide myself because I'll be used and I need to toughen up. Or I feel reserved in talking about sex but if I'm not openly supporting everyone's OnlyFans then I'm a ""pick me"" and a discredit to my gender and I deserve to be left by the more openly free women so relationships are pointless. 

Everyone is replaceable so why try? Why connect when you become strangers eventually and you see them happy with other people? I try so hard to be solid for people and I get told its too much. 

I went to a ER recently and when I was asked who my emergency contact was...I replied no one. I have a job that would notice my absence I suppose. People that I make laugh and feel better about themselves. But my life is literally just filled with a job (s), a few mundane conversations, eating, and then sleeping to do it all again. It's more than boredom...its just a feeling I can't quite put my finger on. I'm sure the obvious answer is depression, but I actually find myself a hopeful person 99% of the time. I just don't understand where I am supposed to feel the enthusiasm to do this for another 30+ years if that's what I'm granted. I feel like a ghost.",16Aug2020,1

I would watch every video there was about the topic we were studying, I was so motivated to make notes and to really understand the topic in depth. But now I am in the second semester of my first year, and I have lost all that. The mountain of workload they drop on me every week has nearly killed my will to learn.

55,"so i am a 16 male and from probably 11 or 12 i've hated myself since i just dont look good in anyway.

and i know it since people don't seem to like to talk to me and i've been made fun of in school few years back.

I hate the fact that i can't do nothing about it i mean i don't think i look too bad from the front i look average/below average but from the side i look BAD especially from the left since i style my hair to the right.

Now i don't have self confidence issues outside of school but school always brings me down since i feel like people my age are still pretty shallow people and have friends based on looks etc.

I'm glad this is my last year of high school because as i said school makes me bring my self down about my looks and everything and every year i go back to school my self confidence takes a huge dip down and it takes a while to build it back up.

I also kind of worry about once i am an adult about finding friends, an partner etc since everything is gonna be harder since i am not good looking.

Im afraid of ending up with no friends or anything as an adult just working a 9 to 5 and coming home more depressed everyday.

I also have pretty poor social skills due to this i mean they're not bad but when talking to someone i easily run out of stuff to talk about or ask about so the convo always gets cut short.

Been studying programming the past couple of years although I have been doing it for longer my anxiety didn't even let me apply for any interviews, which left me doing personal projects, side businesses and other odd jobs.

But I've decided to put myself out there and apply for jobs, didn't get any or little response for the year (even pre-covid) but finally have a response from a major bank. Passed their coding quiz questions (which I was proud of) and a short behavioural interview online quiz but have my main interview tomorrow.

Very nervous as I haven't been working full time for two years, I feel ashamed that I haven't which I feel there is one part of the interview I may fail because of my inexperience and expressing situations where it shows leadership. If all goes well it'll be my first full time job in years.

57,"A few days ago my girlfriend with bipolar affective disorder broke up with me. We've been 3 years together. I admit I've done a lot of bad things to her even to this point that she had to go to the mental hospital mainly because of me and she wanted to kill herself too. Unfortunetly only after I saw how much bad things I did and how close I was to losing her I realised that i really love her. Too late, I know. We decided to start again and our relationship was never better. I started reading about her disability and supporting her. Until these few days ago when we broke up. She said that she is scared that I will repeat my mistakes again in the future and doesn't want to be with me to not hurt her again. I really hoped that after I started to do my best it will be okay. She also said that maybe she just needs time but she's not sure if we'll be able to be together. I feel so guilty for what i did to her. I wouldn't lose her now. I don't know if other people act similar but I feel so stupid because I saw how she is important to me and how much I love her only when I already lost her. Maybe now I should try to forget and go on but I love her too much to let go. Especially when she told me that there IS a chance that she will come back. I will be waiting for her, I want to show that she can trust me again.

Things that were not okay I began accepting, just to try and keep them around.  It wasnt something I planned on, but it happened.


Whenever I would start to track away, something would happen to suck me in.  She said she was sexually assaulted, and I was worried, and she ignored me once I showed I really cared.  She said she was stood up, and the same.  She said she got in a fight with her mom, and the same.  


But when I need someone I'm ignored.  She knows I like her and she brings up app these dates.  She ignores me when I need someone.  Its been such a one way street.  I loved this person and never met them.


But at this point its too hurtful for me.  When I even say I'm trying to move on, my mental health isnt doing well, she will force her way back in, even by calling me and texting me all the time; then disappear.


I just dont know how to end it I guess.  Its obviously bad, ive been lied to for years, quite possibly bamboozled.

And the 4th person I wasnt really close with but this is about the other 2. So my predicament is that my friend thinks I was flirting with his girlfriend.(who is one of my bestfriends) By sitting with her, putting my arm round her, laying with her, you know stuff you do while watching movie's with friends. But I wasnt trying anything. I wasnt trying to get with her or anything like that. And now the guy is pissed at me (with good reason) but he says he doesn't trust me. I'm not sure what to do.

62,"So we went away for a weekend with originally 9 of my friends. My friend who does not know the rest except for me obviously decided to cancel because she felt ill and due to corona she didn’t want to risk it.

We paid X USD in advance so obviously that was lost for her part. Then when we got there we tried asking the getaway house’s owner if we it’s possible to cancel her other half of the payment that’s due when we leave. The owner said it’s not possible.

Then the rest of my friends started complaining, that they are not going to pay for her part, even though it was like a tiny fraction of the cost, so it was like $10 per person if we split it. I said I’ll ask my friend who stayed at home.

I kind of understood the other since if you cancel last time you should pay, but then again if we split it would have been a tiny amount. Then I asked my friend and she declined to pay, since she got ill, it’s not her responsibility.

Since no one wanted to pay and I had enough of these people’s attitudes I decited to pay for her part.

The fee wasn’t even an extraordinary fee, I couldn’t care less obviously. But what hurts is that I called both of the parties my friends and none of them wanted to help regarding this matter. It’s not we were staying at Four Seasons, it was a freaking cheap ass house and even this way I had to pay her costs. It feels kind of sad to be honest.

76,"Always been lightly into VR stuff, but my first time diving in was when I started playing VRChat just a week ago to go to the virtual convention events that were happening. Though, after I explored the game further, I found that it offered more than I even thought I could ask for.

So semi-recent history behind me... Things haven't been great since graduating high school, dropping out of college due to the lack of preparation, and realizing all my healthy, active, and social life was almost entirely embedded within my high school years. Yeah. Things got pretty damn depressing, and I guess I nearly lost all will to just function and exist. I three out all my routines and hobbies (dancing will come up later). I became a NEET and then got slapped with the news of covid-19 and whatever right after. Kinda humorous, I suppose, to be self-isolating before it was actually needed. I was like ""Ah, perfect..."" 

 I have seriously bad issues with focusing enough to motivate myself to do things. Perhaps some heavy avoidance habits... so I went through a series of gaming fixations that waxed and waned this year. VRChat just happens to be my most recent fixation. It just might not dissipate from my as easily as other games. After playing for 7-8 days, I ended up making a ton of new motives for myself, and even recovering dead resolutions I thought I'd never be able to complete or meet. 

One of the reasons I made this revelation is because I accidentally joined one of the dancing worlds and became captivated by the full-body tracking they all had-- it was so crazy to me that the avatars could move around like that. Learning how to dance was actually a goal I had after graduating, so it sparked in my head that using the VRChat mirrors would give me less anxiety and squash my shyness without having to go to an actual dance room or workshop. Kind of a HELL YEAH moment... not to the cost of it all though of course haha.. but it motivated me anyway, and I ended up dancing in my room a bit this morning. Just for the hell of it.

The other reason falls right in the arms of the last but the movements you could make just owning even a regular vr headset and basic controls fascinated, and I got jealous not being able to convey myself with natural head tilts and gestures. 
VRChat, to me, felt super immersive and fun, even as a desktop user. It made feel like I was back in my groove of social engagement. A lot of the feelings of incompetence I was bashing myself with washed out, and the interactions I made with others managed to pull my mind out of the gutter it was soaking in for a whole goddamn year. 
I'm very grateful and excited to be so motivated to work towards a goal for once, so I thought it'd be good to write about for the records ye
Here's to hoping for some VR gear soon so I can experience more fun inspiration and branch out as well. I'm not quite betting on the full $2000+ setup and a desktop upgrade immediately, but I want to start somewhere to liven things up in my life.",16Aug2020,1

78,"Well uh, I don’t know where else to put this. I think I’m just some sort of freak. I’m in a boys only school and most topic that are discussed are sex, and you know, stuff boys talk about, yeah? I just think... I’m too weird. As in, with sex and stuff, I’m too horny. I don’t know how to say it but, I think I really AM the horniest guy in the world. For example, I go shopping with my parents and I just can’t stop staring... at women. It’s literally unavoidable. I just fantasise, oh look, what if I do this with that person, or that with another... and this whole thing carries on and now I look at females as some kind of... other thing.

This stuff happens EVERY DAY, not a one off. I’m straight, but like, I don’t even need porn to jerk off or anything, I can use my mind to fantasise. And nobody in my class has ever done that. And I just think, I’m too weird, strange, and... out of order. I sometimes look at myself and think “What have I turned into?” 

I can’t think of any other way to explain this but, I’m just too different to anyone else. I can take all kinks and fetishes and not think twice about it afterwards, even though I’m sure right now I AM NOT INTO THAT STUFF. It’s just in these brief moments I realise that I’m a human, and I’m not “in the mood” for stuff sometimes (although that’s really rare) and that’s the reason why right now I’m creating this post. I recognise that it’s a problem and it has to stop, but I can’t stop.

I’m a 15 year old guy, brought up in a home with overprotective parents who won’t even let me go to my friend’s house by myself and the idea of therapy is laughable to them. Not to mention, I was supposed to be brought up as a religious person, like my parents, but it’s really ironic since I’m just kind of the opposite of that right now.

I just need a way to get out of this mess. I can’t stop looking at people this way... and recently this has also included some distant FAMILY members. Sometimes I feel like I should leave home, for the betterment of my family and myself, but right now it’s totally not possible since... my parents wouldn’t let me because they’re overprotective. I appreciate all the comments, good or bad. I really just am desperate to leave all of this stuff behind once and for all.",16Aug2020,1

82,"I (21m) have BPD and mostly fall into the quiet subtype. I don’t really have any family or friends, I’ve never been in a relationship or even had sex, so obviously I’m pretty lonely, boo fkn hoo. I did have this friend who was the only person I’ve ever shared any of my issues with (but I didn’t share my diagnosis, even with her) and I ended up catching feelings for her but she didn’t feel the same way, can’t blame her either, I’m way too skinny, covered in scars and pretty mentally unstable. So that’s as close as I’ve come to anything relationship adjacent.

I’ve though about joining dating apps in the past but I’ve never done it because I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say about my mental issues. On the one hand, I hate talking about it, especially with strangers and I don’t want girls to think I’m unattractive or not masculine or that I’m oversharing and playing the victim or being needy because I have these issues and I talk about it. On the other hand, I’d feel like I was lying if I didn’t say anything and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time or end up hurting them because I wasn’t upfront about it. I also know that there’s a ton of stigma around BPD and I don’t want to seem like I’m intentionally trying to hide it from someone who might want to avoid people like me for their own reasons.

Maybe I’m too immature and am not ready to even be thinking about it yet, I don’t know. I have been working hard to independently better myself, I quit drinking and drugs in February, self-harm free since June, I went from eating almost nothing to eating 3 good healthy meals a day, working out every day and putting on a bit of muscle and all that good stuff, but I don’t know if it’s enough or if I’m just jumping the gun because I’m lonely. I’m still prone to severe bouts of depression and have heaps of internal anger some days but I don’t know if those will ever fully go away. 

I don’t want to rush into dating before I’m ready just because I’m lonely and feel like I’m so far behind everyone else, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of my life abstaining from it waiting for the day I’m ‘normal’ that realistically, probably won’t happen.

88,"Okay, so this is a whole mess, and I don’t know how to word it well, but it has been bugging me for a long time...

In March, I married my best friend. He is a proud Puerto Rican man who moved from PR two years ago. I am a musician and have always been intrigued by the intricate workings of ALL music (uhh, duhh!) I have always listened to everything! I listen to country music, alternative, 1950s bops to early 2000s is amazing, punk, grunge, pop, reggae, and everything else under the moon. I even listen to music in other languages, primarily French, Italian, and Spanish. 

When my husband and I met, I started listening to a lot more Spanish music because it reminds me of him, I like it a lot, and because it makes him feel good that I share his taste in music. I genuinely love it, but here is the issue...

I work in retail, and when our store closes, everyone whips out their tunes. Half of those people play music on speakers that are extremely loud. I play my music on my phone, at full volume, but shoved in my pocket, so it’s muffled. I don’t mean to offend anyone, but every time someone walks by, and they hear my Spanish music playing, I hear things, like, “uhh, you’re white” or “you don’t even know who is singing that!” I’ve been called a Latina wannabe, vaguely accused of cultural appropriation, and just insulted every day. I DO NOT talk with any accent, I NEVER try to say anything in Spanish, I don’t walk up to someone and greet them in Spanish, I don’t even sing the music that I listen to while at work (I hum). I am an Italian-American and I don’t even truly identify with that community because I feel like I am just me. 

About 60% of the people I work with are Native Spanish speakers and about half of those people tell me that I cannot listen to “THEIR” music. Of course, after weeks of bullying, I stopped listening, but I am so hurt. 

I have talked to my husband about how he feels about me listening to Spanish music. He told me that music is music, and he agreed that you don’t need a “Latin Card” to listen. 

Sorry for the long post; I am just wondering... Is there something that I am missing? I listen to only appropriate Spanish songs, and I even read all translations and get the “approval nod” from my husband before adding it into my work playlist, as an extra safety check, so I am not listening to anything vulgar. I cannot stress it enough that I do not act wrong at work, but my husband used to work their with me, so people accuse me of “acting Puerto Rican” like my husband because I listen to music.",16Aug2020,1

He works on elevators. That's his career. He really enjoys it and no two days are the same. Most of the people he works with he really likes, he has so many guys that are his favorites, I get him on about that but all in good fun. I love hearing about his day. Sometimes he even sends me pics and videos!! I dont know what the heck I'm looking at but I appreciate it all so much. I'm glad he has a job he likes and gets along with everyone and hes really really good at his job. So many people go to him every day for problems and he helps out every single one of them. I like hearing how he helps them. 

I have quite a few issues. Mostly my eating disorder and depression. And in this whole time he's helped me a lot with both. He asks questions, cares deeply, and just wants to help me.

I feel comfortable telling him when he says something triggering, of course never meaning to, and he just doesnt say it anymore and understands. He's helped me a few times keeping food down. He's helped telling me how important it is to eat. He's told me when it's my ED talking and not me. He's helped when I've shared my intrusive thoughts. He's helped so much with my depression and eating disorder and I'm so grateful. 

It hasn't all been sunshine and rainbows though. We've been through a lot and worked through it. There have been times where we didnt talk on the phone, message each other, nothing. We're learning as we go along. And I'm grateful for that. We can get through anything, and we do. 

We've shared deep dark secrets with each other. The darkest. And we share because we can. Because we're comfortable with each other. We would never judge each other. I've told him things no one knows and he's done the same. Each time we share a secret we become closer. 

He's helped me discover a part of myself that was lost all these years. We can talk about literally anything, and we do. We get closer each time we talk about something deep. We can be funny and risky but then be serious right in the middle, drop everything and be serious, and that's good. 

I love you, Sam. You're my person.",16Aug2020,1

I will not be going back to my old life. I’m going to take a hit on a large salary when things go back to normal. And that’s ok. I’m going to travel more when this finishes, less internet and news, more kayaking, sailing, gardening, baking, landscaping, swimming, more hosting people for relaxing enjoyable wholesome and wellness time at my home. I’m going to go to farmers markets and do more local less global. 

I’m definitely going to work less hours for sure. Part time only. 

Catching up with friends I have not seen in 20+ years. Bringing small toys and healthy treats to friends kids and just being kinder to people. 

Less stimuli that upsets me and more that is primitive to a healthy existence.

95,"I'm not trying to say it's a good movie. I've seen it a couple times, and overall it was a bland experience. Although, I don't understand why people online, specifically Reddit, absolutely hate Stuart Little with such an undying, unwavering, deep-seated passion. 

Yes, the premise is weird. Why is everyone so cool with a talking rat and the fact that he's up for adoption at an orphanage and not a pet store? Why does he wear human clothes? Why do the human clothes fit him so we'll, considering he's a rat? Why does he like boats? What purpose could that plot point possibly serve other than to put him, a rat, in danger? Why did his adoptive parents choose him instead of a normal human child? Why hadn't the government snapped up a talking rat for tests? Why was this weird, kind of boring children's book turned into multiple feature films? 

I understand why people wouldn't like the movie. Hugh Laurie was in it, but somehow didn't improve it at all because his character was written by someone who hates dads, I guess? Yes the child actor is atrocious. But why do so many people hate this movie to such a degree? What is the mythos behind the Stuart Little Hate? Is it a Caillou situation?",16Aug2020,1

I’m a college student who works really hard, try’s to be responsible, and do the right sort of things. I’ve recently lost an internship for the third time and will be doing on line school this fall. Every time I’ve lost an internship it has not been my fault. They’ve all been out of my control. This made me extremely upset and also made me realize not much in my life is making me happy right now. 

I’ve lived my college years trying really hard not to make mistakes and do the right things. For a while now I’ve been feeling like I’ve been missing out on some of the pluses from college. I’ve had a lot of fun but sometimes feel restricted by my relationship and get jealous of the type of fun my friends have. 

I don’t know if this is the right sub, but I feel like I could go down a really self destructive path. It wouldn’t even be  that self destructive. It would really consist of not focusing as much on grades, probably breaking up with my gf, going out and drinking to much on the weekends, and basically ignoring covid.

I love waking up, I always wake up with a big smile on my face, I love going outside and meeting people, talking and helping people. I love to compliment people and help brighten their day, I love to help people around me. I just love being alive

Every day is great, even the most menial tasks are always fun, I love cleaning the house, love walking the dog and love to peruse my hobbies. Life is so great, there are so many possibilities, so many experiences to be had, so many emotions to feel. God, even typing this is making me excited for tomorrow and for whatever the future holds for me, I just love being a human.

Life is fantastic, every time I ever begin to feel down or sad I always remind myself of who I am and what I am and I instantly feel happy. Im a human, my life is short in the grand scheme of the universe, but in this life of mine I want experience everything life has to offer, I want to make hundreds of friends, I want to make people happy and I want to make people feel loved, I want explore the world and meet the people and cultures, I want to carry on being human and live the best possible life ever. I love chasing my dreams, however unrealistic they may be! REMEMBER, A boat is always safer in the harbour, but thats not what it was meant for :)

If people want to know why the term “short man syndrome” exists - try being in my shoes for a month. It might not happen every day, or every week, but over the course of time you will see how many different aspects of your life are affected by your height (as a male):

1. Dating - Tall men always have better luck than short guys since most women are drawn to them. (And good luck using a dating app as a 5’5 male....unless of course you’re rich, which brings me to my next point)

2. Career - It has been proven in countless studies that taller males (usually those over 6ft) make more money than shorter males (those under 5’8). 

3. Sports/Athletics - In pretty much every single major sport, tall men have an advantage. That’s pretty much obvious at this point (if you follow any professional American sports).

4. Clothing - This is a whole another issue altogether, but clothing is generally geared towards taller men, and unlike women, when shopping for yourself as a man - you have far less options available. Sure, there are clothing lines that cater to the short man, but they are usually stupid expensive and few and far between.

5. The way you are treated by strangers - From a young age, to this day, the way I am treated by strangers sometimes is fucking ridiculous. When
I was really young, I was involved in many fights because people thought they could walk all over me. Even today, I am still “picked on”. What do I mean by that? I mean that strangers, from time to time, will say stuff to me that I know for a fact they would not have the balls to say if I was 6’3 220lbs. 

I realize there are plenty of worse things in the world than being a short man, but honestly if there are short men out there that say they have never been negatively impacted by their height at least a couple times in their life - they are 100% full of shit.",16Aug2020,1

I was doing comics, even; I had completed two fan works and I had started another, but controversies on the internet and in real life stomped my confidence to the ground. I now question whether or not to post something. The only place I post now is Twitter.

Every time I visit the art-related subreddits, I see these intricate, beautifully crafted works. Artists' styles (mainly in manga/anime/cartoon) are adorable and simple.

Mine is *not* that.

My art style is... different, I guess. It's not perfect. I don't have perfect technique. What matters (to me, at least--I know everyone's different) is how the picture makes me (and others) feel. It's a world full of critiques/criticisms/techniques when I look at the visual chemistry. I want to feel something when I look at an image, even if it's drawn for fun.

I guess I wish more people looked at drawings that way, especially on Reddit.

I want to share my art more often. I used to; I've been lectured/criticized for my art MANY times. I still draw. I've just been drawing for me. I thought it'd be fine, but I find myself wanting to share, yet my anxiety kicks right on. I don't know if it'll get deleted again. I don't know if it'll get stolen again (I hide my signatures) or if I'll just regret it...

116,"Tl;dr: I’m just remembering that when I was in grades 5, 6, and 7 my mom would run my Facebook account and have conversations with my friends on my behalf without my input at all. I am now just processing and realizing how messed up this is

A random memory just popped into my head that I don’t know how I forgot about/have never really thought too deeply about. I am now 19(F) and in my third year university still living at home.

Context: I was never the most social in elementary school and showed minimal interest in friends. I was kind of dorky and didn’t care. This was fine until I hit middle school and I guess my mom had a problem with it?

I don’t even know how to really explain this properly so here I go

This was around the time Facebook was becoming a big thing (2012) and that’s how everyone in middle school talked. 

Somehow, over the span of grades 5-7, my mom pretty much ran my social media for me including private messaging my friends. It progressed from me asking her help on whah to say sometimes, and at it’s worst I would log in to my Facebook and review conversations with my friends that I did not witness happen at all

It wasn’t in a strict way, but more in a loving ‘I want to help you be popular / make friends’ kind of way, as if she was teaching me to be social? In reality, I’m thinking that it severely hindered my social skills as I kind of suck now.

I am still in contact with a lot of these people, although we never became that close once I took over my social media at the end of middle school. The f*cked up thing is that she chose people who were known as popular in my grades, I’m guessing to up my social status. She would also talk to boys I had crushes on for me

I am just now thinking about the severity of this and how absolutely unheard of and disturbing this is. Not only was it weird for me it was a complete breach of trust for these young kids that would talk to her thinking it was me.

118,"This may sound absurd, but I've realized that it is a universal truth. To preserve freedom, we must never force anything onto others. That is an attack! The only way to protect the innocent is with the ultimate defense. I'm not even saying prevention!

.

Prevention of criminal acts is curtailing of freedoms just the way forcing and attacking is. The best non-destructive method of preventing harm from coming to others is substitution. Most of you have no idea how horrible life was before the era of the USA. People were far more vicious and likely to kill. They often had to in order to survive. These days, you can have no muscle, have low intelligence, low motivation, and weigh a ton, and still be ""successful."" I see it every day.

.

The same holds true for upholding rights. We can not take away some rights in order to uphold other rights. Why are there so many killing shows and killing games out there? Not because they're easier too make. It's because it's normal to have killer instincts for survival. People choose gory violent games, as an outlet for the killer instinct that humans have lost the need for within the last few centuries. There's no way for biology to adapt that quickly, it needs thousands or tens of thousands of years to gradually reduce unnecessary instincts in the population. Switch killing with anything popular yet disturbing.

.

So if you're smart, you'll have extrapolated that there has to be even the right to kill. Even brutal violent gory disgusting killing of all types must be accepted. The trick is that we can defend ourselves by using substitution. By allowing killers to play video games, I think that we have reduced the amount of potential real life murder and mutilation by way more than you would ever believe.

.

But there are other rights that we need to uphold that may not be so easy. In my battles with depression, I've become a strong advocate for the right to die. Without this right, this freedom, we are forcing people to live. Even if you are strong and smart and young and successful. Maybe it sounds good to you to force things onto others if it's good for them, but I'm not so sure of that. We cheapen freedoms by not giving people alternatives. Think about the freedom to improve yourself. Is it really so great to be better if you don't care that you're better? If you didn't choose it and struggle to achieve it? This means that, just like the right to choose death, the right to be lazy and ignorant is just as sacred!

.

The trick, as I mentioned before, is coming up with an alternative. Switch out real victims with fake ones. Kill videogame characters instead of real people. Steal fake treasure instead of real people's things. How does that translate to other things like the right to die? I can't answer that yet. Maybe someone will figure it out.

.

A lot of people are under the mistaken impression that offense is stronger than defense. If that were true, then destruction would have obliterated creation long before life ever had the chance to form. Offense seems more powerful purely because life had to attack just for survival, just for the bare minimum, scratching with tooth and nail- type of survival. But look at the true dominant life form on earth. It is silent. It doesn't move or speak. It peacefully grows toward the sky. If you haven't realized it yet while reading, I'm talking about plants! They're everywhere. They will outlast every human and bug. They thrived before we could even begin to exist.

.

So yeah, it's outrageous, I'm defending all bad choices, every criminal, every impure impulse. We need the freedom to do evil in order to appreciate the freedoms that we should idealize. Every other method is a slippery slope that people have abused and corrupted until it became pointless. The method we should be using is substitution, not punishment, not forcing people into a box, and offense is especially *not* a good defense.

.

I think that the most important thing to substitute right now is control. Vertical hierarchy is a slippery slope, and will always lead humanity toward ruin. We need to switch to horizontal power sharing, and substitute real hierarchies with video game replacements. I believe that we can only hope to innovate our way out of our problems. We must make controlling others (real people) into the perverse taboo that it is.

Bring on the robot workers. Eliminate vertical control systems. Eliminate forced living. Eliminate the human (trafficking) based economy (that *is all* economy). Eliminate wage slavery. The era of true freedom is at our fingertips! Defend yourself!",16Aug2020,1

Relationships are hard for me in general and I've come a long way in even opening up to people, but the more I age and continue to regress into bad habits time and time again, I feel like the people in my life are better off with someone who is consistent in their lives.

When I feel low and less than stellar, I always tend to isolate myself because I don't want to be a negative influence on anyone. Although my friends get that about me, I can see how my behavior often leaves them in the dark and uncared for when I go through periods of radio silence until I figure myself out.

But due to the uncertainty of the visa situation I have not left the US since I moved here. I have not gone home to visit my family in 14 years. If I leave (even pre-COVID) there is a chance I wouldn’t be let back into this country or even my home country, or that my visa would be denied. I know of families on the same visa who were separated for months or years for trying to travel and re-enter. 

My boyfriend went abroad to his country of origin to visit his extended family for a few weeks. I knew I’d have a hard time because I’ll miss him, but I’m feeling unbearable pain and sadness. 

First, I’m the one who really needs 2 weeks off work for a vacation, but I don’t really have time to do so. This is in my control so I can’t be mad at him about that. 

Second, I haven’t seen my family in over a decade. If I leave, I could lose everything I’ve built here in the US. My grandfather died and we couldn’t go to his funeral. My mom has seen her parents once in the last 10 years. I’ve missed so many weddings and births of cousins. And it never gets easier. The holidays are the hardest because I have a huge extended family and I can’t be with them. Sometimes I break down because I miss my family so much and I want to go home, but then I remember why I left home in the first place. It’s not fair that US citizens can travel freely to any country. It’s not fair that my boyfriend gets to spend time with his family right now. I don’t want to be bitter but I feel so weighed down it’s almost hard to breathe. 

I know immigrating was my choice but I wish my citizenship belonged to a safer country. I wish I could travel the world freely or even just back home to visit family. I’m not sure if/when I’ll ever get to see them again. I’m not sure if I’ll even be satisfied when I get to see them because there is over a decade’s worth of hurt and pain already. In my experience this situation hurts so bad and feels so unfair, on the same level as me experiencing racism or getting raped. 

I don’t know how to cope. I’ve been in so much pain for 14 years but I try to be thankful for what I have. So if anyone has any tips, words of advice or resources or even just a listening ear I’d really appreciate it. 

If you read this far, thank you for your time.",16Aug2020,1
124,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",16Aug2020,1

127,"In My Spirit..... ""Me, Myself and I""

I tell ya having to stay home during this pandemic has brought me, myself and I closer and now we are all best friends again. My spirit couldn't wait to get me alone, He had so much to tell me.

Today I got a lesson from my garden. As I was pruning my tomatoe plant my spirit began to minister to me. I was removing the dead and toxic leaves so my plants could grow better and produce more fruit. I then realized that relationships of any kind also needs pruning. At some point you got to cut off toxic relationships and people.  If you allow that toxic  relationship to remain in your life it will sabotage it totally. Anything or anyone that meets this toxicity will also be affected and eventually become toxic to you also.

So now being at home and away from my normality, solitary is welcomed as a much needed blessing. I needed time alone and I've learned I needed to check my dam self lol.  I was off the chain with my eating habits, behind on my house cleaning, slacking in my bible readings, etc. Now I'm treating me better, I'm eating better and I'm realizing some stuff that needed to be called what it is okayyyy.

I realize what being still truly means. I often heard my granny say ""peace be still"" but never  really paid attention. I learned I had to let go and let God. I finally faced something I couldn't solve. When we are still thata when your spirit ministers to you. This is not a church experience... this is a me, myself and I experience. So chill out and see what your spirit is trying to tell you.",16Aug2020,1
128,Hi all. I guess I’m having a bad mental day and want to vent. Sometimes I wish I had no disorders and was “normal”. I feel like I’m just to much to handle and sometimes second guess my worth. I’m to hard on myself. I started meditating with an app today. We will see how it goes for the next few weeks. I know I’m not alone but some days it just feels like I am. Hope y’all are having a good day ❤️,16Aug2020,1
129,"So about An hour ago i walked into my room hoping to go to bed, but then it happened. The most terrifying noise you will ever hear, the sound of pure evil: the zooming of a wasp.

At first i didn't see it, but i followed the sound and saw it sitting in a corner with it's stripes of pure evil. A big wasp, like so big you can't even imagine, like nightmare fuel big. 

The first thing i did was close the door so it could not get outside anymore. I grabbed some piece from a cardboard box and folded it to the perfect murder weapon for this monster

As fast as possible i ran to the cursed corner, but it was gone. And right then it hit me: not only am i hunting it,  it was hunting me to.

I went completely silent and listened if i could here it zooming around, but nothing. Slowely i began to get scared of it, whas it in stealth mode about to f me up? Do they even have a stealth mode?

For about 10 minutes i just sat there, my life flashing before my eyes and the fear of death getting stronger by the second. But i heard it, a zoom i turned, i looked, i saw. Slowely i made my aprouch. BUT IT WAS ALL PART OF ITS PLAN!!

He saw me comming, the sneak. He flew away so fast i couldn't see where he went. But i saw it, just his big but crawling under my bed. This i considered an act of nuclear war.

I looked under the bed but couldn't see a thing, so i waited again. Slowely going crazy, i think i hear zooming but it is all in my head. Did i see him on the floor? No it was just some dust :(. I am scared.

OMG IT JUST FLEW OUT!!! I chased it for a bit, but it went back under the bed. I am really tired now and have already accepted death by giant evil wasp. I am going to bed now and hopefully die in peace in my sleep. 

Before going to bed i had the great idea of opening the door to my room and leaving on the light in the hall. As far as i know it did nothing. I hope i survive the night so i can one day tell my grandchildren about my part in the great war against wasps. But for now goodnight and hopefully t will see you tomorrow. Good luck",16Aug2020,1

132,"Only certain people make me feel comfortable enough to be myself. Like 95% comfortableness. It's not even me being shy and not comfortable enough to be myself. It's just that sometimes I don't even want to be myself around a certain person. 

So, I guess I like to open up to people who accept who I truly am, whereas for people who would change things about me I have no interest in opening up to. This also goes with people who judge me or piss me off.

I guess I just need some reassurance that being introverted, shy, and at times, closed off is ok. I will always try to go out of my comfort zone, but sometimes I can struggle with not thinking my personality is enough.",16Aug2020,1

134,"Today something happened that got me thinking about my social life, again.

I (M21) just got home after a while and got the news my roommate broke up with her boyfriend. Yesterday there came this handsome guy with a beautiful voice and comfortable scent at our home. But then he was shirtless in the kitchen, maybe the crazy hot weather, I thought. Then I discovered he slept here. A few hours ago my roommate was showering with him, it's something I feel like it's never going to happen to me. Many times in my life I've imagined how it would feel, and they just did it, in a matter of minutes as if it's nothing.

But it's only one of the hundreds of social things that looks like an impassable mountain to me and I find it hard to accept that it seems to simple when other people are social to each other. I have only one friend, Lukas, but I hardly meet him (wish we met more) and for four years now I still hardly dare to tell him how much I appreciate him, or I can't find the right words. The thought of possibly being in love with Lukas has driven me into a depression in 2016. I knew I wasn't, but it's also hard to decline given my feelings. I genuinely feel very happy to hear he has a girlfriend, or any other of his personal success. Maybe it's what they call platonic love, or at least something that's more valuable than a romantic love could be. To him I'm probably less important. I'm scared of losing my memories to him and I'm scared of the motion that changes everyone's character over time.",16Aug2020,1
135,"I think the title is straight forward But I'll add more details. 

I mean for example let's say you join a club it has a hobby of yours you enjoy and makes it easier due to resources and stuff. For example there was a art club near me with young people who were very socialize and talkative. In that club there was expensive and very high quality art material and also very good knowledge provided from the leader and other members. I would sometimes take the expensive and good art material home.
That's just one example. Another example is cooking clubs. They provide good ingredients, recipes, tools for cooking and if you make mistakes they tell you what went wrong and how to fix it. It's just overall MUCH better than doing it at home alone. The only bad thing is the socialization. 

Many Clubs and group activities make hobbies or development of skills easier and better and provide good Knowledge and experience as well. It's why I want to join. I wanna use the resources get knowledge and experience and improve my skills but I also dont want to befriend people and socialize. 

When you join how can you avoid people and remain unknown to everyone else? 
apparently people love new club members and are often curious about them and try to get to know them. If someone or more people go up to you and try to talk to you what can you say? I don't wanna come off as weird and unfriendly either because I wanna gain knowledge from others. 

Also obviously there's a pandemic going on so there arent many clubs and group and but I mean when clubs start again.",16Aug2020,1

137,"This is going to be a very long post, but I need to vent. I'm going to discuss the events surrounding the break-up between my now ex girlfriend. To make things more organized, I'm going to give a timeline of events to make it more understandable because there's a lot to take in.


* Tuesday, July 7th - My girlfriend (30F) and I (30M) broke up after a year of being together. She's the one that dumped be. It was on good terms and we decided to remain friends.


* Wednesday, July 8th - We are still talking to each other and taking it slow. We aren't texting a lot like usual, but that's okay. She also tries flirting with me. I found this a little strange, and the stuff she was saying to me seemed as if it was actually meant for someone else, but I thought I could be overthinking things.


* Thursday, July 9th - It's another good day. We talk and it's great. She then tells me she just found out she has a half-brother that she never knew about. She didn't tell me how she found out about him or how they even got into contact. They planned on meeting up at the park Saturday morning for a coffee. She also told me her new medicine is ""fucking with her head"" (she unfortunately suffers from PTSD, depression, and chronic migraines).


* Friday, July 10th - We talk a little bit during the afternoon, but it's not necessarily on good terms. We are arguing. I initiate the argument. The argument was about how she was going to meet her half-brother at the park, but she couldn't hangout with me because of the Covid-19 (a few days before we broke up). I thought it was stupid that she could meet this stranger in a public area, but couldn't come over to my place and hangout. She said that I was jealous of her half-brother. Here is a series of texts:


&gt; **Her:** It really seems like you're jealous I'm meeting a sibling. It's kinda fucked up, you make it sound like a romantic date ffs.


&gt; **Me:** I hardly said anything about it. You're overthinking things.


&gt; **Her:** Just because my half sibling is good looking you're jealous? Or is it the emotional distance?


&gt; **Me:** What the hell? I'm not even jealous. I just find it bs that you can meet him but didn't want to come here. I find it hypocritical. And it just makes me think you didn't want to see me or my parents. Oh well. I have to get back to work. My break is up.


Our conversation ends at 7:30 p.m. Why would she say her half-sibling is good looking? Four hours later at 11:30 p.m. I'm getting ready for bed. She texts me saying this: 

&gt; **I'm sorry. I have no one. I self harmed.** 

She starts asking my advice about meeting her half-brother, and then goes on a rant pointing out all of my flaws. I bark back because I'm upset she harmed herself and angry that she is saying a lot of negative stuff about me. She is also speaking incoherently and was high on anxiety medicine and weed. I keep saying ""whatever"" and the last text she sends me is, ""Hate me. Bye.""


* Saturday, July 11th - I text her when I wake up. I knew she had a rough night so I wasn't going to hold it against her. Here is the series of text:


&gt; **Me:** (9:11 a.m.) - Good luck with your meeting.


&gt; **Her:** - Wish me better luck for my stitches. And before you accuse me of lying for attention or pity (this is where she sends me the photographs).


&gt; **Me:** - I wasn't going to. You don't need to show me proof.


&gt; **Her:** - Sorry. I didn't see the last comment. I'm not going to see him (meaning her half-brother). 


&gt; **Me:** - Ugh. You need to check yourself in somewhere (I said this once I saw the photographs she sent me).


&gt; **Her:** - No. I don't want to talk. I hope you have a good weekend.


&gt; **Me:** - Fine. Don't do anything stupid.


&gt; **Her:** - Too late. But it looks worse than it is. I just need one or two stitches and I'm going to the hospital this morning.


&gt; **Me:** - You should tell them the truth when they ask what happened.


&gt; **Her:** - I am but I'm going with someone who isn't going to let me be committed.


&gt; **Me:** - Who's that? 


&gt; **Her:** - A friend.


&gt; **Me:** - Does your mom know what happened? 


&gt; **Her:** - I went to school with [insert name of friend taking her to the emergency room] and he has these issues too in the past. Yes, my mom asked him to go.


&gt; **Me:** - (9:31 a.m.) Okie dokie. 


&gt; **Me:** - (1:02 p.m.) I hope everything is going okay. 


&gt; **Me:** - (2:47 p.m.) Please let me know if you're okay and everything is alright.


&gt; **Her:** (5:24 p.m.) - It is. 


That was our entire conversation for the day. I was worried sick the entire day, because she sends me photographs of her harming herself, with blood strewn about everywhere. When I hadn't heard from her, I honestly thought she may have actually gotten committed. Truth be told, my mind was racing. I also found it interesting that she said this friend was taking her to the emergency room, because I admittedly got annoyed by him a day or two before all of this transpired because he was making a big presence in her life by liking her stuff on social media and whatnot. I didn't know if she said this ""friend"" was taking her to make me jealous or not. 


* Sunday, July 12th - I wake up and text her to see if she's okay. Still nothing. Two hours later she finally calls me in a frantic. She told me she didn't go to the emergency room because the guy that was supposed to take her got into an argument with her about politics, and it annoyed her so she told him not to bother. Subsequently, she went to the park alone to play virtual chess with people - a safe way to social distance but still have some kind of interaction. When she had her back turned, a random stranger ran up behind her and knocked her down to the ground. He tied her legs up and beat the holy piss out of her. He fractured her wrist, knocked her unconscious, kicked and punched her in the face, stomach, and more. Two witnesses saw what was happening and ran to her aide. The assailant got away. The police were called and she was sent to the emergency room. That is why she never responded to me Saturday aside from the ""It is"" text.


I asked if she got a good look at the suspect and she got angry at me because I didn't seem to care that she was attacked, and I was interrogating her like the police. I looked online, but was unable to find any news articles or anything about an assault at a local park. When she saw that I was doubting her story, she changed it several hours later. This time, she told me she did go to the park alone, but decided to call up her half-brother to meet up. They hangout and get to know each other. They discover they aren't related. Somehow, they end up making out. They also go walking on the trail. During this time the half-brother lost his keys and went to retrace his steps to find them. She decided to keep walking (why wouldn't she help look for them?). While he was away, that's when the stranger attacked her. One of the witnesses was her half-brother.

I don't know what to think. I'm angry and jealous. She lied to me about going to the emergency room. I also found the attack story quite unbelievable. She told me she filed a police report and was disputing it because the police classified it as an attempted robbery--even though she wants it classified as an attempted kidnapping/sexual assault. That's why the incident wasn't online or on the local news. That doesn't make sense. It would have been on the local news. The police would have informed the public about a dangerous person still on the run. I even checked the local crime blotter online and there was no phone calls made to the police at the time she said this attack occurred (between 10:00 am - 12:00 pm.). The crime blotter also provides the location and reason behind the phone call(s). There was nothing remotely similar to her description, or even in the vicinity. 


I'm even more angry now, because her story doesn't add up. My emotions are getting the best of me and I start calling her a liar and a cheater. I say that I never loved her, karma is a bitch, and what not. I start asking her for proof. I asked her to take a picture of her emergency discharge papers or her bracelet she would have gotten from the visit or her cast for her hairline fracture for her wrist. She refused by saying it was ""private and personal information."" I can understand that to an extent - but you can still provide a picture of a wrist band or discharge papers from the name of the hospital without revealing any personal details. To be honest, I felt an immense amount of shame after saying the things I did out of vexation and disgust.


Another thing that caught my attention was her replying back to me Saturday afternoon -- the day of the attack -- at 5:30 p.m. with the words ""It is"" when I asked her hours before if she was okay. Why would she tell me everything is okay if she got viciously attacked at the park? I asked her this question and she said it was because she was ""doped up on morphine and didn't know what she was doing."" She also said she wasn't able to get into contact with her mother. I don't buy this story, because her mother is always at home (medical reasons) and answers the phone. If she wasn't been able to get into contact with her, the police or medical staff would have.


* Monday, July 13th - I text her in the morning telling her I'm sorry for all the rude things I said to her last night. I then tell if her she never wants to see me again that is fine. I wish her the best in life, hope she's successful, and try to end things on a positive note. I felt better about myself. One hour later she texts me with a photograph of her face saying, ""Here's your proof. Bye."" I won't get into details about the photograph, but in my personal opinion it's make-up (my best friend thought so too). Maybe it's not; maybe it is. Nevertheless, I don't reply. What I do is go home, box up all of her belongings, and I go to UPS. They told me it would cost $50.00 to send the package off due to the weight limit. Instead of paying that much money, my father and I drove to her residence. I got out of the car, put her belongings on the front porch, rang the door bell, and walked away without saying a word. The whole scenario took less than 30 seconds. I then text her saying I dropped off her stuff, and she proceeded to call me a stalker. Another fight ensues, and the rest of the day turns into a disaster.


* Tuesday, July 14th - I had every intention of not contacting her again. It was around 3:30 p.m. and I was about to pick up dinner for me and my family. I check my bank account and I notice that she had used my card that day to purchase $82.99 worth of food via GrubHub. I lose my shit and I text her. Her mom calls me and apologizes and said it was a mistake. After the phone call I text her once again saying I'm very concerned about her state of mind and that I'm considering calling the police to do a wellness check. Her mother immediately calls me back screaming at me (I can understand why). Nevertheless, I do call the police to do a wellness check on her. After that whole ordeal, another fight breaks loose. It's another shitty night. 


Truthfully, I did a wellness check because I was actually concerned. She thinks I did it as a ""revenge"" move, but I genuinely didn't. She not only said her new medicine was messing with her head, but she got high, harmed herself, said suicidal things, made out with someone she claimed was her half-brother, got attacked (even if it's true or not, that's still a huge thing to bear), and used my card to buy nearly a hundred dollars worth of food, all within a four to five day period. Combine all of that with her unfortunate mental issues she sadly has to deal with, and yeah - I'm worried. 



With all of that said, I'm not exactly acting rationally at this point. Everything that has transpired was a lot to take in. I've never dealt with such an emotional roller-coaster before, particularly in a matter of days. Hell, I was still in love with her, and I wanted us to get back together. 


Over the next few days, I became paranoid and obsessive. I couldn't get over the fact that she harmed herself, told me she was going to the emergency room to seek help, lies about it, and decides to meet up with this half-brother and they begin making out. It was eating me at my core, and the attack story didn't help things either, because I had trouble believing it. I eventually called the police and asked them if [insert ex's name] filed a police report or if someone made a phone call about an attack and/or robbery at [insert location name and time]. They said nothing was called in by that person and no report had ever been filed. This solidified my suspicions, and I call her out on this. Obviously, it wasn't a pleasant conversation.


One week later, I'm still making the mistake of trying to get her back in my life, all the while being angry at her lying to me (I know, why would I want her after all of this?). I get on Reddit, and I notice she made a post on the relationship advice subreddit. This is her very first paragraph: 

&gt; ""I've (30F) been dating a guy (27M) for about three weeks. We spoke at great length for several days before going out. First date was intense, with a lot of ""I really, really like you!s"" exchanged, him telling me I was gorgeous about ten times throughout the day, and spending a significant amount of time together. More communication through text, then there was a gap in communication that was odd to me, however I chalked it up to his weird work schedule. But it felt like a test -- like, what will she do if I don't talk to her all day? Second date was good, however I smoked a joint I didn't know was a certain strain known for memory gaps -- amnesia -- and when we went to get sushi I forgot we had already ordered, and he said I shouldn't go in public stoned. Not sure if that was a dry joke or not. Either way, we agreed to not date other people if we were going to have any intimate relations, which we did. I think it's important to note that we have not had actual intercourse yet, although I did sleep over once.""


There's more to her post, but that first paragraph is what I want to focus on. She says in the post she has been dating this guy for three weeks. At this point in time we have only been broken up for a week in a half. She told me - as the timeline shows - that she found out she had a half-brother on Thursday, July 9th, and met him for the very first time on Saturday, July 11th. 

In the same post of hers, she goes on to say:

&gt; The issue is that I'm seeing red flags -- looking back, kinda felt like love bombing in the beginning. I've dated narcissistic people and I know that tactic. When I said I was excited to meet him pre-date he said ""your waves seem tighter than mine"", when asked what he meant, that I was more invested in meeting than him.

This is where things get interesting. She supposedly meets this half-brother of hers for the first time on Saturday, July 11th. However, in the Reddit post of hers, she clearly states that she is excited to meet him **pre-date.** This suggests to me that she knew all along he wasn't her half-brother, and told me some blatant lie to make things seem less suspicious. I called her out on this. When I did she immediately deleted the Reddit post, called me crazy, delusional, and that I have a personality disorder. She also said they haven't been dating for three weeks, and that she was just ""rounding up."" That doesn't make any sense. My suspicions are confirmed, though. She lied and cheated on me and refuses to admit it. Even if she didn't cheat on me physically, she had the intention to do so. She denies this completely. There's also other things I know for a fact she's lying about but she won't admit it.

Additionally, when she says in the post, ""your waves seem tighter than mine,"" that made me think about the conversation we had Friday night, during our argument. Prior to her telling me about all of my flaws, she asked me for advice. She sent me two screenshots of the conversation she was having with her half-brother and asked me what I thought he was saying (she thought he didn't seem that into meeting her). Here is the series of texts that were taken as a screenshot between the two:

&gt; **Him:** I'm glad you've out this much thought into drinking coffee. I wouldn't but that is me. I know where I'll be at it before 10 am lll.

&gt; **Her:** Lol, was that sarcasm? Am I freaking you out? If it helps I do tarot readings on a lot of things.

&gt; **Him:** It's not freaking me out. If we were waves yours seems a little tighter than mine about it is all.

&gt; **Her:** My waves will be less surfable. If that's what you think its groovy &gt;__O

&gt; **Him:** I bet I can. Its so close to D day for us that I'm trying to calm down and prepare mentally. I don't want a hundred million things on my mind tomorrow. Trying to forget I was in a wreck earlier lol. I'll need to fall asleep at a decent hour tonight.

&gt; **Her:** If there's too much on your plate plans can change. I wouldn't be put off.

&gt; **Him:** There is nothing on my plate. 10am sequiota. That's the plate. Then after that record shop and probably dinner at grandma's.

Now, at this point I have no reason to question her. There was no genuine reason for her to lie to me about this person being her half-brother. She asked me for advice, and what I thought this person was trying to say to her. This is the series of text following the two photographs she sent me of their conversation:

&gt; **Her:** Is he trying to cancel or say that he didn't care we're siblings

&gt; **Me:** I didn't see anything that he said was bad. He wants to meet you. He didn't say he wasn't ""less excited"". All he is saying is that he's trying to be safe about it, and cautious. And trying not to get his hopes up. He clearly wants to meet you. It's evident to me anyway. You're reading way too much into things.

&gt; **Her:** Why cautious does he think I'm bad person. I don't know why I'm asking you.

&gt; **Me:** No. He just doesn't know what to expect. Same for you. Finding out you may have a brother or sister, and never knowing about them, can be kind of terrifying.

&gt; **Her:** You never understood my depression self harm

&gt; **Me:** Don't start that.


Keep in mind - Saturday morning our conversation ended at 9:30 a.m. She told me she canceled the meeting with her half-brother (as evident by the messages I relayed) and was going to the emergency room with her friend so she could get stitches. Meanwhile, the meeting with her half-brother was supposed to be at 10:00 a.m. So, between our conversation ending at 9:30 that morning to 10:00 am, she got into an argument with her friend about politics, told him not to pick her up to take her to the emergency room, and then went to the park, all within thirty minutes. That sounds fishy. 

There's a lot more to this story. I said and did stupid things over the past few weeks. Inexcusable things. I was angry and jealous, and I couldn't make sense of anything. All of this was a lot to take in, especially in a short amount of time. 

Unfortunately, I still wanted her back. Maybe it was because of familiarity. I don't know. I started begging for her forgiveness for the things I've said, pleading for a second chance to work things out. I had to take a leave of absence from work because I was having repeated panic attacks and was performing poorly at my job. I would send her text after text being needy, clingy, desperate, angry, etc. I know that's unattractive and it only pushed her away more, but my mind couldn't figure out how to cope with the immense amount of stress.


She told me she needed space and if I really wanted to apologize for my actions then I would respect her wishes. I tried. I did nine days of no contact before contacting her again. During these nine days I was doing some healing. I was feeling better. I thought I could text her and actually be friends with her as she originally wanted, but that didn't work out. I got upset because I tried talking to her as friends, but she was short with her responses and didn't keep a conversation going. That only pissed me off more. I brought this all upon myself, however. I should have never contacted her again.


Also during these nine days of no contact she stopped dating this half-brother and went on a date with another person that didn't work out. I thought this might have been my chance to get her back. Once again, I unfortunately made the mistake of begging, despite her telling me she has no romantic feelings for me anymore and there is absolutely zero chance of us getting back together, but would still want to be friends. Obviously it didn't go well. I have officially pushed her away completely. 


I know I fucked up. I know I was desperate, clingy, needy and obsessive. I don't know why. Maybe it's because I know she's being dishonest about a lot of things and she won't admit it. However, every time I think I miss her I am going to re-read this post and keep in mind that she lied to me about this half-brother. She cheated on me and if it wasn't physically it was certainly emotionally.


What's even more disgusting is two days after we broke up and she told me about her half-brother she was asking me for advice on meeting this guy and I gave it to her, assuming they were related. Instead, she wanted advice because she was going on a date with someone she liked. Even if her attack happened - that doesn't negate the fact that she was dating someone new within four days of our break-up (although her Reddit post suggested it was longer than that), and obviously lied to me because what she told me and her Reddit post are contradictory. I deserve better.


She was speaking to this individual for several days before going out on the first date--meaning she was talking to him before breaking up with me, and knew all along he wasn't her half-brother, and she made up some ridiculous lie to me in order to deflect her guilt. It's a shame she won't be an adult and take responsibility for her actions, but I suppose that shouldn't matter to me any longer. And, of course, her relationship with this alleged half-brother is no longer a thing. A part of me wonders if he even knows about the half-brother aspect of this entire ordeal or if she spun a different story for him. It makes me sick to my stomach that she asked for my advice, and had the audacity to tell me it was her half-brother even though she knew it wasn't. What kind of human being can do that to another person?


I haven't spoken to her since Tuesday, August 11th. As I have stated before, she unfortunately suffers from PTSD. I won't get into every details as to why she suffers from that, but one reason why is because two of her (ex) boyfriends have committed suicide, while another boyfriend is in prison for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a minor. Out of frustration, the last thing I said to her was, ""Is that what you do? Get a boyfriend, make their way into their heart, and then break them so badly that they commit suicide? It sure seems like it."" Afterward, I blocked her number and deleted it from my phone. I know that was a very childish and immature thing to say, but I'm okay with the consequences. And if I'm being honest, these last few days of no contact has really made a positive difference for me, because I know my suspicions are true and my feelings are justified to some extent.",16Aug2020,1
138,"I am just a bit pissed off and need to take it off.

A few hours ago I posted in the unpopularopinion sub. I wrote about my views on africanism and some BLM activists’ behaviour towards Africa, from my African perspective. My first post was removed for trolling/being satirical (I wasn’t) within seconds, somebody else commenting also was like wtf.

I got no reply from the mods so I just reposted it giving it extra clarification. People started to share interesting views, agreeing and disagreeing, and I was learning about from them (learnt the world africanism). But, in an hour or less, my post was removed again, and I was banned and muted (so I can’t message the mods nor engage in the comments). 

It’s not a big deal. But I’m pissed I was censored and banned from discussion (and hear different opinions) when I didn’t break any rules.",16Aug2020,1
139," I never seriously care for such things, but when I started using reddit this karma thing got me pumped up really well. I didnt knew how to use the app properly and the sorting was done for hot posts. So everyone I saw had like a million karma lol. It was surprising an I just thought it must be like snapchat. 

I began my journey by searching a few prominent words i could think of like memes, porn ;), anime and stuff like that. That got me into the top tier subs. I just thought that its like owning a page with millions of followers and it will be a really fun ride. I will post lots of stuff and will get a lot of upvotes(i didnt knew it gave karma at that time). So I posted for the first time on the sub named r/memes. I thought that i would check again in a couple of hours and I’ll have thousands of upvotes, and it would be smooth sailing from there on. And dude I haven’t been this wrong in my entire life. 

I opened reddit and i see 1 upvote and one comment. I clicked on the comment and it was done by a bot. It said “your post has been removed for breaking ruleX”. I didnt even knew that rules existed and dang. I then saw that i had 2 dm requests, so I excitedly opened them and guess what? “ i saw you liked anime so mind subscribing to my youtube channel”. I was like wtf. 

This was a lesson for me and i decided to look deeper into posting on subs and what this karma exactly is. The more I learned, the more I realised that it is a freaking blood bath in here. Getting upvotes is like survival of the fittest. And dont you dare open the comments section, there are things you can’t unsee and they will haunt you for eternity. 

But I am glad I joined. After countless posts, and being banned from most of the popular sub-Reddits I have finally reached 10k karma. But this is as far as I go and fight harder my brother and their sisters, because the fight isnt over yet. Peace out✌️ . 

Tl;dr : This is the summary of my journey of how I earned 10k karms ;).",16Aug2020,1
140,"I think about it everyday since 1 week ago.
I really want to do it. I decided to visit my parents right now. They live in a city 6-7 hours away by car from where I live &amp; I think this will be my last time seeing them. I somehow have to say goodbye to them.
I bought the bus ticket &amp; I'm on my way to the bus station.
I'll spend 2 days with them &amp; then I'll find my peace forever.
I know they'll suffer but I don't want suffer anymore.",16Aug2020,1
