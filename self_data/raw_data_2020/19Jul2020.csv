It will be a normal horror movie gore,intense scenes, jumpscares, all of it right,but the murders weapons of choose a plastic knife, and it won’t work like a plastic knife it will stab like a normal knife but it’s a plastic knife. Like I said it will be a normal horror movie but the murder will have a plastic knife. And also in the trailer it will be a normal knife but then when people come to see and the murder shows up BAM he kills a person with a plastic knife they will all think “oh that’s weird, but I bet he will grab a real knife” BUT NOPE he just has a plastic knife.

5,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

6,"In 2019, in a somewhat unconscious way, I vowed to myself to stop thinking so negatively. I say “somewhat unconsciously” because I didn’t explicitly say this to myself, but it was a feeling in my gut and my mind kind of went with this mentality change. I used to really dig myself deep into a pit of depressive and negative thoughts and that behavior was self-destructive in my relationships. I don’t do it as much. Once in a while I will, like after a low moment, but I try to pick myself up in anyway possible after.

I’m quite literally taking a shit in a rest stop bathroom while driving across the state. But prior to this shit, I was having a very introspective drive. I just kept thinking about how much I’ve changed since the past and how I realized I let go of it. I didn’t *just* let go of my cringey past. I think I let it go months ago because I noticed how I don’t cringe over my past failures and awkward moments as much. Again, once in a while I do, but not nearly as much as I used to. I think I finally accepted that not only can I not change the past, but I can control my future, and am hella optimistic about it.

Idk why I used to think life was so shitty. Like, everyone has bad moments, but there are plenty of good moments that I remember more vividly than the bad ones. Idk why I dread over the bad moments when I don’t even remember them as clearly. I don’t even know what caused this change inside me, but, hell, I ain’t complaining. 

Sorry this post seems kinda vague. I swear to god I’m not on a substance or anything. I think I just wanted to post a stream of consciousness. I would note particular memories that bothered me or I found cringey, but I don’t know which ones to choose because they are all quite generic. A failed relationship? A botched job interview? A shitty high school experience? A stupid trend I followed? Idk. I think my point is that there really is no benefit to cringe over the past because nothing can stop you from taking control of your future right now.",19Jul2020,2

Now, I’m not one to assume that everyone thinks I’m attractive, for obvious reasons that this title implies, so I thought that maybe they were trying to look at something else in my general direction. They continued this behavior until I pulled down my mask to get a sip of water from my water bottle. From the corner of my eye, I see their smile disappear only to be replaced with a look of disappointment. To add salt to the wound, they ran their fingers through their hair as their face scrunches up in agony. They walk further away from me, and after a couple of minutes, I realize that they pretend that I don’t exist and won’t look in my direction anymore.

20,"Hey, Reddit.

As far back as I can remember, I’ve always been a black sheep in some form or another. It can vary from large, impersonal group gatherings to my closest friendships. It’s not that I’ve ever been deprived of friendships or social interactions in quantity, rather it’s that there’s a certain shortcoming in the strength and quality of these connections.

There’s a rotation between these long periods of time where I desperately crave closer connections and times where it doesn’t seem to bother me so much. Over the past few weeks, I’ve crept out of apathy back to this strong feeling of deprivation and it’s driving me crazy. I don’t know how to fulfill this social need, nor have I ever.

I’ve never been someone’s best friend. I’ve been very close with some people, but never to the point where they would consider me their best friend. I’ve never fully fit in among family or family friends. It’s *very* rare for me to have a truly genuine conversation or moment with anyone.

It takes a huge toll on me. There’s a crippling loneliness that I can’t run away from when it becomes prevalent. I’ve tried to circumvent this feeling by putting myself out there more, learning to better empathize with people, focusing on self-improvement, talking with my already-close friends more, and, as it got worse with time, taking part in online friendships and discord groups.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t keep going through life with this feeling weighing me down.

I just want to feel a close, honest connection. I hate that I feel like I annoy people as I try to establish this connection, like with every move I do something wrong – building a mental gap between us that I can’t see. I want to find someone who I understand and who understands me.

I want advice. I don't know if it will help or if I'll be able to apply it, because I think I may be hopeless, but I do want to at least try. I don't want this to be a pattern that continues to repeat and gets worse with time if I can somehow prevent it.",19Jul2020,1

28,"I just finished high school, and I may be going through a depressive state right now looking back at my high school years and thinking about how I have wasted it. I’ve been comparing my self to the ISEF and Intel winners. I’ve been depressed that I didn’t know about those competitions or even IMO (not that I could’ve succeeded in those anyways I guess :/). I’m basically mad at myself for focusing so much on irrelevant things in high school instead of trying to genuinely explore my interests. By irrelevant I mean how I looked, what people thought of me, who I was friends with, all those things that are such a big waste of time. ***To in high school right now, please BE YOURSELF and enjoy your time on Earth like there is no one else to make you happy except YOURSELF.*** I feel like if I had known things sooner, I could’ve gotten into a well known college instead of going to one of my lesser known state colleges. Don’t get me wrong, part of me likes my chosen state college it’s just that feeling of “what if it was better”^. On the positive side, I basically have 2 full tuitions to my current college (one which is covered by our state and another that the college offered to me as a scholarship). I wish I cared about colleges earlier in high school, too. I remember thinking as freshman that I’ll worry about colleges in senior year and just go with the flow in high school. I guess I was ignorant. I guess I was also lost and haven’t found any particular interests besides entertainment. I’ve always envied those that found themselves when they were young. Those that are really ambitious from a young age to be an officer in 36,363 clubs, get a 1600 SAT, get awards in those competitions I’ve mentioned before, do groundbreaking research, be a successful instrument player, find that sport they are passionate about and the list goes on. I wasn’t a bad student in any way, but I definitely could’ve been better. I fell in this pit hole from late May to mid June. I pulled myself out and was doing amazing afterwards. I decided to stop being a p*ssy and move on. Recently, I had a breakdown in the shower (it wasn’t about anything specific it was just those random urges of sadness we all get) followed by my dad yelling at me for something minor. It was all bad timing. Now, I find myself in that pit hole again, looking through the LinkedIns of people from Ivy Leagues, Stanford, and MIT. I don’t know how to pull myself out for good at this point. I don’t want this to keep happening. If it wasn’t for the coronavirus, I probably would be going to my campus for Fall term and maybe falling in love with my school enough to forget about past regrets. I guess right now I just feel stupid and hopeless.

I usually provide a TL;DR after every post because I know much that helps, but I really don’t know how to sum up my feelings besides just saying “I’m sad,” and that’s just not enough for what I’m genuinely feeling right now. I truly do understand if you can’t read my rant though. We are all going through tough times right now. Hope you have a good day!",19Jul2020,1
29,"This is going sound very selfish. And it probably is. 

Back in March, Canada went into lockdown. I was a college student finishing up year one, living in a dorm with his international student friends. Planning for a crazy summer, going to the gym, going at nightclubs and discovering the joys of being young, free and stupid. But that all went away really quickly, as it did for everyone. 

My dorm closed down. My friends couldn't stay in Canada and had to leave. Since they were on exchange, that meant they wouldn't be coming back next year. I had to move with roommates who were a lot older and that had very little in common with me. As the pandemic started settling in more and more, so did loneliness. My friends were all gone. I had only myself and my untreated OCD spiralling out of control. No one to see for almost 3 months, which honestly almost broke me. 

But eventually lockdown started easing. I could go out again but had unfortunately almost no one to see. So I wandered aimlessly. I went to spots where I would go with my friends and think back to the times where we would have each other and life was exciting. But then as this went on, my mind filled with regret and jealousy. Regret that due to my mental health I often pushed away friends and sabotaged my relationships with them during this first year instead of enjoying what I had at its fullest. And jealousy because I could see my friends enjoying their lives. They were back in countries that had dealt with COVID a lot better and lockdown is basically over. I watch their stories where they have barbeques, go to the beach, go to parties and have fun. I watch with envy people in parks that are my age who have friends and relationships here that I see them enjoying. And I realize I probably won't have that until this pandemic is over. 

My friends are gone. My classes have all gone online and I won't meet anyone for the next 6 months. I won't see my friends. I won't date girls. I won't enjoy college life. I won't see my parents. I won't have anyone to celebrate my 19th birthday with.

31,"Hey gang,

This is gonna be over personal caus ya know, fuck it. 
Summary statement: I think I'm in a depressive state and not sure what to do. 
Context: since covid hit the U.S. I have gone through some major things and I recognize that. I had covid and a not insignificant amount of time in the E.R.  my wife as well. My stepfather passed away. My grandmother had double kidney failure. My grandfather had a stress induced stroke. My mother broke both of her hands. I changed jobs. A lot has happened. And I don't think I'm processing well. I'm having disassociative moments. I'm doing my best to buckle down and do what has to be done (i work in what we would all agree is a pretty critical job) but I can tell something isn't right. And I can't tell anyone in real life without risking the mission, my marriage, or something worse. I don't want to worry anyone. I won't harm myself and I have the capacity to get through this. I just want somewhere to acknowledge in real words that I can feel the toll this is having. I don't like waking up. I dread every notification or phone call fearing the worst. I never see the woman who has kept me sane through all of this because she is a medical professional and on an opposite schedule. I can just feel my hope and joy fading and everything getting harder and as much as I want to say something, can't be another problem. I dread even writing this because of the non traditional trajectory of my life and the immense amount of judgement even that will bring.  I don't think there is anywhere else to say it, but I'm struggling. And I am just going to have to live with that. 
Best wishes friends.",19Jul2020,1

36," I come from a conservative country,  state, city and family, which in my opinion is the suckiest thing anybody ever has to suffer. Due to that, most of the things which people think and do are normal, aren't usually normal for us who come from a  conservative background. That's why you'll see us enjoying it lot more when we get out of that environment and enjoy it to the fullest.

In my case, it has to with the fact that i love and find women's [belly](https://imgur.com/a/0bkMpgh) very attractive. I don't care about the size of the boobs, neither the ass, Just the belly and navel. It usually is because we don't usually get to see a lot of women's skin (belly is like Haley's comet that you get to see it only once). And i am not blaming anyone, but i think that deep down women do want/like to expose their body in a way, but they can't do that because of their parents or because of the society. So you see, it's one of many reasons why people are conscious of their body  (Both male/female).

I didn't grow up like this. I found out that i like this when we used to have  Traditional day in our college (For the people who don't know, our college's arranged an annual gathering where girls wear saree and boys wear traditional outfit, to celebrate ""Traditional Day"", cause those outfits are considered traditional which no one wears during the whole academic year.) I came across the thought that whenever i saw every girl in our class, the first thing i laid my eyes (in a good way of course)  were on their belly, and after that,  i checked them out. I mean they used to look soo beautiful. I dunno if they noticed that or not, cause i am an introverted guy, and this kind of stuff is not usually discussed normally.

So i came to this  realization in my 3rd year i guess. And fast forward to now, all i do is just enjoy watching the bellies of the women/actress who flaunt it so gracefully. If i am speaking honestly, i haven't watched a woman in a bikini, so i guess i find saree more alluring (I hope i won't melt like ice cream when i'd have my first encounter with a woman in a bikini !  Finger's crossed.)

Ive given hundreds of dollars, driven thousands of miles, Ive changed my sleep patterns and consistently loose sleep, do things i hate, keep pushing myself so they can enjoy themselves, Sacrifice my own happiness and wants for their own. I do this all happily and expect little in return. 

But it seems like i dont even receive the little in return. The second i speak up and push for my way, i ask to be payed back, or i tell them ""lets do it later"", i get swapped out, or that they only want to hang out if its what they want to do. 

I feel as though the only reason i have the few friends i have is because i give and never stop. When i tell them this they claim they care about me, they seem genuine and they sometimes even apologize. But it never lasts more than a week. 

I feel like im just an emotional support human to be used, like im just a body to fill a space they need filled. Like it isnt ME they want, it's the happiness i make them feel.

I feel like all im made to be is the one thats supposed to fix their broken heart, fill the hole they desperately need filled, almost as if im just the person they choose to use until they can get back on their feet and make real friends.

My mom basically got given a codeine prescription cause of her bad back pain a few years back, but it happened to come at a time where her and my dad had really bad financial troubles. She ended up learning to use them as a coping mechanism for stress I suppose. I had definitely noticed a change in her over the past few years; she was way more irritable than she’d ever been, highly strung, always seemed stressed and a little anxious, would tune out of conversations, it was kind of like she wasn’t always present. Looking back the signs are really obvious something was up, she’s gradually not become herself over time, and I’m so upset with myself for not catching on sooner. I definitely did think she was taking more than she should, but I just really didn’t realise how fucking bad the problem was and didn’t think it was a big issue for her. Maybe I was a little in denial or something and just didn’t want to face what was happening, I dunno.

But she admitted to my family she has a problem, and that she wants to stop cause she’s sick of living like this. I just kind of feel numb about it all. It’s so hard to take in and I honestly don’t even know what there is to say, apart from my mom’s always been my rock and seeing her in a place where I kind of have to be hers is pretty soul destroying.

53,"So these are just a couple of my opinions regarding mandatory mask-wearing. At first, I felt very angry at those people who refused to wear masks for various reasons, and most of them are simply illogical and plain dumb, however recently I feel that the state shouldn't impose mandatory mask laws if there isn't a free or an easy way of getting them. Masks need to be changed frequently and if they are cotton made they need to be washed almost every day. Right now we are neck-deep into this pandemic and the demand for masks has never been higher and now they are anything but cheap. Just feel it isn't right to force your citizens to buy a mandatory mask that is very expensive without any help. What are your opinions on this?

EDIT: This post was not meant to say that we shouldn't wear masks, rather that they should not be mandatory if they aren't accessible. Many times I found myself going to the store to get some and they were out of stock.

57,"I've fallen behind in school, in making friends, in maturing and growing up, i still don't even believe i had a childhood, i feel like i was left behind in every aspect and only now am i piecing the puzzles together and trying to do something with my life, for a long time i didn't care and i felt like a dissapointment and was/still am depressed but now i do care, i want to do well, for myself, my future, my relationship. I want to try doing better, being better.


I don't care about disappointing my family, they can stick it.

I care about dissapointing any possible friends, dissapointing my partner, i want to surround myself with certain people and i feel like if i don't improve and work on myself then i'll be stuck surrounded by terrible people. 


I find it hard to be positive also which i think if i'm constantly negative it'll drive people away, but being positive is extremely difficult because i rarely feel positive. 


I'm constantly tired, i forget to brush my teeth sometimes, i sometimes don't shower for a day, my dishes pile up sometimes and i sometimes just don't get out of bed, i just stay there laying there all day...i really can't handle living alone but i know this won't be forever, eventually if my relationship works out i'll be living with my partner one day, i won't be lonely right? I'll feel alittle happier...because honestly even without the coronavirus i doubt i'd be leaving the house anyways since i'm by myself.


When i'm in a good mood i do really well with doing the chores in my flat, taking out the trash cleaning and doing my responsibilities etc.


I feel awfully lonely but talking to my boyfriend helps! Its just sometimes when he's busy i just get so depressed because i live in a tiny flat by myself (we are ldr atm) 

I would never leave him ever i love him he's the only person i feel comfortable being open and honest with and i trust him.. i just think coronavirus and living alone is affecting my mental health...even my boyfriend said if he moved out he wouldnt want to be alone.


I don't trust any of the people where i live, alot of them are really terrible and love drama and gossip so i can't ever talk about any issues with my mental health if i had friends down here, but maybe i'm just bad at picking the right ones.


I worry all the time if i'm a dissapointment, if i'm doing things right, if i'm being a good person if i'm being a good girlfriend and i worry alot..i wish i didnt worry so much.

67,"For context I am 23 year old guy living in Melbourne. I'm studying sports science/sports management and am in my last semester trying to figure out what to do next. I had some idea of a plan before this dumb virus hit and ruined everything. I almost had a job lined up with the sporting organisation that I've been doing casual work with each summer for 3 years but that definitely won't go ahead because they cut 3/4 of the field staff earlier this year.

So my current options are as follows: 

1. Study a masters of Sports Analytics, this is something that I would really enjoy studying and feel would be beneficial career wise and the skills I learn can be used in a lot of industries. However its a 2 year course and I'll be 26 by the time I finish. If I do this I miss out on the chance to work and earn some money. I don't really have much by the way of savings and house prices in Australia are ridiculously expensive. I feel like I won't have enough time to earn enough to save properly for a house if i don't really start working full time until i'm 26. 


2. Try find full time work within for next year and start being a real adult. Considering Australia has dealt with Covid relatively well there's still a fair amount of jobs going around and more will open up in the next couple of months. I'll likely be able to keep working as a casual with my current employer but that it very much up in the air right now as Melbourne has just gone into lockdown. This is also seasonal work because it's a summer sport and only really has work from Oct to Feb and minimal outside this. If i look for other full time work i won't be able to do any travel around Australia which is something that I really want to do and probably won't be able to juggle a full time masters at the same time as full time work


3. Go travelling for a bit around Australia next year and see parts of the country that I haven't already. This is something that I really want to do considering that international travel doesn't seem very likely for at least a year and a half. I also feel like if i don't do this soon i'll never get around to it and it will be too late and hard to find the time for it if I'm working full time. It wouldn't really be possible to find full time work and take leave because I want to go for at least a couple of months and see as much as possible.

So as you can see i'm pretty damn confused and stuck in a loop where I feel like whatever I pick i'm missing out on other things. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it and hopefully you guys will be able to help me out, cheers.",19Jul2020,1

Anyway my questions are the following:

1. why  do i look significantly better or worse depending on lighting in any  given place? (i´d say i drop about 3-4 points in attractiveness in the  worst pictures compared to my best pictures) which leads me to
2. is  it deceptive to only pick my best photos? will potential dates react in  a negative way if we meet and they feel i don't resemble what i  presented myself as in the photos?
3. what is my ""objective"" attractiveness level? how will others perceive me in real life, more like my worst pics or my best pics?
4. how  much does looks really matter? how much of a turn-off is it that i have  zero confidence? will my lack of social skills be a big deal?
5. how do i cope with eventual rejection without falling apart mentally?
6. how do dates ""work""? like what do you do? what do you talk about? maybe give me some general guidelines and pointers?

79,"I used to derive enjoyment from hobbies (drawing, animating, writing, archery, cooking, baking, video games etc.) though recently that enjoyment has diminished so significantly. I no longer look forward to doing these hobbies, and have stopped some outright. 

This has extended into my social and familial life, where I used to look forward to meeting with friends. I used to like lending a hand to friends or family, such as my grandmother, with tasks or favors. The joy I would get from all of these have gradually been on the decline. I still push myself to try the hobbies again (or start a new one), still lend a hand to family and friends, but it just doesn't feel as satisfying as I feel it should.

It's such a difficult thing for me to explain without sounding like an ass.

I consciously know that my friends and family appreciate me, they tell me upfront how important I am in their lives and how much they care for me, but I just can't say I feel the same level of care or love. Even though my relationship with my parents is rather hollow, I haven't been able to say ""I love you"" to either of them in years.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raahteam.raahtheapp

Sometimes we cannot focus on simple things and are blocked the entire day or maybe even weeks, because we have something in our mind which is bothering us and we don't have the correct person to talk to, without the fear of being judged. 

The purpose of this app is you can talk to someone and share out your frustrations, sorrows or just speak your mind.

You can also listen to someone who wants to be heard and feel glad that you just gave some time and attention to someone and made them feel better.

Despite having so much social media around do you feel you can truly express yourself or connect with someone?
 

All this happens while you remain anonymous. The app is purely text chat based no audio, no image sharing, no memes, nothing. Just straight text to help conceal your identity.  

Note: 

1. I am aware this concept may have flaws, talking to a stranger is not ideal or advisable but for topics like breakup, job loss, feeling worthless it does help talk to someone and get motivated.   

2. Raah is not a replacement for a suicide hotline/ professional therapy/ counselling. 

3. We only use the phone number for verifying if you are a real user and for protecting users against trolls. If you have any ideas on how to protect this platform against trolls please do reach out to us. 

4. We plan to delete the chat data every 24 hours unless an incident is reported for moderation purpose. We have done our best to keep our data secure.

5. Raah at this stage does not support end to end encryption yet, but we do want to add it soon. 

6. We are still in beta phase right now so if you find any bugs, have any suggestions or feedback do send it to us at https://raah.app/feedback.

123," Buddha"" Hope is one thing bigger than Fear"".  
A Coin has only value when it is 2 sided, head and tail, one sided coin can't buy anything and has no value. Same way life is only complete when it is whole, by whole I mean there will be nervousness, sadness, fear, anger and greed as there is happiness, peace, goodness, compassion and love. We only know the true value of one side when other is present, as you will only be certain about the head when you can see the tail.   
Important question is how we take things and react to them? This is what we are ignorant about, which in turn makes our life problematic. For eg. If you compare a flower with great aroma and looks with another flower with no smell and looks then obviously our reaction is not optimum and right. Same way the outcomes which are not pleasant on our body and mind we just try to run towards which gives us pleasure. but by definition both are outcomes. Our love for one sort of outcome and fear from other is what bringing the trouble. Learn more about what to be aware of and how to raise awareness, [click here](https://www.calmmindpower.com/post/awareness).  


 There is no harm in looking for happiness, love and peace. But the way we are looking is not right. We are allowed to look, but making judgments while looking is incorrect. The right way is to look without making judgments and attachments. Outcomes which brings disappointments, nervousness, sadness, fear they becomes depressions, anxieties and panics only because we become scared of them and retaliate them and just want outcomes which brings pleasurable sensations. Problem is, this is just half of the reality and that is why we suffer.  Living the life in this manner we make biased experiences, now we have this amazing ability to make memory. We keep on storing all in our mental database and eventually this ignorant way of living makes these problems coming back and just haunt us again and again. Even if you feel you have gotten rid of them, still they come back.

 A big mistake in itself is ignoring the fact that 99% of things which are happening are out of our control. Means expecting one certain type of outcome from your actions when its probability of happening is just 50% ( Positive 50% and Negative 50%) is a recipe of disaster only.   
What is the right question, is there a way of converting this 50% probability into 100% certainty. Certainty  of happiness, pleasure and not get affected by depressions, anxieties and panics . The Answer is a BIG YES, its very much possible. HOW?  


 Before we discuss the HOW part, let me tell you, we don't even know sometimes we get attached to negative outcomes as well, like loneliness, sadness, anxieties, as we don't know how to accept them and let them go rather we just think about them all the times, get scared of them constantly and keep them close to our heart.  Furthermore, as mentioned above now this ability of body to make memory comes into action and we are stuck with bad sensations in a similar way as good sensations. If we do learn how to see things rightly and remove this cloud of ignorance, then these problems will keep on haunting us forever.  

Let's learn the HOW to do Part.  


 We have learned, that most of the outcomes are not in our control like 99% of them, plus mostly what we do is make attachments, judgments,  don't use Power of observance, do not accept negatives as part of life, don't train ourselves on how to see the sensations arising on our body and don't know what is the rightful way of taking feelings &amp; emotions,  how to train our mind for letting go of the memories we have made over time while being highly reactive and controlling. That is why we end up in disappointment and anger because we just knowingly running towards probable 50% of pleasure not the 100% of ultimate happiness and peace.   


 1. Accept: Accept outcomes are not in our control, accept there will be feelings which will not bring pleasant effects, accept the incoming scary emotion as a part of life, accept disappointments and sadness will be there so not being afraid of them or fight their existence, as when you fight those thoughts they lead to depression and anxiety. Accept that we try to control everything around us,  accept that things change all the times, everything is impermanent so there is no merits in making attachments, accept that bad sensations are integral part of life and don't be scared of them, accept we react out of ignorance. This acceptance will  take lot of pressure off your system, as you will stop this running towards one thing and away from one thing.  


 2. Let Go: This should be the ultimate mantra of life, which is to let go as soon as possible. Let go of the hurt you been keeping in your heart, because believe me the person or event responsible for this hurt is not even aware or care of what he has done. Let go of the pleasure you obtain from making attachments, because in bigger picture, it is just making you handicap and addicted, let go of your attachment towards negative thoughts also, drop all the thoughts which bring fear, leads to depression &amp; anxiety.  Just let go of the fear it brings along with them and take them as part of life. 

 3. Observe the sensations: We make perceptions based on the sensations we receive on our sense doors. Eyes, Ears, Nose,Tongue, Body and Mind, so whatever input comes on these sense doors, they make a contact with us in terms seeing, hearing, smell, taste, touch and thoughts. Based on this contact we generate sensations, which then in turn results in pleasant or unpleasant feelings and that is what is responsible for us making attachments. We can stop this at the very beginning by just introducing one small skill  which is called Observance.   
 Means when the touch happens and sensations gets produced, just observe that step and stop the formation of judgement right there. Increase your observance power and the best way to do the same is by increasing your listening skills. So listen more and talk less, also be mindfulness in everything you do this will definitely help you take things the way they are and won't scare you.   


 4. Meditation: Want to learn more about your mind and thoughts, then start doing meditation. So many ways to do meditation, like sitting, walking or lying meditation. Follow guided meditation sessions available widely on YouTube and other places.   


 5. Compassion and Kindness: If you love yourself, than first and foremost thing, to do is forgive others and forgive yourself. What's done is done, increase the strength of your morality and stay away from bad actions and bad intentions.  Don't repeat the mistakes or go down the path of bad action. Live a life of discipline, ethics and morality. This will bring strength in your heart, so forgive more and be more kind, compassionate plus less prone to problems of sadness and depressions.  


 I just want to say, problems are integral part of life, we cannot escape from them. There will be days when you will be highly anxious, depressive or surrounded by disastrous thoughts. But if you learn your mind and remove that cloud of ignorance then sky is  limit for your happiness. So 100% or ultimate happiness is living normally, peacefully and calmly even in the presence of depression, happiness no matter whatever the outcome is , without getting affected by them.

124,They HAVE to support this since they are clearly so dedicated to the principle that law breakers deserve what they get.  (As long as they aren't super rich and willing to cleanse the dingleberries from Trump's taint with their tongues).,19Jul2020,0
125,"First of all, we used to live in a one room apartment. The door opened into a shared hallway. We had a bathroom and a small kitchen but that was it.

I dreamed that we were still in that old appartment and we were sleeping in bed. Then I kept hearing noises in the hallway. It was people and I got scared. They were allowed to be out there, but the second they come through my door, we're in trouble.

I sleep with an entrenching shovel beside by bed. I didn't then, but my shovel was there where it is now in relation to the bed. I picked it up and I put it in the bed with us.

I could feel the steel and the rust and the wood along my side. I could feel the handle in my hand. I had it under the covers with myself. Then the door was open (I think I saw our actual bedroom door open.)

I jumped out of the bed and I went to swing my shovel. So hard that it would hurt someone even if they blocked it. What happend is I couldn't swing the shovel. My arm wouldn't move. I was terrified and thought perhaps it was caught in the bed clothes, even though the resistance was much too hard for this.

I woke up still laying in bed and the shovel beside the bed where it's been since I last touched it. 'That was weird.' Little did I know.

Next thing I know I'm asking my sister who's giving us a ride to school. (I haven't been a student at any physical school for 20 years.) She said that her ex-husband was because he didn't care. She said his full name.

Then I was getting out of my bed neaked as a jay bird and my sisters ex-husband was laying where my wife was. I thought; 'that's weird; why would he get onto my bed with me in it if I was neaked.' Of course this didn't matter to me and I don't confront him because that's the dream.

Then we left and half the people who were with us disapeard without explanation. We never ended up at any school. I woke up again.

I never have sex dreams. I've had maybe 2.5 in 37 years. I've ran a good line and all the girls from highschool feel comfortable being friends with me on Facebook. I know why. I'm harmless. I have pictures of my So and my kid on there and so do they. I've never had sex with them or any of their friends and I never post bullshit.

I started playing this game. This girl I know from high school plays as well. I had one class with her and my sister was friends with her brother. We've been beating the piss out of each other for the past 2 days on this game.

I am in a house where I've never been. Very nice house. It was sortof a parlor room. Couches and chairs and nice wood on the floor and walls and nothing else.

There she was in flesh and bone. It really felt like we were room mates. We sat on a couch in this room that doesn't exist and we had the nicest conversation.  

I was a perfect gentlemen, even in my sleep. She was so nice to me. I woke up.

I've dreamed of dead relatives. Especially my mother's brother. It felt the same way. All I thought was that it was so nice of her for stopping by.

That was some weird ass dreams.",19Jul2020,1
126,"Good i idea?

I’m thinking of making a horror movie right. It will be a normal horror movie gore,intense scenes, jumpscares, all of it right,but the murders weapons of choose a plastic knife, and it won’t work like a plastic knife it will stab like a normal knife but it’s a plastic knife. Like I said it will be a normal horror movie but the murder will have a plastic knife. And also in the trailer it will be a normal knife but then when people come to see and the murder shows up BAM he kills a person with a plastic knife they will all think “oh that’s weird, but I bet he will grab a real knife” BUT NOPE he just has a plastic knife. Let me know your thoughts about this you think it would be a good idea?",19Jul2020,1
128," I've been really upset and feeling depressed all day, and I think I just need to talk about this. I really care about my family's wellbeing and our ability to get through this pandemic. I'm especially worried about my mom, because she has conditions that make her more likely to suffer from the virus if she gets it. One day I sat down with her and my siblings so I could talk to them about disinfecting stuff and going out less, for groceries and essential stuff. They seemed like they agreed and understood me.

But the other day my brother told me he was going out for groceries, and I believed him. He came back with nothing, and I have other reasons to believe he went out on a date with someone instead. And I have a feeling that hes done this a couple times since quarantine. I got mad at him, and he kept denying it but I know he was lying. He doesn't want to admit that hes wrong or change what hes doing, and doesn't care that I'm upset.

And my mom, well, she really doesn't care that I'm upset either. She made fun of me yesterday for being so upset and worried, when just a week ago it seemed like she really took me seriously. I'm not going into details about what she did, but it just really stung coming from my own mom. I wish we could just talk about how I'm feeling instead of her making fun of me and insulting me for what I think would be safe. She also keeps trying to take my siblings out all the time for things. I feel really isolated from my family right now and we're pretty much ignoring each other. They don't listen to me when I try to explain why I'm upset with them, and no one cares when I am. On one hand I'm mad at them, but on the other hand it hurts. I think that my family, especially my mom fits into [r/toxicparents](https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/) just because of a LOT of things that shes done and said in the past. But I still can't get over how much I love and care for her, and for the rest of my family as well. I feel so conflicted between cherishing the time I have with her, and also standing up for myself and not letting her affect my mental wellbeing. I just feel emotionally spent right now. They make me feel like I'm being paranoid, and maybe I could be. Though that doesn't really change how unimportant and disposable they make me feel sometimes. Like I shouldn't be taken seriously. I have no one in real life right now that would listen to how I feel and take me seriously, so I guess I'm here.",19Jul2020,1
129,"I (32F) live alone and have been isolated for months. My best friend lives across the country (US) and we have a very strong relationship. We both wanted to see each other and when the country started reopening I booked a flight. We deliberated a lot but finally decided it would be ok. I wore a mask the whole time and was super careful, but my connecting flight was completely packed and I was stuck middle seat. 

Two days after I arrived (yesterday) I developed a sore throat and low grade fever. We decided to go get a Covid test today, which I did, but it will be 2-7 days before I hear back. This morning my fever was gone and I felt great, but as the day progressed my fever has come back and is at 100.6 now. 

I feel awful, not just being sick, but that it’s my fault. I shouldn’t have flown during a pandemic. My mom scolded me about it. My friend has extreme anxiety bc we’re living in a one bedroom together and she’s obviously been exposed. Also just her personality- she has anxiety in general and gets worked up about everything. So I feel like I can’t express how I feel because I have to be strong for her (this has become all about her even though I’m the one that’s sick- she’s cried multiple times about it), and really have no one to talk to. I feel so lonely stuck in her apartment feeling sick and feeling so guilty and horrible for the stupid decision I made. 

I might not even have Covid plus I’m young and so is she so most likely everything will be fine, but you never know. We are isolating and quarantining together obviously.",19Jul2020,1
130,"Shall I just be the lonely stoner I am, or shall I try make friends, whenever I have it’s never worked and it makes me quite sad, (posting on porn account to add to my sadness for a view of how sad I am). All I do is smoke weed and I ask a “friend” who I was best buddies during my younger years for a smoke and ik he smokes weed and he says no, he didn’t even try to hide it just a simple “I can’t be arsed to see you”. If I was beaten up or killed I genuinely think no one would care except my family.",19Jul2020,2
131,"My whole life, ever since I could remember, I wanted to be a writer. Other kids have a tough time figuring out what they want to do when they grow up, but not me. I was absolutely certain...from about age 9 up to...well, this year.

This year I decided to give more of my life to writing. I gave up a soul-sucking full-time job for a more flexible, part-time one so I would have more time for my writing. I've experienced more writing growth than I've ever had, but I'm not sure if it's actually making me happy.

I landed several publications, but the publications don't make me happy. In fact, I'm content to just bury these achievements and never look at them again. Like I don't deserve them.

I wrote a really strong story. Everyone is telling me to publish this story, that it will probably get into one of the ""big"" pubs like The New Yorker, Granta, etc. They might be right, but the story touches on some political stuff, and I'm irrationally scared of the backlash. (Only the very tiny literary elite reads short stories, so I doubt it will offend people on a mainstream scale even if the NY'er publishes it.) So my story is just sitting here, gathering dust.

YA Twitter is not a nice place. I am terrified of cancel culture—and I don't mean in the same way as JKR. Cancel culture affects small-time creators and emerging artists too, who are slammed down early in their careers for having made genuine mistakes. I'm terrified of making a mistake, however well intentioned, and having this affect my career.

I'm scared of being famous. I know, this doesn't make a lot of sense, but hear me out. I'm scared that if I do become a successful writer (which is technically my goal) I won't be able to deal with the responsibilities of fame. I'm scared I'll say something stupid, get cancelled (again), or even hurt someone.

Writing once made me happy as a kid, but I'm no longer a kid. I'm not sure if it makes me happy anymore. I feel like I just keep doing it because I've always done it, and I feel 'obligated' to continue because I made such a bold choice early in my life. And we should finish what we start, right? Right?

When I ask myself what I can do to make myself feel fulfilled...I draw a blank. I honestly don't know. I used to think writing could help make the world a better place, but it's not the only way to help make the world a better place. I can just get a normal job, pay my taxes, and donate my money and time to good causes. Be an informed citizen and help the world in my own small way.

I just feel really, really lost right now. I'm sitting in my desk staring at my work and utterly frozen. I've never had this feeling before, not to this extent at least, and I'm terrified that it's a permanent feeling and not just a passing one.

Thank you for listening to me vent.",19Jul2020,1
133,"This might sound confusing, so read to end to understand. Also I want to make it clear, I don't want to boost my ego or something, and just want to share this interesting story from my childhood, plus I do not support Nazi regime in any way, I'm just fan of history and at that age they were subject of my interest.

When I was around 12 years old, history of world war 2 cought my attencion. After few months of playing videogames and watching movies about WW2, one day for fun I started to write in my diary what I would do in positions of Nazi generals. I written about groups of tanks, mechanized infantry (trucks and motocycles) and mechanized infantry (armored cars) that will quickly break through enemy lines and create chaos and confuse enemy, thanks to their speed of movement compared to regular infantry used by enemy. (This is not litteral description, becouse diary was lost). Then I just drawn few images and forgot about it. At this point I only knew about weapons and vehicles used, almost nothing about actual strategies and how the war went.

Fast forward few years, and dozens of ww2 documentaries later, I discoveret that diary and that theory. I was almost stunned. It was simplified description of strategy Nazis used to conquer most of their teritorry in WW2. For context  it was called [Blitzkrieg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzkrieg) and it consisted of contentration of tanks, motorized infantry and mechanized infantry to quickly break through enemy frontlines and advance deep in enemy teritorry. Funny thing is that before I wrote it, I haven't heard almost anything about WW2 and there js no chance I already heard about jt somewhere. 

When I showed this to my parents and friends they did not care to listen at all, so I just wanted to tell somebody. Thank you for taking time reading this.",19Jul2020,1
135,"  
I don't like to think about the future (Here I am though) I can't imagine a lot of people do, but maybe it's just me. A year from now where will I be? 10, 20 years? Sometimes I envy my parents, then something grabs hold and pulls me back, something I don't have a word for. I know I have people to turn to, I know who really has by back (I'd never tell em' though) 

I'm afraid I'll find myself in a place where I have nothing, friends leave, no home, family, love, it all moves away, a little bit each day. It's funny being so prideful about being alone when I'm confident I hate it, more than anything, sitting here alone with my thoughts, spinning around. I hate it.  
I look forward to work; Day in, day out. It's like a mobile game daily reward ""Ok, today I woke up and made a buck"" that rewarding feeling, no... It's more like a task, not good, not bad, just a thing that needs to be done. ""I did the thing"" Wake up ""Do the thing"" And so on and on it goes, trying not to think about what comes after the daily.   
I might think ""I could've"" one day, but the person I am now won't. I hope who I become remembers why and isn't to hard on himself, assuming I get there, become that person. I envy my parents.",19Jul2020,1
