1,"My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer yesterday and it has spread to his liver and lymph nodes. Me and my family are beyond devastated. 

He starts chemo tomorrow and they think it'll give some years to him if the cancer responds. 

It feels so weird talking about it, I never would've imagined this. Knowing this diagnosis will eventually take him albeit next week or next few years, I feel so much guilt. 

I'm 26 and he's 56. My dad will never see my wife or kids. There will be so much I'll miss having him see in my life. 

Not only that, but I feel so guilty that I'm healthy and will continue my life without him being alive. I'm sick to my stomach thinking of it. 

Any advice reddit?",23Oct2020,1

Title is weird but what I mean is, I like Reddit. You can just share information that pops into your head (like this post) that no one really cares about and if it’s important the people close to you already know. With this site/app you can just tell at people and hope they hear you. All while being “anonymous”. 

This concludes my ad for Reddit. Next up our soonest shadow raid legends.",23Oct2020,1

My husband sometimes feels like a replacement for her and if I told him that hed probably make stepbro jokes.

When he plays around me with and make jokes it feels like im hanging with her because they are way to similar in that aspect.

When he runs his hands through my hair it reminds me of when my sister use to do it when I was sad.

Hes extremely close to me and just makes me feel safe when im with him like she did.

5,"I have SAD. Seasonal depression disorder. Where in the winter, my mood will drastically decrease because the sun which i really love, wont show for weeks or months. I'll be in a constant cycle of depression

I just know this winter and season, I will be SUPER depressed. I'm scared for my well being, for my mental health and for my life. Because im suicidal. I'm scared what will happen to me in November to March. Or everyday. Because im living with two toxic people. My dad and my brother. 

Another bad news, my dad started being with that gold digger again. The bltch who used him. I found out about it tonight. Yesterday, he offered me to come with him to the city for an errand, i said yes. Then tonight, he lied to me that he will be in the meeting the whole time when we will be in the city, an excuse, a blatant lie. I was so excited to go. But looks like....never mind. He will just go with that gold digging bltch and maybe that random kid she always clings to, he will just replace me with that girl kid and that bltch- and play house with them. Live in a fucking facade and leave the broken things he has caused , be swiped under the rug. And when he comes back, he will be here sure, but emotionally, I will feel alone. Again. Alone in another winter season. I tried to kill myself this last winter....ha. January 1st 2020. I wanted to hang myself in the woods. 

And now....this is all happening again. Maybe I will get a ""Happy new year"" empty text message again, from my dad while he's out there with that golddigger, spending the new years with her instead. I sound like that girl with 'dad issues'? Whatever dad issues mean. Dad issues, except the sexualized part fuck that. I dont know. Im disgusted 

I have no friends. I dont want one anymore. Its useless. 

My mom is dead to me now.

My relatives are also dead to me. 

I have no one now. 

Can't wait.... can't wait for the winter to come. This winter is going to be hell on earth for me. 

I will be eaten up. 

I will endure more bullying. 

I will be alone. More alone. More alone. And more alone. 

I wish it peaked, you know? To have the courage to finally leave everything behind. This shit has been with me since 2015. 

I just want to leave.",23Oct2020,1

I look fucking 19 according to everyone and I still get called ugly in adult hood. Like people OPENLY call me ugly. What the fuck.

I’m still the fucking lame guy at work who thinks everyone is genuinely being nice when in reality I get word that so and so is actually talking so much shit about me. Idk I’m insecure about a lot and don’t even feel “right”. My last ex said “ as a black man you don’t have insecurities to me” which made me feel more insecure about showing insecurity. I fucking hate myself I wish I’d explode and not feel the pain, like just detonate. I can’t stand the fact that I am so ugly, undesirable and unattractive. Actually, I can stand this, I hate that I keep THINKING ABOUT IT and keep wanting a relationship and sex. All my manly fucking manly men guy friends get laid and hit on by chicks and here I am secretly paying fucking sex workers once every pay period to get sex. I’m so pathetic.

7,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence",23Oct2020,1

Where I live, we have three garbage bins right next to the post boxes so people can take all these flyers of bullshit that was delivered to them and toss them into the garbage.  At the end of the week, all three bins are overfilling with garbage.

If postal mail wasn't so cheap, companies and business would rethink these marketing strategies.  If these things costed an arm and a leg, mail wouldn't be so indiscriminately used.  People would only send large packages or necessary mail.   We also wouldn't have such a garbage service that routinely loses mail, has US voting ballots routinely tossed onto the side by some ass bag mail carrier, have cases of mail carriers who just decided to say fuck it and hoard all the mail.

16,"I absolutely hate that everything that makes conservatives uncomfortable results in this big song and dance about how ‘the left’ or liberals hate the US. 

A truly great and free country allows it to be open for criticism. You are far from perfect. Your systems and politics is far from perfect. Your society and culture is far from perfect. You can criticise these things and wish for improvement without hating the country or being accused of hating the country. 

I hate that just because you criticise the police forces that you suddenly hate all police. Most people do not hate the police but it’s clear your police force has some glaring issues when relating to the excessive use of force particularly against minorities. You can stand up for a minority that are clearly being disproportionately targeted and harassed. It’s clear to anyone with a brain that some police forces have huge culture issues and that they simply have failed your citizens. 

I hate that you think that you can just tell your athletes and those with influence to just shut up and play when they are the few within minorities  that actually have a public podium to speak out. You are so quick to hate black athletes who stand up against your bullshit racist culture and speak out against mistreatment and justify it by saying they should just play the sport they’re paid millions to play. Fuck you. They can say whatever they like or act however they want, none of you even acknowledge there’s issues. Watching Brett Favre speak yesterday was cringeworthy and you’d have to be a moron to think like him. So many of you are so stupid and uneducated that you have zero idea what happens in reality. You’re so selfish, self centred and ignorant it makes me sick. Fuck you all. 

I also hate that you are so fucking obsessed with your stupid flags and bullshit chants like the pledge of allegiance. You people are freaks the way you carry on about that shit. It’s seriously cult like and creepy. The only country that carries on like you do about all that bullshit are places like North Korea. You look so stupid constantly waving that shit around on everything. You are all so fucking cringeworthy and gross it’s so weird. You are brainwashed morons. Anyone who speaks out against you freely you hate because you can’t hack that you’re wrong about so many things. 

If you vote Trump you vote for more of the same bullshit. Your country has been taken back 40 years. Who would think in 2020 you’d have to justify a sitting president defending white supremacy. You are all fucked in the head. Wake up you greedy, fat, selfish cunt Americans, you’re a part of a big wide world that you love to fuck around with. This is more than just you clinging onto some fantasy that you used to be this amazing country. You never were. You just say it all the fucking time ignorantly and arrogantly that you have no idea why you even say it or believe in it. You could improve so many lives in your own country and around the world if you were willing to be open to some criticism. 

You have the whole world watching and it’s just sickening to see how cult like and wilfully ignorant you choose to be. Don’t be a moronic American and just grow up and realise you’re far from perfect so stop pretending you are. Improve the lives of all Americans and not just the rich white ones with power. You’re never going to be as rich and powerful as them and the moment they can disown you they will.

23,"I have no one to talk to. I had a previous life of failure and depression. I worked so hard to get rid of the bullying and toxicity that came from the trust-fund babies who attacked me because of my financial state. A couple hours ago, I got a call from one of these toxic student’s mother. She accused me of something crazy, hacking and holding her daughter’s nudes hostage. I haven’t talked to anyone from my high school since I graduated early. These party animals were my friends at one point, seeking their acceptance by joining their varsity sports. It was obvious that I wasn’t accepted and I was cool with that. I had my lover, science. Although even then, I wasn’t accepted by the elitist students who could afford private programs and teams. I could still live with this isolation, it was me jamming on my laptop trying to learn about data science, bio, and quantum computing. My tolerance quickly dwindled over time and my existence seemed unnecessary. That is when I decided to graduate early and perhaps work towards an acceptance to my dream school. At the moment, I’m following the non traditional route of medicine with computer science as a major. I have this trajectory of success so I can transfer and get into medical school. That is until today when I received a phone call from that one toxic person. I don’t know why but I was brought up as the suspect of hacking this person that I just don’t know that well. Although I describe her as toxic, it’s only because of the people in her friend group that I associate her with. Besides that, I thought she was really sweet. Her mother takes the phone and she tells me that they have a lot of money and they’ve hired multiple Private investigators  and will ruin my life. This sounds like crazy talk but I swear to god I feel like I’ve been followed for the past couple weeks. I was studying at a Panera bread and even then I saw a car follow me as I walked home. I told the mom that I did nothing but she was persistent. I don’t know why but I just broke down and sobbed on the phone. These atrocious things would eventually get to my mother. How would she look at me for something I didn’t even do? How does Pakistani kid hacks rich white girl look on my resume when I apply for uni or a medical mentor ship? I had to ask her “why me?”. She didn’t give me a straight answer. She told me that there are rumors that I’ve hacked another girl’s account in eighth grade. I had to tell her that I’m a disabled student and I had to work through rehabilitation to develop normal fine motor skills. At that time, I was drowning in simple school work because my hands were vestigial lol. She didn’t care. I even tried helping her. I cannot hack instagram or Snapchat. I am a cs student at a community college who is focusing on deep learning. Idk what Hollywood garbage she wants from me. These are BIG tech companies spending millions on cyber security. I don’t have the knowledge to penetrate something like that. When she spoke more about investigating me, she knew my gpa, she knew my home address, she knew what programs I was in. How? She has been spying on me. I feel like someone is watching me now. I got a call from the kid’s boyfriend. He’s threatening me violently. I don’t know what happened in these past two hours but apparently I called the police. The police came over and my mom and the office looked at me like I was some weirdo. While I started spitting about what happened, I realized how weird I truly was. Why would I call the cops? I feel crazy I don’t know who to talk to. Over the past couple months I’ve been feeling this sadness I can’t explain. Maybe, I needed religion in my life. I picked up the Bible and Quran. Read them both and it was actually working out. I met this friend who I just admire. She’s so cool. So involved with her community and has many extracurriculars she juggles. She’s like my role model. I didn’t want to fuck it up so I tried to make this as plutonic as possible. I called her bro, man, and bruh. This was working out for a while but even then I feel like I ruined things. She is kinda bored of me I think? You know what that’s ok. I definitely don’t have any communication problems and have a lot of confidence. There’s no social awkwardness at all. I’m not going to be mad because of how people choose to respond to me so I continue to remain courteous knowing that it’s just another chore for her. It gives me more time to work anyway. Funny enough, she still reaches out to me. However, I think this is just a kind gesture so I brush her off. Now, I just feel alone. At times, I wish my house was haunted or I had multiple personalities in my head so I could develop some type of friendship. It’s all cool tho. Friends come and go so I think maybe this is just a rough spot. There are many other garbage adversities I have to deal with like the instability of my mother’s marriage, the hormonal sisters who treat me like trash, and an existential questioning of theology. I’m sure these will all pass but damn I miss being able to talk to people. I just needed to vent, and I don’t really care if no one reads this. It’s this or jumping off a building LMAO. I just feel like my environment doesn’t want me to succeed. If you are reading this, thanks.",23Oct2020,1
25,"Today we had to put down one of our dogs. He was a sweet, kind, loving Chow Chow and Black Lab mix and I'm going to miss him so much. He always had the biggest smile when he saw me and I can't believe I'll never see it again. He was a ray of sunshine. Next Thursday at the exact same time as we had to put him down today, I have to go in for a biopsy on my lung to see if I have cancer or some other illness.

I went from perfectly healthy 5 weeks ago, to incredibly sick 4 weeks ago. I've been tested for Covid multiple times and have always come up negative. Doctors say this is something else but they don't know what. Now I've been told with the mass in my lungs, the fluid coming up, and the difficulty breathing, that I could die if I get covid or the flu.

It's hard because I went from taking care of my parents who are old and have health problems to them taking care of me because I can't even walk without being out of breath instantly. It's so hard to see them struggling when I could do things for them before so they didn't have to.

Now for the first time in my life I'm really scared. I'm in my early 30s, I don't smoke, and aside from being overweight I live a mostly healthy life. Most of my friends haven't spoken to me much in the last several months and I've been posting on reddit a lot more to fill the void, but I'm really lonely in general. It doesn't help that with me being sick I sleep off and on most of the time and don't even have the energy to game for long. So even if I did have friends talking to me I wouldn't be able to talk that much. Especially since I'm very hoarse after talking for a short time. 

Now after a life of depression and dark thoughts I really don't want to die or be sick for the rest of my life. I really just want a second chance to live and be healthy. I thought I had a lot more time. I hope I still do.

Thanks for reading. I just needed to get this out. Please enjoy your health while you have it, don't take it for granted because it can just disappear with no warning. Take care.",23Oct2020,1

29,"I (20M) am studying a high level degree to attain a job in an exciting and highly prosperous career. After years of pursuing the degree I was certain that this is what I wanted to do with my life. 

Despite this fact, I let go of myself academically this year. Unlike so many other people my circumstances had not worsened due to Covid-19. I live in a great home with great parents with great support and lots of time to focus on my studies. Yet I find myself wasting all my time either sleeping, or watching porn.  I became nihilistic and gave up on life, even though I was not even affected by COVID. This semester I am most likely going to fail unless I can motivate myself to do 8 weeks worth of work in 3 weeks. 

I do not want advice necessarily, I just wanted to vent my frustration and see if anyone responds or can relate to my situation. I feel so guilty having potentially destroyed my university career with a poor  academic year .  I am so much more privileged than so many people, yet I can't use the opportunities I have even to chase my own dreams.

 . I will give it my all from today onwards and hope that I can save myself from failing.

30,"I stumbled upon a video on pornhub, cause I’m a teen filled with chemicals and such.

It was this woman going to the gynecologist and getting the gyno to finger her. Of course, this was fake. But the acting freaked a lot of people out.

The guy in it was strangely good for the role, and he truly sounded like a doctor. He wasn’t a typical male porn lead where it’s like “I see boob? Make sex instincts take over”. And he was like “ma’am this is highly unprofessional” and it was very convincing.

So me and a lot with many other viewers all got very uncomfortable at the film. Cause it viewed less like porn and more like just filmed sexual assault.

As one commenter pointed out, it was obviously fake cause of all the medical term he messed up. But to the average viewer, you don’t know the difference. And the whole thing made me so uncomfortable it was very strange.

It made me think- sex in an unlikely environment and like getting someone to do sexual favors is a common fantasy, but in reality it would just be rape. And of course in pornography, all the actors are into it because of their job. But in reality it’s much more uncomfortable. It’s gross and the lack of consent made me want to vomit.

We can all agree that rape and sexual assault is horrible, but I’ve never really seen something on it that isn’t just a fantasy film. And while this video was just a script, it felt too real. It it made my bones hurt. And just generally depressed.",23Oct2020,1

I don't know why my dumbass didn't just press “post” BEFORE browsing through and closing other tabs I wasn't using, but come on man.

It hasn’t happened yet but I worry that my needs will be compromised by my girlfriend to please her parents but because I’m so scared of confrontation I won’t speak up or try to change things. I will more than likely just nod and play along. A good example is the fact my girlfriends mum has invited herself and the rest of the family to our new house for christmas without consideration for whether we might have wanted to spend it with my family. My girlfriend is often too scared to tell them things I’ve said in case they don’t like it. Such as me having bipolar it took waiting until I had my first manic episode after a year for her to tell them because she was scared of their reaction. I have told my girlfriend I want to spend next years Christmas with my family and she said it’d be fine but I know she hasn’t mentioned this to her mum. I’ll admit I hate confrontation and I will actively avoid it. So I’m unlikely to stand up to them ever.

My girlfriend is very close to her family and i don’t often want to spend time with them. I don’t want to tell my girlfriend what I really think and I don’t want to be that asshole that tries and dictate her relationship with them. I also think I have a bit of “confirmation bias” on the matter and I am looking at ways I can pick holes at them.",23Oct2020,1

Life is relative. Something that may be so extremely difficult for one person may seem like nothing to another, because of -relatively- worse things they've experienced. That doesn't mean your issues are not worthy of pain or worry. These are the worst things you've struggled with!

I've been through a hell of a lot of shit in my life. Stuff you couldn't even make up. And its been a hell of a ride, and im only 18. But every single shitty thing that's happened to me, and my reaction to that thing has got me to where I am right now, in this bed, feeling wholesome and emotional, right now. And I love where I am right now. So much I can't even begin to express it! I've just started university on a course I've wanted to do since I was little, I have the most phenomenal boyfriend who I cant wait to spend the rest of my life with, im doing well in my studies, my anxiety is getting better every day, we're looking for apartments together for next year, and I just am thinking about all this good stuff that's happening right now thinking, you know what?? Im exactly where I want to be, and where I so desperately wanted to be all these years. And to know that?? Is absolutely indescribable. 

This doesn't mean I dont have bad days, I have loads of bad days, worrying incessantly about completely unprecedented things. But that doesn't matter, because in the mix of it all I am thriving and living the life I love and adore and wished for. I am so happy. 

I'm sorry I just had to get it out. I wanted to put this in my notes on my phone but I knew this post might help someone who's struggling. Do you have anything going on in your life that you're struggling with right now?? Is there something you're really grateful for??

I messaged people to let them know I couldn't contact them via phone until it was fixed, which would be a week or so, and £80 later.

My dad messaged saying don't do anything yet, message the company to see if I can get it repaired etc and let him know. The company obviously said it was not covered for accidents, so, I let him know.

Today he turned up with a brand new phone for me (Samsung A21S) which is a kit nice phone, but, I don't feel joy having it. They said it's a late Birthday /early Christmas present, which is fine, but, I know they don't have tons of money, and also, I liked my old phone perfectly well, and now it's potentially just going to sit and root after 6 months of use.

50,"the realm of 'free speech' is getting smaller and smaller, and this is a trend with the 'left' nowadays. The media can make the oppressed look like the oppressor and vice versa. So when talking about 'right wing' white, chinese and indian people, or anyone else labelled an 'oppressor', this is simply because of your need for an other. People act like they don't 'other', but as an Indian myself, the LEFT others us SO MUCH its insane. Indians, no matter the statistics, or any common sense, indian hindus are treated as inherently oppressive. it is a similar sentiment eugenics. progressives were eugenicists who wanted a superior race, (the same people called racist the world over). 

for Trump supporters in America, suicide has increased. While the white upper classes in fact have the 'left wing' to go to, because they are not DESPERATE for reform, the working class white people are one of the only groups who do not have anyone to 'point' at. Because if they are racist, it's not going to be from a nice elitist 'i care about the minorities' way. Ultimately as a working class white person, if you need a way out, but no one else listens, you will not care about how 'suave' the person voted in is. So NO, they don't care whether trump stumbles over his words or the fact that his image is more racist than Hillary. HILLARY is just as racist, but has a better image.

when something is not socially acceptable, often that part of you is relegated to your subconscious, or you deny having that thought. The idea of being this 'cringey nationalist goon' will cause people to take the 'moral' side. If you grow up in a place that is incredibly militant, you will be too scared to speak up.  As the restrictions get bigger, you will slowly make the conscious smaller and smaller, and project all your thoughts onto someone else.

54,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

But the last few years have been a slow process of drifting away, we started seeing each other less and less and the last time we saw each other was new year's eve (and that was out first meeting in a few months as well). In July i sent him a message asking how college was going, exams and shit like that and if he wanted to meet and he ghosted me, and now today after all these months of silence i sent him another message saying i'd really like to meet with him and that if he doesn't want to he should just tell me, not say ""i'll call you in a couple of days"" and then not do anything for months.  
It's obvious he doesn't want to be my friend anymore, i see it but i don't know why, we didn't have like a huge fight or anything we just slowly drifted apart, that's just part of life i guess.

People are seriously losing their minds, maybe they are tired of being suppressed, controlled, and treated like petty vermin by those who lead us.

All over the world are “leaders” that are just walking their nation into an early grave; America is definitely one of these countries.

I don’t want to make it political because it’s not.  This is a problem involving the well-being of the human race.  It is in our nature to survive, and instead we are running head first into an oncoming semi-truck.  

Our desire to live free isn’t an ideal, it is nature.  It is everything in our Earth, and all it’s ecosystems combined.  The plants, animals, and beautiful lands grow and live free.

We, however, with our cognitive thought, we have taken this world and made it our slave.  Mountains crumble, icebergs melting, and worst of all, our forests are burning.

People are no better, we are our own natural disaster.  We have stopped looking to survive, but instead to appease.  

We work hard to keep the belly of our addictions full, then we give it our happiness and joy, and we give it our freedom and then our life.

Think your not an addict? Think again.  You can be addicted to ANYTHING.  That phone your reading this on, how many hours a day do you spend thumbing through your social media.

We have taken all accountability, that we should have, for our actions, and thrown it out the window.

Freedom means being responsible for yourself.  No one to tell you what to do, where to go, or what job to get.  Freedom does not negate consequences, but instead of being afraid, we, as a species, need to open our eyes and begin to govern ourselves.

Stop allowing yourself to be controlled until your explode from within.  We outnumber those in charge by tenfold, yet we sign away our freedom for simple conveniences.  This is why we are all losing our minds, and why this world is slowly going to shit.

85,"Post One: 

It's been about three years now since I woke up. Doctors would call it a coma, but I know much better that it was some sort of astral projection. That might not be the right word for it either but... well, to this day, I simply refer to it as my miracle. 

I want to tell you guys everything. Everyday, I lose more and more of my memories from that time, so I must share them before they melt and blow away with the passing breeze. 

For some context, I live in a state that does not garner much traffic. It's one in which if other people were asked to pinpoint it on the map, they would simply look around helplessly. Our sports teams have long passed their prime, and artists popular enough to have their names known seemingly come from everywhere but here. 

I think it was mainly because of this that many of our state residents especially idolized an author from our small, suburban city-- the only person who had a little recognition outside of just our population. For the sake of anonymity, I'll call him ""Ram"".

He was dearly treasured, but still I was sure that no one loved him more than me. No one understood the symbolism better than I. The emotion and poetry, I solely saw. He was a very talented man and everything from his published novels to his online blogs, I read. I looked up to him, you know? He was 10 years my senior and started publishing his own work at the mere age of 18, so I grew up with his words imprinted on my palms. 
 
Anyways... It began on my 17th birthday. I had awoken expecting the typical Snapchat spam stories from my friends which would include the ugliest pictures of me to have ever existed. Instead, however, everyone in my school was posting about the death of our beloved author.

Ram had committed suicide only a few hours before. News travelled fast, and on the snapchat stories of all the children, his memories replayed. 

As one could imagine, I was devastated. I had not believed it at first, but after spending the next few hours researching and researching and researching… it dawned on me a little bit more that he had come to haunt my birthday. 

Such irony, on a day which celebrates my birth, the only person I loved more than myself decided to end his life. I would scorn him now… if I ever get to meet him again, for stealing the spotlight that I craved so much away from me-- that bastard. 

I blew the candles on my cake that night wishing that wherever he was, he would find warmth.

It sucks that I cannot explain in words the amount of care I had for this man. I guess to make it understandable for whoever reads this, Ram represented everything that I wanted. Whenever I doubted myself, my capabilities, and my future, the mere picture of his smile was enough to cure me. His death was like the death of my dreams. 

I fell into deep depression soon after. For someone who was already so depressed, mourning for him only opened up a greater tier of misery. 

I decided finally that perhaps all I could do to numb this pain was to follow him. 

And so I killed myself. 

I won't go into how I did-- ended my life, I mean. I don't want to give anyone ideas. Just know that it hurt. It was nothing like the romanticized thorny rose concept I had made it to be in my mind. Death is ugly and frightening and fucking cold. It's patient and lonely. 

Right as I had done it, I thought right away how badly I wanted my mother to hold me and tell me that it was all going to be alright.

But, well… 

This is where the real story begins. After I died, to my surprise, my eyes opened again. I don't know how long I was out for but I awoke to my body feeling weightless and languid. As Cody may even say, frictionless. 

I am unsure how to describe the ""afterlife"". To be honest, I was too out of it to fully grasp my surroundings, much less, to sit down and analyze it. You dont really think about those things when you're there. I can say though with certainty that it is nothing akin to what is described in religious scriptures or what not. 

Keep in mind that I was barely cognitively all there. My conscious felt hazy and it was as if I was coming in and out of a dream-like state. I faintly recall having a conversation. Even now, sometimes in my dreams, bits and pieces of the discussion comes back to me, but what I talked about in whole and who I was speaking to, I have no idea. 

Whether that was God or Satan or a different deity entirely… or none at all, the only thing I was certain of was that the next memory I hold, it was in our world. Except not really. 

It dated back to around 6 months before my 17th birthday give or take a few days. And I was still dead. I dont know if many of you guys believe in ghosts, but after this… I must assume that they truly exist.

Doc says that these images are just fragments of my imagination while I was in the coma. My therapist says it's my brain trying to cope… but I feel it so deeply in my soul that I had not made all this up. 

I was back on Earth, but the only difference was that I was a ghost and Ram was very much alive. How did I know this, you might be wondering… I knew this because I was on his back. 

Day in and day out, he carried me on his back, and he was none the wiser. 

I have to go now. Dishes to wash and online school to complete. I thought I would have enough time to tell this story, but it’s longer than I anticipated. I’ll be back, if anyone cares, to tell about what I saw at the end of my life sentence.",23Oct2020,1

90,"I'm putting this down to try and get it out of my head. The last year was hard for me. Harder than I thought life could be. I never thought I would recover. But slowly I did, and I have reached a point where I am happy. It was all going great until I caught the feels. She started working with me at the start of the covid issue, so I had limited contact with her, but as our reason to interact via zoom and such grew I found I just didn't want to stop talking to 

At 35 I shouldn't really have this schoolboy crush but the woman is amazing. She's funny, intelligent, a little bit irreverent sometimes haha. And God is she pretty. Just thinking about her makes me smile. We have fun together and it's always good to talk. We just seem to click. Sounds great to meet someone who makes you feel after having your heartbroken. I should be on top of the world. But there is a catch. She has a long term fella. She seems happy with him and I'm not the guy to try and come between two people. So I just got to keep these feels on the down-low. So I'm telling you Reddit. That way I can get it out and hopefully mitigate it even a little (not likely. Her smile lights me up) thanks for listening Reddit.",23Oct2020,1
91,"Hey all,

i am desperate and tired of my thoughts, so I am writing herer right now. I hope you can help me with that or give me good advices.

Currently (the last few month), I had great sex with my partner and everything seemed to be fine. Today its been a few weeks now that I have seen her the last time and I have those bothering toughts... I am always anxious about having sexual problems again (which I indeed had in the past). With my first GF I suffered from Premature Ejaculation, then there were times I couldn't get one up and there was a period of time where I could not reach orgasm. 

I realised that there are those periods where I feel like gotten rid of all phyisical/mental problems but after a while they always tend to come back and bother me again. Last night I had a dream where I could not have sex with my GF because of Erectyle Dysfunction. Now I fear beeing bad in bed/ not beeing able to pleasy my GF anymore (which I always did in the past):

What can I do to get rid of these recurring bad thoughts/problems forever??? I really hope that you have advice for me.

Have a great day to all!",23Oct2020,1
92,"After a string of shitty choices in the past several months, I think I broke myself. I destroyed two good people and fucked myself over. After coming to terms with who I am and what I did, I feel empty. And drained. And I don't want to do anything. I'm skipping therapy, I'm half assing my job, and I just don't want to talk to friends. I just keep sleeping around and getting into other self destructive behaviors.

Man. I just don't feel like living anymore. And this is not really a cry for help. I'd rather be dead. I guess I just want people to know I'm a shitty person and I really have no idea to break the cycle.",23Oct2020,1

97,"I have watched over the past couple years as politics has slowly invaded parts of my everyday life. Despite my efforts to avoid it (deleting social media, cutting the cord and cancelling my TV subscriptions, avoiding political headlines, etc.) politics has now invaded sports, my school, my friends, and my life. There is no escape. The most recent political uprising (BLM/abolish the police movements) have taken over my school and now there’s this whole drama and many of the school’s clubs, departments, sports teams, etc. have felt the need to make some sort of statement. Stop it. I don’t care. If I want politics I’ll turn on the news. All I want to do is go to class and allow myself to be largely ignorant of the political drama that surrounds us and depresses us.
