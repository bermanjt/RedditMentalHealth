2,"Where do you start? It's so hard to unlearn things. My therapist once said to me ""you judge yourself for everything you do or don't do"" and it is so true. I can never be good enough for myself. 

Right now I'm reading the very first lenghty messages I exchanged with someone I used to talk to for dating purposes. I truly liked this person. The first guy I've ever caught feelings for. Things went left between us and to protect myself and my mental health, I cut him out of my life. It was the right thing to do and I don't want to go back. But I still cried reading it because I felt emotional (im also on my period)

I don't want to feel this way. I hate myself for caring. I hate myself for crying. I'm such a dumb bitch for still caring and being upset. He doesn't deserve it. At all. I should be better, I should know better. I don't want to feel anything. I Shouldn't feel anything seeing as we were never even together. I honestly want to laugh at myself for this level of patheticnes over someone that wasn't even my boyfriend.

 I wish I had never replied to him on the app. It was a lesson yes. And it happened and it's life. But I still wish he never came into my life.",09Sep2020,1
3,"I’m posting this hopefully for some different point of views and opinions. Also for some positive feedback/support if anyone has any.

My girlfriend (now ex) flew across the country to spend our birthdays together. The first day (1st) she was here I realized I didn’t have romantic feelings for her. I decided not to tell her because I felt like I was protecting her. I didn’t want the week long trip to start off like that for her. I figured it would just mean a really long week, and it would’ve been horrible. Instead I spent the whole week with this facade of this loving caring boyfriend. Every hug, every kiss...I felt so empty inside. I felt so bad because I just felt like I had been leading her on for months and kept doing so.

The morning of the 6th, I was in the kitchen and she came to me and playfully asked “so can we still date after I get back home. I’m asking because I have abandonment issues.” I wasn’t going to lie to her face. I grabbed her by the shoulders and I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. The only words I could muster were “I don’t know.” She knew I meant no. She went into my room, and laid down. I sat next to her and grasped her hand, and told her I still care about her. I readjusted my hand and she shook my hand off. I took that as she didn’t want me there. So I went into the living room and sat down. A few minutes later she walked out of the front door only saying “I’ll be back.” After about 25 minutes I was started to get worried. We had our locations shared indefinitely. I went to check, and she stopped sharing her location with me. She took me off snapchat and Instagram as well. She came home after an hour or so and she just sat at the kitchen table and didn’t say anything. I drove home because my family had made me a birthday meal. After about 5 hours I made it back to my apartment. I got home, and soon after she left again. She didn’t stay out of long this time. Right after she left I texted her saying that I brought her food and I left it on the table. She texted me back saying “Stop texting me. Leave me alone. I can do that myself. I won’t talk to the you the rest of the time I’m here. You wasted my fucking time. I wish I was home so make this easier and let me be.”

After that I decided it would be a good idea for me to spend the night with my friend. I figured she didn’t to stay in the same place as me. I told her I was going to my friend’s and she just responded with “okay.” I packed some stuff and left. The next morning she texted me asking if I could still take her to the airport to which I agreed. A few hours later we had [this text conversation](https://imgur.com/a/Ih3PrcB). 

(While I was at my friend’s I talked to them about what had happened. They both supported me. My female friend consoled me telling me that I was making decisions that I thought were best, and I shouldn’t feel bad. Also that she thinks my ex was possibly saying those things to make me feel bad, and that it’s easier to say those things than to forgive someone. My guy friend said that she was also acting immature by not communicating with me and blaming me for making the decisions.)

My ex and I didn’t say anything else until the next morning (8th) when I picked her up from my apartment and took her to the airport. We didn’t say a word the whole 20 minute trip. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to say anything. I had already tried to tell her over and over that I do care about her. She refused to accept that. I wasn’t going to try to convince her. Everyone makes their own conclusions and thinks what they want.

We got to the departures and she got out and said goodbye and have a good one in a good regular tone. I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. As soon as she started walking away. I felt instant regret about not saying anything.

The last few days I’ve felt this enormous guilt about what I did. I hurt her so badly. I care about her so much. She was one of my best friends. She helped me get through a really hard time of my life. How can I do that to someone... anyone… let alone her. Right now I don’t feel as much. I’m not sure if this is what being “numb” is. I know I fucked up, and I’m holding myself accountable. I can’t take back what I did and said.

I’ve been having mental health problems the past few months, but now I know it’s going to get worse. So I plan on talking to the VA about my options and seeing a doctor and psychologist. Partially to help out my impending mental deterioration. The other part to figure what the fuck is wrong with me and why I did all of that.

If anyone has anything negative to say. Just know that I already feel awful, and to please consider keeping anything hurtful to yourself. I’m already in a terrible headspace.",09Sep2020,1

6,"First step of this thought: [Life started from a single cell.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/5/100513-science-evolution-darwin-single-ancestor/#:~:text=All%20life%20on%20Earth%20evolved,new%20study%20seems%20to%20confirm.&amp;text=The%20study%20supports%20the%20widely,more%20than%20150%20years%20ago) Let's call it the Mother Cell. All life on Earth is basically one giant organism, growing out from the same starting point, like tentacles reaching out ever further. That knowledge is cool enough on it's own, being related to every living thing on this planet and all, but: 

Knowing that, let's move on to the next step. There's this idea called the Bootstrap Paradox. Which tells a tale of a piece of information, or object, traveling within in a loop of time, with no actual point of origin. Just existing, forever. **Example scenario:** When you were a kid, you found a sheet of music in a sandbox. As you grew older, you learned to play it, and performed it on stage. Years go by, and people *love* the song. Soon, every human on Earth knows it. Decades later, humanity and its technologies become incredibly advanced, and they manage to invent a time machine. They decide to test the machine, with a sheet of paper. The most famous sheet of paper in the world: Your song. The test is successful, and the sheet music ends up in a random place and time in the past (because it's not an exact science, come on), which happens to be the sandbox where kid-you is playing. Starting its journey all over again. Boom. In this scenario, the song was never actually created by anyone. No point of origin. It just exists in time, forever. Awesome. 

Now let's put these two things together. What if one day in the future, we, or by then some other intelligent species, become so technologically advanced that a time machine is invented. Not only that, but our bio-engineering sciences have evolved equally grand, to a point where we have the ability to create life. **We** create the Mother Cell, and decide in all of our wisdom, to use that time machine for one purpose only: To send the Mother Cell back in time, where it will seed life on Earth.

Life would have no origin, it just exists. Forever looping in time, perpetuating its own existence. Pretty neat theory, no?",09Sep2020,1
7,"My boyfriend put together the most beautiful engagement for me and I said yes. It’s been 3 years and I love him so much. I posted the news that night and I was excited I couldn’t even sleep. I woke up to my fiancé’s brother sending me dark messages about their family trauma. It was awful. 

I have met his brother. He is 22, schizophrenic, suffers from depression, morbidly obese, suicidal and narcissistic. His family recently kicked him out because he threatened to kill his sister and his niece, bought a weapon, and stole money. Both him and my fiancé experienced sexual abuse and my fiancé explained this to me, but his brother decided that was the perfect time to explain in detail exactly what happened to them, and for this reason my fiancé may be all these terrible things. The rest of his family loves me, and I love them. But his brother is extremely hostile toward me. I responded and told him  I know about the abuse, he’s out of his right here and I don’t want him messaging me. And then he asked me to send his 3 year old niece $500 since I’m taking her uncle away from her. And I blocked him.

I feel so awful my fiancé and I had to spend the morning after a beautiful day discussing these tragedies. It was hard because I also had sexual abuse trauma and I felt that I should open up, and I didn’t want to. I had to let him know that I know he’s not these awful things because I’m not. We have both had years of therapy, so it felt so invasive to have to open up to someone outside of a professional about this. His brother was then threatening to share the information he shared with me with everyone on social media in and effort to overshadow our great news. 

Later that night he called from a different number and I was heated. I told him “I get it but you need to stop. We can’t help you with the past.” He doesn’t work.  I told him “you, me, your sibilinos, my siblings, everyone I know has been sexually abused and have become something else. You’re stuck and that’s not my business.” he said fuck you. And that’s when I went off. Reminded him that he reached out to me, that I have tried the soft approach but since you want to act crazy, I can treat you like it. He said he wanted to kill himself and I said “hey you get $800 bucks a month from the government, free therapy, and access to drugs ppl overdose on daily. You can do that, but you won’t because you’re a coward. You want everyone around you to suffer, you steal, you lie, you hurt ppl you love, and if you ask me it doesn’t make a difference if you’re on this earth or not. I’m not your sister and i don’t care about you. You ran away from home at 19, so Next time really disappear. You came back because you can’t last out in the world and that’s what’s really eating you up.”

My fiancé heard the whole thing, he said that in a way I was right, the family has been nice but I didn’t have to care for him. I don’t have to respect someone who can’t respect me. The family let’s him disrespect them but I don’t have the patience. His family called and they were sad, but they understood and I told them that he’s not invited to the wedding or my home and they understood. It’s been years of him making racist statements about my race in comparison to my fiancé, threatening to kill himself, and their parents so my fiancé will send money, and being an all over awful person. His family will hide weapons in the house before they call the police to protect him. I wish he’d die. I wish he’d really just do it after proclaiming to do it for 3 years and kill himself. And not for what he did to me, it’s bigger than that now, he’s hurting ppl, but the place his family is stuck in because of him. It’s How he’s made my fiancé feel, and I’ve said this. And I feel sick because of it, I just think things would be better if he was truly gone.",09Sep2020,1

I asked if I can get a treadmill because I was thinking if I got one and walked on it while my family is either working or at school it will maybe make me feel a little better about myself and I can do things. I know I shouldn’t be on social media because it’s bad for you some parts of it not parts where you just look at animals being cute and funny. I know all this can be fixed by myself but I don’t know how to do that. I have a consular but I don’t really feel like that’s helping because I tell her the problems I’m having but she doesn’t go like in-depth with them maybe she will but I’m too afraid to tell her where it gets to that point. But maybe she is just the type of consular where you just talk and that’s it I don’t know. I want to change my life I know I can be better I’m just to insecure I guess. I know that I’m only 18 and I got my whole life ahead of me but like what can I do now to go in the right direction like to improve myself. I’m really sorry this is so long but this is just what’s on my mind at this moment and I mean let’s be honest the coronavirus and the you have to stay in can get pretty lonely real quick.",09Sep2020,1

So I am being very supportive, we’re keeping little to no junk food in the house, healthy snacks, cooking balanced meals. Which I am all good with. But sometimes I need some fucking junk food!  My wife goes to bed earlier than me, she’s usually asleep by 10 and gets up early while I am up later doing remote work and taking care of other shit.  About once a week when she falls asleep I hop onto a food delivery app and order some Chinese food or some shit for myself. I love it.  I usually place an order right as the kitchen is closing for the evening. I give delivery instructions NOT to ring the bell just in case she is up taking a piss when they come.  Once she actually heard me opening the door and called down from the upstairs, I told her I was bringing in a package that had been left out haha!  I take the food down to the basement where my home offices is and enjoy......mmmmmmm. I store the leftovers in the back of a mini fridge down here. My dirty, greasy little secret.

18,"I just read a news story of a guy accused of rape. The girl who is underage says that he raped her. The police detained him for questioning. Everything happened today, a couple of hours ago.

That's it. All there is is her allegation, and the fact that he is currently in a police station.

And yet the newspaper jumps on the opportunity and runs a story with his damn name, age, honetown, residence. They conceal the identity of the accuser for protection of a minor, but reveal every fucking detail about the accused. They write with a strong matter-of-fact undertone that he is indeed the rapist.

This is fucking absurd. He *might* very well be the actual perpetrator, but on the chances that he is innocent, they just ruined his life.

***Backstory:*** 

I was adopted and I was born with my brother. We're both fraternal twins.

 I never knew my biological mom but  she had one- two other children before we were born ( my sister and brother who we met before)  

She had me and my brother \*\**were twins from her pregnancy (last kids).*

I'm tired of being tired everyday despite doing half the work and having half the energy compared to a regular school day. I'm tired of jumping from Zoom class to Zoom class.

Kids (esp ones with things like Autisim, ADHD, etc) are doing worse then ever and nothing is being done. Its fucking bullshit that it has been more then half a year at this point and no intelligent solutions have been figured out by the professionals in charge.

And it helps so much to have online communities where I can just say what I’m thinking and not have to worry about who will find out, or what they’ll think of me.

23,"I've developed a gigantic crush over my coworker. She's a little older, though not by much. We work for a non-profit and while a majority of my work is done alone we are pretty much are partners. For a long time we would work together once a week to complete a certain task. Never a problem for we make a good team. I always have thought she was super cool. She's educated and well spoken, she's artistically gifted, has a good heart, cool hobbies and is obviously very pretty. However she always had a boyfriend, and to be honest while I found her attractive I wasn't necessarily attracted. Besides, why complicate work? So that never bothered me, actually figured they would tie the knot sooner than later. Just thought she was a cool coworker. We would hang out for a few minutes after work to enjoy nicotine. And talk. 

My parents were great at the start. Typical middle class family. But my mom always loved to party while my dad loved to have a good time. One thing led to another and they both developed drug issues. Anger between them developed. Accusations of this and that. Divorce. Dad stayed away for a few years. Mom's drug problem got worse. Eventually moved in with a family member. Eventually mom lost the house moved in with us. Issues then resumed till she finally moved out when I became an adult. Dad cleaned up his act and returned to my life before I became an adult. Still working on the relationship but it's good. Mom got worse. Became clean, relapsed again. Cycle continues. Ends up on street. Finally got an apartment couple years back. Is sober for a few years. Relationship between us gradually improves and reaches an okay point. Then relapse. This time though, the cycle was interrupted. Whole different animal. Not even sure what occurred. Well I do but I would rather not go into it. Now she's....just someone else. Delusions, etc. Now I don't see her. 

Me and my coworker would talk about this. She would be sweet and offer me words of encouragement or try and give me advice. Don't think she understood the pain I felt, or the feeling of being an actor because you gave someone so much of you. Until one day. She was having some hard personal issues. We were smoking and she started to vent about her boyfriend. It was out of the blue as I thought they were great. As I listened, the problems sounded similar to the ones my mom faced. Dabble into harder drugs, spiral out of control until you've landed into the cycle of addiction. She was frustrated. Sad. Confused. Feelings I'm intimate with.  I listened and tried not to say much. I did give a little advice, though I really wanted to be careful as to not overstep boundaries. I don't know her boyfriend. She told me she felt comfortable telling me because I could relate. For the most part, I could. I was also able to relate to her. This went on for a few weeks. I felt a bond start, and slowly develop. Each week I would give her more and more advice as her situation was getting more tight. Issues I knew all too well. Wondering if the person is where they say they are. Wonder if your money is in your wallet and not taken by them for a quick high. The wonder if you will have to lie for this person. Small changes that eventually become permanent. I started to push my boundaries because of the bond that was developing. For better or worse I was starting to really care for her. I was noticing small changes in her. I didn't want her to abandon someone she loved and had a life with. But I didn't want her giving up a part or all of her soul trying to help someone who most likely can only help themselves. The projection onto you. Their addiction then almost feels like it becomes your addiction. The worry. So I was a little more direct with her in some areas. We began to start on a small project together as this was all occurring. Eventually she figured it out for herself and broke up with him. 

And now I'm stuck with my feelings for her. I would like to lay under a tree with her and just talk. About the tree we're under. Oranges. Space. Any and everything. What do I do with them? We felt similar pains and frustrations. We told each other some stuff that was pretty raw. I'm being ridiculous. Why would our little talks influence her feelings and what she thinks of me? You know what, what does she think of me? Was I just convinent to talk to because of my experiences? We are 2 different people. We have some common issues but we are pretty different. Sometimes I catch her looking at me more than I would expect to catch someone. She laughs at stupid things I do. She'll laugh at my terrible jokes(most people just snort). We have a good rapport. But I'm also lonely. I formed a connection with someone and odds are I'm magnifying the seriousness of it because of my loneliness. But I am comfortable around her. I talk a lot when I'm with her. I'm genuinely smiling. I normally don't speak much at all with anyone even my best friends. We're starting a project together. Something that will require a lot of work and time to grow. We've been having fun doing this. But I'm unhappy with the larger organization we work under. I have been using vacation days for a vacation of sorts and haven't spoken to her in almost 2 weeks. I'm unhappy I have these feelings for her and can say nothing. I can't put this on her. She's still working through a couple of things in her life and the last thing she'd need is her coworker proclaiming his feelings for her. It's also unprofessional. My best friend says to tell her how I feel like that wouldn't be a disaster.  I don't even know if she still speaks to her ex or what kind of relationship they have now. We haven't spoken on that since. I don't even know if that is any of my business. I don't even know if it matters. I'm just unsure if I can go and work on this project with her and set my feelings aside. It's something she's very excited for. She wouldn't stop talking to me about it which I love. I don't want to disappoint her.",09Sep2020,1

We seem to be bonding more over the last few days and I've really solidified a friendship with her. She is great and honestly I could see this turning into a relationship but I'm not going to force anything as she says it takes time for her to catch feelings for someone and I respect that but I'm seeing so much potential already there. A few nights ago she and I agreed to meet in Bali when COVID is over and the thought of this has made me feel amazing and I've been in such a good mood lately. I'm just so happy being around her and hearing her voice she really does work wonders for me and I'm so glad that I reached out to her on her r4r post. I look forward to see what the future holds for she and I, I hope it all grows into a relationship but I'll be content if it's just a normal friendship. She is great, I like this woman a lot!

30,"(19F, Canada)
I live in my small community (reservation) that’s far away from the city and towns. City is 3/4 hour drive away, while the nearest town is 1 hour.

I’ve been struggling with school throughout my highschooling years (emotional behaviour issues, depression/Suicide attempts, and homelessness) 
And now all of that has come back to  really bite me in the ass.

Right now, I’m ‘sponsored’ from my communities education to go to school OFF reservation, so I currently have a ‘time frame’ of 1 year to finish my grade 12 highschool education meanwhile I’m currently trying to figure out what grade I’m even in, let alone trying to recover my credits and grades. 

They don’t offer Adult Ed in my area, and I don’t think I’m going to even come close to finishing my grade 12 education this year. So I think I fucked myself over big time.

I’d like to get my license and a vehicle, but they only do drivers ed in a town, that’s wayy farther; maybe 2/3 hour drive. I can’t exactly afford to pay gas or hire a ride, and my moms pretty old and she can’t really take me to my drivers ed appointments either, or can’t sit/drive for long. Her arthritis starts to act up and she has swollen joints.

I desperately want/need a job too, but my community is so damn small I’ve went to all 6 ‘establishments’ where they could possibly be hiring in my community but to no avail! I MUST have my grade 12 diploma, computer skills, and need to know how to write formal letters, or I need a license to operate a vehicle and be able to transport myself to work. Lol. That was frustrating. I still do ask around every now and then though.

It’s my fault, I know that and Obviously I take full responsibility and come to terms with it. But it’s so devastating and such a slap in the face to myself. I feel so fucking stupid and frustrated and I’m stuck as what to do with my life now basically. I feel like I’ve ruined my life, WITHOUT doing the whole drugs, rebellion, drinking, parties and sex thing.

36,"I have been in therapy since I was 8 years old. And I  have been spending time in inpatient psych hospitals since I was 11. I have seen 100s of doctors and I have tried every class of psychiatric medication since then. When people say “it’s all in your head” they fail to realize that my head, is my brain.... you know, the organ that determines behavior, perception, mood, personality. A lot of VERY important parts of the human experience. Probably the MOST important parts. 

You would never tell someone with brain cancer “it’s all in your head.” That makes no fucking sense. I have a neurological disorder called Bipolar with psychotic features. And I have a personality disorder due to trauma, the trauma stumped brain development in 3 parts of my brain causing borderline personality disorder. 

Mental illnesses are disorders of the brain, and I know my behavior may confuse or in the past hurt others. I know I can’t always just act like everyone else and that’s frustrating. And no one should tolerate toxic or harmful behavior. Definitely not saying that. but people with severe mental illness are truly sick, especially untreated. Or unmanaged. and I personally try my best. And take responsibility of my choices and my own life. I’m currently unemployed (temporarily) I didn’t finish school (going for my GED) and I live at home. 

I don’t tell people my situation often, and I don’t like to explain how my mental illness has “held me back” and I don’t invite many people into my life period. It’s complicated... My best isn’t always appealing and that’s tough. And I don’t think many people truly understand or want to understand ME, but that’s ok. I’m happy with that. I don’t get involved with many people haha. We all have to live our lives. But the stigma and misunderstanding does bother me. I encourage researching a loved ones mental illness fully and openly before involving yourself. Just like you may research any illness a loved one is diagnosed with. 

And finally, to anyone struggling with a mental illness, yes I’m unemployed and living with my family. But I used to spend everyday in mental agony. I made terrible and harmful decisions. I was constantly self medicating, constantly reckless and was ready to die at any moment. My disorders are severe. I’m 22 and at 19 I sought help. In the last 3 years, I have changed dramatically (I even have before and after pics haha) my mental illness rarely affects others. I feel happiness and contentment often. And my life is GOOD! There are resources out there... and seeking help was the best choice I’ve ever made. Seek help, just like you would with any other condition. It’s no different and you deserve it! Much love.",09Sep2020,1

46,"Tomorrow is going to suck. I have so much going on in my head right now, but I know I can't get it all out in 50 mins and it's not like my therapist, or anyone around me, understands my position. On top of that, I have no money to buy my meds, and they are running out. Sucks to be me, I guess.

I'm currently gaining weight instead of losing as I should, and I don't know why because I'm doing everything right. I meal prep, count calories, I make sure I get enough exercise. It's driving me nuts and makes me feel like crap, but we never talk about that because something else is always more important than my body image issues.

I've come to the conclusion that it's actually very possible I have ADD, despite me always denying it. I don't want to talk to her about it though, because it's probably not important enough, and I don't want to seem like I want to collect diagnoses like they're pokemon. There's so many conflicting emotions too. I don't know how to handle it.

And then the whole thing with moving out. Yes, my parents are abusive and one of the main sources of my trauma. Does it mean I have to be happy about having to flee from them? Because that's how everyone acts. When I told friends/my therapist that the social office accepted my request for help and gave me a social worker to assist me in, well, basically putting my life back together, and ultimately escaping the abusive environment, everyone just asked me when I'd move out. They've been asking months before I got the letter of acceptance. Everytime I talk to one of them, they ask me about my progress with moving out and it sucks. I'm working on it because I know it's something I have to do for my own good, and I will do it, but I just can't share in all this happiness and excitement. I'm fucking grieving, devastated and broken over the fact that it has come to this. All I ever wanted was normal parents who love me, and now I have to come to terms with that I got alcoholic abusers instead. There's no reason for me to celebrate. I put a smile on and pretend to be happy and excited for everyone else, but I'm dying inside. I'm scared of the next months. There's nothing happy about it. But I can't tell anyone because they'd never understand.",09Sep2020,1

I also read this sentence in the morning ¨When you get into an argument with someone you love, please close your eyes and visualize yourselves three hundred years from now. When you open your eyes, you will only want to take each other in your arms and acknowledge how precious each of you is.¨ - Thich Nhat Hanh

I offer several separate styles of Reading. The first type is an unlimited question reading. You may ask as many questions as you please and I shall answer with in-depth and detailed responses. Sometimes, depending on what you ask, I may split up the reading into sections. The second type of reading I offer is a general reading. For all these reading I will need at least your first name, DOB and if you're comfortable a picture can really help. To conduct these readings I use my psychic intuition and your energy and vibrational core stem to draw information out. Predictions are also made through this method and meditation with use from my guides. The second style I offer is a live 30-minute session. This is held in this chat box. You can check out my reviews and legitimacy by clicking on my profile and visiting my previous posts. If you would like to verify my legitimacy and reliability, I have countless reviews. You can request these from me right here or simply click on my profile and check out my post history. The reviews are just there for all to see. I have a subreddit too called r/arwennewreviews. ALL these styles of reading are the same price. Itsy £11. Payment is made through PayPal. Which is roughly $14.10 (the exchange rate changes almost daily, but it's roughly that). I also do past life readings. These are completely different though and if you would like information on these please just ask. Would you be interested in going forward?

I thought I was doing better at work but now, I just feel so stupid. so so stupid. I don't even want to engage in a conversation which I know will turn ugly. I just agree and let it go.Honestly, I don't feel motivated to work anymore. My laziness has made me stupid and disrespected. Nobody talks to me seriously. I'm either a joke or a kid. My pay isn't that great, so there's no monetary gain also. Sorry if this rant is so erratic. Another one of my problems. I don't know how to articulate my thoughts.

50,"My parents came to visit me (30F) this weekend from home, about 10 hours away. My mom had one rule - dad and I were not to talk about politics because it always ends badly. Monday night, after a fun weekend, he says ""I know we aren't supposed to talk about politics, but..."" What followed was a four hour discussion where I lost significant respect for my dad. It was hard, it was frustrating, I was hurt that he couldn't just finish the weekend on a high note. I left their AirBnB around 1am, came home and cried. They stopped by on their way out of town yesterday morning, I cried more. I spent the next 12 hours crying until I would throw up, napping and then repeating the process. 

Around 7pm, I checked social media to take my mind off the hurt. And it was at this point that I realized my ex, who I had remained close friends with since we broke up about a year ago, had blocked me on socials over the weekend. He recently started a new relationship and told me a few days before it was public. I had thanked him for the warning and told him I was happy for him. He didn't communicate that there were any changes in expectations from me with this new person in his life, though, so I assumed it was safe to continue sending the odd message about whatever cool or impressive thing I'd done recently. This assumption, I guess, was wrong.

55,"This is only a small part of my story but I need to tell it. I have kept it inside for so long but I’m tired of hiding who I am. This is me. I have a lot of flaws and undesirable personality traits but I still deserve to be happy.

I was diagnosed with BPD in my early twenties. I always thought I didn’t deserve the diagnosis because I never went through a single traumatic childhood event.  Prior to receiving my diagnosis, my parents abandoned me (not physically). I was trapped in an abusive relationship with my now ex.  Recently, I was stalked at my workplace for 5 months. I’ve been followed home by a junkie. I’ve had someone filming me in my apartment from their window which left me too afraid to open any curtains or even go out onto my balcony.  I’ve been held hostage in my own apartment.  

I didn’t just have one traumatic event. The traumatic experiences never stopped. 

Childhood/adolescence:

I don’t remember much of my childhood. I never thought I was a bad kid, or weird, except apparently that is not the case as per my mother to my therapist. Occasionally I get flashbacks of moments, such as the pure heartbreak I felt when mum left me on my first day at school. I remember playing alone, with my aunt (a teacher) standing nearby. Mum told me later on that she had no idea I felt that way as I hid my emotions and never displayed my love for her. My therapist believed this is where my fear of abandonment stemmed from.  

My adulthood:

In my early twenties, whilst still in university, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship.  It had elements of gaslighting, cheating, financial abuse and substance abuse intertwined.  That’s a whole other story which I will tell another time.  

My relationship with my parents was incredibly toxic.  My mum would make constant offhand remarks like “are you still going to the gym? You’ve put on weight”.  She would go through my diary and call me a whore for talking to a boy. My mother is also a story for another day.  

My parents were constantly fighting and I would get caught up in them, sometimes blamed for them.  They weren’t just normal fights, they were incredibly loud, vicious arguments that would go on for hours. They kept separating and getting back together, but my father wasn’t happy in the relationship. He stayed for us, but that was a mistake. My siblings begged our parents to divorce because the constant screaming and walking on eggshells was too much. My dad wasn’t happy, and he lashed out at everyone, especially me as I was the oldest and loudest, therefore easiest walking target. 

He absolutely loathed my cat. One day, while he was living elsewhere at the time, mum handed my cat into a shelter, because she thought my dad would stay if we got rid of him. I was on my knees begging her her not to take him from me, but it didn’t work.  Mum cared more about saving her failed marriage.  I sobbed for weeks, missing my best friend.  It wasn’t me or my cat he hated, it was his relationship with my mother.  

Dad eventually came back saying her loved her and wanted to try again. After a violent drunken outburst from my father one night directed at me, my own mother told me that I had to leave.   I discovered she blamed me for the breakdown of her marriage, but I realise now that I was a victim of it.

All of this culminated in a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder.  I’m still not entirely sure if I was to blame or if I was a victim of it. I tried medication, meditation, mindfulness, CBT, every treatment under the sun, except DBT.   I was told by the psychologists that I wasn’t sick enough, because I didn’t actively try to hurt myself or worse. Because I didn’t have the courage to go through with it, I didn’t qualify for DBT. 

Upon further research, I learned DBT only achieved moderate results at best, so I really couldn’t understand why I didn’t qualify. It hurt to feel like I didn’t deserve to heal, so it was at that point I gave up on external treatment altogether and focused on self-love and healing.  

It’s been 7 years since my diagnosis. I am a lot stronger than I give myself credit for, but unfortunately it means I get little support from anyone else. I don’t have any real friends. I can’t rely on family for support. Therapy is expensive.  This pandemic has been awful for me, I’ve had two of my closest friends cut contact with me after I stood up to their awful treatment of me, but I’m doing my best to stay alive. 

Despite all of this, I have so much to be grateful for.  I have a well-paying job in a meaningful industry. Now that I’ve moved into my own place, my relationship with both parents has improved significantly.  Dad even got his own cat? I get a lot of compliments for my art on social media, my singing voice is improving every day and I’m finding new ways to connect with people.  I’m even part of a group chat now! But most importantly, I’ve put down a deposit for another best friend (a Ragdoll kitten, so floofy!) and I literally can’t wait to meet him/her! To everyone else with BPD, we got this. 

TLDR; my entire life has been one traumatic experience after the other, resulting in BPD but I’m healing myself, one day at a time.",09Sep2020,1

68,"Hello Reddit,

Today I come to you because my life is disastrous and I truly need serious advice and help. I'm 25.

My life summarized, I went to school, high school, every thing went ok, I joined a good college to pursue an engineering degree in my country, there I was a top student successful for 2 years. At 20 I started having very serious health issues, I tried to continue and at first my university was supportive but since I was sick for 3 years they let me down. I went to another university to try to continue, but fell sick again and again. My disease is mostly unknown according to doctors, I have lung, digestive, eye and skin issues but they can't pinpoint a diagnosis so I can't be recognized as chronically ill or disabled. So here's my situation, I'm sick at 25, with no college degree, unable to work and not recognized as disabled or sick.

I wanted to try again to study at other universities but at 25 in my country I'm refused everywhere. I wanted to apply to work but in my condition and my country being very judgemental on age I'm refused everywhere then again. So I can neither work nor study. I've lost my parents so I'm going to go financially bankrupt anytime soon. I have 10 000 bucks left on my bank account and when they run out, I'm basically over, going homeless and with serious health issues. I'm really thinking about ending myself and I really need help.

What can I do? I speak 3 languages, English, French and Spanish and beyond that I have nothing except a 3 years long unfinished college degree.

I was thinking about learning a language and moving in a country with free healthcare if that exists for strangers, to try go get healthy and then find a place to work if I'm not judged due to my age to make some money while trying to pursue my dream of becoming an engineer, but I know no such country that would make this possible.

Please reddit help me, I have no way out but one and it's bad one. I have just had so much unberable pain and sorrow in my life.",09Sep2020,1

I’m posting this hopefully for some different point of views and opinions. Also for some positive feedback/support if anyone has any.

My girlfriend (now ex) flew across the country to spend our birthdays together. The first day (1st) she was here I realized I didn’t have romantic feelings for her. I decided not to tell her because I felt like I was protecting her. I didn’t want the week long trip to start off like that for her. I figured it would just mean a really long week, and it would’ve been horrible. Instead I spent the whole week with this facade of this loving caring boyfriend. Every hug, every kiss...I felt so empty inside. I felt so bad because I just felt like I had been leading her on for months and kept doing so.

The morning of the 6th, I was in the kitchen and she came to me and playfully asked “so can we still date after I get back home. I’m asking because I have abandonment issues.” I wasn’t going to lie to her face. I grabbed her by the shoulders and I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. The only words I could muster were “I don’t know.” She knew I meant no. She went into my room, and laid down. I sat next to her and grasped her hand, and told her I still care about her. I readjusted my hand and she shook my hand off. I took that as she didn’t want me there. So I went into the living room and sat down. A few minutes later she walked out of the front door only saying “I’ll be back.” After about 25 minutes I was started to get worried. We had our locations shared indefinitely. I went to check, and she stopped sharing her location with me. She took me off snapchat and Instagram as well. She came home after an hour or so and she just sat at the kitchen table and didn’t say anything. I drove home because my family had made me a birthday meal. After about 5 hours I made it back to my apartment. I got home, and soon after she left again. She didn’t stay out of long this time. Right after she left I texted her saying that I brought her food and I left it on the table. She texted me back saying “Stop texting me. Leave me alone. I can do that myself. I won’t talk to the you the rest of the time I’m here. You wasted my fucking time. I wish I was home so make this easier and let me be.”

After that I decided it would be a good idea for me to spend the night with my friend. I figured she didn’t to stay in the same place as me. I told her I was going to my friend’s and she just responded with “okay.” I packed some stuff and left. The next morning she texted me asking if I could still take her to the airport to which I agreed. A few hours later we had [this text conversation](https://imgur.com/a/Ih3PrcB).

(While I was at my friend’s I talked to them about what had happened. They both supported me. My female friend consoled me telling me that I was making decisions that I thought were best, and I shouldn’t feel bad. Also that she thinks my ex was possibly saying those things to make me feel bad, and that it’s easier to say those things than to forgive someone. My guy friend said that she was also acting immature by not communicating with me and blaming me for making the decisions.)

My ex and I didn’t say anything else until the next morning (8th) when I picked her up from my apartment and took her to the airport. We didn’t say a word the whole 20 minute trip. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to say anything. I had already tried to tell her over and over that I do care about her. She refused to accept that. I wasn’t going to try to convince her. Everyone makes their own conclusions and thinks what they want.

We got to the departures and she got out and said goodbye and have a good one in a good regular tone. I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. As soon as she started walking away. I felt instant regret about not saying anything.

The last few days I’ve felt this enormous guilt about what I did. I hurt her so badly. I care about her so much. She was one of my best friends. She helped me get through a really hard time of my life. How can I do that to someone... anyone… let alone her. Right now I don’t feel as much. I’m not sure if this is what being “numb” is. I know I fucked up, and I’m holding myself accountable. I can’t take back what I did and said.

I’ve been having mental health problems the past few months, but now I know it’s going to get worse. So I plan on talking to the VA about my options and seeing a doctor and psychologist. Partially to help out my impending mental deterioration. The other part to figure what the fuck is wrong with me and why I did all of that.

What I'd like to say is that the sort of parents I have they didn't grow up like I did and they lived good lives but weren't privileged. My dad left some big shoes to fill and it only gets bigger. 
I once told him about the issues I have. He told me to shut the hell up and keep on going. Cause if I think I'm in deep fucking hell. I can't stop, can't rest and have to keep going till I fix my problem. I think he's right about the liability. The fact that most of our problems are there because we let them. Because we were lazy, dumb or even unlucky. No one can help us except us.

I’m still luckier than most though. I live with my parents. I get to eat 3 times a day. My parents can afford to buy me medicine whenever I’m sick. I have a comfortable bed to sleep in, with air conditioning. Although I feel lonely, I’m living comfortably.

What I wanna share is how I feel like whenever I enjoy living a privileged life. Everytime I eat good food, I feel guilty because I know that there’s children out there starving to eat. Everytime I’m about to recover from the flu or any minor disease, I say to myself, “there’s some child out there who’s feeling the misery and pain you felt when you got sick, the only difference is his/her parents can’t afford medication.” 

This is fucking me up mentally, but I’m not here asking for any help. I’m simply sharing. I don’t wanna get rid of these sad depressing thoughts. I would feel even guiltier trying to do so. I’m thinking of using this guilt feeling for motivation to do what I can to help the less fortunate.

83,"I love egalitarianism. 

If there is one quality that I wish I could see more of in society, in general, is egalitarianism, where people are rewarded proportionally to how good they are at doing something useful, and how much value they bring to the society. I think it is highly unfortunate that almost every ""authority figure"" we tend to come across in our lives did not get into that position because they were somehow more qualified or more valuable, but rather because they sucked up to the right person at the right time in the right place. This extends everywhere we go, from the most ""democratic"" to the most ""authoritarian"" countries and institutions, people who get into the positions of power are typically not the most qualified, not the most intelligent, not the most productive, not the most valuable, not the most experienced, it is the people who grease the right palms. 

The largest difference between a ""democratic"" institution and an ""authoritarian"" institution is who's palms you grease; in a democracy, you grease the palms of the public through the art of BS. The better you are at public speaking, the better you are convincing the masses that you have their best interests in mind (even if that's complete nonsense) the better you are at playing the conman, the salesperson, the more likely you are to get into a position of authority. Conversely in an ""authoritarian"" institution, the better you are at sucking up to the big players, the establishment, giving them handouts and privileges, making under-the-table deals, the more likely you are to get the position of authority. 

Notice how in neither of the above you are required to be good at what you are doing, **you just have to convince the right people**. Otherwise, it's all a circus, an act, and worst of all: **the average person does not see the difference.** The best salesmen, the conmen, the ones who give handouts always prevail.

We live in a fake world where everything is just an act. Does not matter what you can do and what you have done, what matters is how others perceive it.

People faking their lives on social media, faking their achievements in their resume, faking their feelings and their personality, the BS, the participation trophies, the photoshopped images, the misleading news, the arbitrary hierarchies based on god knows what, we are fed crap our whole lives and those who can disguise their crap the best come out on top.

I even find it hard to read news nowadays (especially American news) because it's often political propaganda, or opinions/predictions of conmen, self-proclaimed ""experts"" who got a thing or two right in the past and now can BS as much as they want because they know people will believe them. 

All the above is why I often don't respect most of the authority figures, I don't see most of them as actual people of authority, I see them as good conmen, the fakers who fake the best. I'm sure we've all had an experience where we met people in position of authority and could not figure how they got there because they seemed to do damn stupid, well I just gave you the answer.

That is not to say I don't respect all people of authority. I have also met plenty of people in positions of power who genuinely seemed to know their work, who had the experience, had actual achievements, or at the very least had respectable personalities. But this is not often.

I just wish I can work for myself someday in the future, start my own business, be self-employed, or just find a way to live as independently as possible.

But they were close friends, so much so that when my grandfather’s brother attempted to rob the small store, the mafia boss threatened to call his mother whom he knew. My grandmother wasn’t nearly as close with him, but she did say hello while shopping at his store. 

The mafia boss made it big and closed down the local store, buying huge chains that I believe span multiple countries.

88,"Um, Idk how to start or express but I should anyway. 
Have you ever felt this super weird yet beautiful feeling? 
The feeling of being in the present? The feeling of realizing that this moment is all we are? We won't ever get to live in our past again even though we remember every bit of it. We won't ever, like ever, get to sit in a time machine and feel the future. We are THIS MOMENT. This breath we just took. We don't know if we'll get to breathe the next second or not but yet we spend our entire lives worrying about the future. 

Life is so beautiful yet so sadistic, maybe. It makes us suffer and  worry about a future that doesn't even exist yet it makes us live this moment which is all we'll ever have. 

I don't know how to put this across but IDK how to feel about this at the same time. 
If I'm here, I must have reincarnated. I must have felt this before but IDK how it felt then. I don't even know how many times have I felt this 'being in the moment' thing before. My past pulls me into this endless loop of negative thoughts and my future mocks at me for being so pathetic and negative and yet I can't be in the present.

I always have to be near someone if they’re in the same building as me. I can not be left alone or I start to feel anxious or something (I can be alone though, I just don’t choose or like to). If I am sitting near someone close to me I have to be touching them, wether it’s just my toe, finger or arm. I feel comfortable being near and touching. 

I have now had my cat for two years and can now say he is just like me. He can’t be left alone, always follows me from room to room (even outside) and he will place a paw on me if he is sitting close enough to me. 

Now is this a coincidence or was it adapted from me?",09Sep2020,1
122,I was doing a jumping warm up and and rolled my ankle. It was the worst ankle sprain I’ve ever had (sprained 5 times before) there was a lot of bruising and swelling. I run xc and have tried to get back into it. While I’m running it doesn’t really hurt but the next day I hobble out of bed. If I keep running on it will this result in a permanent injury? I want to be able play soccer in the summer time.,09Sep2020,1

124,"It’s red north of me (Oregon), and since I’m further away, it’s orange where I am. I like it when it’s these colors or grey when rainy. In fact, I love rain and it’s so rare where I live. I used to think rain makes me depressed, but it just makes me solemn (sorry, can’t remember the right word). It enhances creativity and feels like something new when it’s not the same bright empty blue color all the time.

But I still feel awful about the fires and all that. I’m not forgetting about it. I’ve prepared in case it reaches my house.",09Sep2020,1
126,I was out on a ride listening to some music as I usually do in these covid times. I had a stash of fireworks some mean 25-30 g ground salutes and I had pretty much always been safe with them nowhere close to being in danger besides the general risks but I had 3 left and I wanted to go out for a ride to light them off so I went out on a route that I had started going on which was just going to the other river bed parallel to the one close to my home and long story short one lit another and blew up in my hand when I was running. I had started freaking out and was the most scared ig I’ve ever been and I ended up collecting myself pretty quickly n told myself what I needed to get done. I walked from where I currently was to the exit of the riverbed phone in one hand and other in a absolute fucking mess. I got picked up and suffered for 9 hours screaming and crying in agony and in that 9 hours I was forced to wait 2-3 more hours than I needed to because the ambulance company refused to take me without confirming I had the insurance which I’m pretty sure defeated the point of a fucking medical emergency but besides that I learned after since I wasn’t able to move my scooter (scooter was a electric scooter so would be too hard for me to drag) and talk on the phone with 911 somebody had stolen it. I had told the firefighter and ambulance who got there where it was but if they didn’t care about it even though I was kept waiting there for like 6-10 minutes w a absolutely destroyed hand but ig then it still isn’t something they need to do. My sister who had been letting me use it knows how much I love to use it since I go for rides literally every day had gone to get it for me but it was already gone by then. I was just wondering if you guys think if I were to start a go fund me for like a dollar donation if ppl would help me try and pay back my sister or buy a new one when I get back function in my hand which still is going to be a very long time. Ok some of y’all are like me n can manage looking at gore I can send you a picture of my hand when it happened.,09Sep2020,1
127,This has easily been the hardest time in my life and I'm drowning. I'm trying to stay positive and see the silver lining in all of this. I have one more day til my girls an I are back to living in the car because of something I couldn't control. A voucher was all I could and I'm so grateful for that. I've been troll scammed and I have nowhere to go and no one left to reach out to. I know everyone's struggling right now. I just needed a small release for all this stress.,09Sep2020,1
128,"8 years ago I gladly signed up for *Imgur Pro* to support the platform and get some extra features.

3 years later, they sent me an email basically saying ""Thanks for supporting us. as a reward we are canceling your subscription, giving those features to everyone for free, and we're going to start serving you ads now.""

It's hilarious how hard they're begging for money now, and won't be seeing a dime from me after basically throwing my money back at me and spitting in my face.

Idk how the hell they thought any paying customer would take this email as a positive thing.

&gt;Dear Imgur Pro Subscriber,

&gt;Today, we celebrate Imgur’s sixth year, and what an amazing six years it has been! What began as a simple image uploading service has transformed into a community of the Internet’s most dynamic visual storytellers. Imgur has become the best place to explore, share, and discuss the Internet’s images--and we couldn’t have done it without your support and loyalty.

&gt;That’s why, on our birthday, we’ve decided that you’re the one who deserves a gift. We’re phasing out Pro subscriptions...and making the Pro features completely free for every Imgur user!

&gt;You can now store unlimited uploads in your Imgur account with multiple thumbnail options and complete image analytics and referrer data. The only difference is that now it’s free.

&gt;One thing to mention--one small display ad per page will now be shown. Since you’ve been used to sharing your albums ad-free, we’re keeping the ads turned off through your originally paid time so you have time to let your viewers know about the change.",09Sep2020,1
129,"To me I think most of my friends know me for copying other peoples work and renaming it to my own, and that's very true and something I regret, something else is that I'm a liar and that's also true, sometimes I wish I could rewrite my life and get rid of that and at other times I feel it's pointless, life is not worth living to me. And many other people think the same, and I also feel if I were to end it, why would people be sad, I'm a pointless, worthless liar and a fraud and my life has been very short so far, many people say if I were to end it now I would lose all the possibilities of the future and I know that's true, but what am I to the future if I'm a liar like all the others, that's what sucks about me. And I can't deal with it forever.
So what does life have in store for me, and my concern is that I may never find out.

131,"When I changed my clothes an hour after he took me home, I literally looked at the window while I was changing... because i was looking for him. Being cautious because of him. _(Prior this, 3 years ago someone used a ladder to see me through the window late at night)_ 

Why am I like this, 

I know he likes me. Its obvious. But it's not a wholesome like-like. I just know its a sex thing. Why i know... he just sleeps around, he's just another man**** to sum it up. 

After reading and watching many sources online about men that can suddenly change just like that- either physically or mentally- and knowing my mother's garbage abusive boyfriend irl.... and living with two males for years (dad and bro)- 

It made me less naive. 

Heck...

Like the saying goes, 

Men are scared of women because they don't want their egos to be tarnished,  Women are scared of men because they don't want to be KILLED or RAPED. 

Something like that. Ik sometimes it ain't true but still

What I'm trying to say is, I am somewhat scared and worried. God knows what this guy is capable of. I dont trust men. At all. Anymore. 

Its so fucking sad that me, us, the women have to go through all this mental preparation and extreme cautiousness because of one fucking guy or two, or three, or 5,000. Idk. 

 I have 1 more week of working with my cousins boyfriend. I am creeped out. I'll try to manage all of this. Hopefully nothing goes wrong. 

That's all.",09Sep2020,1
