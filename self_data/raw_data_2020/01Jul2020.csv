0,"Just received a DM today saying 

""You're a skinny failure c\*nt who'll never take shots and that's why you'll never amount to anything"".

I'm not sure why.... 

I'm quite introverted, so my social circle is really small (few friends here and there). So I can't think of anyone I've pissed off recently.  And my account isn't that popular, I only have around 200 followers, so the only way for someone to find my account is through a tagged photo or they've looked up my name in the search bar. I'm just wondering why would anyone would go so far out of their way to ruin someones day with such negativity? I've never received anything like this ever. :(",01Jul2020,1
1,"I am such a loser and so embarrassed of my own existence. I really want to travel and go on vacations, but other than my family, I have no one to go with. This summer will be boring because I am all alone. But back to my original point, I don't have friends. All I have are, at best, a few acquaintances that sometimes hit me up to chat on social media. The closest person I have to a friend lives across the country, so obviously there's no chance of us getting together. I am a pathetic piece of shit who struggles to connect with or relate to anybody she meets. I'm a weird freak, and many people have told me (though perhaps not explicitly) as much throughout the course of my life. See, I'm usually okay at casually talking to classmates, coworkers, etc., but when it comes to forming deep, meaningful relationships, I just can't seem to do it. I struggle to really relate to people beyond just surface level stuff, and that has been a hindrance to me all my life.

I'm so tired of getting on Instagram and seeing how much fun every other kid my age is having, out on the beach with their friends and getting to stay in cool-looking places. Not only do I not have the money to do that stuff, because I'm just a college student and spend nine months out of the year tied down with class and homework rather than working, I also don't have the PEOPLE to do it with. Yes, I did mention my family, but honestly, who wants to spend their whole life traveling with their family only? Besides, if I were to post those pictures, people would just think I'm a loser because they'd be like, ""Omg, she clearly doesn't have friends, she just does everything with her *parents,* hurr hurr!"" And the scariest part is I know they won't be around forever. They're still fairly young, but something that's kept me up at night lately is the thought that once they're gone, I truly will be alone in this world. No one will love me or care about me to the extent they do. I'm asexaul/aromantic, so it's not like I desire a boyfriend, and what other kind of platonic relationship could even come close to that degree of love?

Even my bedroom is pathetic. The paint is peeling off the walls, and I don't have the time or money to redo it at the moment. My shelves are covered with stuffed animals, which I love, but it doesn't look anywhere near as modern and trendy as most bedrooms I see other people have. My house was built in the 70s, I believe, so it kind of looks worn down in some ways. I'm embarrassed and ashamed to post pictures of myself in my room. Literally all I do these days is stay home, sit on my ass, and work. And come August, it will be back to school. Yay. Granted, I'm actually super grateful for my job and the ability to work from home. I honestly would be LOST without this job, because I have a ton of anxiety when it comes to working in a ""real"" environment. I had to quit my retail job because I was depressed and anxious all the time, and couldn't even enjoy my days off because I was too stressed about having to return.

But anyway, that's just a bit about myself. I am a total loner, am too big of a freak to connect with anyone around me, am a depressed, anxious mess, and don't have the money or resources to do anything cool with my life right now. I think about suicide on a daily basis, because the pain of seeing cooler people on social media has become too much for me to handle. I'm reminded daily of how worthless my life is in comparison to these others girls'. I feel ridiculous, and like I said at the start, I'm often embarrassed to even be a human on this planet. I'm not cultured or well-traveled like many other people my age, and I have significantly less followers on Instagram than other girls.

I'm losing hope that my dreams can ever come true...at least anytime in the near future. I'm losing hope that I will ever make a genuine forever friendship. Tell me why I shouldn't just cut my worthless throat right now??? Nobody except my parents would truly miss me, and I'm sure even they would get over it eventually. Nobody understands the depths of pain I am in and have been in for a very long time. As much as I've tried to stay optimistic about the future, I'm becoming more and more convinced that the future will be dark for me, especially considering what a shit show of a year 2020 has been. I honestly think I'd be dead right now if I had access to a painless exit method–I figure I owe myself at least that much mercy.",01Jul2020,1

hi sadie :) its 16 year old sadie aha. right now youre kinda scared. youre scared because you read dominics unsent letters and they make you worry youll go back to him again. you dont want to because youre scared youll just get hurt again. you also just want time for you both to grow individually. you have commitment issues now. youre scared to let someone in because you feel like they wont like the real you. you hide your true feelings a lot. you put on a face so everyones happy but youre not. as much as you seem happy youre not. youre kinda empty but enjoying life too aha. im proud of us. we're trying to just make the most of what we have. right now you have great friends. youre not looking for a special someone. youre just trying to keep yourself happy or content with your life. ALSO YOUR CLOTHES CAME IN TODAY SO YOURE EXCITED HEHEHE. but youre scared. if anything the strongest feeling for you right now is fear. but i hope when you see this again you wont have anything to fear and potentially have someone that will be able to understand and love you unconditionally. someone willing to understand every part of you. someone that wants to. dont you forget your worth girl :) love you &lt;3 well love me i guess aha.",01Jul2020,1
4,"  I work at a pub and a group of girls sitting and drinking and had a guy there with them too and one stopped to ask me can they play music on their phones I said no we arnt allowed to play music and I said if it was up to me I’d let them but it isn’t etc and I walked off to get glasses from another table when she said something to her friend “he’s...” (but I didn’t hear what she said from there) laughed and on my whoway back past she looked back at me and said ‘what time do you finish?’ I paused a little and said ‘oh....10pm’ (it was ‪8:40pm‬ at this time) and then she turned away and said ‘oh so you don’t want to drink with us then’, is this a bad thing? 

Edit; they then left ‪at about 10-15‬ mins later for another bar, they already asked my boss can they play music a while before they asked me and he said no",01Jul2020,1

7,"I got permanently sick at 13, but I've had immune system issues much earlier. My parents were doctor avoiders, so I had to start bleeding out and be unable to walk before they accepted that I was sick.

I should have been wearing a mask for most of my childhood, but it wasn't socially acceptable. I got sick a lot as a result. Poverty didn't help matters.

Anyways, I feel so liberated now that healthy people finally have to wear masks, and I hope it is permanent, not just for safety, but also because I find most people to be ugly. Please also consider wearing sunglasses (snarky humor).

But it's not just that. As an intelligent sophisticated male with no energy since 13, who needed an assistant in order to attend college but was denied, and is considered not competitive enough to be hired by employers, I'm also happy to see other people not working. Now people can't make horrible hateful remarks and shun me for being a non-working person. A lot of those horrible people have since cried about losing their jobs and needing to go on welfare, and that made me feel so good.

But it's also satisfying on a general social level. Other people now get to feel my pain, where they would normally be pristinely incapable of empathy. Yes, it is normal and common to need intimacy and companionship in our lives. You're not really whole without it unless you're asexual, otherwise you're a huge liar saying things as part of your denial process. I found it to be fabulously hilarious when I heard that a lot of singles dyed their hair, and later shaved their heads, out of boredom or insanity from isolation. Your life defines how you act and think. This is undeniable now.

As for me, after the 18 month process to fast-track the vaccine, I'm still going to essentially be in quarantine. I hope people will not be so hateful toward me just because I am fully functional and look normal. I have basic needs like anyone else, such as the need for intimacy and sex and companionship, and I should get equal opportunity to find a skinny girl to be with, regardless of how much effort I am able to put in. In case anyone doesn't know, I absolutely do not have equal opportunity. There are tons of men and women like me, and we are all silenced by society, censored, denied help to find the love that we need in order to thrive. We often have no friends because people think we are boring. We are forced to ask family, therapists, doctors, support staff, and complete strangers for help, and are often taken advantage of in the process. Of course, no one cares enough to help, and therapists aren't allowed to help because of privacy laws. I can not and will not ever stop reaching out like this, even though I often get lots of downvotes by ableists. My cause is just as important, and just as urgent, as the top causes in the news today. There is plenty of evidence that being in a relationship can make people more productive, maybe even productive enough to be productive members of society.

For now, though, until my people are accepted in society, I have to offer myself as a body pillow or sex doll, because I can't in good conscience offer much else. Life has made me very cynical and blunt and reserved and hyper aware of abusive behavior, and given me a dark twisted sense of humor. All I'm allowed to do is hope for monogamy, as I'm not seen by society as good enough to be relationship material. I have to say no smokers for health reasons. I have to look only online because it is too dangerous and stressful to look offline. Even online, I have to somehow avoid the issue, or else people I contact will, in almost every case, berate me for things in my life that no one can control. So I also have to swipe and just hope that someone doesn't care about my issues and messages me first.

Anyways, I've been chatting with a girl for a while who I like as a person, but she just wants to be friends cuz I am not attracted to her on the outside, if you know what I mean. Just gotta find someone like her on the inside (sexual, awkward, tolerant, forgiving, kinda a stalker) with outsides that I find attractive... Since discovery of anyone who would be interested is so difficult, I think that people like us need personal community help in finding each other and matching. It's a numbers game, after all, and the odds are extremely stacked against us.

It's not like normal singles dating at all, they complain plenty, but the difference is like day and night. Actually, my theory is that we probably pair up more easily because we have to be realistic about our value in society. We can't demand perfect partners like everyone else does (yes, they do). We can't take as much abuse, but (and) we have to endure more. Besides the public prejudice, we also have all of the normal difficulties involved in finding a partner, such as matching our values and what's most important to us. Then there are atypical atypicals like me, hypersexual, aromantic, can't be around smoke, picky about looks, etc. (In many cases, being intellectual, health conscious, and computer literate can be problems when trying to relate with others in my demographic.)

I hope life gets better for you all. Just try to learn empathy from this experience, please. Who knows, someone like me could be key in preventing another pandemic. If people hate on that person, they may not have the will to contribute at all.",01Jul2020,1
9,"When I was a teenager and in my early 20s I drank **a lot**. I blacked out multiple times a week, I'd wake up and run to the window to make sure my car was parked and okay, I'd leave bars after being cut off to go to other less strict bars, had empty liquor bottles in my car, drank at work occasionally, like really I was drunk all the time. 

I eventually went to aa and smart recovery programs but what got me off booze was finding things I love to do and making those my goals along with keeping people around me that had similar goals. 

Fast forward to me being 26 now and I can hardly even drink alcohol. I buy spirits if I know I'm not going anywhere and just want to relax maybe once every few months but it almost always goes to waste. In AA they said it was impossible to have a drink again without falling down the rabbit hole and for most people there that was probably true. 

Just wondering if anyone else here has experienced this. I really don't doubt that I had a severe drinking problem but it seems strange that it's no longer even a slight temptation.",01Jul2020,1

12,"I'm only now managing to stabilize emotionally, hours later.  A fraudulent vendor stole $264 from me through Amazon.  They say I'm not eligible for a refund and when I try to contact them my message is supposedly not sent because of ""internal server error"" on Amazon.  They're aware of the situation and just want plausible deniability.  The fraud was co-ordinated and even involved my credit card company.  There isn't anything I can do about it, and that's always the toughest situation for me to handle.

13,"Living is weird. I don't feel like I'm doing it anymore. Quarantine is probably just catching up to me but I haven't felt anything in a little while. I don't think I've even felt sad in a long, long time. Feeling happy is even rarer. At this point, I just want to feel some type of emotion; I just want to cry. Sometimes I question the legitimacy of my own feelings. I think I get angry a lot but I'm not sure. It mostly just feels like I'm faking everything. The thing I look forward to the most is sleep.

15,"My grandmother died about 10 months ago, but I haven't felt sad. I love my grandma, I used to see her every other week. But I feel nothing. I've almost cried Because I felt bad for not being sad. 
I saw her while she died, I was one of the last people to hold her hand, I kept talking to her, playing music she liked, trying to keep her happy in her last hours. But when she died I was the only one in my entire family not crying.  I don't know why. 

I am not religious and as much as I want to believe in things such as ghosts, and as much as I try to convince myself, I have accepted that once I die, in my mind nothing will happen. It scares me sometimes. Maybe this has something to do with why I am not sad? 

But the thing that makes me feel worse is I cried for days once my dog died. I didn't feel sad about my other ones, but when one certain dog. Who my family had to sadly give away to a better home, died I cried for hours.  I cry over shows and movies. 

I have an okay relationship with both my parents but I can't show affection properly. I can't hug, say I love you or anything of the sorts. But I find myself all the time being jealous of familes in shows. Or looking at sort of found families and enjoying those the most. Maybe I don't have the best relationship and I don't know it.

17,"6th grade I’m eating lunch by myself after getting bullied by a group of 8th graders. Didn’t have friends I could call brothers at the time. That was the last time I thought I’d get bullied. 

High school comes around and I play football and tennis. Tennis, I was real good at. I get made fun of once in a while for being a minority but I just laugh along with it. Some of these jokes were funny at first, but when you hear it over and over, it’s not funny anymore. If I didn’t laugh along, I’d be seen as sensitive and made fun of even more. I saw these people at parties I went to and was cool with pretty much everyone in high school. I wasn’t popular, wasn’t weird, just kind of chilling in there. 

Graduated high school and I’m getting bullied at class. This guys is making minority jokes, saying things about me, doing everything he can to bring me down. I shrug it off the first few times then it escalates. I’ll be sitting down and doing my work and get a water bottle thrown at me or a pencil. Then when I tell the teacher, he shrugs it off and says stop it, but it keeps happening. Eventually I’ve had enough and confront him and tell him to cut his shit. He stands up and starts getting aggressive. I’m told to sit down by the teacher. It just keeps happening and it’s been going on for the past 2 months. I could take him in a fight, but I’d rather avoid all the trouble I’d get into.

38,"Today I started my first ever meal plan in an out of hospital setting after having suffered with anorexia since the age of 8 (10 yrs). 

You would think that I would've been given this support earlier seeming as I've had multiple hospital admissions but the fact is, in Australia (and many other countries) the funding for outpatient specialised eating disorder services and dietics appointments simply isn't there.  

I am one of the lucky ones who got acess to a publically run intensive outpatient program - the only one in a city of over 4.5 million people. 

Anorexia has a mortality rate of 1 in 5 and is the deadliest mental illness which makes it hugely frustrating how inadequate these services are. I am incredibly fortunate for this oppurtunity and realising this makes me want to try my hardest to recover and avoid relapse. 

Someday I want to use my strength and knowledge to help other sufferers personally and on a broader spectrum by advocating for better treatment acess.

Later today she did bought this sucker thing to get pimples out, but when she put it on my face it felt so weird and unpleasant to my skin that I chicken out and she called me a sook. Am I wrong in thinking this and simply being a child about it? Or am I right in thinking this. I'd love to hear your opinions and thoughts below! Have a great day everyone",01Jul2020,1
43,"Im not stranger to horrible pasts, i know the feeling of the soul crushing moments of loss when i saw my girlfriend died, I do know how is it like being the outcast and the bully target in the entire class because I was academically smarter and behave differently from the rest and being branded as a freakazoid due to my medical condition and i knew every damn feeling of how it feels like of being rejected or being judged because my ugly face even by my own family agrees. I know them most of it and thats probably why I was nicknamed as the the walking teddy bear by my close ones.

I had this friend, he is a good person, I know his heart means well but his actions and behaviour never help his case. But he gets bullied by his entire class, people who was supposed to sit with him even left him after a few days and he is the only person who sits at the back alone. So one day, he decided to jump that morning but i helped him, introduce him to my circle of friends, make sure he experience what is like to be have his existence acknowledged for once. But it work for awhile. He began to be very very possessive like he wanted the rest not to ""steal his only friend"", and began to push my friends away from me by talking alot of shit about them for years. Of course, I ignored it and called quits after our graduation considering how much ""alive"" he has been these years and my tolerance is breaking at its peak.

We still talk but his life is still the same and it goes around in circles about his mother's death which was 5 years ago. Im always at the end of the phone listening to the same repetitive stories about her and how it impacts him, that I memorized and could even recite it like a mantra. But later i found out that he moved on years ago but he did this to get my attention and other's as well by wallowing into self-pity and proclaiming that he has the worst one among all. 

But, has he ever ask about mine? Never. 

Im not the only one having series of trouble family dramas about finances (which he will never encounter once in the day of his life) on my side and its emotionally draining me and my mental health is worsening day after day with my daily occurrences around me. And lets face it, each of us here have our own battles to fight at home or anywhere in our lives. So i decided to avoid talking to him anymore to look after myself, but he began to look for me by harassing my circle of friends in my social medias, threw profanities in my texts to demand an audience from me. My close ones blocked him and word has it that he wanted to revive the ""old days"" back then in school. I found that sentence hilarious and ironic, Why bother reviving the old days when he spend his whole 5 years fighting with people and talk so much shit about my close friends in my circle and in his entire school life? And i have been there supporting him from the beginning to the end which makes me his only friend and he have never made anything productive to improve himself or make new friends except raining a lot of hell on me. The last time i heard from him from my friends, he sounded very emotionally unstable after i blocked him in everything that i have to avoid communication from him. and yes, he has fake accounts. You could imagine my inbox filled with crap loads of profanities and hostilities in his messages .

The last message i gave him was a suicide hotline number, changed my number and left. I might be his only friend, but i have to call quits this time. I cant take the emotional draining anymore, and its a pointless cause helping someone who never takes the first initiative to redeem or fix themselves even having someone to support him for many years. So, if he whatever he wants to do from now on, im not going to be there anymore. Its been 7 years guiding him, helping him to get up on his feet but its time to leave and move on in my life.",01Jul2020,1
44,"The reason for saying “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” isn’t because it’s a waste of time to fix it. (You might be tempted to improve something that’s already working, which could be called “fixing it”). It’s because you might break it. A lesser known version of this quote makes this clear: “If it ain’t broke, fix it until it is”.

This quote isn’t just good for handymen and engineers, it also applies to politics. New policies are introduced which are intended to make society better, but since no one can predict the future perfectly, these policies sometimes make society worse.

Some people might be willing to experiment with policies so they can learn how well they work. But this has some issues. You’re experimenting on your own country’s people; the long term benefit of discovering good policies doesn’t always justify the short term pain. Sometimes a bad policy can have long term effects even after it’s revoked, like if your country’s economy gets behind. And sometimes what starts as a bad experiment sticks around because of bureaucracy or the next generation gets used to having it.

Therefore, it’s understandable why conservatives don’t want to risk messing with the parts of politics that are working well enough for now. But conservatism also has its roots in Plato’s philosophy, who believed that society gradually approaches an ideal state (by making small incremental changes, only to the things that are “broke”). Then the goal is to keep it there, by ensuring that’s it’s protected from outside enemies, and that each new generation is taught the right ways.

On the other hand, progressivism in the long term believes that there is no ideal state and that society must constantly change. So it’s possible that there are people who think of themselves as progressives but their long term view doesn’t match. Let’s take an example of someone who fights for LGBT rights.

If this person has a long term conservative view, then they think that LGBT rights have always been a necessary ingredient of an ideal society, and somehow we just never realised this till now; but once we have them, we won’t need to change anything else in the future. Whereas if this person has a long term progressive view, then they expect that we will keep discovering new groups of people in the future, similar to the LGBT, that we’ve been we’ve been withholding rights from; but we don’t know who they are yet.

Conservatism often gets misrepresented as an argument from tradition (if it’s good enough for the 1950s it’s good enough for me) or an argument from slippery slope (if we let men marry men then next they will be marrying frogs), but it should probably be thought of more as a practical way of running a country rather than a purely philosophical approach. After all, most of us are naturally conservative in our personal lives and wouldn’t just move house or change jobs or get divorced without giving due consideration to the risk that it might make things worse. We should treat our politics the same way.",01Jul2020,1
46,"I was 19 and a freshman in college, I had a ""friend"" who was 24 and mostly just bought me alcohol. We went to a club one night and I started grinding on him. I was at a depressing place in my life (I'm bipolar) and idk I just wanted someone to show some attraction towards me, make me feel valid. I had just been dumped a month ago and it crushed my self esteem.

""Friend"" bought me many more drinks, and he took me home because I was so drunk. I still remember most of that night very clearly though. I went to lie down on his couch but the room was spinning so badly and I felt nauseous and wanted someone to hold onto... idk, something. So I went and climbed into bed with the ""friend"". I remember that we started kissing and then had sex...

Here's the thing: I never saw him put a condom on. After he finished, I asked him to eat me out because I didn't finish and I wasn't even attracted to him. He declined and said that it would taste bad from the condom. So I was like yeah fine ok.

In the morning, I did see a condom wrapper on the floor. But then I went to the bathroom and found some kind of liquid down there... I had never had anyone cum in me so I wasn't sure how to tell. Cause maybe I was just super wet or something? But it was different than anything I had seen before. I didn't even talk to him on the way out, I was petrified. It was extra scary because I know he himself had a history of being badly sexually abused and I thought he was never the sort of person to do that to another person.

I went back to my dorm and put a pad on and went to sleep. I saved the pad in a bag because I thought maybe I could take it to a lab or something and have them look at it and tell me if it's jizz or not.

After that I only saw him again once, to buy me alcohol of course. We didn't talk about it at all.

When I was moving out of my dorm, I took one look at the pad, and threw it away. I wanted to put the past behind me. Ever since then, I have told people that it was rape. I know that you will all tell me I am ""ruining a man's life by falsely accusing him"" but I only told a few trusted friends, I did not tell him or anything in his life, and I certainly did not press charges. But it felt like rape, it really did, and while I know it's possible the condom broke, he would have noticed when he removed it. He would have TOLD ME. And that's what haunts me... I will never know. I will never know if I am valid in identifying myself as a survivor of assault. I feel like I'm lying. There's no way I would ask him - there are other reasons for me to dislike him, including that my friend had a bad sexual encounter with him as well.

I have NEVER IN MY LIFE given permission for someone to finish in me without a condom, the thought disgusts me, especially after this experience, I don't plan to have anyone cum in me until I am trying to have a baby. I don't find it sexy at all. And I feel like this experience is probably why. Luckily my boyfriend knows most of the story and I fully trust him to never do that to me. But I feel like I needed to talk about it here because I wonder if anyone can relate :-/ or at least tell me my story is valid

TL;DR - I am 80% sure a guy came in me but I will never actually know and I feel like I can't really call it rape",01Jul2020,1

50,"Relationships? I had them. My first love was from 15 till 18, my second love lasted 3 months, the one after that almost 4 years.
Been single and trying hookups and stuff for a while but I can’t find a meaning in it.
Been used as pillow for venting or as a toy just for sex far too often.
Women fall for me because I’m highly extroverted around them, confident and they think I have a good looking face and nice body.

I’ve had an abusive on/off relationship from late 2018 until Christmas 2019 which left me with a lot of damage and trust issues I had to work on. The only good thing about lockdown was that I was forced to reflect on my life and past relationships. 

But man.. dating sucks. Women constantly show a lot of attention, I fall for them and want to things slowly and then either their exes reappear or they suddenly decide that they’d rather like to have a friends with benefits type of thing with me.

It’s not that I’m needy or anything especially on the most recent one that just dumped me I think I did everything right.

I also got the impression that a lot of people these days, both genders, only date for validation and quick sex and I’m over it.

Yeah sure the sex with me is nice, I have a cute face and a nice body, I get it. Yeah I’m charming and I treat people around me good and I’m successful in my job.
Thanks for being the 10th person to tell my it’s amazing how much I know and what kind of advices I can give.

But it would be nice if there was just one fking person on this earth who’d appreciate me for my inner values and would just commit to me.

I want someone to want me and not chase women all the time, I want to be appreciated based on my inner values and not just used for sex.

I tried dating women who weren’t exactly my type, different education levels, ages. I really did. Been through the whole ghosting shit our generation does.

I always read that there aren’t any decent men anymore and I start to believe I could turn into an asshole too because it’s just not worth the effort.

You’re worth nothing even if you have your shit and looks together. 

I feel like shit for being used for sex by women, I thought men do this but hell man.

And I also think that it’s intimidating if you’re truly confident, good looking and successful. 

I know my downsides too. I’m only 5‘8 and I have a fucked up family I wouldn’t introduce anyone immediately too. I’ve got trust issues but I’m not jealous or pushy. I hide them and give every person a new fresh chance to show otherwise.

If you’ve got any advice for me how to be less outcome Independent or just at least don’t loose hope and the will to put effort in, just tell me.

BTW. English is my third language so go easy on me.

57,"Since my childhood, labels like 'talented', 'naturally gifted', and 'intelligent' were given to me by my parents and relatives simply because I used to ace my school exams. My memory was decent, and scoring marks was a mere matter of memorizing the content, rather than learning and understanding. Receiving praise upon praise for this feat of memorization, I falsely believed myself to be a genius who could achieve any level of success without putting in much effort.

After graduating from school, I entered university in pursuit of a  degree in Statistics. Gradually, day by day, my superiority complex shattered as I observed people who were actually intelligent, who could grasp and learn new concepts without breaking a sweat. These people were not only intelligent, they were also hard working. They kept learning and exploring things which were beyond the degree curriculum. Ironically, I found myself in the shoes of low scorers, whom I used to ridicule back in school. My superiority complex got converted into inferiority complex within a couple of months.

Then came the despair and clinical depression from not being able to understand concepts, below average grades, and comparing myself to my classmates who had overwhelming academic &amp; non-academic achievements. Throughout my degree I've struggled to learn. I've struggled in creating projects, which require applying your knowledge, and not mere memorization. I was forced to push myself everyday. Finally, I've completed my degree with a CGPA of 3.3/4.0 

The change from excellent grades of school to below average grades of college has changed the nature of praise that I receive. Now, my parents and relatives go like 'Yes, you scored kinda good, thanks to your 'Intelligence/Talent', but you're not utilizing it to its full extent. You could do better if you worked a little'. This pisses me off.

I learnt to respect hard work. I learnt not to look down on those who have low grades. I learnt that life is indeed in favor of those born with intelligence, but thats not an excuse for not working hard.",01Jul2020,1

- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie.

68,"To start with, I’m 21, and I’ve always related a lot to Otis from Sex Education if anyone’s watched that show. Really awkward about the opposite sex, maybe a little too nice to everyone, which results in rare bursts of frustration, anger and confused feelings from trying not to be a bad person, when trying to please everyone just leads me to pushing people away and not being true to myself. There was a thread on reddit about how constantly teasing kids about friends of the opposite sex can lead them to shut off that side of their lives from their parents, and that made me realise why I’ve ended up like this, and it’s the same as in that show; helicopter parents, and in my case I shut down most of my personality because it would be a source of arguments or teasing as I grew up.

My parents growing up wouldn’t let me a few streets down to play with friends until I was like 12/13, so growing up I never got really close to everyone apart from my one best friend. People were always at arms length. Even in high school parties, long walks, meeting in places at the other end of town, being out at night, all way off limits until I was 16 or 17. One time my dad looked through the messages on my phone cause I kept laughing at something I was looking at and wouldn’t tell him what it was, and he saw I was talking to a friend and swearing a lot (I swear a shit ton lmfao) and got insanely angry at me for talking like that. Relationships wise, any girl I brought up to my parents would result in a merciless teasing, even though they thought it was just joking around. There were times I remember I’d be like crying and yelling cause they wouldn’t stop teasing me about certain girls I was friends with, and when my mum would tell me dad to tone it down cause it was annoying me that much, I was just told that I ‘couldn’t take a joke’. I remember so clearly I had a little innocent crush on a girl in my class when I was like 8, and one day she found out and we decided to be ‘boyfriend and girlfriend’. When I went home from school that day, I decided to ‘split up with her’ in my head cause I didn’t want to have to tell my parents about it and have them tease me and embarrass me over it. It’s really sad because I remember really liking this girl in the most innocent sense back then, and even that young I was sabotaging any potential relationships without quite realising why. Really fucked up when I think about it.

The result is now I keep everything from my parents, cause I’m a completely different person to them now than I am to everyone else in my life. I don’t invite my friends round cause I’ve distanced those parts of my life so much that I’m a completely different person around my friends compared to my family, and it would just be weird. My family probably view me as moody, awkward, closed off, unemotional, too serious, etc. But around my friends I’m known as the funny one; always cracking jokes and stuff, and while they know I’m awkward, it’s in a more endearing way than with my family who probably think I’m weird. I’m not free to be myself around my family because that jokey, slightly awkward but bright dude who tends to crack rude jokes was always made fun of or was something my parents would get angry about. Anytime my personal life came up growing up, it would be a source of a a massive argument. With relationships, I’ve grown up thinking subconsciously that liking something is something to be embarrassed and ashamed about, and now every possible romantic prospect becomes this massive deal of like anxiety and pressure; even having my friends know I like someone feels excruciating, even though they don’t really care and will be supportive. Hell, right now I like a girl I’m friends with and she knows, but I feel like I missed my chance with her because I wasn’t confident enough to be up front about how I felt earlier on when she was showing major signs of being interested, and I would instead get embarrassed and stuff. It’s so unattractive.

So now I’ve grown up to be a guy who’s never been in a relationship, who struggles to connect with people because I kept literally everyone around me at arms length growing up and opening up is so uncomfortable. I couldn’t make close friends cause when they invited me out I’d have to turn it down, and I couldn’t date because I was too insecure, unconfident and ashamed to make any sort of move beyond being nice and friendly to them and hoping something would happen. Now I’m 21, and while I have a group of friends and handle all this a little better, those insecurities are still drilled in there: I still don’t let anyone in, I still don’t have the confidence to start a relationship, and I feel depressed knowing I’m like a completely different person around family and friends. I’m constantly years behind other people emotionally; I’m still mentally a shit scared little kid who’s scared to swear around his parents or show them my real self, scared to ask out a girl cause it seems like a big deal, scared to let anyone get too close because I didn’t do it growing up, just this big ball of anxiety and restraint, constantly second guessing how I should act every second. It’s fucking exhausting, and it’s really hit home for me how much my upbringing caused that. I love my parents, they tried their best, but they fucked up in a lot of ways.",01Jul2020,2

71,"I'm Russian, and most people don't speak a foreign language here, even English, and we're pretty isolated on the internet because the preferred platforms are vk instead of FaceBook and Pikabu instead of Reddit. There's Twitter, and Instagram, and some others, but the first two are the biggest ones and the olders (I think).

I've started speaking English pretty early thanks to the internet, particularly Youtube, and since I've been able to understand written and spoken language pretty well, I started to move away from Russian-speaking communities and join English-speaking ones, because I found them more interesting. Mostly thanks to Reddit. And that opened me to a lot of stuff that I think is very important now, both through direct messages like being lgbt-friendly, being tolerant and caring about myself; and indirectly, like getting to know about the slave trade,  the holocaust, and various other atrocities that people have committed over the years, including Russians.

It's not that more progressive ideas don't exist in Russia, but I think I would've gotten way less exposure to it were I not know English and had the availability to get experience from people all around the world. The Russian people are still homophobic, they have outdated views on sex, mental self care is only making its way here, and many dislike other cultures. It sucks, really. So I'm thankful that I got the opportunity to get access to so many people that are this open-minded, to have much more material to make me a better person.

That also has made disconnected from mainstream Russian culture, since near 100% of what I consume is in English (outside of academics). I tried to find something good in Russian several times. It's near impossible to find anything good on Youtube, so that wasn't successful. Pikabu is like browsing r/all all the time, except worse. vk has nothing but memes and porn (often together). For some time, I was subscribed to r/Pikabu, and I liked it better than the site at first. Then, after a while, I realized that I upvoted one post in several weeks, and the subreddit was just making me angry more than anything. So I unsubscribed recently (and that was what moved me to make this post). I don't use Twitter or Instagram, and I don't really care to follow individual people, I have enough of that from Youtube.

So I guess I'm staying in my English internet. Of course, if you know some good communities that speak Russian, I'm all ears. I could use some new podcasts as well, they're all in English too.


**tl;dr Russian people suck**, and English exposed me to many new and great ideas, history and concepts that I wouldn't have found on the Russian internet. I tried to find some good communities recently, but failed spectacularly. I think I'm staying on the English side of the internet.


P.S. Of course, this post is all about the internet communities, and when it comes to our books, movies, music, art, and all that, it's a different story. Russian is a beautiful language, it has some of the best writers out there, the Soviet movies are the greatest, and we had and have great scientists, and I could go on and on. It's just that I don't feel welcomed in the larger community of people.",01Jul2020,0

I ‘listen’ to her when we call but she has a lot of energy I can’t handle but recently she asked me something.

There had been stories about two trans girls being ‘removed’ by their dates/boyfriends and it scares her to tell the guy she really likes about her transition. So she asked me to help her test the waters.

I am a Pan, cis female and would like to help her but i don’t think I would be a believe able MtF as I am not very feminine to begin with. Maybe I could say I was thinking about FTM transition but it might not have the same result.

I would like to help her and I like to count her as a decent person in this sucky person world. 

This would all be over Zoom or phone and my voice can go kinda low. For Zoom she suggested I put on some make up and nice clothes... I don’t own any make up besides nail polish and chap stick. Nothing in my closet is really girly and I can’t go out an buy stuff that I may use once or twice.

74,"Last semester, (second semester of my freshman year of college) I took accounting. I fell into a really awful depressive episode, and failed every single exam that I took for the class. Because of COVID, I could switch the class to Pass/Fail and it didn’t hurt my GPA when I ultimately failed the class.

I need the class as a prerequisite for business school, so I decided to take it again this summer. I was nervous because I failed so miserably last time. I got a therapist, focused on improving my mental health, put a lot of work in, ***and today, I passed the first exam of the Summer Semester with an 87.8% — which is B+ !!*** I’m beyond excited!!!

This is the same test that I failed with a 46% because I was having near constant su•cidal thoughts. I couldn’t function enough to study, and I didn’t know any of it. I’ve dealt with depression for so so long and I convinced myself that I would never amount to anything. This gives me a little bit of hope. Maybe I can succeed. Maybe everything will be okay.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

76,"I have never had anyone, and waking up to that fact this year has been sobering. I never really had a dad, I never really had a mom, I never had much of a family to rely on in general, and the only two positive role models I had both died, one from a heart attack and the other from killing himself.

Ever since I was thrown out of my ""home"" at age 19 I've had to fend for myself without having any of the knowledge to do so really. I've stumbled in the dark with zero guidance for a very long time, but for some reason I made it this far. But then this fact occurred to me, and even though I survived for years on my own, the responsibility of that it's  ""just"" me now and that it always has been ""just"" me felt like getting hit by a freight train.

I always had some kind of illusion that I had people to lean on, my family for one, but having finally broken off contact with most of them for good reason that illusion just disappeared. It left me feeling hollow, lost, sad, angry, just plain terrible mostly.

It put much of my past behaviour into perspective, how often I've looked for a role model or even a parental figure in my friends or even their parents. How much I've tended to put people on pedestals not seeing their faults because I've craved acceptance. I know now that I'm the kind of person that works really well following someone else, it makes me feel great to have someone care about me and pull on me to go and do stuff, since it's hard for me to ""just"" go and do something without planning and questioning, but I've learned to do those things on my own know even though it takes alot out of me.

I have been waiting for someone to save me, but now I realize that ""I"" am the only one that can, and the weight of that responsibilty is crushing and almost suffocating. Apparently ""I"" am the one I have been looking for, but I was dealt such a shit hand at the start that no one ever taught me that self reliance, it's not fucking fair.

When all is said and done I am quite happy about this though, it's just going to be hard and it's probably gonna suck alot, but such is life and I choose to believe that it's worth it. I got this far without knowing anything, so let's see where I can go know.",01Jul2020,1

Now I’m thinking IG could go too.

The reason I haven’t yet is that there’s quite a few people on there I probably don’t have phone numbers for. But I’m starting to feel like it’s having such a negative impact on my mental health that I need to get rid of it.

Has anyone found that getting rid of social media has massively improved their feelings about their own life? I’m sick of the negative feelings that come with comparing myself to others.

78,"I came into these two subreddits with the intention of trying to listen to their perspective while also sharing my perspective as a person associated with the protest movement that has taken hold in the US in the past month. I have been disturbed by both the demeanor of police on those subreddits and in real life in response to the protests as well as the extremely hostile, anti police sentiment in /r/publicfreakout among other subreddits. I believe that dialogue and exchanging of perspectives is the only way to ever reconcile problems like this so thats what I wanted to do. 


First I went into /r/protectandserve and made a post in which I wrote a lengthy piece expressing what I thought was a take on the police that they hadn’t heard heard too much before. The post was respectful (I didn’t just come in sayin ACAB, or calling for abolition of the police, or calling all of them racist). I didn’t and still dont really believe ACAB. The tone of the post was along the lines of: 

It is clear there is something wrong with policing in America. Here is what I think. What is your response to these videos and my perspective?


I included a couple dozen example videos evidencing the presence of the problem (of violent/disproportionate responses to namecalling, peaceful protesting, simply being out during protests, etc.). I spent about ten or fifteen minutes typing this out trying to make sure I didn’t violate their rules. Regardless, within less than a minute i received a message that I was permabanned from /r/protectandserve. I messaged a few of the mods asking why but I never received a response. I was disheartened and disappointed in the mods. 


Then i went to /r/police and made a few comments on a post that resonated with me. Then I got into an exchange with one of the commenters (presumably an LEO). He started attacking straw man arguments and insulting my intelligence and calling me a bigot among other things. This commenter was hot and I got a little hot as well and perhaps didn’t behave as diplomatically as I could have but I don’t think I violated the rules any more than he did. Regardless, I was permabanned. I haven’t bothered messaging the mods of /r/police. 


In any case, way to go mods and subscribers of police subreddits, you’ve just made someone more militant against the police than they used to be. 


I wanted an exchange of ideas/perspectives but instead I got shutout because I harmed your fragile egos. Keep on jerking your cop buddies off and thinking you’re more righteous than the public. Just cause thats all you choose to listen to doesnt mean its true.",01Jul2020,0

81,"Long story short I have a supervisor who has been making me feel terrible at work in each communication / interaction I’ve had. Just generally accusing me of being disrespectful / insubordinate. I’m often defending actions that my direct manager had approved. When honestly, I don’t want to sound less than humble, but I am good at my job and I’m extremely career driven so I give it my all.

Ive been feeling very conflicted because I am very receptive to feedback and can see room for my own growth / where I’m failing before I see it in anyone else. This is a strength and a weakness because I am always striving to be better but can be very self deprecating. I will hold it all on my shoulders. Anyways, I went back and forth on calling it out because I felt it might just be me taking things too personally, being over sensitive, and feeling like it would be turned against me to be another area I’m told I’m disrespectful and subpar. These are some common messages I had received all though childhood and I’m starting to see where it’s still in my mind holding me back. 

I finally opened up to a coworker on how uncomfortable I felt and how I was struggling to bring it up. This co worker not only listened but she told me I did not need to explain myself at all because she’s watched the interactions and how I have been singled out and talked to in ways that would have made her feel attacked. That she’s been pushing feedback to this supervisor because she sees it and it’s uncomfortable for her too. 

In the midst of a shitty situation, my coworker filled me with gratitude. Just by helping me feel so seen, heard, and validated. I am now ever so slightly confident in moving forward with addressing this issue. Just by knowing that this discomfort is valid, it feels easier to challenge my worry that I’m over sensitive. So, yeah. I just wanted to share some hope. In times of discomfort and growth, seek allies. There is always going to be someone out there who understands you, even if it takes a while to find. 


TL;DR: A supervisor has been making me uncomfortable at work and I wasn’t doing anything because I was scared it was all in my head. Coworker highlighted that it is something very real and not okay. That validation and empathy made me feel brave enough to move forward in addressing the issue. I wish everyone in the world would always be able to find an ally on their most difficult days... to give a little hope and highlight areas to be grateful for in life.",01Jul2020,1

88,"I don't know anybody I can share this with now, so I hope I came to the right place.Also English isn't my first language so excuse me for any mistakes.

# A little background:

I(22F) had a BF(23M) -*who's now my Ex*\- he was very abusive and manipulative and I was so naive back then and I had depression so I didn't know how f\*\*\*\*ed up that relationship was.

The time we broke up was so hard for me as he broke up with me accusing me that I'm the reason why he had experienced the death of his beloved girlfriend and if I did the right thing and accepted to be his girlfriend before he met her he wouldn't be emotionally suffering like this (INSANE RIGHT!) however, I believed him (??) and I was so devastated thinking I ruined his life and that I'm the main reason he suffers that much.Anyways, we remained friends for a while after the separation and there where it happened.

# The incident:

We went out to do something related to his work, we were all alone and he started talking about how miserable he was and how bad he feels for **not loving me back** etc. , and I felt sad for him so I tried giving him a friendly hug *(it was the best I could as this hug meant I sacrificed A LOT since I'm relegious and I don't do anything physical with the someone of the opposite sex)* before he puts his arms around me and start pinching my waist.

It was weird and wrong  but I felt like my mind couldn't process! My voice wasn't there when I tried to ask him what was he doing. And then he tried to kiss my lips, that's when I tried to push him away and I told him why would you kiss me when you say you don't even love me! But he wouldn't stop. He told me to shut up and tried kissing me again and when I finally could push him away he told me he was sorry.. But I was still under the effect of all what happened and I couldn't say anything.

That  was almost three years ago and all this time I didn't trust myself. All these years I was scared and I blamed myself a lot for doing this and for letting myself do it and violating my own principles and being a sinner.

But today after telling this story to someone (*a stranger who was writing about sexual harassment on a public forum*), I learned that the truth is this wasn't consensual at all so in fact, it was a sexual harassment!And with it becoming from the person I trusted the most back then it was natural to be in such surrender under the effect of the shock.And If I wasn't okay with it but was so shocked to say a firm no it doesn't mean I accepted it or that it was consensual.

91,"When I was little, relatives and neighborhood friends would always call me gay or whatever and I didn’t even know what gay was other than boys liking other boys. The thought of me liking another boy in that way made me uncomfortable and I clearly knew I wasn’t gay. I couldn’t understand why I was being called gay but I figured it was just a common insult so overtime I grew to just kinda “whatever “ that insult. Because I knew I wasn’t. 

Got a little older and i started to dress more , ‘clean’. I didn’t grow up with my father and I always looked up to my grandad. He would dress, like he’s going to an interview, everyday. That’s his swagger. Without even realizing it I picked up on his style and would add my own little “metal/skater” aesthetic to it. People began not only calling me a “faggot” but a “wanna be white boy”. I put gauges/plugs in my ear bc I liked how it looks on me and the ladies do too apparently. But close friends even started calling me gay and making jokes of how I’m gay and yadda yadda. Mutual friends chimed in on it as well. I felt like I had nothing to hide and I’d always laugh it off bc I was not fucking gay. 

Deep down when these jokes were being made or whatever I was wondering why everyone thinks I’m gay. I’ve never done anything to show that I am nor did I want to. One girl I hooked up with off a dating site asked me , “are you gay?” When we first met up. I was like wtf. I told her no and asked why she’d ask me that. She said “because you look/dress nice”. The fuck? Okay, I guess. 

After having several back to back failed relationships and even been called a “faggot” by bitter ex gfs I decided fuck it. Maybe I am a faggot. Maybe I am a “wanna be white boy”. Maybe I am a nigger. Everyone seems to know what the fuck I am without even knowing me. I started cutting myself and I fucking regret it, however, my sleeve (tattoo) will be covering it soon. I feel weak, knowing I let others input get to me. 

Recently I’ve kinda given up pursuing women and found out that I’m actually attracted to trans women. So I guess they were right I am gay. I JUST recently started doing this though. Hooking up with trans women. They’re fucking hot and the head is amazing.

Okay, this time I will write everything about me.

Age 19, Male. Nationality: Indian

Doing Btech IT in a 2nd-grade college(nor best neither worst)

So, To begin with, I am feeling suffocated, I used to give myself hope but now it's not getting worthless.

I am not good at ANYTHING, like legit not a single freaking THING.

oh, wai- *""You should try to find something you're good at...lol...EZ...solved"".*

I've tried countless times, I've introspected myself countless times...but I can't find anything that I good at.

1. When  I was in school...I wanted to be the smartest out of my friend circle, I  sucked at studying...I would give up easily after 15 Minutes of reading...Ultimately...I lost the dream of becoming the smartest one,  fair enough...I didn't work hard and I didn't like to study.
2. I  really loved gaming and had a serious plan of making money out of it  but I had to be good at it, I started playing games (FPS, action,  sports, etc) but no luck here either, I SUCKED. I loved playing games but It was pretty worthless because even after putting many hours into it, I wasn't able to improve and If I wasn't getting better I wouldn't be able to make money off it.
3. I  was like...dang man...What should I do...So, an idea popped up...oh hey  ""YOUTBERER, I WILL BE A YOUTUBER"". I recorded myself multiple times...my videos were in a ""less funny, more cringe"" category and I  didn't have a camera face( I am ugly ;-; tbh...I told I will write everything about me).

4)At this moment I was like *""Of course...If I suck at studying, video games, making videos, art, music, etc...There is still one thing left: PROGRAMMING""*

I  started programming in college...I again wasn't good enough as all my classmates were way better than me in terms of applying logic **(programming requires only one thing that is logic)**  ...but this time I refused to give up and went ahead learned everything but in the end, even thou I learned everything every word, solved many programs...My logic didn't build up.

102,"When you are using the Internet for having communication with people online without revealing your name directly, how well you think your private data is protected? I am talking about the data which represent you, something like legal name, phone number, email address, banking details, social security number, nationality and your date of birth. I'm excluding the data related to biosecurity (iris, fingerprint, DNA) for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are someone lack of self-confidence, especially if you are someone hating who you are because of some past memories that traumatise you (which is what happened to me), I'm pretty sure that you prefer not to reveal who you actually are in front of people. You can try to hide by using a VPN, a nickname instead of legal name, fake details or whatsoever, but hiding your real identity will not be so easy, especially if you are living in a country where most people (or politicians) have no knowledge about big data and are not aware of cybersecurity. I'm not sure whether it's just me surrounded by some stupid people or the same for everyone, but things that I do not appreciate actually happened a lot. One day, when I was in elementary school, a kid who was in my class posted the phone numbers and postal addresses of all students in the same class on a public site for ""easy access"". From that day, I started getting tons of spam calls. One day, I was using social media which required a phone number for registration (but the username did not have to be a legal name). My username was totally unrelated to my legal name and my posts were not related to the activities in my real life. The only way of figuring out was searching my account with my phone number, which actually happened. I never gave my contact details to school bullies, but they somehow got my phone numbers and email address from teachers who were aware of that I was being bullied by those kids and then started bullying me on social media. One day, I went to an internet cafe to play a video game which was viral in that time. One of my friends somehow managed to memorise my username and password by looking at the keys that I was typing on the keyboard when I was logging in and shared my account info with his own friends. End result? Most of my useful game items were stolen and I got banned because some of the people who had access to my account typed some ""forbidden words"" on chat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever I try to hide from others or try to make them not to have access to something, things happen. Of course, you would say it is just me surrounded by terrible people, and that would be 100% right for most cases, but I'll just say that I'm living in somewhere people are not aware of privacy and cybersecurity. Even the government of my home country publish some backdoors as some format of antivirus and force citizens to install them (aaaaaand hackers in China hacks the PCs in my home country using those backdoors). Thankfully, with some know-how that I got throughout some years, I somehow managed to keep my current accounts for the services that I currently use to be secure from those people who try to gain access to my personal data and use it for their own good so far. Thanks, people, you gave me such an awesome paranoia which I will never be able to get rid of.",01Jul2020,1

I eat way less, I lay in bed all day in silence and scroll through social media without even stopping to look at the posts. It's so stupid and annoying and I wish it didn't happen. It gets triggered by the dumbest things, like this time I've been feeling down for the past few days because I thought about my mom and had a realization that she's just not the mom I thought she was. My best friend and I had a long talk about it where I cried so much and at the end she said she loves me and I'm her best friend, which I obviously reciprocate and think about a lot. It hurts me so bad to see her hurt and I never say that but she said it and it's everything I think about her and it meant to much to me. We had made plans to go drive and get food the other day but she just became a pescatarian so the plans got cancelled. I had already been feeling very down and I had been looking forward to the little trip and it just really fucked me up and made me so sad, so I was just giving her shitty replies and she kept trying to say like we can go somewhere else she just wouldn't be able to get anything at the place I wanted to go to. She didn't do anything wrong at all and I don't think I did either, I can't control my feelings and I know I would be quiet and unpleasant to be around so we just didn't hang out and now I feel so bad. All day I just laid and bed and cried because I hate myself and how this happens and I wish I could handle small letdowns like a normal person instead of a little baby but I can't sometimes. I actually tried to cheer myself up by taking a shower and listening to more upbeat music and getting high but I almost passed out after I smoked so I had to be sober all day (I smoke daily) and just feel my sadness. I wanted to see her that night and at least explain I wasn't mad at her and she didn't do anything wrong it's just my feelings don't work right and I can't control them and I'd been feeling shitty before this happened but she didn't respond for long enough than I just went to bed.

110,"Triggers: Drug use, suicide

So, this one's a little weird and long
I really wanted to try shrooms, cause it's covid time, I'm bored, and I've really wanted to try them.
So I take some, nothing happens, I do I bit of research and learn that antipsychotics make it so shrooms don't work.
So I'm met with a choice, don't take the shrooms and go on my merry way, or.... stop taking my medicine for a few days and see what it's like to trip.

A bit of background:
After my third failed suicide attempt, mostly due to voices in my head screaming at me, and my PTSD. I was finally able to talk to a psychologist. I've had these voice since I was 15, and she gave me antipsychotics/bipolar meds and I believe I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, I know it's was something like schizophrenia, but not exactly schizophrenia.

So back to the shrooms, I said, fuck it, I've dealt with them for five years, I can last a couple days. So I stopped taking my meds, everything was completely fine. After I was done with my trip, I returned to my meds without second thought. I did this again a second time awhile later. But, when I was going for my third trip, I realized, ""hey, I haven't heard those voices at all."" So I completely stopped taking those meds, and I've been perfectly fine.

I've talked with a few close family members and basically we are all in agreement that, maybe after years of abuse, depression, and other stuff, caused me to have a psychotic break down or something like  that, that just worsened over the years, and that in my mind, the medicine they gave me would make it stop, so it stopped. (There's scientific studies on stuff like this)

Sorry for this being so long. But anyway, back the main thing.

 I meet with my local psychologist ever three - five months, so I'm not sure when I'll see him next, especially with covid, but I'm scared to bring this up to him, what's a good way to get that ball rolling in an area that I can easily bring this up?",01Jul2020,1

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? When i do eat i are fried eggs and bacon on toast is that bad?

Problem was that she had a long distance boyfriend. I tried to hide my feelings for her because I didn’t want to create problems for them. She eventually was told by a friend about my feelings and I tried to break off our friendship because I didn’t want to get in between her friendship. She was devastated to lose ,at the time, her only friend. So I stayed because I cared about her and didn’t want to see her hurt. 

Eventually we made the poor decision to drink alone in my dorm. She had a panic attack and I held her tight as she dug her nails into my back. She eventually calmed down but I was incredibly concerned because I had not seen one of her panic attacks before. I told her to stay the night in my room because I was concerned about her having another attack alone (she didn’t have a roommate). In hindsight I should have slept in my chair not in the bed with her. But we did get into bed together and long story short she ended up physically cheating on her boyfriend with me (nothing more than kissing me for a few seconds). She immediately freaked out and started panicking about having cheated on her boyfriend. 

We haven’t spoken in 4 years. I still find my involvement in all of it shameful. I hate what I did. I hate what I would have done if she hadn’t stopped us. I cared about her I wanted to be there for her and I failed. I reached out to her recently to apologize for what I did. She made it clear she hates me and wishes to never hear from me again. 

I don’t know how to forgive myself for what happened. I hurt her horribly, I was her friend. How can I forgive myself when the person I hurt won’t?

**What is your ""checklist"" or ""criteria"" for determining if something was racist or not?**   

I'll try to think of some examples here:  

&gt;1. A lot of things are being removed for blackface. In [this episode of Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6kLeUG87s&amp;t=1m22s), a character paints his face black to portray a drow elf.

&gt;1a. Is this scene racist?   
&gt;  
&gt;1b. Is the actor racist?   
&gt;  
&gt;1c. Is the writer racist?   
&gt;  
&gt;1d. Is it racist to leave this up on streaming services?   
&gt;  
&gt;2. I have an art exhibit, and the only thing on display is a piece of paper with the N-word written on it.   
&gt;  
&gt;2a. Is the paper racist?   
&gt;  
&gt;2b. Is the artist racist?  
&gt;  
&gt;2c. Is the paper racist if the artist is a racist?   
&gt;  
&gt;2d. Is the paper racist if the artist claims it as satire.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. In the recent case of George Floyd's killing, is it racist to suggest that this case has nothing to do with systemic racism?      
&gt;  
&gt;4. A top photo in r/OldSchoolCool shows a picture of a black man and a white woman couple from the 90s. A user finds this picture unremarkable and comments, ""this is only popular because they are an interracial couple."" Is this comment racist?  
&gt;  
&gt;5. A white man beats up a black man while repeatedly calling him the N-word. Is this man racist? 

This isn't a school assignment, so don't actually answer unless you really want to. I just want to stimulate the idea of the subject and the initial question.    

Maybe I'm just retarded, because I am so confused by all of this, and to me I don't understand an no one is willing to teach me or give me a strong objective answer. And obviously I'm venting because I feel mistreated and probably a racist piece of shit.

I didn't think I would have offended someone. I removed the post after a few hours and I personally apologized to [u/saadKM2004](https://www.reddit.com/u/saadKM2004/) in his dm's. A few people made a meme on me and talked about me in the comments harshly, I received over 20 people in my chat calling me names and making fun of me to the point where I got called the n-word by someone ( I am not going to tag him for exposure). I got harassed in the comments and on my profile. I tried to explain the situation to the people in my chat but nobody understood, I was going to delete my account and lose all my friends and Karma but [u/IcyInferno732](https://www.reddit.com/u/IcyInferno732/) was the only one who listened to my side and told me not to delete the account. I was only trying to make it a funny situation but many people understood it wrong. In [u/saadKM2004](https://www.reddit.com/u/saadKM2004/) AMA tik tok post, there were other people as well who made fun of tik tok in the comments but I took advantage of that situation to make a meme and join everyone making a meme on the India ban on tik tok situation.

We've been taking quarantine SUPER seriously - masks always when out, genuinely not going out at all unless it's absolutely needed, wiping down every single thing we bring into the house with Lysol wipes, only cooking our own food to avoid risk of contamination from restaurant-prepped food, taking advantage of curbside pickups rather than going into the shops even though they're all opened up again.

We skipped out on a long weekend at a beach house with friends a few weeks ago, because they live in a hotspot and have been confirmed to have exposure to it. That sucked. So the ""at least we're responsible!"" side of things is the only comfort we have lol. This is almost sort of a humblebrag on my part. I do feel good that we've been responsible, and doing our part to try to lower exposure.

But man it's mentally exhausting. Gotta roll with the punches I guess!",01Jul2020,1
