0,"i (f17) live with my family. my mom constantly bring up my sexuality and is convinced that im lesbian (im bi and not out) and recently she went out with some friends (my friends parents) for dinner. she commented on the way that me and another girl are not taking partners to prom, so we must be dating, which we are not, and kept going on about it. my best friends mom was pretty concerned about it, and asked her daughter what was going on, and she told her everything ( i dont mind, as long as my mom doesnt find out ), and she talked to me about it. im pretty pissed at my mom for doing that because she has no right to say those things (i have repeatedly told her that im going to prom alone because i want to, and she still does not believe me). i want to confront her about it becauae im so upset, but im not ready to come out yet, and im afraid it would basically be a confirmation for her of what she already thinks. what should i do?",08Dec2020,1

9,"For reference, I’m [21 M] and she is [21 F]

So I slid into this cute girl’s dms who seemed really interesting, we don’t know each other irl but we’ve followed each other for a long time and I could tell we have similar senses of humour and stuff. For the past couple of weeks we’ve been sending each other memes back and forth, getting to know each other, etc. She lives a few towns over so I’ve been kinda working up to trying to ask her out on a date. It seemed to be going well; the only issue really was that she could take like hours to reply, but I get people can have busy lives and I know she still had work and stuff, so I didn’t mind. Any time she did get back to me she always made effort to respond, asked questions, kept the conversation going, sent me funny shit she’d seen, etc.

Yesterday we were talking and we both realised we liked the exact same movies, and she was freaking out and getting really excited cause she’s never met anyone who she can talk to about them before. She actually apologised for how excited she got over it lmfao, I thought it was cute as hell. At that point she was replying instantly to everything I said, rather than the hours for replies like before, and I felt like I’d kind of got her to come out her shell a little and really got somewhere with her and connected with her. Felt so good.

Then midway through that exact conversation, like right when she was all excited, she just opened my reply and blatantly ignored it. I haven’t heard from her the full day since, and she’s never once opened a message from me and ignored it before this, she always replied eventually whenever she got round to seeing it. I get rationally that anything could have happened; she could have just forgot to reply, could have noticed later but felt too embarrassed to explain she forgot, could have just been straight up busy, literally anything.

But going from those instant replies where we were both excited about talking to each other to complete and utter dead silence just seems really strange. I’m a pretty socially anxious person so I can’t help but have my brain go to stupid places; what if I creeped her out somehow, what if she thinks I’m a loser, what if she was always just replying out of niceness and stopped because she’s not interested and doesn’t want us to get too friendly, etc. Rationally I know that’s likely not true, since we’ve have both been making effort with each other, she’s told me before she thinks I’m really funny, and of course she was so excited about talking about all this; it really just felt like that conversation opened things up majorly.

So, what gives? Why the complete dead silence? It’s just really strange man, and I don’t wanna be annoying and message her again when she’s straight up ignored my last message; at the very least, I want to back off for a couple of days so I don’t seem like a clingy weirdo, but I just really don’t get wtf happened here. My main question is, should I reach out to her again? I don’t want to creep her out, and double messaging after getting ignored has always been a bit of a no-no in my book, but I feel like we were getting along so well and I don’t want to not reach back out and just let that die off.

**TL;DR:** Girl I’ve been messaging for a couple of weeks left me on read just as we had a conversation where we discovered we have a lot in common. She told me she was so excited about it, and then she ignored my message and we haven’t talked a full day later. Don’t know whether to reach out to her again or take the hint and leave her alone.",08Dec2020,1
10,"I’ve been a part of the fandom for years now, so I’m used to hate online, but it’s gotten to the point where it has become unbearable. I own a popular TikTok account where I post furry art, and I have been repeatedly told to kill myself by trolls on the app. Recently, I’ve even faced harassment in real life. This last weekend, I was at the park with some friends roleplaying. I was wearing my German Shepard dog fur suit and roleplaying as a puppy, playing fetch with my friends and chasing the other dogs. Soon, a woman came to our group and began verbally harassing us. I was extremely scared, so I apologized to her. She returned to her bench but continued to watch us from afar. After she saw me lift my leg and urinate in a bush, she called the police. An officer responded to the call and I was issued an ordinance violation. I’m still extremely shaken from the experience and I feel like I was targeted for being a furry. I just don’t understand why furries are treated so much worse than members of other fandoms.",08Dec2020,1
11,"I don't witness it often, but occasionally I'll hear whispers of a shadow organization walking among us. A group so mysterious, your own mother could be a member and you'd never even know it. As you've likely inferred from the title, I speak of the anti- Karens. Those who ask to speak to the manager, only so they can compliment a job well done. Hero's who can halt a true Karen's rampage with a single utterance. My girlfriend works for a craft supply store that seems to serve as a meeting ground for all Karen's in the area. She'll occasionally come to me with epic tales of bitchery stopped dead in it's tracks by nameless heroines who are gone as soon as they appear without so much as asking for a coupon in payment. Only recently the love of my life was staring death in the face as a gigaKaren descended upon her due to a misprint in the stores advertisement. It may very well have been the end for her had not one of these selfless creatures swooped down from the heavens themselves to remind this lady she was being an ass in public for no reason, and that she shouldn't take her frustration out on retail workers. Defeated, gigaKaren lumbered away leaving a lingering scent of stale cigarette smoke and hand lotion while muttering something about ""20% off"" while our hero continued on with her day (after telling the employees that they were doing great of course).

I may have embellished slightly but anti-Karens are very real and they walk among us. Hopefully we can all sleep a bit more soundly knowing this.",08Dec2020,1

15," Hey! How is going?  


Today I discovered that my group of closest friends make plans without me. They tell me they don't have time but they secretly meet each other. Many times I have asked them if something was wrong, they told me no, that they were things that I imagined. It's something I've noticed for a long time, but wasn't able to take action and walk away. 

 If this were a unique case, then nothing would happen, what happens is that this has happened to me for more than 15 years (I am 32). I am a very sociable person, usually the center of attention. But I've noticed for a long time that they only call me to make party plans. With others they watch Netflix, go for a coffee or spend a day making different plans. And most of the time the same pattern happens, I know someone or a group of people and we spend most of the days together, we make all the plans together. Then these people start to move away, with each other they continue to maintain the same relationship. It's like I go from being a very important person to someone they want to avoid. I'm talking about a pattern that will have happened to me more than 10 times in my life. 

 I am between Enneagram 4 and 6. I doubt everything a lot, I am pessimistic and optimistic at the same time, I like to talk a lot about my problems, and I have 0 confidence in myself. I know these are things that can alienate people. Is it normal for me to happen to almost everyone?  There comes a time when I think, I must change all that, but at the same time I think so that if I don't know what is causing them to move away from me. 

Before, this topic caused me many emotional problems. Now I have approached my life in a different way, but it continues to affect me. I just want to understand what is happening. At what point does everything change so that they move away and do not want to know more.

 I've been looking for more posts on this topic on reddit, but haven't found them. If you knew one, could you pass it on to me?

17,"I’m 24. Recently diagnosed bipolar and just starting meds. 

This may sound stupid, but I feel lost and mediocre and identity-less on my meds. I was really dysfunctional and failing at school, work, life in general before I got on meds but now that I’m on them, and a bit more functional, I feel like all the good parts have been taken away. I experienced some major academic success during my hypomanias. My professors were all so enthusiastic about my work and wanted me to publish. I was producing all of this objectively great stuff, making friends for the first time, was kind of the life of the party and I was starting to really believe in myself and see a future for myself as some sort of artist or academic. I was getting so much positive feedback and I formed my whole identity around my hypomanic symptoms. It was a welcome relief after spending the first half of my life being depressed and struggling with very low self esteem (and self hatred), ADHD and social anxiety.

Now I feel like it’s being taken away from me, or like it was all I lie and there was never anything truly creative or “brilliant” about me. And if I wasn’t a nervous wreck and horrible at everything else I wouldn’t care but it felt like the only thing I had going for me.

Since on meds, I haven’t produced anything as good as used to, or had any moments where I felt proud of what I was doing and excited about it like I used to. The worst part is I feel like I was just being delusional the whole time. It’s like I’m finding out that all of my favorite parts of myself and all of the stuff I thought of as some sort of “specialness” were symptoms of my illness. Without hypomania I feel worthless. I’m just like everyone else now, except worse in every way. Before I was still worse but also better, if that makes sense.

I know, objectively, that those states of mind that I loved so much were symptoms of sickness but still, I miss them so much. I also know that they’ve lead to horrible full blown manias before, with psychotic symptoms and everything, and major depressive episodes too. Still, I feel like I was using my bipolar symptoms (principally the hypomanic ones) as way to almost compensate for my constant feelings of inferiority and worthlessness and unlovability. But now that my bipolar is starting to get under control, it feels like my coping mechanism has been taken away and I’m left with no self esteem or identity. I just want my old self back. 

Anyone else been through this or have any insight or advice??",08Dec2020,1

Fighting to stay alive....

who ever is reading this, and you feel the same way.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

I come from a part of Brazil where guns and gangs where in our nature, I'm a born predator ready to fight and kill from the begging. Parents didn't want me so they put me up for adoption, got adopted and ended up in the USA. Learned how to fight and was in the top of my class (aka class president), but at the same time I was the Lone Wolf and the Alpha. I only cared about others not myself so I let people walk over me, but if they walked over my friend. They would regret it....

Went to Collage, still in collage.

I cut now...

But I stopped because I remembered the last thing my friend said:

""don't become like me, I know you're different, a born killer but you don't kill, you defend and I am sorry that I made you feel like you failed to protect me. But, remember don't be the one who cries, you better dry those tears cause you need to fight even when you think you can't."" 

So, for those of you who got this far. And hate me for being me and not taking my life.

I'm sorry for being alive, 

but I'm even more sorry because I don't plan to die any time soon.

34,"I’m curious about the correlation. It’s something that I’ve noticed in myself and others.

I always assume other people are annoyed by me, or that I’m inferior to most people. So as a easily, when people show interest in me, I generally assume it’s fake or out of pity. It’s so illogical, but it’s a pattern I’ve noticed. As a result, I struggle being a good friend. For example, I don’t pursue new friendships or nurture the ones I have because I assume that I’m a bother and not that important to them anyways. I know this is illogical, but I’ve realized I believe it deep down. I focus too much on the flaws of others, seeing them as dealbreakers rather than a part of being human. I see my own flaws as things that are genuinely wrong with me. When people have pointed them out in the past, even when friends point them out with love or concern, I’ve gotten very defensive and hurt rather than owning them. 

I’m tired of holding myself back.  

I know I’m lovable, I know there’s nothing wrong with me. But how do I actually believe it? I have to love myself to love others. But... it feels so counterproductive. I don’t want to focus on myself anymore than I already do. I’m constantly thinking about myself in negative ways which distracts me from connecting with others. I worry that loving myself won’t help me connect with others, but logically I think it will probably help. I’m just scared that loving myself won’t help me love others better.

37,"This is a long one so i apologize in advance. I’m new to this sub so I’m not sure if this is the place for this type of thing but i thought I’d share some of my feelings I’ve been having overwhelmingly lately. I am a 26 year old male, i do grocery delivery and have had many different and good jobs in the past. I have a relationship and have also had quite a few in the past. As of this moment I’m feeling uncertain with everything. I’m feeling like my job isn’t “manly” enough or that it will be a career i can stick with for the long haul. I have many things i can do but i don’t have that one niche, that one thing i love doing above all else. I just don’t feel that about anything. My relationships have always been uncertain because I’m very much monogamous and just want to find one person i can be with and be done with it. I’m also not one to have a big friend group and keep everything tight knit. I am a man that has a lot of feelings and when i talk with other men it’s as if these feelings don’t register with others and i feel as though these feelings are kind of silly but they’re real.  As we get older friends become more distant and we focus more on our responsibilities as i do also every day. In that, i find it’s hard to find people to talk to about these things. My friends are there but obviously not at all times of the day so I’m left alone a lot. None of this is inherently bad or out of the norm and I’m working through these feelings of uncertainty but i just always have this overwhelming sense that I’m alone. For me everyone seems so open and I’m not really. I like exclusivity. I’ve also grown tired of sex or sexually oriented things. I watch porn occasionally like most people but it seems that most conversations now lead to sexually innuendos or some sort of jokes and most people are free birds and can separate sex from emotion. I’ve tried but i just can’t do it and I’m losing hope that I’ll find anybody as exclusive as me. It’s not wrong to be open in anyway and i applaud anyone for doing what they want to do in life. I’m just not sure where i fit. I can’t seem to relate to most people anymore and am struggling to see the outcome of all of this. Everyone tells me they’re here for me and i, in return, tell them I’m here for them. But i find myself needing them and them never coming to me for anything. Granted they always try to help me with whatever I’m going through and i appreciate that a lot. I just feel like i need them all the time and nobody is needing me. The world is full of people so why do i feel so alone most of the time?

45,"Last year I hooked up at the holiday party with a coworker from a different office.  It wasn't anything spectacular but I guess I've held a sweet spot for him since. We simply clicked  over our dark sense of humor and similar backgrounds. I did not know how he looked before meeting a few days before the party when he and a few others came for some new training.

We never spoke about hooking up since he went back to his office. That is until last week.  He needed to vent and used my personal number so it wouldn't be tracked by the company. Since then we have been texting nearly all day, even off days. Today he sent me a selfie. Okay I knew, he was no George Clooney, but damn he much more on the Steve Buscemi end of the spectrum.


Nothing against my coworker or Steve, both great guys, but damn if I didn't wonder ""wtf was I thinking"" and ""how drunk was I to risk an HR write up over him.""  I still like him but I do feel a bit deflated.",08Dec2020,1
46,"I'm 21 years old and grew up with Catholic parents who weren't exactly homophobic but never went out of their way to teach me and my sisters about LGBTQ+ stuff. I assumed my sisters and I would all give my parents a traditional life where we grow up and have husbands and give them grandkids. I spent most of my tween and teenhood confused and just feeling wrong. In hindsight, I don't think I was confused. I think I knew I was gay but allowed myself to consider possibilities that weren't really possibilities and that felt like confusion because nothing felt right. I went through a long phase where I thought if I acted straight I would become straight and I dated a boy when I was sixteen. I hated kissing him and holding his hand and would cancel dates just from anticipation of having to kiss him. I dumped him after three months out of guilt.

It was a few months after that when my sister told me she was a lesbian. I had to be supportive of her, but I was secretly very disappointed. I think I could have come to accept myself much sooner if it weren't for her, because my first thought when she came out to me was that now I couldn't be gay and I would do everything I could to make those feelings go away. The reason for this is that I am the youngest of three girls in my family and being the youngest means everyone expects you to be just like your sisters. I really resented my family members who assumed I wanted to go to the same colleges as my sisters and choose the same major. It felt like they saw me less as an individual and more like a sequel. Or like a little girl who idolizes her big sisters and wants to be just like them because she hasn't formed an identity of her own.

So I spent the next three years subconsciously punishing myself for noticing pretty girls and congratulating myself for noticing hot guys. It was exhausting. One day, out of nowhere, I snapped out of it and realized that my gayness would never go away and it makes no sense to hate myself for it when I don't hate anyone else for being gay. The first person I told was my best friend about a year and a half ago and now just about everyone in my life apart from my family knows. I don't expect my family to treat me badly because of it, but aside from the fact that it's inherently awkward to tell your family about your sexual preference, I'm afraid of them comparing me to my gay sister and thinking I'm just another. Or that they will be disappointed that only one of their daughters will live the traditional life they expected for all of us.

I have never dated a girl before because in the time I have been at peace with my sexuality, I have struggled with crippling social anxiety and couldn't even make friends, let alone start a relationship. I'm at a point in my life where I'm really happy and I just feel ready, so I signed up for Bumble and I hit it off with a girl. We haven't met in person yet, but things are going really well and I'm so excited! I'm really close with my family and would love to share this with them, but I first have to get through coming out to them and I'm not sure if I'm ready for that yet. But I also don't know when I will be ready. This was a bit of a ramble, but I'm going through a whirlwind right now and I had to tell someone.",08Dec2020,1

He came home and asked if I could cook tomorrow, I said I can’t do anything with no clean pots or pans. A few hours later, I’m getting ready for bed, but now I’m fed up and just unload the damn dishwasher myself. 

I go to wish my husband goodnight and say “I’m going to bed. If you want me to cook tomorrow, load the dishwasher.”

“It’s not unload?”

“No, I just did that myself. I’ve been asking you every day for four days and I’m getting frustrated, so you’re going to load it.”

He gives me a half assed apology while still staring at his phone. I don’t respond and he says “I said I’m sorry, what more do you want?”

“Changed behavior”

“Oh, so my apologies aren’t good enough?”

“Only when you mean it and fix it. I know keeping the house up is hard for you, and it is for me too, but we gotta get the shit done.”

55,"I despise my birthday, I wish people would just forget it.  My mother made me feel bad every single day of my life for being born. It was my fault that I came into the world and she reminded me many times that she wished she had an abortion.  

I even went as far as to turn off birthday reminders on Facebook so people would leave me alone.  My stupid husband reminded everyone it was my birthday this year, when he realized I had the reminders off.  I hate the meaningless “happy birthdays” from people that you never talk to that wouldn’t know it’s your birthday unless they saw it on Facebook. Every time I see a “happy birthday” I reminded just how horrible my existence was to my mother.  

But then on the opposite side, I have my cousin that calls me every year to thank me for being born.  Then I feel bad for hating my birthday. 

My mother went into labor with me early, at home, and during a flood back in 87. Rescue couldn’t get to her and they couldn’t get out.  My cousin, who was 5 at the time, and her mother helped deliver me.   My cousin was so moved by my delivery that it shaped her life goals and she was determined to become a nurse for labor and delivery.  She went to college right after high school and became a nurse, got hired at a local hospital and has been there ever since.  I just turned 33 and she has helped deliver so many babies.   She is an amazing woman that has helped so many other woman.  She calls me every year and thanks me for being born and helping her find her calling.  

So I don’t know, I can’t say, please forget my birthday to people, as that seems rude.  My birthday is just a reminder that I wasn’t wanted and off all the horrible things that happened during my childhood.  I’m not sure what the point of posting this is, other than I have no other place to post it and wanted to tell someone.

58,"Yesterday, I was looking through my mom's notes to help her find a password for something and I accidentally saw a note she wrote to herself about coping with divorce.  Obviously this frightened me and for a minute I didn't believe it and tried to convince myself that maybe she copied and pasted one of her friends text on accident.   My breathing started getting really shallow and my mom asked me what was wrong and I asked if her and dad were getting a divorce.  And sure enough I was right.  

My whole entire world came crashing down in that moment, my seemingly happy, perfect parents weren't the people I had thought after all.  I started breaking down crying saying ""why would you do this"" and ""at least wait until I'm in college"", but to no avail.  She brought my dad in the room to where us three had a long discussion about the details and reasons of the divorce. Thankfully this is not a fighting behind the scenes abusive relationship, instead they just no longer had a connection on an intimate level anymore.  My dad even told me their marriage started to feel more like a friendship than a partnership.  

After about an hour they left me alone and I bawled for hours.  I couldn't believe this was happening, I always thought I had parents who would never even consider getting a divorce.  I started feeling angry, wondering why my other friend's parents, who so obviously hated each other, were still together, but here I was having my family ripped apart when my parents didn't even hate each other to begin with.

I like my  stories, but when I reread them, I always have some doubt about how good  it is. I suppose it's due to thinking about it for so long and having a  hard time assessing your own work. I sent a manuscript to editors and  still wait for answer even if I don't hold out too much hope about it,  places are scarce.

71,"""The nail that sticks out gets hammered down."" My sixth grade teacher told me in front of the class, as they mocked me. From childhood to adolescence to employee i was told to fit in, to shave off the defined edges of myself to fit into a square hole, like a good square peg. And when I refused, I was accosted by authority and by my peers - by the nails that don't stick out. By The Hammered Down.

&amp;#x200B;

But I held fast. I kept my identity and I resisted the hammer, at great cost. I am bent, but unbroken. I am not hammered down. Yes I may get caught on things that other people slip through with no trouble, but my spirit survived un-defiled and defiant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am in a position where ""how they do it"" or ""how it's supposed to be"" and ""the way it is"" are abhorrent to me. For me, after years of hammering, doing things the normal or expected way is to surrender to the hammer. I will take any road but the main one, because I spent so long fighting off the people and institutions who tried to railroad me onto it. And look at those poor, unremarkable bastards now. Not sticking out, uniform, forgettable, replaceable, expendable. Proud of their obedience. In their eyes, I have failed. In my eyes, they have failed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would rather fail spectacularly my way than succeed their way.

&amp;#x200B;

Their reaction is to call me pretentious and arrogant, accuse me of thinking I'm better than them. And I'll admit, being chastised by the beige, the bullies, the basic, the Borg my whole life certainly dug a pit of contempt that I can fall into when taken off-guard.  That's not it though, it's not about being better or worse than them, it's about authenticity. I gladly paid the price and held onto my individuality, and they chose to throw theirs away in the name of unity, like ants, like soldiers, like bricks in a wall. I cannot shake the suspicion that they did it simply because it was easier than standing by what they believe in. I'm not better than them, I just didn't fold under the pressure like they did. 

I expected to be congratulated in the end, once the hammers had mostly passed. Congratulated for all the sacrifices I made to survive the gauntlet of obligation and conformity. Sometimes I am congratulated for it, and I respond with warm humility despite the fact that those congratulations are the payoff I was banking on when I made the decision to resist. Those congratulations are the only external validation, the only external reassurance I have that I was right to resist the traditions, the religions, the social constructs, the rules both written and unwritten, the bureaucracy, the omnipresent fucking groupthink. Yes I expected to be congratulated, but most of The Hammered Down follow the same ethos that hammered them down in the first place: ""Deviation from the norm will be punished unless it is exploitable.""

&amp;#x200B;

Which leaves me where I am now: having fended off the imposition of their definitions of success, I have struggled to find my own definition. It's hard since the only people who support you are either Hammered Down or sticking out in their own unique way that I can't relate to (beyond the general sticking-outedness and the recognition and respect for their own defiance. Us Sticking-Out can always recognize each other and I treasure them like nothing else). There's nobody out there I can ask who understands what I'm trying to do, because I'm the only one who's bent like me. It's gotta be me. I've banished the external judges, but I keep lazily returning to basic, default, objective markers of success like cashflow and jobs done and push-ups per workout and calories per day. Things easily plotted on a spreadsheet - how beige. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finding one's own definition of success is, in and of itself, work. Hard, invisible, immeasurable work with no progress milestones to encourage or guide you. You don't have it, and then one day you do. If you wander long and hard enough and luck smiles upon you, you'll stumble over it in the dark. Finding your own definition of success is something that has to be felt, not calculated. Calculating is what The Hammered Down do, with their safe, machine minds and their safe, machine hearts.

&amp;#x200B;

I made a breakthrough with my art. When I finished my fourth painting, i felt it. I found it, and I knew I had found it. I had succeeded, on my own terms. I literally wept with joy that night. I finally scored a goal in the game that only I am playing and only I can see. The success that nobody else could sense or measure or appreciate.  There had been echos of this feeling before - performing a song in public, nailing a speech, other expressions of my spirit in public. But this, this is the best it's ever been.  


That's why I know I'll be an artist for a very long time, why the searching period of my life is finally, mercifully over. I found what I have been so clawingly desperate to find for so long. I'll just have to feel it a few more times before I can properly articulate what it is. The best I can do now is this: To create something to my own standards of quality that draws attention, inspires intrigue, and occasionally jostles a soul.   


So what does this mean for you, dear reader? It means that if you want to do work that is meaningful to you, you need to find the answer to this question: If you had never received external feedback on anything you'd ever done, not even once, what would you be doing with your time, and how would you know that you'd done a good job?",08Dec2020,1

78,"My best friend set me (f26) up with this guy (m27) starting a couple of years back. He’s her now ex’s brother who she insisted was my perfect match and he began to initiate contact with me. He lives in another state so it was just via Snapchat initially and he seemed genuinely interested in getting to know me, spoke highly of my friend, and wanted to know what was going on in my life. I was preoccupied with someone else at the time so it was just general conversation but interesting and it was nice talking to him. 

A couple of months ago he reached out again after a few months of no communication and this time we started talking more in depth- texting, calling, and video chat daily. He was open with me regarding his past criminal history which left him with a felony and years in prison but expressed his desire to move away from his hometown and leave the baggage behind. I did a background check and he had not been dishonest about anything mentioned so I felt he was being transparent. He had also been seriously injured and almost cut his hand off a few months prior so he was laid off and not in a good place financially. In fact, he had no money but I wanted to believe it was just a temporary obstacle and didn’t want to overthink it as we’ve all had financial struggles at some point. 

We wanted to meet in person and decided that he would fly to see me and I would pick him up at the airport. Finally the day came that we met and from then we were inseparable for a full month-he stayed at my house, he worked with me (I have my own business), and we went one adventures together and just spent tons of really personal time together really getting to know one another. I had absolutely no reason to believe he was not falling in love with me and I wanted him to feel that I was on his side. I was in a toxic relationship for 5 years which I escaped from last year so I’m still unlearning negative traits passed on from that experience and consciously decided to give him a solid chance and not to assume that everyone is like my ex. 

He had some personal items that were stored at my friends house near where I live one of which was a hunting rifle that belonged to his dad who had recently passed away and it was a very sentimental item for him. I arranged for us to pick up the items and seeing him with his dad’s gun made me really happy for him because I knew it meant a lot to have it back in his possession. He is not permitted to have a firearm with his criminal record and flying home with it wasn’t an option so we decided he would take a rental car home when the time came.

In our conversations he discussed with me his affiliation with an organization back home which occasionally put him in dangerous situations. He told me stories from the streets and behind bars that most people couldn’t comprehend or recover from witnessing. I wanted to be there for him and be a safe place for him to talk about things that he had experienced and allowed him to speak freely and without judgment. 

Thanksgiving day we went to my moms house and he cooked the turkey in a smoker and hung out all day, helping out and talking to my mom and step dad. He told my mom I was a very special person and meeting me had been a wonderful and inspiring experience and he admired and respected me deeply. My mom later told me she had no reservations about him and he was welcome. Random people at the store told us we complimented each other well. A friend of my parents said we were one of the nicest couples they’d ever met. A match made in heaven.

Then, the time came for him to leave. He would go home, clean and fix up his house to rent so that he could move to MI and start a new chapter. It was difficult for both of us to say goodbye but we knew it wasn’t for long. I had paid for a rental car for one week to get him home and off he went. That was Monday and for the next few days I barely heard from him. I assumed he was probably busy taking care of things but asked him to please let me know at least that he was ok and the car was fine. He apologized for the lack of communication and claimed he had been cleaning the garage, fixing the bathroom, and taking care of some business. He said he loved me and was making progress. I didn’t want to think too much of it.

Sunday came and I called at 11 to ask if he was on track to have the car back at noon and he apologized profusely and said he thought it was supposed to back the next day and he was still using it to transport some items to auction that afternoon. I was slightly put off but had no reason not to believe what he was saying was true and I paid to extend the rental one day until the following afternoon. He assured me he would get the things done and have the car returned the next day.

That night we texted briefly and a response came through “you know he’s had a girlfriend the WHOLE TIME you’ve been talking right?” from his phone. Then a moment later the phone rang a a girl named Haley informs me that she was his girlfriend and had been living with him since July and he had given her his phone to use, she saw a text from me, and wanted to clear things up. According to her he said he had paid for the rental car and had also asked her to move state with him in the spring although I’m not sure how that would have worked if he was living with me. I was aware of her as he had told me about his ex (23f) who had relocated to his town the previous year to be with a boyfriend in the navy but that didn’t work out so she was stuck down there and had gotten involved with some rough people and apparently had no one to go to. He had explained that though they were no longer together he was trying to help her get into somewhere secure or back home where she was from. According to him she had not been living with him since August. So, I knew who she was. Nonetheless, she was using his phone at his house and he had been ok with leaving his phone with her while he ran to the store or wherever he went in the car I paid for. I told her to please let him know I would like to speak with him when he returned. 

He called an hour later and left a voicemail saying “I don’t know what she said to you but I’m honestly not really worried about it, I’m sorry that happened. I was trying to be nice and let her use my phone to call a ride to get out of here and she said whatever she said to you and again I apologize please call me so we can talk about this, I love you.” I called him back and said “this is how it’s going to go, you return the car by 5pm tomorrow or I’m reporting it stolen.” He was astonished I would invest myself in what this girl had said to me but I’m not playing any games especially after 5 years of it. We hung up after a brief exchange of me thinking he’s dishonest and him upset I believed his ex girlfriend. 

This was 2 days ago and I did receive a confirmation the car was returned at 4:30 on Monday. There has been little contact between us aside from him telling me she did not live there, wasn’t living there, and had not been living there and that she was upset because she wanted them to still be together. I feel I have nothing else to say but I am blown the fuck away.",08Dec2020,1

Say for example I want to delete an account from a forum because they got hacked and since I want to reduce my further spread of my private information, but amazingly they'd simply flat out refuse such requests on the grounds of ""preserving their SEO"" and honoring my request would ""hurt SEO"" instead, even though at least in Europe there is the GDPR which would incur huge fines or whatever for those who failed to properly purge private data if requested.

100,"When my (26f) mom got pregnant with me my dad was off seeing someone else and didn’t give a shit what happened and my mom was an exceptionally impressionable and naive young lady at 22. She had me and her family was broke and my dads mom was a control freak so she took us in to live with her and my paternal grandfather three hours north of where I was born. My dad was in and out of my life but my grandma controlled everything so I never really knew why I couldn’t see him but I knew he had tendencies to be violent and he and my stepmother fought constantly. From there ensued 15 years of emotionally twisted and psychologically damaging experience which ended with my grandmother dying in agony over the course of 3 days at home. 

Less than a year later my grandpa freaked out on me one day while I was home sick from school (I was 16) and told me to get my ass outside and rake the leaves or he was going to let my chickens loose for the dogs to take care of. My mom was still living there at the time and timidly recommended I better get out there before grandpa gets home from his walk but I wasn’t waiting around and snuck out the back part of the property and down the road, escaping before he saw me. I called my friend’s grandparents who lived a few miles away and they picked me up and we called the police. I went to stay with them temporarily until the police came and picked me up and dragged me to my aunts house since I wasn’t old enough to live wherever I wanted and I wasn’t emancipated. At the time my dad was staying with her and we hung out quite a bit and I was finally getting to know my dad a little bit as an adolescent woman. My aunt hates me for reasons which I have no control over such as being alive and on my 17th birthday I was moved into my friends grandparent’s house. 

The grandparents were the stony type but still made dinner for me for my birthday and the phone rang just as we were sitting down at the table. The grandpa answered and clearly something shocking was coming from the other end as everyone looked at each other and he said “it’s your mom she would like to talk to you.” I took the phone and my mom manages to speak and tell me my dad was dead. My stepmother was screaming in the background. He had overdosed two days earlier and they had just found out, apparently he laid there dead for two days at his friends house.

This fucked me up on a psychological level as the last conversation I’d ever had with my dad was one over Facebook in which he had disowned me and hated me because he accused me of siding with my stepmom on some issue they were having. I had also always needed a relationship with my dad and this was a final end to something I would never understand. I took a whole bottle of Tylenol and planned to die but I became violently ill and my friend’s grandmother took me to the hospital assuming what had happened. My stomach was pumped, I was transported to a different hospital where I stayed for a week before spending another week at a psych ward. I refused to stay there any longer so recovered myself outwardly and was discharged with a prescription for antidepressants and sleep aids. 

I started staying with my friends dad after that (instead of the grandparents) because they didn’t want that negativity in their house (me nearly offing myself). Shortly after, as i lay nearly comatose in bed from the pills the ward prescribed me, my friends dad comes in wasted from the bar, comes in my room and puts his hand down the front of my shorts. Miraculously I was able to escape and went to his roommates room and told him what happened. He stayed up all night to make sure nothing happened but that was that. I then went to live with my friend’s mom. 

Fast forward, I spend 6 years doing end of life care for elderly people independently (through referrals, haha) and then started my own business doing property management and commercial/residential cleaning. I have nothing to do with any of my family with the exception of my mom and one cousin and take care of myself, live independently, no drug habits, great financial standing, developing myself emotionally, etc. 

I started a relationship when I was 20 with a guy I met at a ski resort and years passed of psychological and emotional torment that I continued to maintain myself in because I thought that was love. I didn’t know what the fuck love was, I had never seen anything other than sickness between two individuals who called it love so I stayed and felt it for 5 years. Several times we fought and he would grab chunks of my hair and rip it out, grab my hair and shake my head around by it, then tell me how ugly I was and that I looked like a cancer patient because my hair was so thin. I was always self conscious of my hair because it’s always been thin/fine and he knew how to kill me inside. This is just one example but that’s the nature of it. I finally broke free and severed the ties I had and I felt within myself that I had broken the cycle that I was in with the relationship and I was finally free and everything was going to be ok. I set my focus on growing my business, saving money, and bettering myself as an individual. I want to experience life instead of run away from it. 

A few months ago, I started talking heavily with a guy my friend had been trying to set me up with for a couple of years. We really connected on a core level and in some ways resembled each other’s character. It was really cool and we both acknowledged how well we hit it off and the potential for a future together based on our open communication and method of perceiving the world and life in general. I understood that he was not in a good place financially and that he had a record which I had been aware of before- I chose to overlook these qualities because I desired and valued the connection we had otherwise. 

He came to stay with me and for a full month we spent as much time together as possible, he worked with me, we went places together, etc. I opened up to him and he opened up to me about deep and vulnerable experiences we had that shaped us into who we were. He gave me his undivided attention and I wanted to believe that he truly did love me for who I was. I let him in because I wanted to believe that I was accepted and that he wanted to learn about me and where I had been. He told me he could see himself marrying me, that I deserved to be loved, kissed scars on my body, prayed over me, looked into my eyes and kissed my forehead, told me I had changed his life, said he had always thought about me and being together in real life was better than he could have imagined. He met my mother, kissed her forehead and told her that I was a beautiful and inspiring young woman and that he admired me greatly. Put his arms around me in my mother’s kitchen on thanksgiving day while he cooked the turkey, and told everyone he would be back after Christmas. I thought he could love me, I thought I loved him.

I paid for a rental car for him to get home and although it was difficult to say goodbye, we understood that it was only temporary and that he would be back soon. I felt assured that he was genuine in his feelings and intentions and put my energy into working and saving money. 

I didn’t hear from him too much after he left but I assumed he was busy, getting settled, etc. Then a few nights ago a girl called me from his phone and said she was his girlfriend and that she had been living with him since July. He had told me about her but said that she was his ex as of august. He called me later to explain that it was all a misunderstanding and I told him to return the car or I was reporting it stolen. He returned it and that was that for that. 

So, anyways, if you read all of this, just me observing this life so far and wondering really what that point of it all really is. I have been through some things too, whoever is reading this, and sometimes I feel indestructible. Other days, I look myself in the mirror and say how could you be so fucking naive after all the shit you’ve experienced you should know more than the jack shit you’re working with. But, balance.

Yesterday he climbed onto the axle of my car and I had to leave the shutter a little open to let him escape after the car had cooled down.

He sat in a corner shivering, I thought he'd die of the cold so I went out and made a box with some insulation to keep him warm. Now he wouldn't climb into it, I don't blame him. So I tried to gently pick him up with one hand (I didn't want him to bite or scratch me, so I wore gloves) while I held the box in other. He resisted a little and I put him in the box. He wanted to leave, and tried to jump out. I pressed him down ever so carefull but he was a little strong for his size and then it happened. I clutched hum under the rib cage feeling his warm innards and a beating heart, his heart rate rose as he clawed the wall of the box trying to leave. His belly that I was holding felt getting warmer as the heart rate increased and I just wanted to crush him, squeeze his warm innards out and I subconsciously strengthend my grip. I wanted to see what sound he'd make as I crushed him, I was thinking of the look on his face as he died and it motivated me somehow. But then I just threw him away, kind of agitated. I wanted to help him but he was not being all too welcoming, now I know I can't think like that about an animal but this was what I thought as I flung him across. He wasn't hurt, I felt that I might have hurt him but this didn't really bother me as if the concern was really just fake and not from the heart.  The cat was fine but scared, he quickly darted off.

110,"Long post here, trigger warning: suicide

So, long story short I attempted suicide my senior year of high school, back in 2016. 

Every single one of my best friends (friends between 5-10+ years of friendship) had screwed me over in multiple ways. 

Most of which started using drugs and went on this massive drug induced power trip. They belittled me that entire year, stole money from me, and from my home and parents, as my home isn’t generally locked (we live in ruuuuuural area), and these friends knew this. I later found out they had basically ransacked my parents home weekly looking for things to pawn, loose money and change, etc. 

During that time I had two close friends, as my main best friend was part of the drug using group now and just went absolutely power trip nuts. Meth made him think he was god and everyone deserved to feel his wrath. Anyway, another close friend, we will call him Matthew, left for basic training. I was then left with my other close friend, we will call her Rachel. Rachel had started becoming closer to the old friends who joined the drug crowd, one in particular, that often used me for money or my car. 

I began to express my dislike for Rachel becoming so close to this girl, as I felt the other friend was extremely toxic and basically a leach of a human being and I didn’t want it anymore. 

This turned to a text message barrage from both of them. Saying all I do is whine that people use me or are out to get me, that no one likes me, and how suicidal that I am. And that if I am that suicidal I’d probably just do it instead of talking. 

So I took that note. All of my friends betrayed me. They left me when I needed them most. So I decided to give them what they wanted and downed a bottle of pills. 

I had been texting a separate friend at the time, probably the only real one out of the bunch, and eventually confessed what I did. She was at my house before she could even text to respond. 

She told my mom to take me to the hospital and there I was placed on a 72 hour hold and transferred to a small psychiatric facility. 

I played the part, held that fake smile, answered every question each nurse had with a chipper “I’m just so happy to be alive and to be here thank you!” 

I finally got out, the day of my high school graduation. Sedated to shit, because personally from my experience, I think that’s a lot of the aim for psychiatric drugs. Don’t fix the problem, just sedate them. Anyway, that’s another discussion for another time. 

I didn’t enjoy my graduation because I was so emotionless from the benzo cocktail I’d be prescribed. 

So I graduate, I’ve found a new friend. Thought she’d be better, decided we’d jump cities for college and be roommates. Low and behold she began stealing from the company we worked for and myself. Slipping on rent, and constantly mentally and emotionally abusing me because she couldn’t get her own life together. Yet again, another friend in the book to screw me. And then, my sister told me to get bent. The last straw in the fragile haystack that was my life of poor recovery after a traumatic event. If my sister could betray me, anyone could. 

And so, for four years I created coping mechanisms. One in which I told myself it’s easier to not get close, than to feel like you did those years ago. 

I don’t trust anyone. I wake up from dreams thinking I’m being robbed, constantly. I can’t loan, even a small amount of money out, without feeling like I’m being strangled by my anxiety because I feel these people are just going to take my generosity and run. 

I’ve lived in this new city and have made no new friends unless it’s through other people. My current relationship struggles because I can’t trust him. Not even because of anything he’s done, I’m just so used to people being awful it’s like I’m waiting for it. 

I attempted suicide and received absolutely no recovery treatment. No therapy. No medication. Just moved to a new city and thought the change in landscape would make me forget all of the awful people in my past life. Nope, I just internalized those emotions. Created a wall around myself and live in fear almost daily. 

I often hide my possessions or money in different places in the house, just to maybe ease the idea that if anyone I did trust decided to turn on me, they wouldn’t know right where to start. 

It’s paranoia and it’s psychotic. I don’t want to live like this but can’t afford therapy. For many of those years I thought I was fine. Until I got into a serious relationship and realized just how deeply I have been damaged, and that these weird “quirks” of hiding things, aren’t quirks. They’re my ptsd manifesting. 

Anyway, I don’t know what I wanted from this, other than to maybe be heard.",08Dec2020,1

113,"I was just sittin back Thinkin of my very first gf, and how after we broke up she stated all the nasty shit she truly thought about me. “Your life is pile of shit you can’t even get hands on” yadda yadda. She said some hurtful words that only inspired me to do more for myself. It made me not want to be like her; feeling like you NEED to have someone, anyone, in their life. Former friend of mine stated all the shit he truly felt about me after we fell out. All of my close friends seem to see me as a broke gay anorexic nigger from what I can gather. I can see the broke thing, I don’t own a car yet and I am seen walking a lot. and I guess I come off as gay bc I don’t look very masculine, and I’m just skinny asf. I guess I’m a nigger bc I am black. Ya know I am careful about having white friends now. I feel like y’all are backstabbing plotting cowards. Idk I can’t speak for all..my most recent gf who was white Called me all kinds of N bombs. For a brief while I was racist as hell, quietly. But I can’t lump all whites in one bag. 

Thinking of everything these ppl truly think of me, makes me want to go even harder. I want to achieve greater things that I want in life, fuck what everyone else is doing.

117,"I am the man without Narcissisms, therefore I cannot lie and I can do no wrong. I have an Irrefutable message from God: The second coming is here.
People of Earth’s Final Judgement

If humanity could agree on nothing, it wouldve unified the entire planet. 

Ask 2 people to agree on nothing and they will argue there is nothing to agree on! The flaw of single polarity thinking in a dual polarity existence.

By agreeing on nothing you agree commonly and thus have no conflict

When in fact they agreed on nothing. Nothing is the medium, and therefore something the brain can use to identify or classify as “something”. But to do this the brain needs to know nothing is something and that requires dual polarity.

Explaining “Nothing” is a lot like explaining “Infinity”

Infinity is defined as the opportunity to continue something in perfect condition in cycles. 
This is usually where people understanding of infinity stops.
The actual definition of infinity is: The opportunity to continue something in perfect cycles so long as the 
environment allows it. 

A good example: Listening to a song on repeat.
Each repeat of the song is 1 infinity loop. To continue the infinity cycle, you must supply energy to the device playing the song. Thus this defines “finiteness” if the device keeps working the song will play infinitely. Thus infinity, like, nothing, is 2 states at once, you have infinity, and then you have a point of finiteness.

For nothing, there can be something, and for nothing to even be a word it has to be a thing, thus nothingness. Due to this the dissolution by nuclear weaponry is imminent and unavoidable.

If we cannot agree on anything we will disagree on everything",08Dec2020,1

123,"Fresh account. Too many eyes. Keeping it vague. This post is me seeking comfort amongst all my current chaos.

I was on a month long holiday to see family and friends. My partner discouraged me to go as they have some major trust issues from previous relationships. They neglected getting treated despite my attempts to help.

Not even 2 weeks into my holiday, my partner calls me, distressed and upset I had not messaged them that day. I was hungover as fuck from the night before and they did leave me on read so I just kind of left it and enjoyed my night. Partner quickly went from a 3 to a high 10 and forced me to make a decision there and then to break up. The decision was to stay in my current home state and break up or go home immediately and stay together.
At that point I had not even seen my mother yet and it had been 3 years since I last saw her. My mother paid for my trip there.

Obviously a lot of panic talking and emotions are going at that point and I felt like I could not just leave without seeing my mother. So I chose to stay and end our 4 year relationship.

Our relationship had been going downhill for about a year before then, so I think it may have made it a little easier for me to accept it. That night my buddies and I drove a few hours out of town to go drinking on the beach for 3 days. No service. Twas' wild.

I did slip up on my 3 day bender. Met a bird and messed around. I want to blame the drugs and alchohol, but dude. I knew what I was doing.

We finally leave and I get reception... with around 40+ missed calls and many texts. The partner calls me in the car on the way home and I'm so fucking tired and my mind feels fuzzy. I can only focus on one thing at a time. Like constant radio static. Partner expresses they are a changed person. Saying they'll change. They never knew what they had until it was gone. Yada yada.
That pissed me off.

OP: ""Wtf are you saying. You broke up with me. At one of the worse times possible""

They start saying they'll move to the state I'm in. (The state I was in is home to me. Everyone I love is here and I planned on living here permanently one day. Partner refused to share the same fate... until now.)
Tell me what I've wanted to hear for so long...
Still though, I considered the past year and the fact I already slipped up (I cant bring myself to tell them) and being back home just felt so fucking good.
I said no. I didnt want to get back together.

Then the abuse started. ""How can you flip on a dime so easily? How can you love me one day and not the next. Tell me is there someone your seeing? Are you doing stuff behind my back?""

Hearing all that hurt because even though we were technically broken up. It still felt like I had cheated.

Phone call ended badly. Partner furious and I, so tired, sluggish and depressed.

To make matters worse, the bird I met wont leave me alone and my heavy heart is longing for affection. I'm allowing them to see me and I fear this is a rebound or whatever. 

I don't want to go back to my partner now. It's too late for that. All my belongings are with them and they've threatend to keep my $1500 computer. Which we went halves in (that pc is everything to me lol). A birthday gift for me. 
I feel as though that's unfair as they get to keep the washing machine and bed that I paid for. $2000+ between those two items. I cant possibly post those items over.

To make things worse, iv had to move into my parents (Mum and step father. I moved out at a young age for a reason) and an old ex of mine found out about the break up and has been sending me cruel messages. Iv already got 2 jobs here but all I have is a phone and my suitcase. When I'm not buried in my work, I'm buried in depression and guilt with no distractions.

My own father wont talk to me either. He wanted to see me and my partner get married. He loved expressing that. When we broke up, my partner went to him and said some wack stuff. I dont know the full story yet.

Even if I went back to my partner. I'd feel guilty.
Depression is eating at me like cancer.
When I'm alone I stop and stare at things that I could harm myself with. Pills, knives, scissors, passing traffic. I break into sweats for no reason. I cant bring myself to do any of it though. This is all so new to me and I'm freaking out.",08Dec2020,1

125,"I'm only 22, but I'm tired. I'm tired of doing this college shit for the sake of my parents. I remember when I first went to university at 18 I had aspirations of going into film, but I later changed it to nursing due to pressures from my parents. Dropped that shit because I didn't really care about it, I just cared about the money, and what my parents wanted. I then changed it to business due to my parents again, and whenever I told them they'd get irritated that I kept changing it (should've just kept it to myself). I realized that I was depressed, or better yet, I decided to seek help for the depression that I've been dealing with for years now and that resulted in me getting hospitalized. Ever since that happened I just feel like my life has been going downhill. Now, I'm 22, no degree, and still in school. The thing is now I have no aspirations and just feel burned out. I feel like I've lost all my drive and any motivation to study. I'm not even sure what I want to major in anymore, as everything I truly want to do doesn't require me having a degree. I'm at the point where I don't really care what I get a degree in anymore as long as I have one because unfortunately I live in a society in which it matters. Most resumes won't even get looked at if you don't have a degree in **something**. 

Changed my major to psychology (from business) despite all the advice telling me not to because I think I'd have an easier time, and I'd be able to graduate despite my depression. At least I'd be able to see why I'm an anxious, depressed, moody fucking mess. I just want to lay down and go the fuck to sleep. I'm 20k in debt due to stupid decisions I made when I was 18, that I would stomp my past self out for if I could go back. I hate this shit.",08Dec2020,1

130,"Think about it for a second, you have this horrid, wretched, vile, evil piece of human waste who your guys have spent YEARS fighting the army of, and all of your fallen brothers, all of the people he killed, all of the countries he bombed an invaded have lead up to this moment. Finally, we the allies will capture the lynchpin of the Axis of evil, and you enter the bunker to find that this man that you were ELATED at the prospect of taking and getting to FACE his crimes in front of the world or having the opportunity to put one to his head . . . Killed himself?

I try to imagine how I'd feel in that moment. First I'd feel cheated, this scumbag killed babies, women, children, over 10 million people and had the audacity to take the coward's way out? If ANYBODY deserved to face justice it should be HIM, and here he is lying DEAD?! Are you fucking kidding me? We all have guns and we all feel the same, so we each take a moment and unload our magazines into the body of the most evil bastard to ever live, but it still isn't enough. We light it on fire and throw gasoline on it but it still isn't enough, we decide that cremation is too good for this bastard and put the fire out, there is barely anything left but it STILL isn't enough. We spend hours arguing and fighting over what to do with him, so we decide the best thing to do would to take him to the dirtiest, swampiest, most infested marsh and put him into a wet shallow grave and each take a dump into that grave before burying it 3 feet in.

And it still wouldn't be enough to avenge those innocent people, our brothers in arms, our allies and the people they lost and the things those Nazi bastards stole.
