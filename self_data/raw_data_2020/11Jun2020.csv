1,"I have OCD which causes me to have intrusive thought and they act up when I try to drive. I got my permit 6 months ago and I’ve hardly driven because I live in a very big and busy city with tons of traffic and all the cars around make me incredibly nervous. 

However do to quarantine very few people are on the roads so I’ve been slowly learning to drive on main roads just a little bit at a time. There are still other divers on the road and I still get anxious driving near people but I’m doing a lot better then I ever thought I could. I still have to drive with a parent but I can now successfully drive from my house to places near by which is a lot more then I could do before. With quarantine being lifted slowly in my city it has allowed me to gradually get use to more and more other cars on the road. 

Corona is a horrible thing that happened to our world and I am not happy it happened. I’m instead trying to find a positive and so far learning how to drive has been something I couldn’t do without it.",11Jun2020,4

7,"Throughout my life, I have seen moths during times where my mental health was suffering. The symbolism of the moth is illumination-- when light is shone on whatever has been hiding from the dark. The moths in the bird seed, the moth on my window, and the moth on the door gradually became larger as time went by… and unfortunately the bigger the moth, the bigger the shock would be of whatever it was that I experienced the following days the sighting. 

Our last full moon was a powerful moon of healing and growth. As I was doing my typical lunar rituals, the candle light danced over a bowl of water, almost like a butterfly fluttering. I took note of it, and I found that butterflies were symbols of entering transformation with grace. I was relieved to see this as I have experienced many traumas in the last few years. 

However, in the following days I found myself growing more emotional. My dreams have been haunted by my past love for the last three nights. I will wake up and cry because in a way that is not at all graceful. Then, I realize that perhaps these tears were like oceans moved by the pull of the moon. Perhaps it is very necessary to mourn and cry and grieve to my very core in order to move on. I was so focused on becoming the butterfly that I forgot what it takes, what has to happen when you wrap yourself up in that cocoon. I saw a dead moth on the floor yesterday. I thought of a quote from my favorite movie:

“Back at home, we have black moths. Formidable creatures rest assured, but they thrive on the dark and the cold. What do they feed on? Butterflies, I’m afraid.”

I can only hope that this death is symbolic of the death of those monsters which still feed on me in dream. I hope these are their last goodbyes.",11Jun2020,1
8,"So I just wanted to tell this to someone because I thought it was so crazy.

So basically I have an ex gf from Highschool who I'll call Megan. I haven't talked to Megan in like 2 years and haven't seen her in person in atleast 6 years. My fiancée I'll call Olivia, has never met Megan but is friends with her on things like snapchat and Instagram because Megan reached out and wanted to be friends or something like that.

Megan will talk to Olivia all the time about random shit going on in her life and ask for advice and things because Olivia is getting a masters degree in counseling. We have our own theories on why she stays in touch but whatever.

Anyway today Olivia gets a snapchat message from Megan with links to an onlyfans account that she has made and apparently has decided that a good pseudonym to use for herself is Olivia. She used my fiancées name as her fake name to do porn. And then sent it to my fiancée, I just. Is this not just silly?

What's even funnier is she has her real Instagram account linked to her onlyfans, so why use a fake name at all?

15,"I (F26) moved away from my parents (M&amp;F, 60’s) after college about 4 years ago, about 1.5 hours away by driving. During college (~3 hours away from home) and after I didn’t/don’t call them very often. They don’t have Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or really any social media. They do text, but I cannot expect a quick reply most of the time. 

There are reasons I don’t call. In the past I’ve worked 40 hours a week or was a full time student. Being a student I really didn’t have time to call them. Working 40 hours a week allows me time to call them, but by time I get home a bunch of chores need to be done and dinner needs to be made. Perhaps these are excuses. 

Right now I’m on furlough, but I’ve decided to go back to school and have this hellish anatomy class that’s poorly structured. It’s week 3 of 11. Aside from studying, I am still not calling them. 

I’m reluctant. The phone calls last 0.5-2 hours, with an average of an hour. Most of the time it’s just them talking. Sometimes the one-sided conversations bug me, other times they don’t. The topics aren’t relatable to me, or are coated in/directly about politics and conspiracy theories. My mom’s worse about this, especially with COVID-19 and the riots recently. 

I miss them, but not how I know them in adulthood. They treated me differently as a child, as in they didn’t talk to me about mature topics. I think they figured I wouldn’t understand, which they were probably right. Since high school (14 years old, for international folks), the climate has changed. They view me as an adult they can talk at. They stopped asking me questions about myself. 

I’m just sad about the whole thing. They’re getting old and can’t have more than 30 years left. That’s just a bit longer than I’ve been alive. I don’t know how to handle this...",11Jun2020,1

18,"Ever since I was old enough to form an intelligent political opinion, I've considered myself both a Democrat and a Republican at various points in time. But over the years I've come to realize that ultimately, both parties really aren't that different from each other. Both of them are like shit sandwiches, the only difference is one of them has sugar and the other has salt.

Sure, the Democrats and Republicans want a better future for America (at least on the surface), but both are corrupt, rife with internal conflicts, and deeply hypocritical. Both embrace the ""you're either with us or against us"" mentality, as well.

Instead of trying to compromise and work towards a goal that everyone can agree on, both sides stay within their echo chambers. They shout down and mock any dissenting opinions while claiming their political ideology is the only correct one, then they attack their opponent by saying ""They won't listen! They think they're better than us!"" without a hint of self-awareness.

And don't get me started on the more extreme elements of both sides, which are far more popular than they should be. Just a few examples: on the right you have the alt-right, Neo-Confederates, the Proud Boys, and FOAK. On the left you have anarchists, the NBBP, and antifa. 

Most of these groups are characterized by a willingness to commit violence, cause chaos and/or create fear within their opponents...because that's *totally* how you get people to agree with you. Violence doesn't solve problems in the long-run. The horseshoe theory is real.

I guess I'm just disillusioned with it all. There are issues I care about, but I'm tired of being forced to pick a side and being expected to rigidly adhere to whatever opinions that side tells me to have. I've tried striking it out on my own (i.e. being a centrist) and just got shit on even harder by both sides.

I'm done with politics completely. I'm not voting this year or for the forseeable future. Maybe if we somehow manage to abolish the electoral system and increase the number of political parties that actually have a shot at winning (or even just heal the divide that's currently plaguing the US, if that's even possible), then maybe I'll give politics another shot. Until then, I'm out.",11Jun2020,3

23,"I recently moved neighborhoods and one night I heard this cat outside absolutely wailing. It sounded like it was right outside my door but it turns out he was 4 doors down. That’s how loud he was. I later learned he was deaf.

I have cats (who I adore) at my parents but I couldn’t bring them here because of no pets rule. I thought this was a perfect opportunity to be able to sort of “have” a cat here without actually having one. 

I’ve cared for stray cats before. Leaving food/water on the doorstep, etc. But this poor one was so malnourished I could feel it’s spine and hips. He was fixed but didn’t have his ear clipped and came up to me with no issues. This made me think he was a domesticated cat that got loose or was abandoned. I was heartbroken at his condition.

He came to my doorstep one morning and it was pouring outside. I brought him in to the front room so I could feed him without myself getting soaked. This was a big mistake. I felt horrible having to put him back outside since he enjoyed being inside so much. He even fell asleep in my lap.

He shows up when he’s hungry or wants attention and I’ve been letting him sit inside with me till he wants to leave again. I can’t keep him here nor do I have the money for vet costs. He’s still so skinny, has the worse case of ear mites I’ve ever seen, and is congested. 

He doesn’t seem to be cared for by anyone else here considering how thin he is. I thought about taking him to the SPCA so he’ll get the vet care he needs, but they aren’t a no kill shelter and I’m afraid he’ll be put down if I take him there. I feel like I have no other options though. All the no kill shelters around me aren’t taking in animals. 

I feel stupid for becoming attached so quickly. But I also feel horrible if I take him to a shelter. I don’t want to see him continue to be sick like this either though. 

I feel like any choice I make is going to feel like it was the shitty thing to do. Sorry for the rambling, I just needed to get this mess out of my head.",11Jun2020,3
25,"The books of Spinoza's Ethics, which he demonstrates in geometrical order, are as follows.

1. God
2. Mind
3. Matter (he uses the term Affects but if you actually read him he literally describes the affects as bodies in space)
4. Human Bondage
5. Human Freedom

This order is important... it is logically consistent and only falls apart if you deny the ontological argument for the existence of God.

The trippy thing about Spinoza's system is what happens when you apply it to other geometrical progressions in nature and see if anything cool pops out.

Here's one I just discovered.

The Fibonacci sequence. Lets take the first 5 terms and map them to Spinoza's Ethics.

0,1,1,2,3

God = 0
Mind = 1
Matter = 1
Human Bondage = 2
Human Freedom = 3

What's trippy about this conception is that God is a non-entity, mind and matter are equivalent, and freedom can only follow after slavery.

2... the concept of Human Bondage.

What are the next two terms in the sequence? 5 and 8 ... 5 is the number of Spinoza's system and 8 is the number of Buddhist systems.

8 is the 7th term in the sequence.

Why is 7 considered a lucky number?

Ask and you shall receive

Grab a bible... Matthew 7:7

What does it say?

Why is the trinity considered perfect to Christianity?

Why is six considered perfect to Euclid?

Why did Spinoza choose to write his system in 5 books? Why did Hume choose 3 books for his?

You mean to tell me all of this shit is just a fucking coincidence? That I'm just arbitrarily making free associations?

You ever reflect on the significance of John 3.16? You ever wonder how 3.16 is just two digits off from pi? You ever see what Newton saw in the bible?

27,"I live in a decriminalized state where it's two steps from legal. It's like a rediculous number of people in the state smoke it. At home, in their car, on the street sometimes. I have a genetic profile that makes me very sensitive and sometimes harmed by THC. it actually creates cortisol in some levels. That plus another illness I'm battling mean just a whif and I'm feeling full effects. And I don't fully detox for at least a day or two. 

I told my family I would have to leave the state when it became legal. But I have to stay (and want to). Plus, many other states are legalizing. But everytime I'm trying to go to somewhere and pass a cloud, or am staying somewhere that a neighbor or someone down the hall smokes. I get very suicidal. One whiff and I start experiencing physical pain. Extended exposure and I start to lose it. It's not just being stuck in a metaphorical prison situation around here, it's the physiological effects too.

Many stoner/smoker friends have tried to be considerate, and not do it around me. And some of the no/low THC strains help me on occasion with a small exposure. But most people love the euphoric bliss they get from THC and pump it up with 25%+ dank.

There's entire sections of the city I can't even visit at night because so many low income residents live there and rely on it when they get home. 

I told God I would never kill myself, because I don't want to go to hell. And I love my family. But honestly, I don't know if I can survive in denser urban areas of this state anymore. Maybe as people get more conscientious about the effects on their neighbors things will improve.

40,"Hey Guys I know Lasik Eye Surgery seems scary and there’s a lot of questions which you may have if you’re looking into it or already booked for your surgery date so I thought I’d write a post about my experience. 

I under went Lasik eye surgery about a week ago on the 5th of June 2020. I went to PersonalEYES in Sydney and the surgery was performed by Dr Chandra BALA ( I cant recommend him enough ). My treatment cost me $6500. Which I paid upfront, there are numerous payment plans you can discuss before the surgery. 

A week before my surgery I did a Lasik assessment to see if I was a suitable candidate and underwent numerous eye tests.. I was in fact a perfect candidate for the procedure. 

I honestly can’t believe that I took the plunge and did it because it seems pretty scary to have foreign objects in your eyes but honestly I would do it 150 x over if I had to. 

This is a step by step of my experience on the day.. I will also explain a little about my emotions surrounding the experience and pain/discomfort felt (there was no pain just my brain freaking me out).

My appointment was booked for 10:30am I had arrived a little earlier as I live quite some distance from the city and was sitting in the waiting room. Whilst this was all happening I had to fill out some forms pre op and a few more eye tests were taken and then I just chilled out in the waiting lounge. Unfortunately they were running a little behind because the DR already operated on 10 people before me. 

I was then transferred into a waiting room around 11:30 where I was with two other patients who were going to have their surgery before/after me. During this time I was given 1x Valium (Diazepam) to calm my nerves before the surgery. This happened to work for 10 minutes and then I just accepted the fact that I was actually going ahead with it. I waited in that room for a further hour. I was so nervous but it was all in my head.

At 12:30 mid day my name was called and I was brought into the room where the surgery procedure began. I was asked to state my name and DOB for the record and the Dr began to place numbing drops in my eyes. 

Within seconds I could feel nothing it’s not even uncomfortable when you blink. I was then asked to look in opposite directions whilst he placed a speculum in my eye (that weird scary thing which holds your eye wide open so you don’t blink). Honestly even that did not hurt since you’re pretty numb. 

He then proceeded to work on each eye starting with my right. He put the laser on my eye which makes a little cut in the corneal flap so he could proceed with the laser correcting my vision.

The first laser lasted 28 seconds you are asked to look at a green light.. they count down so you’re aware and you don’t feel pain at all when the flap is cut but you feel a sharp pressure kind of like someone pressing down on your face. I have big eyes so I felt this more so on my cheekbone once again though no pain. 

He then got a little tool and folded the corneal flap back and got me to look up there was now a red light and the laser which corrects the vision was working on my eye. Once again no pain could only hear it. Some people say they could smell it I smelt it when my left eye was operated not my right. This took 6 seconds.

He then folded the flap back into place and used a paintbrush like tool to smooth over the flap. 

Same thing happened with the other eye. 

I was out of the room within 20 mins tops. Probably took about 5 mins per eye. 

I was then sent home and asked to return the next day for a post op examination. 

I went home and took the sleeping tablet they gave me along with 6 different kinds of eye drops and some eye shields. 

I slept and woke up 2 hrs later which was surprising.. when I woke up I was in discomfort and water kept dripping from my eyes like someone rubbed an onion on it. Couldn’t open my eyes. it took some time. When my mum put the drops in I was fine. That discomfort went away immediately and I put my eye shields back on. 

I didn’t use my phone and stayed away from light. 

Went in the next day no problem could see everything vision is 20/15 in Australian terms is 6/4.8 which is better than 20/20 or Australian 6/6.

Today I went for my one week post op everything is good however at night I see halos when I look at lights and things are still a little hazy but that’s due to dryness. My eyes are extremely dry after the surgery. I was asked to discontinue my main drops and was prescribed with PolyGEL for extreme dry eyes. 

I wear my sunglasses everywhere as I am still experiencing a little light sensitivity. 

Right eye is fine with no issues left feels dry and little gritty which will go with time.. 

Overall really happy I did the surgery and wish I did it sooner...

52,"1. People who keep you from being happy are the absolute devil, and the longer you keep them in your life the more soul sucked you're going to be. The moment someone turns from friend/lover/confidante to someone who is cold, distant, doesn't care for your life, treats you poorly, do yourself a favor and tell them to fuckkkk off and find better people, no questions asked. I had to learn this, and many other people do too. 

2. Trust your instinct. Never second guess it.  Sometimes we all have those points where we have to make an important decision and your first instinct should be what you do because that is the real you and your real thoughts and feelings. You won't lie to yourself successfully. 

3.  Be honest, to yourself and other people. Don't lie, cheat, boast, fool yourself or the people around you, and don't waste time. Don't want to date? Be honest. Want to date? Be honest. Want to find a new job? Be honest. Partying too much? Be honest to yourself and calm down. Want to go home, leave, do something else? Be honest. Honesty in every single situation imaginable will help you 1000x more than dishonesty and that is the motto I live by.

4. No one owes anyone anything. You are not owed anything, and no one else is owed anything either. We simply have to work with each other and when it's time to end something, or move on, just do it, and understand we all have the same shit to deal with. 

5. Time is not as long as you think. One year turns to 5, turns to 10, and all of a sudden you're older, your family is older, friends are gone, etc. One day , one week at a time, think of what it is that you're doing and if it's the right thing, but the more time you waste you will regret.",11Jun2020,1293

You may feel worthless because you're sad or depressed, or maybe you're surrounded by people who don't appreciate you or even make you feel bad.

I've had 6 long term relationships in my life, ranging from just over a year to around 3 years in length, including one (brief) marriage - we were separated 3 months after we walked down the aisle. 

I have plenty of friends, who all insist there's nothing wrong with me - I just haven't found ""the one"" yet - but they are all now married and starting families (even those a few years younger than me) and I'm... alone. 

Dating used to be fun but now it just seems daunting. I can't help but be aware of the string of failed relationships behind me, some of which ended for good reasons but some (like my most recent one) where I can't even see where it went wrong. I'm starting to question if there is just something inherently flawed in me - that this pattern of failed relationships will continue until I'm too old to date and I end up alone forever. 

I've always been a confident guy and I've never had any problem getting a girlfriend, but now I feel that confidence has ebbed away. I've always tried hard to be a good partner when I am in a relationship, being kind and supportive and attentive but not intrusive or smothering. I'm a romantic guy and I've always tried to show that... I just can't seem to get it right.

- Screenshots from an Reddit account do not constitute slander. Nor do they demonstrate alienation of affection or any other bullshit lawsuit you’re trying to brew up. I don’t know what you think you’re doing over there, but it’s stupid. 


- Snooping out someone’s Reddit is a cheap ass move. It’s like taking a picture of someone’s diary. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading how sad, lonely, and empty my marriage has felt. I hope you feel great knowing I’m subscribed to AA Groups, the DB sub, and other subs for seeking support in an unhappy marriage. I hope you enjoy knowing that I love him, and always have, but that he has not been a good husband to me regardless of that. Even he admits he hasn’t been a good husband and acknowledges that as one of the reasons we are separated.


- SIL, I think you’re a two-faced fucking harpy that pretends to be all zen and the salt of the earth. You say I’ve shown you what kind of person I really am - but in reality I’ve been telling you the entire time what’s going on and you’ve been pretending to have my back only to turn on me when I called you out on meddling and stealing financial documents out of my house. When I say you’re a two-faced fucking harpy, I mean it. From the bottom of my heart, fuck you. I’ve always thought you were this awesome, kind, patient person - but you’ve just got a very good front put up. Also - I didn’t just unfriend you on Facebook. I blocked you. The fact that you even noticed I had blocked you shows me that you were trying to snoop on that too. I’m not stupid. The fact that you used my not being friends with you on Facebook of all things to attack my character is bewildering and funny to me. You’re an idiot. If you read this and send angry texts to me or my STBX, congratulations, you’re even MORE of an idiot. 


- BIL, God bless your heart. That’s all I have to say about that. I know you think you’re doing the right thing but you need to practice more critical thinking skills. I feel for you, man.

83,"When I was a freshman in college, I met a girl, let's call her Sophie.
Sophie had long blonde hair, deep green eyes and a cute smile, She was a 10/10. 
We were in the same class, and I decided to create a group of study with her,
so I we could spend more time together.
The benefit of this group of study was that we got to know a lot of new people,and I met one of my closest friends, Frank.


During the first semester, the days passed following the common lectures and I tried to get close to Sophie.
I basically texted her every night. We had more conversation online that in real life,
this is because we lived pretty far away from each other and the campus was the only place where we can meet.
Let's clear this out I never tried to approach a girl before and I think I was doing ok,
usually I text a person only if I'm really interested.

After 2 months of exchanges and mixed signals, one night Sophie was texting me about her past relationships and the problems she had with it.
At that moment I thought that was a good idea to tell her my feelings for her.
Feeling rejected for the first time is strange and it hurts slowly.

I wrote her that I understood her will and that She was polite to tell me the true.
I'm not the type a person that rages out if a situation like this happens, but also I stopped chatting with her.
In the next days I threat her normal: only small talk and awkward salutes and
I noticed also she was talking with Frank.

Some nights I felt a weight on my chest, cause I had not elaborated the rejection. And I was a little off, She seems not having any trouble in the choices' situation.
In me grew hate for the dudes that talked to her. Now that I am writing it I notice how stupid I was.

During the Christmas holidays, I met a new girl: Anna. She was very extroverted and made the first steps towards me, my friends knowing my situation push me in to her.
And that's the story how I meet my first girlfriend, our story lasted three months.
She was a little crazy but I enjoyed the time spent with someone that offered me some love.
I knew that our relation wasn't meant to last forever: we had a different personality and interests. And when we broke up, it didn't be a heartbreak for me.

In the meantime Frank and Sophie got very intimate and that hurt me a lot.
Cause my mind was always asking why him was better than me for her.
The idea that I spent so much time for her, that I open up my feelings for her without a result, made me sad.

This was an immature way of thinking, but at that time I was not capable to understand that she was a person with her tastes, personal stories and ideals.
I only idealize her persona and never know herself truly, like I haven't a real face to face confrontation.

Frank and Sophie ended up together and I went for my way.
My situation with my studies didn't go well either, principally for my way to procrastinating things and being so confident to say: ""I will catch up with the work later."", also my college's professors sucks.
I started failing classes and have a little depression.
So I lied to my parents and my friends and I told the I can resolve my situation by myself.

After two months Frank and Sophie break up.
Frank and I come closer together and we slowly reestablished our friendship.
And He told me how strange she was and her bizarre behaviours.
This made me reconsider the fact that with my eyes I saw only what I want to see and never pick some aspects of her, like I said I idealized her without knowing her properly.

I'm friend with Frank now, sometimes we mention that our friendship was born thanks to her, to be honest when happens I feel awkward and try to avoid the conversation.
Cause yeah, I'm an introvert...and I'm not so confident to share my emotions.

When I think about all this story, I feel very childish and stupid and I want to erase all from my memory, but I know it's impossible and remembering the past is the only way to learn from my mistakes.

So I think that share my story will make me feel better.
I'd like to have criticism.
Sorry for my English.",11Jun2020,2
85,"So I have been taking Venlafaxine for about 3.5 years. I had worked up to 225mg through a psychiatrist. For the past 2 years or so I’ve been feeling great, and made leaps and bounds through psychotherapy. For about a year my psychiatrist decreased my dosage until I was on 75mg. I stayed at that for a while and moved to the UK, taking 6 months worth of meds with me. 

I ran out of them a couple days ago and a) didn’t want to go through the bother/ expense of finding a psychiatrist in the UK, and b) figured that I had been weaning off it with the intent to stop anyway, so now is a good a time as any to go through discontinuation (I’m not currently working). 

I’ve been feeling like absolute death the past 2 days... headache, alternating between feeling cold/ hot, brain zaps like CRAZY, nausea, food aversion.

92,"A little background and yes this is a long one.

I'm 38 y/o, married, no children and work full time. I'm an only child and very close with my parents. We've always had a good relationship, they're super supportive and provided everything I needed growing up. A few years ago, they decided to take care of some financial items and made me power of attorney for both if they're coherent or not coherent. I can make monetary and medical decisions for them. I haven't had to exercise that authority yet but have been vocal in my mom's health issues over the past year. (I'm an EMT and have some medical background which helped my parents understand all the medical lingo, plus I'm a nerd and like to read up on health articles.)

Last year my mom was diagnosed with cancer. She's currently in remission now. She went through the whole bit of a small surgery, then chemo, then major surgery to remove all the cancer. She was at home on disability from mid-April until early this January, when she went back to work part-time. She's doing quite well but it took awhile to get used to her new normal. During these eight or so months, I was taking notes, going to all doctor appointments with them, answering questions and asking questions, going to chemo treatments, dealing with the chemo sickness, the major surgery that included taking my dad back and forth to the hospital she was recovering in that's about 55 miles one way from where we live until she was discharged. I helped take care of her when she came home some, doing odds and ends, getting groceries and helping with her medical appliances that she now needs. My dad is squeamish so he can't really look at anything that she needs to attend to in relation to her surgery. I completely understand that. Not everyone has a stomach for those types of things.

Anyway, since she's been back to work, my dad, who I love dearly, has been calling me multiple times a day on the days that my mom works. He will call about anything, to complain about something, which could literally be anyone and anything, including mom, to ask questions that he already asked in a prior phone call (his memory isn't that great, so he probably forgot he called.), to ask me what time she's done work so he can go pick her up. (She leaves a note on the kitchen table with the time he's supposed to go get her because her hours vary.) He does this while I'm at work, and it began even before COVID and I was told to work from home. Whenever I do go back to the office, I'm not going to be able to answer the phone all the time. Management will most definitely notice. My dad's been retired for about seven years now and he's 79 y/o. He wanted to keep working but has only driven truck his whole life and knows little about anything else. My mom keeps telling him to get a hobby and he's not interested. Sometimes he's in a good mood when he calls and sometimes he's not. My mom is my best friend and he references sometimes how close we are and that he doesn't have anyone.

I've already been suffering from anxiety and depression for the last 11 years or so and this has just made those intensify 10-fold along with working from home and not being able to go anywhere. I love my dad very much but I feel so guilty if I don't answer the phone or can't help him with something right away. I don't know how else to put it. I just keep thinking that I'm a bad person for complaining about this and I play these situations over and over in my head. Could I have handled something differently? What if he calls today and is upset about something?",11Jun2020,0
93,"Having mileage is really important. Sycra Yasin who teaches art online says his Iterative Drawing learning method is “very good at breaking this thing where analytical people tend to just think too much”. The takeaway from this great video is that focused, iterative practice on specific things is is the fastest way to develop intuition about something. (video link at bottom)

Intuition:
“The ability to understand something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning.”

People can get stuck in a rut where overthinking is getting in the way of what they actually want to do. I think it’s really important to stop what we’ll call your “default” mode of thinking and challenge it as often as possible. 
Want to draw a great human eye? Take your time, erase mistakes, iterate, polish, and perfect.
Want the ability to draw a good eye without thinking?You’d be much better off doing a hundred willy nilly eyes without worrying so much about how they turn out. 

Of course you’d be well advised to research the eye and how it’s structured. But the real learning happens through trial and error, when you focus on bits that went wrong in that last iteration.

Now, this is obvious. “Practice makes perfect.” But the key here is to do our practice in a way that makes the thing natural to us. If we want to quickly improve and learn anything, this method is very good at cementing the ability into us, making it possible without thinking. 

Most people only think of practice with regard to activities like sports, studying, or exercise. I think it can and should be applied to our way of thinking. In the same way drawing can be a natural talent, a peaceful mindset can be natural to some people. 

People who are happy go lucky really are lucky. These people I think have a talent that not everyone has. They are talented at being at peace - it comes naturally to them. They are naturals at not worrying about the small things, the big things, the superficial things, the relationship things. Being at peace is intuitive to them: The bridge between the analytical side and intuitive side is built. They don’t need to practice it because they are lucky enough to have that connection in their brain already formed, in the same way people have all kinds of natural talents like drawing or sports.

You can break down the techniques of drawing; the form, colours, perspective, and anatomy are all pieces of analytical detail that you can use to draw the perfect eye. But someone who is able to intuitively draw an eye means that person has all those pieces of knowledge so naturally connected in their brain that they don’t have to “think” while they draw. It’s natural, like breathing.

If you want to build this bridge quickly, do as Sycra recommends: pick something specific, and do it quickly a hundred times. And don’t be so careful, just do it. 

How can we be at peace if we don’t practice being at peace? Let’s create a more specific practice for, as an example, being less anxious.

People who tend to be anxious are usually thinking a great deal about many things, and things that are usually negative. It makes sense that worry would arise in someone who constantly has a nag in the back of their head that they can’t seem to shake. It could be something like their relationship, what they are pursuing in life, how they spend their time, or their own self in general. It could be many of these things at the same time, and it can be nothing. 

Humans tend to avoid thinking. It’s work. We tend towards relaxation. Things that occupy our minds like Netflix give our minds a comfy and familiar place to relax into. Are these escapes necessarily a bad thing? No, obviously not. We like familiarity. 

But if we ignore our mind’s need, like ignoring our body’s need for physical exercise, we can easily fall into a bad state of mental health.

Don’t let that feeling of worry sit in your mind, like a knotted muscle, always slightly straining. Work it out. If you’re analytical and you’re good at being analytical, you have great potential to make anything intuitive for you. 

But you need the mileage, if it’s not already a natural thing for you. You must put in the time. You cannot pick up a pencil and draw an amazing eye without intuition about it;// intuition that is either developed or naturally possessed.

In the video, iterations on drawings are made almost haphazardly. The changes between each are not completely thought through. The changes are made, and the thinking happens afterward. What’s good about this iteration? What’s bad? Ok let’s try making it more curvy. Let’s stick this piece out. Hmm no, let’s go back, but spread it out. Each iteration is developing your brain. You’re learning what looks and feels right by knowing what’s wrong.

Do this with your mind. If you’re unlucky and you’re a chronic over-thinker, you might lack the natural talent that many people have. It’s easy for them, it comes naturally, they don’t have to think about it. With enough iteration, you won’t have to think about it either. 

Here’s an example of someone practicing their mental health. They start with meditation, in the same way someone learning to draw a human might start with the head (it’s also a good metaphor since the brain is in the head, duh).

“Ok. So I feel anxious right now. What can I try changing that might make my thoughts more at peace? Searching for some common recommendations online, meditation comes up the most. This is probably a good place to start. 

1. I’ll try to stop my thoughts, through meditation.”

“Ok so that went pretty badly the first time, I couldn’t stop thinking  at all, but I know I need to try at least like, i dunno 100 times to actually be good at meditating. I’ll try focusing on my breathing more.”

“Ok that helped a bit but I always came back to being “aware” that I was focusing on my breath, which would be very unhelpful. I’ll try focusing on my body.”

“Ok that helped more than focusing solely on breathing. I’ll try focusing on both my body and breathing.”

“Worked ok, but I still become aware of my focus on body/breathe, and lose my (un)focus. Hm how about I try something totally different and instead of trying really hard to NOT think, I’ll think as much as I naturally do, and not fight it.”

“Wow that was different. I got very odd trains of thought. While most of them were negative, as I wasn’t worried about not-thinking so much, they would come and go. After a while I felt relaxed. I got very scared at times, but letting them flow naturally worked well. Now I’ll try thinking as hard as I can on everything that comes to mind.”

“Intense. I feel like this was more useful for figuring out solutions to many of the problems that my worries first arise from. Was not as relaxing as letting thoughts flow freely. Now I’ll try flailing my arms wildly while I meditate.”

… and so on. Be bold, the iteration is meant to be quick and dirty - mistakes are how people learn.

“Ok. So I am really good at meditating now. I can relax my mind when I want. I learned that my thoughts are not who I am, they are something that I can observe, almost like they are someone else’s thoughts. But, a lot of the anxious feelings still come slowly back when I’m not meditating, so while it’s a useful tool to relax into the moment, it’s not really working outside of meditation time. I learned during my meditations about what I’m anxious about. I’m worried about missing out on life. When I’m not working I don’t do things that I actively desire to do, I just do the same old thing. I also learned that I don’t really know what I want. Now, instead of being anxious in general, I’m anxious about a specific thing. How can I learn about what I want, out of life? Ok I’ll apply the iterative technique, and try 100 things, because my new goal is to have “knowing what I want” intuitive to me.

1. I’ll try drawing on my past, focusing on the good times in life - what made them good?

3. I’ll try windsurfing

4. I’ll try having lots of sex with attractive men/women

5. I’ll try reading every day

6. I’ll try to meditate constantly

7. I’ll try making music

8. I’ll try traveling

“OK. So I know a little more about what I want in life. I love a lot of different things: being around other people, tasty food, sex, friends and family. At my core, I want to love and be loved. Now instead of being anxious about not knowing what I want, I’m no longer anxious because I know how I should be living. I still get anxious from time to time about death, but I know that’s only natural, and that the best way to stop worrying about death is to live, fully. In fact, my worrying about not living life fully is almost the same as my worrying about death. Oddly, I’m intuitively aware that death is not worth worrying about, yet I lacked the intuition to be at peace. I now understand that people who constantly worry about death are simply not intuitively aware that it’s nothing worth worrying about. They don’t have this natural talent.

Without knowing the head, you can’t draw a good human. 

Without the ability to meditate or calm your mind, you can’t learn what’s causing your anxious feelings.

To draw a full human just from intuition alone, you need to be able to draw all it’s components intuitively: the body part connections should be intuitive, perspective should be intuitive, human anatomy and movement, and the variety of body shapes all should be intuitive to you. This takes an immense amount of iteration and exploration of these individual pieces if you’re not naturally talented at drawing. 

Similarly it takes an immense amount of iteration and exploration of the self, to have peace of mind (and body!) become natural to you.

To have intuition about your own self is truly a talent to be envied. So go explore yourself, and make some mistakes!

106,"I turned 40 last year am single male. I don’t own a house and don’t have any kids. For the last 20 years I smoked weed almost every day and just went about life with no worries. I dated a few girls, but always chose the bad ones that would end up taking me for granted or cheating on me. There were good girls who would have been loyal and worked to make me happy but I didn’t appreciate them.  All these years I told myself  I still had time and I was better off waiting.

Now a few months ago I was diagnosed with a mild case of hpv genital warts that seem to be going away, but this has really caused me emotional distress. I quit smoking weed and cigarettes 4 months ago to help my body clear the infection and plan to stay smoke free going forward. I’m thinking now that I wasted 20 years of my life with no purpose hanging out with people who weren’t good for me and spending money on going out, cigarettes and weed. Now I’m 40 and feel it’s going to be too late to build a relationship with someone to start a family. This pandemic and being sober from weed has really made me realize that this could have been a role where I was married with kids in a house having quality time. Instead I’m in an apartment by myself watching everyone else live the family life through Facebook. All my fiends are married with 2 kids. My sister is also married with 2 kids and when I visit and see how happy they are I feel like I really messed up my chance for that life. I’m also worried about my parents who in their 70s. I know they won’t be around forever and that no one will love me like they do. I visit them everyday and think about this. I think about how I cheated them out of more grandchildren and the chance to attend my wedding. I live in regret thinking about what coils have been and what will be. I have a great family that I see a lot but I feel like this will be over once my parents pass. Will I die alone and be found days or weeks later? Have I blown my chance to meet someone, fall in love and start a family since I’m currently 40 with no prospects? I am not sleeping because I keep thinking of this.

116,"So i plunged it for a while and that kind of helped but it was also splashing too much water out of the bowl for my liking and the smell was horrendous.  What I ended up doing was going to the kitchen, taking a butter knife then cutting up the poop because I could see it blocking up the drain.  It was so gross I almost puked but it worked.  The texture of chopping up a poop with a knife is sublime I can not explain it, it was awful tho.  I am debating just throwing the knife away.  I'm sure it can be cleaned but at the same time its the principle of the thing.",11Jun2020,11

120,I don’t really know where to post this but back in May I was scammed out of $600 through Apple Pay because I was trying to buy my sister a switch and I found someone on OfferUp and I sent the money through Apple Pay and they sent the tracking number. I figured because of everything going on they didn’t want to meet in person and that’s understandable but the switch never came. So I called Apple Pay to file a dispute but they said they couldn’t do anything because the payment went through. So I called my bank and they said I could file a dispute and get it back but I got a letter saying my dispute was denied and I don’t know how to get my money back.,11Jun2020,2

123,"So my wife has really high blood pressure and it's been like that for years. Today she finally got in to see a doctor about it and they want to do testing that would cost like $1,000. Luckily the medication they just put her on only cost $7. I'm about to start a fucking GoFundMe for her tests that they want to do.

127,"For 6 years I’ve been saving for a house deposit. Every payday I put a substantial amount of money aside to try and meet my goal of owning my first home. But I’m still nowhere near. In fact, I’m as far away now as when I started. 

I’ve had to move rental properties so many times that my deposit and moving costs have been submerged into what I should’ve saved. 

I want to feel stable. I want to know that the house I’m in is more I’m my control. That if I can’t live there it’s because I fucked up financially, not because the landlord decided to sell up/put up the rent extortionately/become intolerable to associate with. 

I haven’t lived in a property for more than a couple of years and I just want to settle down, feel like I can make friends, actually get involved with the community. 

Instead, I feel scared of making links, knowing that inevitably it won’t last long. 

And even if it does last longer here, there’s not a chance I can afford to buy here. I’d have to save for 20 years to be able to even make a dent on a 10% deposit (and by then, house prices will have gone up anyway!) 

I’m so rejected and disheartened. I feel like giving up on my dreams.",11Jun2020,2

144,"TW eating disorder

First of all, this will be me ranting, so thanks in advance for reading and no hard feelings if you don't.

I have a history with eating disorders, binge eating and bulimia. I've been in recovery for bulimia for about a year now and I'm doing better and better.

In the span of this last year, I was sexually assaulted, the abuse in my household has gotten to an unbearable point, I ran away, moved into my boyfriend's father's house, cut contact with 2 dear friends for various reasons, and last night my boyfriend messaged his ex saying he missed her. The exact wording is that he missed her a lot.

And I just can't eat. It happened when I was sexually assaulted as well. I am so upset that even the thought of putting something in my mouth makes my gut clench and it feels like my oesophagus gets locked off.

This is important because I used to not eat for several days and then lose consciousness and find myself having eaten a ton of sugary stuff with no memory of doing it.

I don't want to relapse. But I'm so very upset and I know that if I forced myself to eat something, it will feel like I'm unable to chew. It will feel like I forgot how to. It's lock up coming from my brain. If I were to try to explain, I would say my brain is under so much stress that it thinks the act of eating would make me so vulnerable that I'd end up dead.

I am SO upset. I'm currently giving the fight to my boyfriend so on that bit, there isn't anything I'm not doing that causes me to lock up. It's just that the thought of eating is really unbearable right now but also I keep thinking 1. I need to eat something and 2. What if I relapse because of this. On top of the stress I already have, I get worried about this.

I also don't think I'd be able to sleep comfortably at all, so I don't know if I'd be able to eat tomorrow either. If I were to be able to sleep for a solid 8 hours, maybe I'd be able to but... Who can when their significant other does something as shitty as this.

Thank you for reading if you did. I just wanted to share my feelings.

Throwaway because I don't want this to show up in my other posts on my main.",11Jun2020,1
146,"For my whole life I have wanted to be an outcast I hate to fit in and not in the hipster way of things, I have just always wanted to be well an outcast I feel this may have started when I was in primary school and I was a bully, I was a bad person, everyone used to exclude me from games and I didn’t have many friends and people always would argue with what I would say so I decided to change my actions and I became a nice person, so when I moved into secondary school I started a new and became the nice version of me but it doesn’t feel like I’m any different from how I used to be I’m just now putting on a persona of a nice guy, it’s feels fake , it feels like all of my friends are fake even though it’s still me who made friends with them.

147,"So I know for some people crushes are really horrible and shit, but I actually kind of enjoy the feeling. 

Usually it's someone I know is out of my league, so I don't have any dumb expectations and can just focus on the feeling of having the crush rather than them actually liking me back or something.

The Reddit lifestreams are Awesome! 

I normally avoided these, but two days ago I checked in on a very popular stream minutes before it ended. It looked up the user who hosted this stream and saw that he just started a new stream, so I joined. Now there were a lot less people in the stream and you could have a conversation via the chat with the guy. It actually felt awesome to talk to a stranger from another part from the world. (Sorry mom for talking to strangers). Today I checked in on some music channels, Not all of the people were as talented, but they all were very passionate. The streams with few people watching are the best, because you can actually talk to the people. I actually felt happier/ satisfied after watching these streams.",11Jun2020,0

And I've come to realize. There are hundreds of thousands maybe millions who just live their daily life don't bother anyone and don't play in the same sandbox as everyone else haha. You could amount to your wildest dreams be a Rockstar be a famous artist, build the next Facebook and... Still there will be people who don't know or care.

I think it's silly all these things we put weight on. Having a 2 thousand dollar purse but the person next to you has no idea what it is. Value is anything we assign to it? Things are only as worth as someone else wants it to be? Or can we value something internally regardless of anyone else perceived that value?
