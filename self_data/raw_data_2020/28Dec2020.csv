1,"Note: This might be more relevant to other people from Britain, but might be similar to some peoples experiences elsewhere. 

I felt all my school life I had to pretend to be something I wasn't to avoid physical attack as much as possible (form chavs/roadmen/wanna be gangster) or constant criticism from most of the working class, so I'd learnt to behave working class very well, but my parents also wanted me to do education, this was very hard to balance (as for the most part working class culture is strongly anti education). After I left school, I couldn't make friends from either class, as I felt too other to the other if you see what I mean, and my confidence was fucking shot. Now in my mid 20s, I'm sort of over it, but still haven't had any friends since my school days. Where the hell do I look for friends (or girlfriends) now (this is a genuine question, if anyone reads this I'd greatly appreciate some suggestions)? I've done ok for myself workwise, but work alone online, so that isn't an option to meet people from. Most working classes probably would probably see me as too middle class now, as I have only associated with my middle class (part working class, but they act middle) family really for years, but would any middle accept me, when I grew up socially (at school, learning those ways) working class really.",28Dec2020,1
2,"I mean, everytime I get bugged out because it’s so relative and sometimes confusional. Technically 4 am is day time, but if I’m at a party or having a bit of insomnia, I consider that as night time; if I’m waking up early, that’s day time.  Even more confusing is the fact that, at least personally, I consider “day” the time when sun is up and “night” the rest. 
It often happens that I tell a friend “this morning I went late to bed, I’ve lost myself looking at memes and ruined my sleep schedule”, and all the day they, and also me, refers to that event as “last night”… but technically it was morning, and if something happens on the actual night, there would be two nights on different days considered today.
On a 24 hours day, where 12 hours are day and 12 are night, the night time is at 00-06 and 18-00, but considering them 12 consecutive hours would be wrong, because they would be on two different days. Still sometimes they are considered the same day, and that’s what bugs me out.
Have you ever noticed? Have you got a different point of view?

5,"An online friend that I had a crush on was suffering from a depressive episode last we talked. I gave him space and tried to be there for him, but I ended up taking his disappearance personally after some time, assuming he lost interest. It had been a few weeks of radio silence which never happened before and I ended up thinking he ghosted me. Because of this and the fact that I was too emotionally attached to him, I called out my friend for it in an amicable way. I also ended up spilling out my feelings which truth be told I had been concealing for quite some time (he already knew beforehand that I liked him). 

I never heard from my friend again since that day, but found out a few months later what happened by stalking and messaging him on an alt. I know what I did was crazy; I lost it because I was pretty much heartbroken and couldn't take his disappearance. Aside from now having a girlfriend, he was also in the hospital when he initially disappeared for attempted suicide, and by the time he was released I had already said goodbye. 

I have mixed feelings over this situation. Part of me is guilty for not being able to tell how bad his depression was at the time and letting my own emotions overwhelm me. I shouldn't have drawn conclusions and been more understanding. Another part of me is hurt because I think he still could've told me what happened, seeing that everything transpired months back and he's in a happy relationship now. Was our ruined friendship completely my doing?",28Dec2020,1
7,"I’m going to blow my own spot up here... I should be a junior in college but instead I’m a freshman. Why? Because I went to school for a year, did poorly, took a gap year, and not enough of my credits transferred over for me to be a sophomore. So yeah. I am going to school for digital media with which I can choose a career in photography, graphic design, advertising design, etc. and even though those are my hobbies, I still don’t have much motivation to do well. At all. And I have no idea what else I’d switch my major to. I sit around all day and play on my phone or focus on my appearance and only do something when I have to or if someone asks me to hang out. I’m not self sufficient. I don’t try and make my life fun I just go with it. I want a job that pays well, but that isn’t too hard or stressful. But then if it’s easy, I might get bored. And I won’t get paid a lot. But I hate high stress and pressure. I know what I want in my future life, but don’t have the motivation to work for it. I love taking the easy way out. Nobody else in my family of 6 is like me. 
I am diagnosed with depression for which I’ve been on medication for about a year now, and although I don’t necessarily feel as depressed anymore, I still feel like a bum with no motivation. I just don’t feel a deep sadness. 
I recognize my potential, and what I could be, but I feel like I’ve coasted along for 21 years and I have no idea where to begin so I just don’t.",28Dec2020,1

13,"Quote by Buddha supposedly. But seems to be from Ernest Wood. I always thought its meaning was probably the most profound if you abstract the idea into “if you don’t know about something interacting it with other things that you know will give you an idea of what it is”.

There is you. And the world around you. Whether you exist in this world can’t be measured if you never interacted with the world. We could never tell you existed if there is no gravity, no light coming from you. These are only possible when you interact with the world. 

Now, instead of your physical body let’s think of your virtues and characteristic traits as the foot. You will never know you’re brave unless you are put in situation where it is required. You’ll know if you’re kind unless you hit the ground that asks you to be kind. 

If you have limited experience in life, you are the foot floating in the air never touching the ground not knowing who you really are, what you’re really made of. Once you touch different grounds your feet(your character)will harden from all the damage(or the experience in our case) it took. 

You maybe are that person who has lived long enough, think you know enough, but this quote also gives us a hint that if you are put in a completely new environment maybe you will reveal a completely new side to yourself. Maybe there’s a ground you’ve never touched before and foot that you’ve never felt before. 

This quote was also the basis for my epiphany that morality is not something divine. Morality is nothing but a management tool for people to live in harmony together. What is the difference between a good person and a bad person if they’re stuck on a desert island with no one to interact with?",28Dec2020,1

18,"Hi Reddit,

This is my first ever post on reddit. Before this I have never been an active user of reddit other than occasionally read posts shared by friends and groups. I am not sure what I plan to achieve from this exercise but I have always strongly believed that as long as you try and put your thoughts to words it has the power to relieve you of the burden of the same thoughts. I have done that all my life, writing down and typing up notes that range from incoherent wisdoms to lucid rantings. The surprise being I am no better than I was before.  This brings me to the reason for putting up this post, maybe it hasn't helped because despite vocabulating my thoughts I never let others hear them.  The only audience they had was my over thinking anxiety ridden lump of grey matter that tries to find a logical solution in the most insane of irrational problems. Nevertheless, if I don't try this out I will always wonder what if I had more faith in humanity  and the internet in general to help me out through this hard times.  


Hard times; seems like a great segue into what I am going through and what I want to talk about. I know I have very little to complain about when it comes to my life. I have a great well paying job, a loving family and supportive friends, but I deal with loneliness that I don't know  how to get around and get over it. To give you a background I am an immigrant who moved to a country for education and then ended up finding a great high paying and well respected job that I absolutely love. Sadly that also meant that the loving family I mentioned are time zones away. Not a day goes by which makes me want to go back and get some grocery shopping with my dad, take my mom out shopping, experiment in the kitchen with my sister and buy all the toys in the world for my sweet little niece. It seems like such a simple solution to give up on the career and just go back home and be with them, but does that make me a failure? I worked hard and got to where I am in my career today. Is going back my only choice at this stage? How come I haven't had these thoughts when I was in a relationship? Is it because I realized I was capable of replicating a similar family here that fits with my current life? Can't I have it all?   


Moving on though from family to relationships, it has been almost three years since I have been in one, or for that matter even gone out on a simple date. It has been a long time since  I have felt loved, hugged and kissed and held close so that I can bury my sorrows and share my happiness in silence and in trust. I didn't think it mattered. I have told people in my life that it is okay to be alone, not have that someone special, but deep down I don't think I believe in it. I really wish I did though it just makes my life easier. It makes lying to myself a lot lot easier. I am not claiming to be a wonderful person, neither am I saying that there was some fault with the women I dated. It is just that I don't understand why don't I deserve that love and that affection people claim to have or even a watered down version of it. I am not that naïve to believe that everyone has it perfect when it comes to their relationship but at least they have one. Why not me? By the way while we are on this subject I want to take this moment to acknowledge reddit's choice of choosing my random reddit handle as repulsive face, great gut shot buddy! Maye it is my repulsive face or maybe there is something is destiny that has decided I need to wait or be alone whatever it is, how do I put my brain to rest.  


The last thing I want to talk about are friends. I am not saying I don't have friends. I definitely do, while I was in school or university I made sure I made friends. I made sure I had good memories, but ever since I moved for my work I have failed at making friends. I live in a 450sqft studio apartment working close to 10+ hours a day with no friends. The gravity of the issue being since the entire pandemic WFH has started, I have had weeks go by that I spent without talking to another human except the checkout person at the grocery and that too only when I have alcohol in my cart and can't do a self checkout. Luckily alcohol is rarely not in my cart. Aren't we supposed to be the social animal? Is this really normal? I thought it was, but I feel really lost and I don't know what to do.  It has been so long since I have made a friend I don't even know how to now. I am extremely socially awkward to the point that I rehearse and draft out messages that I want to send  others before I actually do.  Am I damaged?  


Well that is all for my first post on reddit. I am sorry if I reddit isn't supposed to be used this way. I am sorry if I rambled on too much. I also apologize if whatever I typed and said out here triggered anyone and ruined their holidays. I am not sure what I plan to achieve by this post. It may not be answers I am looking for, this is quite possibly just a rant, a rambling or a cry to reach to anyone feeling the same or have felt the same. It may be a post for me to stretch my arms out for a hug virtually, maybe the safest  way to hug right now.

26,"Since watching the queens gambit I have been playing a lot of chess on [chess.com](https://chess.com).  It is fun but also so frustrating at times.  Both when I loose and when the opponent refuse to accept a draw when it is clearly a draw situation.

28,"I often read saying that venting or expressing yourself on paper is a good tool and I'm not here to deny its benefits to others, however in my experience it feels as if what is being written is the same as shouting into an empty room. Nobody is going to read it and it'll probably remain that way. Just as the saying goes ""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?""
I guess I do want others to know what I'm going through. I don't have many people that in open to. I do have one person that I'm friends with and I feel really bad about venting to her all the time. I told her directly about it and she said it was fine, but I feel bad everytime I vent because she's listening to my negativity and I don't want all of our communication to be just about my problems.

35,"I am not a doctor and you should be evaluated by a sports medicine doctor/physical therapist or relevant specialist before undergoing any self treatments for injury. This information is to hopefully help you understand what tendons actually need to heal, and to give some idea of how you can go about healing them. Tendinitis/osis is one of the most frustrating injuries to deal with, and I feel almost everyone will or has had to deal with it somewhere at some point. There is so much false or contradictory information on the subject, it can be daunting to even figure out where to start with healing. To make matters worse, many general physicians don't have a great understanding of the issues, or just have very outdated information. I recently came across an interview with Dr Jill Cook, one of the world's leading experts on tendon injuries and rehabilitation. This information is based on her/her colleagues extensive scientific research, as well as the research of some of the other leading researchers in this area. It's a 2 part video interview (audio only unfortunately) but within it I found some of the best Information I've ever found on the subject of tendinitis/tendinosis, much of it completely contradictory to what I have been told from other physicians/fitness people. I will link the videos as well as do a quick bullet point list of what I feel is the most important info to understand. 

Video part 1 - https://youtu.be/1B4-ho9q_bQ
Video part 2 - https://youtu.be/MHq_2IcK_5s

*Summary of relevant information:
 
1st you need to figure out for sure if your pain is actually a tendon issue, Jill said 50% of people referred to her turn out to not have any tendon issue, it can be confusing. A tendon injury will not be painful at rest, and it will be painful with load. Increasing the loading increases the pain. The pain will be very localized, you can put one or two fingers on the spot, and the pain will not migrate or move. Tendons will give you pain 24 hours after activity, this is very important to understand, it's always what you did the day before that you need to analyze to determine when you have done too much/too much weight/reps etc. 

-Some things that don't address the problems with tendinitis/osis or that aren't very helpful in healing:

Rest 
ice/heat 
anti-inflammatory medications 
Cortisone injections 
PRP injections
Dry needling 
Massaging the tendon 
Stretching the tendon 
Braces 
Low weight/high volume exercises 
increasing blood flow to the tendon 
Collagen supplements 
Stem cells (don't integrate into tendon matrix) 


-What IS helpful, and necessary to heal tendon injuries:

Heavy slow resistance loading of the injured tendon. This creates mechanical stiffness and strength in the tendon, as well as growing the muscles associated, which is a big part of alleviating pain. Heavy slow resistance training is NOT painful for tendons, despite what logic seems to tell us. There is actually very little load placed on tendons when under heavy slow resistance loads. Fast movement of weight is what creates loading in tendons. Low weight/high rep training will worsen tendon pain. After 5 reps of heavy slow resistance, the tendon will be stabilized for further sets and there is little risk to the tendon. The whole idea is that tendons need to be loaded to heal, rest will not heal tendon injuries even if the pain goes away. As soon as you eventually load that tendon past its threshold you will likely have a return of pain/issues. What you need to do for long term resolvement of issues is start very slowly using the 24 hour rule - if your pain is the same 24 hours after exercise, you cna proceed with the same weight/reps, and pain should slowly improve as you progress. If pain is worse 24 hours after exercise, you did too much, and need to lower the weight/reps and re-evaluate again. If pain is better 24 hours later, you can slowly up the weight l/reps and continue on. Below is a plan written by another leading expert Craig Purdam that you can follow: 

*Stage 1: Isometric loading

This is loading the injured tendon with weight but not actually going through the stretch/contraction range of motion. For the triceps tendon for example, you could hold yourself in the top portion of the push-up position with proper form for time. Look up your particular tendon and isometric exercises for that tendon. 

5 repetitions of 45 seconds, 2 to 3 times 
per day; progress to 70% maximal 
voluntary contraction as pain allows (24 hour rule).
Move to stage 2 when you feel comfortable trying to progress, and you have minimal pain when trying stage 2 exercises below. Do so very slowly and only as pain is improving. 

*Stage 2: Isotonic loading

This is loading the injured tendon while also moving the limb associated, unlike isometric. You maintain constant tension in the muscle as it changes length. These exercises can be either concentric (muscles shortens) or eccentric (muscle lengthens). Again you will need to look up examples for your particular tendon.

3 to 4 sets at a load of 15 (rep maximum) progressing 
to a load of 6 (rep maximum), every second day; 
fatiguing load.

move to stage 3 when you have adequate strength and it's consistent with the other uninjured side, and when you have minimal pain during exercise and pain returns to baseline after 24 hours of loading. 

*Stage 3 Adding in relevant exercises for activities/sports 

Progressively develop volume and then 
intensity of relevant exercises to replicate demands of your sports/activities you wish to return to. This will be individual to you, but if you play basketball and have an injured Achilles tendon, you're going to want to return to jumping, etc. Slowly progress back into normal functions of your tendon that it will need to deal with. Always use the 24 hour rule. This stage will take you back to full use of your tendon in whatever activities you wish to take part in. 
 

I hope this can be helpful to anyone reading this, tendon issues can be incredibly confusing and stressful to deal with, and it's important to understand the what tendons need to heal. I highly advise seeing a sports medicine doctor or physical therapist for your particular injury and getting evaluated for more certainty of your injury before undergoing any exercises.",28Dec2020,1
36,"I met her when I was 16 and she was 13. I'm now 22 and she's 18, there is about a 3 year gap between us. The first time we met I didn't think much of the situation because we were visiting from across the states. We didn't even visit to see them. It was a vacation at a resort and to see a basketball game. Or at least that's what I was told. We saw them 2 times in a 5 day span, for less than 3 hours both times. First reaction was that she's cute, that's where the fuck up starts.

Fast Forward a year and now we live in the same state as them, 15 minutes away. They start coming over regularly but its just awkward because I'm a depressed, awkward, and anxious 16 year old. But we spend a lot of time together and I start to really like her. This goes on from ages 16-18 for me. When I was 17 we merged families by living together btw. When I was 18 our parents got married. Throughout this whole thing I've had feelings for her. Not strong but I was into her for sure.

Well when I was 19 and she was 16 we started hanging out way more with just us two. My older sister moved out and our parents went out a lot or stayed late at work. We started flirting around that time, on one specific occasion she mentioned that I'm a lot like my dad. Fast forward 20 minutes in our conversation and she says that she wants a bf that's like my dad but that looks different. I don't look anything like my dad. And she starts almost posing in provocative ways. So obviously since I had had feelings for, at this point I start thinking that maybe she's dropping hints. About a month later I tell her that I think I might like her. She literally doesn't say anything so I ask her if she's mad at me. She says that she's not. Later that night I feel like absolute shit because not only did I just get rejected but I also probably fucked our relationship. So I try and take a step back and fix the situation as best I can, I tell her that I don't think I really like her, I just am not used to having a little sister, and that I just started to feel really comfortable around her and she's more like a best friend who also just happens to be my step sister (yeah I know, I'm actually just stupid af)

She didn't talk to me for 3 days after that. But she did text me thanking me for clarifying. So I just hoped that things would slowly go back to normal. Which they started to within a week. However after that she starts looking at me a lot more, with extended eye contact. Even said one time that we are just step siblings not real siblings. I brushed all of this off, assuming that she is either trying to bother me or just likes the attention I give her. Within that time frame-about a year- she has been off and on with her flirting. Shortly after she turned 18 our parents were out of town and we were hanging out, she brings up out of nowhere how, ""isn't it cool that I'm 18 and our parents are out of town?"" I responded with, ""yeah but just wait till you're 21 and can buy alcohol"" and her mood dropped noticeably after that, and she has seemed to avoid me since then.

Then this Christmas it all started again, she said that she's 18 and legal, and started hanging out with me more, and posing in provocative ways. But then she stopped again because I kind of shut her down again. I just can't do this anymore. I'm overwhelmed by my feelings for her, I want her so bad. Not just I want to have sex with her. I genuinely love her as a human being. I've never felt so strongly towards a girl. I've even gone out with 3 chicks that were into me since I initially told her how I felt. But I can't even keep things going with them because I can't get over my step sister. I don't want this. Its not some porn fetish. I love her, I would do anything for her. But I Just can't take it anymore. I think about her often, and its not in a sexual way most of the time. I just love her.

I kept making songs because I enjoy listening to music and I wanted to make some songs for Miku, my favourite virtual singer. Minecraft used to be my favourite game because I really enjoyed making statues, buildings, redstone circuits or whatever. I kept moving forward because there were no other ways to go. What else would have been my options, suffering from depression for nothing? As someone not loved by anyone, there were not many things I could do. 

My parents kept throwing my Arduino stuffs away and I can't afford all those electrical parts again and again so I decided to stop working on Arduino projects recently. I stopped playing Minecraft because I got bored with that game. The only creative activity I still work on would be songwriting, but now I feel like I should quit that too. The reason is quite simple. I can't come up with new melodies or lyrics anymore. I just can't. I feel frustrated. Do you know what it feels like when dreams were the only things that kept you alive and now you are losing all of them? That's what I'm experiencing now. Of course losing dreams won't kill me directly. I'll just never be happy after losing all my dreams and soon will be swallowed by my depression and suicidal thoughts. Oh god, I can't believe that I am still alive while hating myself for my entire life.

48,"Hi Reddit, so about two hours ago I had the weirdest thing I’ve ever experienced happen to me. I’m going to tell the entire story and if any of you know a scientific phenomenon that explains this please share. So tonight I made plans to visit a good friend of mine who just got back from college. We spent most of the night just talking in his kitchen. it was somewhere around 11 at night when we were talking about politics of all things and out of no where a BRIGHT and I mean BRIGHT Flash of pale/cream colored light happened in the hallway entering the kitchen to the right of us. Me and my friend both froze and my first thought was that a power outlet had literally exploded with electricity. There was a light pop noise when it happened. It was not loud, the pop was about as loud as a light switch flipping. The weird thing about this is that this flash happened no where near the wall, ceiling or floor. It happened right next to his chimney about midway from the ground to the ceiling. We tried to find an electrical source for this and there were no power  outlets, light switches, lamps or lighting anywhere near the spot that this happened. We both were extremely confused, we even tested all the lights and electronics in the kitchen because if it was something electrical failing it would have caused a fuse to either blow or trip a breaker. With all said and done we just continued on talking about how weird that was followed by more conversation and catching up. About an hour later I was facing the opposite direction of the first flash and he was facing me when once again out of no where I see a very visibly bright cream/ white colored flash of light with the same pop noise and everything. This time it looked as though the source of the light came from behind the door frame on the other entrance of the kitchen. This would have been behind him and completely out of his view but we both stopped in our tracks and I asked him if he saw it. Apparently he saw an entirely different flash that took place behind me and slightly to my right. The flash he saw was a red-ish color and although these flashes happened extremely quick the flash he saw was directly in his line of sight and a lot closer. (About 2 feet behind me and maybe 10 feet from him) for the rest of the night we didn’t see any flashes and We called it a night about half an hour after the last one we saw. Now that I’ve told you what happened I’ll explain in more detail what these looked like. The first and probably the biggest one that we both saw was so bright it was hard to see clearly. It was a white/ cream color and It just looked like a giant flash of light with no source. These next two happened at the same time but we both saw a different one. The one I saw I did not see directly. All I saw was a flash of light in that doorway and just based off what I saw in that moment it looked like it’s source was just behind the doorframe and I could clearly see light on the floor and ceiling around it when it happened. The one he saw and by far the weirdest he described as slightly red in color , about 6 inches wide and 4 feet tall. It did not appear to touch either the ceiling or floor and happened literally in the middle of the room. It’s hard to describe these things because they all happened in an instant. I’ve tried googling this to find some kind of answer and the only thing that shows up are eye issues (which this was clearly not) and paranormal crap. So with all said and done I’m pretty freaked out and I never believed in the possibility of spirits up until tonight. My only guess is some kind of static electricity in the air but as far as I know that’s not a thing if your inside a small space like a house and we touched a bunch of metal stuff, nothing shocked us, our hair was never sticking up at all or anything like that. I didn’t mention this earlier because I don’t want anyone thinking I’m trying to tell some kind of ghost story but he told me that apparently this happens frequently at his house and both him and his mom have seen this multiple times in completely different parts of the house. I’ve known this guy my entire life. He’s extremely smart and even has an internship at the DHS. I’ve been to his house more times than I can count and I’ve never witnessed this. Im surprised he never told me about it but it seemed like he had never seen it with another person and he also didn’t want to freak me out or have me think he was crazy. (Which yeah all things considered I would’ve been like okay yeah that’s weird but I’m going to take that with a grain of salt) these weren’t some small flashes of light that we weren’t sure if we were saw. THIS HAPPENED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF DOUBT. These flashes were insanely bright and the only thing I can compare the intensity of these flashes to is the one time i accidentally touched a live wire to a ground wire while working on an electrical outlet. Once again the weird thing about this is when I did that, it made an extremely loud bang and it sounded like a flash bang went off in my face but the flashes tonight made no loud noises. Just a almost unnoticeable pop. Anyway. What’s your thoughts guys? I hope you find this interesting. Sorry it’s so long but I’m freaked tf out and I really just wanted to express exactly how f*cking weird this whole thing was.",28Dec2020,1

59," 2 days ago, a name from an old kid's tv show was on my mind and without realising,  I searched that name in google. I started worrying because I remembered that in the past, I searched for that show. I remember not being able to find much. That's the only thing I remember. For some reason, I worry that I may have made a rushed promise to God or to Gods not to ever search for that show again. I cant remember making such a promise but for some reason, I get bad vibes as if I made one. 
 
 I worry that by searching the name i may have broken the hypothetical promise. Why ocd is giving me bad vibes?

 I searched for that show probably, during period that I was having much anxiety about my ocd. Maybe my ocd which has to do with promises to Gods, falsely connected my anxiety with that show. So, it now gives me false worries that I may have made a promise not to ever search for that show again.

 I cant remember making a promise but why I get those bad feelings? Could it be that I made a promise and since, it was for something rare, I forgot it easily? Maybe my subconscious remembers it but I forgot it?

 I spend 2.5 years worrying about my ocd promises and I started getting better the last days but everything got ruined just because, I randomy, without realising it, searched for that name in google. I spend 2.5 of worrying so much that I ended up having a psychosomatic problem and now, I must worry that I may have broken an hypothetical promise to Gods?

65,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

One instance she said she booked me in for a practice interview and I just looked down and nodded and she said annoyed ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ when I didn’t mean it like that 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

💡She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


◾️I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

68,"I just want to understand why people get so upset when I talk about vacations. Yesterday, I was in a writing group, and I found myself talking about one of the very little things that make me happy - Disney World. 

And the host cried, because the conversation gave her bad flashbacks to her ex-husband. 

That was understandable, and I shut up. 

Someone in the comments told me that it stings a little when you don't have the money, but they themselves didn't any interest in Disney World itself, so why would they be upset about not having the money for something they don't like? ""I'm more of a quiet beach person. No large crowds."" I thought maybe they were sympathizing with the host, and I apologized and left. I probably won't do back for a while, just to give everyone some healing time. 

I've been to Disney World over twenty times; my family has lost count completely. (I'm a sophomore in homeschool high school, by the way). I've spent up until the beginning of this year thinking everyone's life was like that. 

I know, I sound like a spoiled brat, but going to Disney World twice a year or more was all I've ever known. It made sense to me that people who don't live in the state don't go that often, but none of the people who lived around me didn't do the same as us? 

Still, I sound spoiled. I've spent most of my life watching vlogs on YouTube, thinking everyone had the lifestyle we did when it came to vacations. Boy, I was wrong. 

So I guess it made since why people thought I was lucky for going to Disney World. 

And that they were shocked when we played two truths and one lie and the ""Going to Disney World over ten times"" truth wasn't a lie. 

This year, I noticed people looked irritated when I talked about my vacations. (Most of them getting canceled. Thanks a lot, C.) Every time I brought up my trip to Europe (that got canceled), people looked like they wanted to punch me. 

My mom talked about how she loves Disney with some people once, and she said that someone insulted her by calling her a ""princess"", like my mom thought she was better than everyone else. 

And it's not just Disney. On the other side, there's cruises. (The Europe thing was part of that. RIP, my dreams). 

I've been on thirteen. 

I don't think that's a big number. 

At least I didn't think that until I heard most people haven't been on any. No wonder they looked so pissed when I talked about my experiences. 

I went on a MSP (Ah, the memories) and made a form asking users how many cruises they have been on to make conversation. I've been bullied on those forms before, but maybe this time I could start good conversation. 

Nope. People called me ""rich girl"" and wished the Titanic on me. I messaged one person and apologized for being offensive, and she said, ""What you said wasn't even offensive lol!""

So I don't understand why people are wishing death or tragedy on me for that. 

And, no, I'M NOT RICH. I'm simple middle class, my parents make average. My mom pays for vacations, my dad pays the bills and buys food. That's how it's been since my sister was born and we moved to Florida. And even before then, we cruised more. Disney was a rare thing. 

But here's the thing  - No one likes cruising. No one. They complain about seasickness (I love the rocking of the boat), they complain about the water (there's water in your house when you turn the sink or shower on. Jk, that's a little understandable), they complain about being in the middle of nowhere (never thought about that), and they complain about Titanic (now, I understand that completely, though it's a rare thing that it would happen to you. You're more likely to die in a car accident.) 

So why do people get so upset when I talk about my cruise experiences if they don't even like it? I don't get upset when they talk about all their video games they've collected, something I don't have much interest in. Don't those cost a lot? 

I had a friend in fifth grade at the beginning of the year who's been on four cruises. He was the first person to ever talk about cruises with me, and he started feeling down around me. 

We haven't texted since April. 

""Why were  you texting someone who's four years younger than you, anyway?""

Not the point of this post. 

The point is that it's upsetting to have something you're passionate about, but have people get upset over it. My life is rough. I've been screwed over by pretty much everyone. My parents never believe me when I'm innocent just because I've lied to them five years ago. My sister has a developmental delay and wears headphones to block out every noise and makes weird movements in public, making people think that I have a disability too and treating me like I'm two. (Even my sister understands how half of this stuff works, thank you). Because my sister can't understand me, that takes away the only person I have to talk to.  

I've having problems with my faith, something my parents value more than anything. They don't believe I have faith either. I don't feel like there's much hope for me. I'm not pretty and I'm not that good at many things. Creativity and traveling are the only things that make me happy. Traveling is the only time my family is semi-happy (my sister complains about noise and walks around weirdly in those headphones, as I said before. It hurts seeing the normal families at times, all the siblings able to talk to each other and understand things). 

People complain about me being bitter all the time, but when I talk about something I love, they get upset and think I'm bragging. 

I have no one to talk about travel with, other than my parents. 

When people talk about how great of friends and family life and all the great things they have that I don't, I don't noticeably be rude about it. But I bring one thing up about my vacations, and people act like I just announced that someone they love have died or something. 

If anyone knows the reason for why people respond this way, let me know. I hate that I come off as rude, and I really don't like offending people, but I also want to express what I love, because I don't love much. Even this Negative Nancy needs a break to be happy and thankful. 

I make made another post to express myself more, if that's okay. I just made an account to express myself for a little bit.

70,"I (26f) was first notified of the existence of this man (27m) through some mutual friends of ours who thought we would be a good match. He lives in another state so we talked on and off for a couple of years and then he came to visit me. He stayed with me for one month and things had gone so well he wanted to move to my city in a couple of months so that was the general idea. 

He was financially strapped and I was not so I paid for him to rent a car home. A few days later a girl calls from his phone and informs me that she is his girlfriend and they have lived together for months. I knew about her in an “ex” capacity and believed her. When he called to explain I simply stated that he return the car the following day or I was reporting it stolen. The car was returned.

The next episode begins when I set a deadline for him to return a handgun he had in his possession which belongs to me and he would not respond to any of my attempts to communicate the return of it and I took it as he was tying to steal it from me. So, I drove 14 hours to his city he following week - giving him updates along the way to which he would not reply- and took it from him before turning around and driving home. I guess he was shocked and he didn’t have much to say but did apologize for “being a piece of shit.” I guessed at that point that was that. 

A couple weeks later I saw my mom and explained to her the situation that had recently transpired and after some time told me that she and my stepdad had given him money for some things that he was planning to bring back with him when he moved out here. This was not very smart and it was not a small sum of money, I felt furious as my mom is not wealthy and works hard for what little she does have. Why was I left completely in the dark on this anyway? I knew about the situation but not that they had given him money. I gave them his number.

My mom texted me later and said they decided just to take it as a loss. I texted him and told him I had now learned that he had stolen money from my family, what in the actual fuck, and he is a waste of life. No response since my trip to get my gun and that was the last I reached out to him. 

Our friends know. His family knows. My family knows. Everyone is horrified. Honestly I have no idea what the hell just happened, he left several things here as he planned to return a month later to live/work here and that was the plan put forth to many mutual people. Then to just fuck off like that? Many people were affected by whatever this was and he has yet to speak one way or another and I’m not going to ask. 

TL;DR- guy I was in a relationship with from another state came to stay with me for a month, went back home to his girlfriend, stole a gun from me which I drove across the country to retrieve, then later found out he took a sizable amount money from my mom before disappearing without explanation of any kind.",28Dec2020,1
71,"Life is shit...
The fact that I am even addressing this proves it, as one should be grateful for being alive, right?
Alert:::
I am, in a state of contradictions, so what I say can contradict what I said a few moments ago. PS: Sorry for my English.
I don't know when I became like this, but it started to happen when I started watching GOT back in class 8 or 9, I guess. (Season 8 was crap... Couldn't even watch it whole)
Life is valuable, no doubt indeed, and if someone would come and ask me if he wants to die, I would slap him most likely, but when I think about it, it makes damn sense.
Just throw away your logic, and jump into this train as it makes no sense until you think from a... Well, unique personality.
I care about nobody, I do care, but in some ways, I don't.
Let's begin on the rabbit hole that I am into.
Let's take a look at my life. (Not required, but I want to vent out)
I am 17 yo, and live in a developing country.
Since my childhood, I was what known as a ""Bright"" kid. Scored pretty good in every tests, not because I wanted my father to praise me, but he would beat, and scold us for not getting good enough marks.
I remember, I got beaten when he saw 98/108 or something that happened around class 1, the score was my attendance, and he mistook for an actual score. I don't blame him, he isn't literate.
For the next couple years, same thing happen, and I score marks to escape his scolding. (He is a good father, and I am grateful to him)
He never once praised me, but did compare us (I have an elder sister, and brother) to the neighbour's children. 
For the couple of years... Till class 4 or 6... Our lifestyle was too strict. We used to wake up at a fixed time, with father beating if we didn't wake up.
But as time progressed, I stopped giving much damn to my studies. Being called the gifted one made me feel proud, as well as sick.
Stuffs happened, and my sister moved, my parents became engrossed in work, my environment loosened. I felt free, and here I started my new phase.
I would watch series all day. Most of them were pretty graphic.
And things happened... And happened, with my parents loosening their control over me.
Now... Back to the present.
My personality:
An arrogant dick, who cares for none, and gets a nag pretty much everyday, and doesn't even care about other opinions.
I know I am wrong, but... I can't help myself. Idk the reason.
Now, to the main topic. 
Why I think Life isn't as valuable to me as it should be:
1. I feel life and death are normal
2. I don't want to try hard. If something isn't going well, then I would just move on (idk the reason, and if you know, then please tell)
3. I feel like I am just a trash of the society who contributes nothing.
4. If I don't want to try hard, why the fuck am I wasting resources? Shouldn't I just end it?
Now, I am not going to commit any weird stuffs at the very moment, I am still holding my sanity but... I kinda want to know where I am wrong to get over this shitty thinking of mine.
If you can then please help me realise the worth of life.",28Dec2020,1

And after quarantine (start of November in my country), she started to talk to me. Daily, about trivial subjects at first. Quickly, we started to talk about our mind state, loneliness, depression, etc. And soon after, about sex. She talked about her 2 years relations, the sex she had, and apparently it was bad at the end, painful.

I'm a virgin, but I read, watch and listen a lot about the subject, so I was able to discuss about it, and she told me a lot of stuff, about her body, what she likes, want, her fantasies, etc.... She even told me about her current relationship. 

And.... My horniness, who was in jail for a long time, came back. We did a lot of sexto, I described what I wanted to do to her, etc. That was hot.

I don't know why, but I want to make her happy, make her having a good moment, I want her to like sex again, even if it's an arrogant thought of me. 

I told her of course, because I don't hide myself, and she continue to make suggestions, to play with me, saying she wants to cuddle, but I don't think she wants to go for more, and it's driving me insane, I feel like shit, I want to stop being a horny dude, but we constantly talk about sex, and tease me.

85,"**Love vs a crush**

[What u/Qeidren said about the butterflies is very true](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/klo6rj/how_do_you_know_when_you_are_in_love/gha81c1/):

&gt; When even after the butterflies have calmed down (and they will), and everything has stopped being new and exciting (that one is definitely inevitable), there are still moments where you look at them or just think about them and feel like 'how the hell did this happen and how could I ever be so lucky?'

&gt; And when you can't remember the last time you had one of those moments with them, your first thought is to do whatever it takes to find them again.

&gt; You'll still get butterflies, and you will still have those wonderful sun-blessed days where everything shines, but you won't be so worried about whether or not they're happening right now, because you know you've got the thing that those moments are made of, and as long as you keep digging, it will never stop flowing.

It's just like that one family member you really love. If you love a person, you will still be able to live your life knowing that you can go back to them. When someone loves you, you will know it because their support is still with you no matter what you're doing and you know you will be loved unconditionally when you get back. When it's a crush, it can be hard to focus on what you need to do, it's very easy to get envious about them talking to other people, and it's easy to worry about them getting their attention or worry about being around them.

I will say that sometimes exposure or addiction feels like real love. It's fine to be addicted or used to the one that you really do love but it'll go beyond that. When you truly love, it's about you and the person, not about you having the person. When you don't have the person you like, it's an emptiness around you and loneliness inside..When you don't have the one you love or family, it's an emptiness inside and loneliness around you. Love can also be both of these things inside and out.

When the pride or benefits or excitement goes away, and it's time for real life to start kicking in, it's easy to ask yourself if you're really in love.

**Needing the person**

When you're in the best of times, either it'll be WITH the person you love physically there or WITH them being supportive from afar, or it'll be BECAUSE your crush is there. Of course love can be pleasurable because the person is there but it won't be limited to that, the true pleasure will come with then not because of them.

When you're in your worst of times, even if your tolerance has been surpassed by the person or if you're hurting and the person isn't able to help, you will still need them there. When you love someone instead of like them, you won't expect them to be there because you need exposure or need something that can give you, you won't accept the behavior/problem as a cost for being with the person. When you love them, you need them there because you need the person, you need what you have together, and they would expect that of themselves if they really cared. When you want them there, it's not from exposure or out of habit, it's not about what you lose or gain when they are there or not there, and it's not about how long you guys will have each other. When you want them there, it's actually about what they are missing and what you guys won't have together and you not being there to support them. 

Of course you are going to need things from the person and you're going to need to give them things, and neglecting that can compromise the relationship. If a family member or partner is not giving you what you need despite fully being able to (or being legally obligated), that is neglect. When it's emotional neglect, it's a lack of their commitment. Of course there are exceptions when emergencies or tight schedules or medical problems arise, but if the person is not committed to you, then it is not high priority relationship. If you find yourself not having the time for the person despite having the time of day, that is a sign that you may not actually love them or be interested, and that is perfectly fine to feel as long as you are honest with your feelings.

**Support**

When the person you really love isn't supporting you, it won't be about them not doing their job, it won't be about them being terrible/neglectful/etc., it won't be about you losing your relationship status or not getting their attention, it won't be about what you are losing or what you want to see. When the person you love isn't supporting you, it's abandonment. When you love someone and invest in them, but you don't get it back, it'll be about you not being loved back. 

When you're worried about not being loved back, it isn't about whether you're good enough for them or not. You shouldn't have to worry about not being good enough as long as you're taking care of yourself. You also shouldn't be able to pick apart things you are doing wrong (even things you don't want to admit) or things they are doing that are hurting you/separating you. If you're worried about being good enough, it can either be from your insecurities, or be a sign of their high expectations, and can indicate abuse/manipulation.

**Second chances**

With a crush or a person you like, or a person who doesn't actually love you back, you may give a second chance, which will honestly be more about you having more time with them, reaching then how to treat you, and getting a second chance to be impressed. With a person you love, the second chance will be an opportunity for them to have better conditions because you know they can reach a potential and you know you have things to work on as well.

When you give second chances to a person you love and you are still getting hurt, or you find out it escalates, then that is not safe for you. That is a time where you are not unconditional with each other.

**Unconditional love and conditions and safety**

Related to the butterflies: Love is unconditional, yes, but when you are in love you have more clarity. When someone you love does something wrong, of course you're always going to defend the one you love. You're always going to be okay or want to not blame them because you know they didn't mean that, you've seen their better side. But when you truly love somebody, you also know that: if they're doing bad things on purpose or they're able to control their flaws and they don't, then it is safe to say that they don't actually care about your well being, their behavior is more important than others' safety, they don't care to take your support, and they don't care about what you guys have together. Either they don't actually love you back or there is something keeping them from holding you at that value. Sometimes it is not their fault due to other conditions, but that is not a safe or supportive relationship for you and you have to consider whether you can safely help the person or if you need to give them resources and go back to safety. 

If they did actually love you, they would know you have to be safe and that you worry about their condition too. Someone who loves you would either do what they could to control their condition because they're worried about yours, and they would accept your support, OR they would know that they couldn't control it and they'd sacrifice you for your safety and condition. If you love somebody and you are in danger, you will know that you are in danger. When you have an addiction or a crush or if there is psychological manipulation, problems with safety tends to come off as something else or be difficult to tell. 

Either way, even if you are in the deepest love with somebody, or if you realize the person you like is putting you in danger, do not tolerate what they're doing to you. If you are in danger by anyone, don't be afraid to hurt the other person, especially if they are threatening or injuring you. Intoxication and coercion and nonconsensual sadism are not excuses for them to hurt you. Accidents DO happen as part of life and they are forgiven. Have good judgement, because repeated incidents that are known about are not accidents. They are not acceptable. Neither is them making up for repeated incidents or buying you things or doing things for you.

**Do you love them?**

It's not about asking yourself if you really love the person, because if you could ask yourself that then you're always going to find problems. 

You know you're in love when you don't find yourself asking whether or not you love them. If you're not in danger or if there's no motive for you or them, then the question of whether you love them will not have to come up. If it comes up at any point, you know you have some things to look into. If you have a lot of anxiety or trauma, anxiety can trigger false red flags and can make you question things, however if you are compatible with the person and if you are a priority, then they will do what they can to help you through so that you can be loved and be safe. And if you actually love somebody, you will be able to do the same if the roles were reversed.

**For anything here, you should be able to see the roles reversed. Of course people are not ever perfect and there is no strict criteria to ever apply, but this can help you evaluate whether it is love or not.**",28Dec2020,1
86,We’re taking a break because I felt I was the only one putting effort into the relationship and she thought it was best if we take a break. Should I prepare for this to turn into a break up? I’ve known this girl for years..best friend and then became my girlfriend.,28Dec2020,1
87,"I'm 34 and have been internet active since I was about 13 or 14, so two decades. Started off with Xanga which was great, on to Myspace, different forums, then Facebook and most recently Reddit (late joiner).

Right now I'm really questioning how good it is for my mental health to be part of this shit anymore. Facebook is the worst abuser, Reddit has its things too. I'll try to explain, but I'm probably gonna ramble because I'm kind of all over the place with thoughts right now.

I'll start with Facebook's issues:

1.) It is divisive as fuck. You curtail your friends list, your circle, and it seems to always just create a stronger echo chamber. Then other echo chambers are around you though, you have access to all echo chambers. The fact that we are so engraved into our own echo chamber makes us so much more certain that we are right and the other side is wrong. We do not interact in any way that promotes exchange of ideas or open to thoughtful and actually engaging conversation. One side just wants to say stuff that will make the other side mad, one side thinks the other side is heartless. It's all stupid.

2.) This goes along with the first point, everyone thinks the other side is awful, stupid, crybabies, or whatever because each side has literally the worst people representing them the loudest. I'm an extremely left leaning American and as are most of my friends, and the groups I'm in. I see these groups share posts that are absolutely absurd from shit people on the right say. These being shared just reenforces a false idea that everyone on that side is like that. I'm sure the same is done in conservative groups. The truth though is that we are seeing the actual rock bottom worst ideas from the absolute trash that side has to offer. But we seriously see the worst of EVERY SINGLE point. I'm equally annoyed with men mansplaining as I am with seeing anyone point out and ridicule a man mansplaining. I'm sick of people on the left, I'm sick of people on the right on social media. These loud ass voices of dumb shits just creates more gridlock.

3.) To tie the last two together. I'm completely stuck on the idea of which would be more healthy, to stay in this echo chamber or to see the other side more. The echo chamber just entrenches me more that the other side is bad. But seeing what the other side has to say a lot of times, especially going through the election, who we have in office, makes me hate them too and sometimes gets me really angry and I feel unhealthy. I don't know what to do. It's not healthy either way. 

Now on to my experience with Reddit. 

1.) I haven't had direct experience with it, and it's also not limited to just Reddit. But, Jesus Christ, there is a lot of people who just can't let other people enjoy something. Be it a video game, be it another site, be it whatever, there are just posts after posts of people making fun of someone for liking something they don't like. Don't like Fortnite? Don't fucking playing it. Who gives a shit if someone else like it? Do any of you have any idea how absolutely soul crushing it is to talk to someone about something you really are into that you are really passionate about and they just shit all over it and you for it? I have done that in the past and for awhile lost the best friend I've ever had. Don't fucking do that anymore. Let people TicTok, TicTac, what the fuck ever.

2.) Just straight toxic ass behavior in forms of jokes. I can not count how many times the same joke about women saying something about men's height and then the retort about women's weight done in so many different meme formats. Shit like that is gross people. Just be better people.

96,"This happened back in the spring but it has been weighing heavily on me recently. My dad had a problem with alcohol and drugs throughout his life, despite being very successful in his career and a (typically) great father. Over the last year of his life, things started to spiral as his long term relationship came to an end, in large part due to his addictions. He was kicked out of his house by his partner after some repeated ugly incidents. During his outbursts, he was **never** personally violent, but had a tendency towards rage and paranoid thinking. His partner sought a restraining order to keep him away from the house. We knew my dad living alone out of his house would not be good for his well-being. Things continued to worsen and he repeatedly contacted his partner by email and phone accusing her of some preposterous claims. This was in direct violation of the restraining order and, worse still, was often done with his work email. After repeated incidents, his partner and her family contacted his workplace and had him fired over his conduct. This ended a 20+ year career my dad had with his company through multiple rounds of layoffs and acquisitions. He lost his life and health insurance as a result of the termination, leaving my sibling and I temporarily without health insurance. He died a few months later after depleting much of his own savings from living on his own and spending lavishly. Given his prior termination, there was no support for us in the way of life insurance. His sizable 401k had been depleted form his spending on hotels, lawyers, and who knows what else. Of the two houses he owned with this partner, the more valuable one was left entirely in her name while half of the vacation home was ostensibly passed down to myself and my siblings, although practically we can't afford it ourselves and it's value is dwarfed by my father's outstanding debts. 

As a disclaimer, there are large parts of the story I still don't know for certain as I often could not fully trust my dad's own telling. In any case, I don't wish to defend my dad's actions here, he was clearly out of line and we tried to convince him as such countless times. Although I very much believe he struggled with alcoholism and other addictions which often were the cause of his actions. However, I can't help but feel my dad's former partner acted in a careless way, first having him kicked out of his own house and then fired. She must have known had bad this would be for his own well-being and for my family who have always depended on my father. I can't blame her for being sick of his drunk outbursts, honestly we all were, but there had to have been better options. I'm not denying the emails and calls he continued making to her were surely a form of harassment, but it was obvious they were coming from someone clearly hurting and not mentally well. We repeatedly encouraged my dad to seek mental health treatment but he never followed through, often claiming hospitals would not admit him given he was not prone to self harm. Then there's the firing. How could my father's company that's benefited from his hard work for over two decades throw him out in his time of need? I understand he was most certainly in violation of his contract but, once again, he was clearly not well. This made his path to recovery even more improbable given the lack of income and health insurance. Not to mention the fact that it prevented his family from receiving any support from life insurance when he eventually died. 

No doubt part of my anger stems from how it difficult it was for my dad to receive mental health and addiction treatment during his downward spiral. I think if he had been admitted and received proper care there's a good chance he would still be alive today. I wish I had personally done more to help him but I felt like I had no control. I don't know how to feel about his ex partner but it's hard not to read her actions as careless. As for his company, I think it's frankly disgusting how quickly a long-serving, successful employee can be fired when they clearly need support. His coworkers and even his boss most certainly knew of his alcoholism, I think in many cases encouraging it on their many business trips, and yet did not intervene in his firing. Mostly this is depressing to me because despite everything my father was generally an empathic, kind, and intelligent person and it hurt seeing him fall so much in this last year.",28Dec2020,1

100,"A quick summary for “the past” here would be basically my ex gf. We were together almost 5 years and our relationship ended in 2018. However up until today I’ve been even dreaming about her. 

The first two years it was an amazing relationship and my first “real” one. The third year, I left the city we were to go for a masters degree and after that I started a new job in that mentioned city. We kept a long distance relationship for two and a half years. I was having one of my toughest moments in life, working more than 16 hours and suddenly anxiety appeared. So yeah, perfect combination. She saw that I was way worse when it came to self esteem, confidence and basically I wasn’t the same guy anymore.

I was at my lowest, relying on alcohol during weekends to forget her at the same time I wanted to forget about my shitty job, looked for help and ended up going to therapy for a while. It really helped and today I’m in another (better) job, and moved to a new city and country, where it all started fine, however I was having issues meeting new people (I left the other city just when I formed a really cool group of friends) and the phantom of my ex was still there during the lonely days.

And then, 2020 and the pandemic arrived. Last time I saw my family and friends was on January and I’ve been keeping up pretty well I’d say, working out helps me a lot, I don’t drink anymore and I think I’m in pretty good shape (better than ever I’d say) and all of that stuff (I’m 29 btw). However I still think about my ex, the situation has not helped when it comes to meeting new people and I couldn’t travel this Christmas to see anybody, so, basically I’m losing the friendships I had in the last city I was (even though I try to keep talking with them it’s clear it’s not the same anymore), and I feel more and more lonely every day, so my head goes back to the good days over and over. On top of that, I see myself losing a ton of time on social media, and this doesn’t help either because it makes me feel even lonelier, specially these days. Last night I dreamed about her again, and I don’t have anybody to talk about it, so that’s why I’m writing it here.

I tried to meet new people using apps and such, but that didn’t lead me anywhere. So yeah, here’s my rant",28Dec2020,1
101,"For the past 5-6 years or so I have been depressed and stuck with social anxiety and well anxities in general. 

After a solid 4 years after college I decided to pick myself back up and get help and guidance with work in a field I enjoy. For the past 2-3 months we have been working on what kind of stuff I like and after the holidays I should hopefully get a training or internship someplace. 

Today I suddenly get told by my dad I need something by January and I said didnt you and mom agree to me being in this program and letting me get guided. But suddenly that doesnt matter I need to get it done now. 

My mom or sister is constantly pissed at something and the atmosphere in this house is generally not a good one. My dad also said if I dont have something by January he will take the little money I have even though both of my parents by advice of my doctor agreed and supported this whole program. 

My sister is generally more succesful, shes social, works and finished university so to hear from my own dad how my sister does much more than me even though I have been diagnosed with depression really hurt. 

I also admit I do feel ""off"" a lot in the sense of headaches, nausea and the likes lately I have had a lot of problems with taking a poo because I will bleed. Quite a bit. The response I am getting is almost 80% 'Oh its something else this time'.

103,"20 [M] with 21 [F]

After doing some internal processing, what I once though was self esteem has just been the absence of caring what others think. As this revelation came to me in the shower, I didn't find myself to be amazing or anything--i just simply didnt care, and that was enough. And upon realizing there wasn't much of myself that i was ""proud"" about (i dont necessarily dislike myself), i felt pretty sad.

I realize now, being in my 1st serious relationship (2nd relationship in total) after being pretty harshly dropped by girls in the talking phase throughout high school, that the only person whose opinions i really ""care"" (in an active ""i value what this person thinks about me very highly"") about is my girlfriend. We have been together 1.25 yrs about, and from time to time i cant stop myself from thinking im not all that, though she reminds me how special I am to her and how much she loves me. I want to be the best for her, which i can acknowledge is not realistic at all. I guess im afraid some other dude will catch her interest, which has lead to some negative thoughts and feelings throughout this time period. I do trust her not to cheat on me, but i guess i dont trust that I'm enough to have her want to stay. &lt;&lt; for that thought, can somebody slap me and tell me im an idiot?

Im glad this came up so I can really address it instead of thinking that I have high self esteem EXCEPT with my girlfriend, because frankly, I dont think it's possible for self esteem to change depending on who you are thinking about.  Which is so freeing 

This is more a personal expression than a question, but for the sake of bringing a better, more confident version of myself into the world and into our relationship, are there any pieces of advice dealing with self esteem that completely shifted your view and mindset? I don't want to feel like I dont have agency in all of this... thank you :)",28Dec2020,1

It may be a pump and dump, but worst case scenario, I lose like $50-100, move on, and learn from the loss. Best case, I gain like $50-100. So, just playing around and getting my feet wet. My brother found out that I invested in this stock when I asked him a question and RAILED at me, saying it was a stupid stock. Like, ""you don't know anything about this,"" and ""you have no idea how to manage the money in your portfolio bc you don't even know the terms I say,"" ""you shouldn't follow what idiots on reddit say,"" ""people would kill for your portfolio and you don't deserve it"" etc. It was a custodial account before - now the account is mine so I need to take responsibility and learn how to manage it. If I ask my dad questions, he yells at me so I figured it's best learning on my own but they both still treat me like a retard.

My brother has lost like $13k or so in stocks/options in the last year. He gained 10k and then lost it when he invested it in something else. So it's not like he is an investing genius. He craps on me for everything I do - the TV shows I watch, what I wear, the games I play, literally everything I am interested in. I have some stuffed animals that I love, my brother beats them up and abuses them.

I was really interested in stocks, but now I'm thinking that maybe he is right - I lost $10 on it already so maybe I don't know what I am doing. I thought I could be good at it if I try...",28Dec2020,1

112,"This year has been horrible! I have been feeling so lonely for the past months. I graduated this year and started a new job and have a promising career ahead of me but I feel so lonely. All my university friends have left for their home country. I have been single for almost 2 years now and have not been on a date for almost a year (thanks covid)! I really miss that physical and emotional touch of another human! Due to the pandemic, I have to work from home and cannot even interact with any of my colleagues! I cannot visit my family in my home country due to covid! It has all reached a point where this is greatly affecting my productivity in working. No one to talk to, no one to have a meal with, no one share my day with! Heck even the gyms are closed! It was the only think that kept me physically active! I wish this nightmare is over soon! Granted I am in a much better condition compared to millions others who have lost their loved ones or are unemployed but I still feel so fucked up and lonely",28Dec2020,1
113,"I’m an adult and I feel like I’ve never in my life been “normal”. I think there is something wrong with me and I’m terrified to find out what. I’m scared to find out because it makes me upset that no one ever tried to treat me for it.

I’ve always been leagues behind my peers academically and socially and I have never caught up. I’m an adult but I sure as fuck don’t feel like one. I don’t know how to be an adult  or act like an adult. I had severe social anxiety for 5 years and I think that has stunted me even further. I’ve really fucked up ly life and I feel so terribly lost now. I don’t have friends or a decent job. I work, it’s not great but it’s something. Everyone liked me there and tells me how I’m a hard worker and I’m like able but I feel like there is something that’s not right, that they aren’t saying. I can tell that I am cognitively slow. It makes me feel like I’mtheir per and not their equal. I have never been an equal",28Dec2020,1
