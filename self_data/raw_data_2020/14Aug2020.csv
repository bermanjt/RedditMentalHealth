0,"I‚Äôm so depressed lmao. Recently I was diagnosed with some other BS condition. 

Ok so a few years back I had a bunny. She was literally the cutest little fur ball in existence. Like she ate, pooped, and peed but it didn‚Äôt matter what she was doing, she ALWAYS looked cute asf doing it. Chewing up my lighting connector? Yup she looked cute. Pooping all over the house? Looked cute. Giving me the death glare? Fucking cute asf. Like how can you be mad if she looked cute asf? Etc. 

I went off to the military and including bring her. She got cancer during the beginning of corona so I couldn‚Äôt take leave to see her before üò≠ rip bunny.

Tbh now all I want is a bunny hopping around. That‚Äôs all I ask. Dude you know how cute she looked rubbing away while her little ears hopped up and down? Cutest shit I‚Äôve ever seen.",14Aug2020,1
1,"The thing about studying for hard tests and in bad circumstances is that it's always a task you're not ""willing"" to do, it's hard and uncomfortable and can push you on the edge. I study for a few hours but I always just reach a point where I feel like my mind isn't processing anything and it's like very tense and stressful to keep thinking about studying and the test and It isn't solved by a short break I usually need a bit of time to regulate my system and start studying again, but I just can't tell why I'm unable to challenge myself and tolerate the uncomfortable task of studying instead I always give in to having breaks until I feel mentally calm again",14Aug2020,1

5,"This is crossposted and I want as many people as possible to know this in case anything happens.

I still have 6 months on my lease and have had no issues until recently. My slumlord made advances towards me and I rejected him about two weeks ago. A few days later there was a armed home invasion at my house that involved three people and resulted in two completely wrecked exterior doors. Electronics, bassinet, and a few other things were taken. My landlord refused to pay upfront for the doors which was odd and possibly illegal but I managed to get the money to fix both doors. I informed my landlord that I got it taken care of and he said I could deduct the cost from next month's rent but seemed almost insulted that I didn't ""ask for his help"". A few days later my back door was broken into again. Nothing seemed to be missing but my fridge was pulled out and unplugged and pushed back into place. At this point I'm freaked out and make my second police report to the Detroit Police Department and go to my neighbors to ask if their cameras picked up anything. On one of them it showed my landlords car leaving the area but I thought nothing of it until I told him that I was able to get a hold of some footage from the neighbor that I turned over to the police to add to the report and he instantly got really angry and started yelling at me to ""get out"" and that I shouldn't have done that. Not even twenty minutes ago (today) my neighbor told me he had seen my landlord at my house earlier and questioned him as to who he was because I let all my neighbors know about the break ins. He pulled out a identification card that showed my address and told my neighbor he was my boyfriend and that my girls are his and SHOWED HIM A PICTURE OF MY BABIES PLAYING OUTSIDE. I'm not saying the break ins are connected to me rejecting him because honestly that is quite far fetched but I'm freaked out and I don't feel safe. He is obviously mentally unstable. I had my neighbor tell the police what my landlord said. I'm freaked out that his ID has my address. I can't afford new locks and I can't afford cameras and a alarm, even a cheap one. My gut is screaming at me to leave but I have no family and nowhere to go. Maybe I watch too many crime shows but I'm terrified and in fear for my life. What should I do! I'm dumbfounded over the whole situation. EDIT: The Detroit Police Department has all three incidents reported with footage and witness statements.",14Aug2020,1
6,"Quarantine has been absolute crap. I feel so alone, even though Ive been alone before that. My friends rarely talk to me unless I text them first, and it just makes me feel annoying. They have groupchats and cute zoom session together without me, and it just makes me really sad.

In reality this has been happening to me way before the pandemic, they always hung out together and I was always the backup friend. I feel like such a loser being upset about this but I can‚Äôt help but feel so replaceable and unwanted.

My relationship with my boyfriend is absolutely terrible right now. We barely talk anymore and he doesnt seem to care much about me anymore. I also realised how much manipulation and gaslighting was going on in our relationship and I just feel so defeated.

15,"Recently, I've been reflecting on my past relationships and I found that I have a light need for my partner to tell or show me who I am. The beginning of each relationship goes through a solid honeymoon phase and as things become more invested I start mirroring traits of the other person. I use the partner I'm with to help clarify and give me purpose and direction in almost all facets of my life. I recently broke up with my ex because he was emotionally unavailable and the relationship was very stressful for me. I've been really frusterated and confused and disappointed for a while now. 

I know it sounds cliche but I want to take this time now that I'm not in a relationship to focus on developing myself. I want to feel understood, have passions and hobbies, and get in touch with what's speacial to me so I can be an independent and healthier person. Has anyone felt like this before?

16,"I had a fight with my girlfriend (5 five years of relationshio), it was about something really stupid actually, she was mad about something all day, and I tried to understand why but she wouldn't tell me.. It was frustrating, she was clearly mad and kept telling me that she was only bored.. At 2am i had to go because I have to wake up early tomorrow, and as always I wrote to her and told her that I love her and she respond with a ""bye"". I know it may sound stupid, but we have this thing that we promised each other to never go to sleep mad without telling the other one why, and that every night we remind each other our affection with a simple ""I love you"".. I was also tired and stressed (I have two important exams next month and I am not able to study well this days) and so I snapped, and told her  that even I am mad often bcs of some things in my life , but I would never keep her stressed about it and most importantly I would never go to sleep without reassuring her that she is not the cause or without telling her a stupid ""I love you"".. I suffer from anxiety and she knows that, even these stupid fights keeps me wake at night.. She respond with ""I'm fine bye"" and didn't answer me back after that.. Now it's 4am, my heart is racing, I have stomach ache and I can't sleep.. I'm afraid I did something wrong, and also these last three days we fought about another stupid thing, and I am afraid that she would break up with me even if I have not any reason to think that.. I think my anxiety is making me think that but I can't help it, she broke up with me 2 years ago with a message for another fight, and I don't want to wake up tomorrow finding a message like that or that she blocked me like the last time..

I told him to meet at a park, at first we were sitting seven feet apart on a picnic table, we were talking about random stuff. I said I wish I could hug him, then he said that we can as long as no one finds out. So before we separated again for probably another few months, I hugged him then I burst out crying and he did too.

I don't care unless she actually has a  back and forth  conversation, which she is incapable of due to her  autism.

I  started ignoring her  texts hoping she would take the hint. She never  did and continued to  spam me with photos from her day.  The final straw  was when she had a  conversation with someone else that I found out  about. She was just  complaining about how her family is abusive while  refusing to do  anything to stop it. I deleted her everywhere and blocked  her. I have  not spoken to her since and it took her two months to  notice that I  disappeared. She has told mutual friends how hurt she is by this, but if  she was a true friend, she would have noticed sooner.

40,"I recently hooked up with a man that traumatized me deeply. He looked nothing like his Instagram pictures. His ass was soo big- it was bigger than mine and I have a large ass and also his ass was bigger compared to the rest of his body. It was like I was in bed with nicki minaj except it‚Äôs a dude that I‚Äôm not at all attracted to.
His dick was soooo tiny he clearly was self conscious about it to the point where he won‚Äôt show it to me. He just put the condom on facing away from me and only took his pants off when he was about to fuck me. He lasted 5 mins and that included the time he pulled out because he was getting close so he needed a little break until he can continue his sad thrusts. He also didn‚Äôt know where to put his dick in. He literally couldn‚Äôt find my pussy. 
It was so bad that after sex I just found it difficult to even look at him. 
He also had the audacity to ask for round 2 before he left my apartment. The thought that he could have spent the night over sleeping in the same bed as me disgusts me. 
I am angry because I‚Äôm wayyyyy too hot for him and it baffles me how he thinks he‚Äôs worthy of asking for a second round when I didn‚Äôt orgasm the first time we fucked and I‚Äôm also mad about the fact that he didn‚Äôt even try to make me cum. Like he is just yuck. What‚Äôs the point of his existence if he can‚Äôt even satisfy a woman? 1) he is not smart so clearly he won‚Äôt be useful to the economy. 2) he can‚Äôt have good sex so what‚Äôs really the point of his life?
If I could be Thanos, he‚Äôs definitely the one I‚Äôd make disappear with the snap of my fingers. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt feel the slightest bit of sadness if he got hit by a bus because at least no other girl needs to feel as traumatized as I did. 
I know I‚Äôm horrible human being for saying this and feel free to shout at me in the comments section but this feels so good to let out. And I honestly have no remorse in thinking the way I think. I honestly don‚Äôt understand the point of his existence.",14Aug2020,1
41,"There is just too much happening in life and I‚Äôm sorry for this being long. My mom for the past ten years has suffered 3 major health issues. First it was cancer, then it was a stroke 5 years later and now once again my mother has been going through another bout with cancer which thankfully she is crushing. At the time of her stroke, I was 15, and as I was completely dependent on her, her losing the ability to drive and be independent affected my life significantly. I love her and my dad so much and I would do absolutely anything for them, and because of that and because I really wanted to, I decided to commute for college to take care of my mom and help at home. I wasn‚Äôt with her when her stroke happened, and I never want that to ever happen again or not be in a position to help her or my dad.

Maybe I am alone in thinking this way but I don‚Äôt see my life out of the child parent relationship and I never have. It‚Äôs typical for teenagers to ‚Äòrebel‚Äô against their parents and as a young adult look forward to starting their own life but I have never done or felt either of those things. My family needs me, and I have never wanted to put them in a situation that is difficult because in my mind ‚Äúfocusing on your own life‚Äù is selfish but at the same time I also understand this is a normal part of life. I understand it for other people, but I just can‚Äôt see it for myself.

I‚Äôm currently 20, and I just don‚Äôt see myself being in any position to go out all the time, be in a relationship or honestly get married in the future. I don‚Äôt wanna fathom a reality where I have people who are equally as important in my life as my parents/family are. I know this might sound really stupid but this is just how I feel. I‚Äôm the youngest of four, and all my other siblings moved away for college, moved out, and have had relationships since they were young but personally I just don‚Äôt see myself doing that. I like certain aspects of those things, but there is just too many things I don‚Äôt like that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good thing for me. 

The reason I‚Äôm making this post is because I feel like I‚Äôm fucking up in many ways. My friendships in college have been extremely minimal and I have had practically no social life because I make it a point to go home immediately after classes. You know what a Saturday night has been for me in college? Watching TV and going out to dinner with my parents and sometimes my siblings when they come home. I love spending time with my family but I have honestly many times been jealous of my siblings‚Äô lives and those my age and definitely feel like I‚Äôm missing out on a lot. I know most of this is of my doing, but it‚Äôs so hard for me to think differently about all of this.

I never got to go to college at 17, a stupid divorce ruined my family and too too much of my parents' money and time, they didn't give a shit about preparing me. I applied myself, fucked up my financial aid, and ended up in too much debt after one semester and withdrew.

I tried again in 2017 but my mom got laid off her nursing job and my dad who had let his family keep the house suddenly evicted us. I bombed my college classes and ended up with a 1.08 GPA.

My family lived in a hotel for 3 years. Now that we're financially stable again my sister is getting sent off to college. Everything worked perfectly for her and I feel like a failure cursed to spend the rest of my life living with my parents and having 0 friends or achievements. My sister's life is pretty much perfect. She was too young to be ruinec by the same events that ruined my life.

My parents are mentally stifling and they make me feel like a stupid child. I really want to go back to college to get a degree and have an excuse to stay away from my parents. I literally want to move to another country just to see the world and have my own experiences. 
But my academic history is ruined.
I wish I could just leave it off since I didn't even go to college for 2 semesters combined and I still have debt.

This is so fucked up. I look 'stupid' in documents and on paper and I can't change anyone's opinion.  I feel like no college would let someone with these credentials in. I'm so embarrassed of myself.

69,"My elder sister was raised in a rather poor environment. My mother moved to find a job and eventually met my father and settled with him to raise me. Leaving my sister with our grandparents. I was raised well. I was given the right amount of discipline and affection. But when I turned 10 everything started going downhill. She started to pressure me into getting good grades, only talking to me when she needed something from me, constant arguing with my father, and threatening me that she'll kill herself if I don't be a good daughter. She even says everything in detail as if the thought was so vivid in her minds eye. It was terrifying. The only escape I had from her was the 2 week yearly vacation I get when I visit my grandparents (fathers side) for summer. I couldn't tell my dad or my grandparents about it because I was scared that they'd go their separate ways (they're not married). I was constantly walking on eggshells and I seriously just wanted to dissappear from that point on.

Eventually I ended up confiding to my sister about this and she told me that I was being over dramatic. I was raised with both my parents, I was favored by my grandparents, and I get to eat good food on a daily basis while she has to rely on the money my mother sends to her. What gave me the right to be sad about this?

My mother just sees me as a bridge between my father's money and my sister. I'm just a product in which she profits from. She now tells me everyday how much she loves my sister more than me and that if it weren't for her being broke she wouldn't have given birth to me. 

I just feel suffocated. Its all piling up and its dragging me under and I'm scared. The pressure of having to keep this all within myself so no family feuds would occur is slowly eating me up and I seriously want to grow up fast and escape from this damned country. I don't have the right to be sad because my father is foreign and everyone would shun be for talking shit about my mom because its considered disrespectful.

If I had the life my sister was in I'd be glad. Having a mother do anything for you is certainly one thing I could only dream of. It's as if she was some sort of Princess that was poor and will eventually find her happy ending while her evil stepsister is left to rot.

The watchlist involves spreading slander about me to the community with the goal to cut me off from the community. I was told before about the slander.

78,"I've recently realized that my family is pretty shit. On my mother's side; 

My grandfather was a thief who stole vehicles off trains and beats his new wife, or so I'm told as I have zero contact with him. 

My grandmother manipulates everyone around her for her benefit, she loves to be passive aggressive and instigate fights. This Easter I wasn't taking her shit anymore. I tried to leave the room she was in, but she blocked the exit. I walked through her, didn't lay a hand on her, but told her to move and moved her out of the way with my body weight. She tried to stop my by wrapping her hands around my neck, It didn't work. She then called the cops and answered ""i Won'T be BUlLiEd By MY GrANdSON ANY LOngER!"" as she realized how much of a fool she was making of herself, she quickly back tracked with the 911 operator and cancelled the call. Because she's unable to take responsibility for her actions, she put the blamed my 14y/o sister for starting the fight, to which she was just a innocent, crying, bystander. 

My one aunt is ignorant to the fact she's almost definitely a psychopath, when I was a kid, her daughter/my cousin, and my sister wanted to watch their favourite Christmas movie before bed on Christmas eve, they took a little too long finding it, my aunt comes in and just snaps yelling ""WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!"" my cousin tries to explain herself, but my aunt isn't having it- my aunt grabs my cousin by the neck and slams her onto the bed behind her, telling her they're going to bed right now. Apparently she's not much better now. My sister and cousin maintain a relationship as much as they can but my aunt has sworn off the rest of us.

My mother met this man 12 years ago who helped pull her, my 2 sisters and I out of poverty, buy a house and then buy an acreage. He was a great man. A man I really see as a father figure. My mother gave him up 4 years ago for than man she has today‚Äî A meth head. And they frequently fight, break up, and get back together. And my poor 14 y/o sister deals with it by herself as my 19y/o sister and I left the house as we were old enough.

My father left before I was born. He's come in and out of my life. But essentially he's still a dead beat. The first time I saw his true colors were when I invited him to stay at my house for a week. He stayed for a month. He peer pressured my girlfriend to do coke. He tried to teach me how to get away with drinking and driving. He fucked my friends, got one pregnant, stole from the other's mom. I kicked him out of my house and life.

I don't have any sort of relationship with his family. Nor do I have any relationship with my maternal extended family.

Now I'm thinking about making my girlfriend, my wife, and realized if I do, I don't want my family there. Maybe the other aunt and uncle I haven't mentioned because they're pretty okay, probably because they distanced themselves from the rest of us.

Seeing and hearing all the great memories my girlfriend has with her family makes me wish the memories of mine were happy and plentiful. But when I think of the memories I have of them, I just feel shame and embarrassment.

I wish I had a different family.",14Aug2020,1

Last year our 5th grade teacher set up a reunion on Facebook because we were graduating high school. We were all so happy being back at our old school talking with old friends and playing on a playground far too small for us. My old crush had said she was happy because it had been her favorite class. Yesterday that same teacher posted a notice that someone (She didn‚Äôt mention who) was having a car wash fundraiser for her and I ignored it.

85,"Yes, the first thing I did after the drive through incident was message my therapist and tell her the whole story. I have focused a lot on my own mistakes and failures in therapy. It seems like you want to believe that the reason my therapist takes a negative view of you is that I have not been upfront about my own failings, but that is not the case. And I told the two people in my life I trust to respond compassionately to me sharing my mistakes the next day to talk it over. I am more self aware than you seem to think. If that was a ""wtf"" hand gesture, it was ""wtf am I doing? This is pointless."" I am genuinely sorry that the gesture was hurtful to you. Also genuinely sorry that I was wrong about you having blocked my number and I wasn't venting to a wall like I thought I was.

Back in July, we were both asking for what we needed to keep ourselves out of resentment. But the needs we were expressing were not compatible. If we couldn't find a compromise, resentment on at least one side was inevitable. I was trying to find that compromise.  Admittedly I made many grave errors in the way I went about it. There are a lot of specific things I would do differently, but I would still try to find that compromise to save our friendship. I could have followed exactly what you asked for and been the only one left in resentment. But I had already tried that, and it had left me in 5 weeks of misery which was made worse knowing that you thought everything was just fine. It hurts that our friendship apparently wasn't worth compromising for to you. I think we could have found a compromise if you were willing to try, and had a beautiful friendship going forward and untainted happy memories as more than friends.

From your perspective, I am not someone you can trust not to push your boundaries, and that is not someone you want in your life. From my perspective, you are not someone I can trust to give a enough of a damn about the fact your choices caused me deep pain to want try to make it right, and that is not someone I want in my life.

I immediately got upset about if and I went to my team leader and assistant manager and refused to take their food to them I wanted them kicked out but my team leader wouldn't coz he said I can't be sure they were making fun of me. later on I had to check the toilets and I walked upstairs to girls toilets and the door open and it was them girls I looked up and the girl that laughed earlier smiled at me, and I overheard the blonde saying whys a boy going in girls toilet and walked past me as normal. They were pleasant looking girls tbh",14Aug2020,1
88,"Yes, the first thing I did after the drive through incident was message my therapist and tell her the whole story. I have focused a lot on my own mistakes and failures in therapy. It seems like you want to believe that the reason my therapist takes a negative view of you is that I have not been upfront about my own failings, but that is not the case. And I callecd the two people in my life I trust to respond compassionately to me sharing my mistakes the next day to talk it over. I am more self aware than you seem to think. If that was a ""wtf"" hand gesture, it was ""wtf am I doing? This is pointless."" I am genuinely sorry that the gesture was hurtful to you. Also genuinely sorry that I made the incorrect assumption that you didn't respond to my question in July because you had blocked my number and I wasn't venting to a wall like I thought I was night before last.

Back in July, we were both asking for what we needed to keep ourselves out of resentment. But the needs we were expressing were not compatible. If we couldn't find a compromise, resentment on at least one side was inevitable. I was trying to find that compromise. Admittedly I made many grave errors in the way I went about it. There are a lot of specific things I would do differently, but I would still try to find that compromise to save our friendship. I could have followed exactly what you asked for and been the only one left in resentment. But I had already tried that, and it had left me in 5 weeks of misery which was made worse knowing that you thought everything was just fine. It hurts that our friendship apparently wasn't worth compromising for to you. I think we could have found a compromise if you were willing to try, and had a beautiful friendship going forward and untainted happy memories as more than friends.

From your perspective, I am not someone you can trust not to push your boundaries, and that is not someone you want in your life. From my perspective, you are not someone I can trust to give enough of a damn about the fact your choices caused me deep pain to want try to make it right, and that is not someone I want in my life.

90,"I told my mother I need to stop talking to her for a while. I was very angry she witnessed my abuse and did nothing.

Nevertheless, she called me several times. Today she called me yet again and asked for help with her phone. At first, I refused and suggested to ask my abusive elder brother who still lives in the same apartment.

Then I felt guilty, called her back and explained what I could. It's not enough. She can't share her screen to me, I can't tell her where to tap. The brother refused to help.

After a few minutes the whole thing happened again. She needs help, I try, it's not enough.

I feel bad. I'm a bad daughter for not trying to help right away the first time. I'm a bad person for not standing up for myself and talking to her. I'm also a bad daughter because I couldn't help her fully. I'm probably a bad person for blaming my brother.

91,"I'm a 24 year old male and ever since this virus hit I've crashed so hard.

I used to do Thai Boxing 4+ times a week and eat clean etc etc. I used to have sex with my partner. I used to see friends. 

But lately, man.... I've crashed harder than i thought I would. 

I still live with my dad who's out all day so I am alone a lot especially while working from home. Only child so no one else to speak to other than my partner and we aren't on the best of terms due to me having pretty much no sex drive. I essentially live in one room. 

I've broken down a few times over the past few months and my mental health is all over the place. I ran a 5k yesterday but today i don't even want to leave the house. I have the comfort of gaming (which I'm probably addicted to) that i keep going back to. I'm usually a pretty disciplined person but that's all went totally out the window the laat few months.  I've actually started skipping meals because I've kind of stopped getting hungry. 

I feel like shit for my partner because I'm a total blank canvas right now. 
I have no family other than my mum to speak to, I'm so lonely i need a family of my own. 

Me and my parter were due to travel Australia and South East Asia for 6 months on May 4th this year. We were FIVE WEEKS away from the date and then this all happened. 

I can't stop my mind from thinking at a million miles an hour. I'm a very deep thinking person and love to research things but in conversation and person I'm pretty default. If i could just get out of my own head for a while it would be nice.

This isn't normal and i don't know what to do about it. I know people say eat well, get enough sleep, exercise (the doc said that when i went to them. Granted this was before i started serious cardio via Thai Boxing) , as I said I was doing all of that and then some before but depression shows you what you need to do and just stops you doing it. I literally sit in silence by myself sometimes because my mind is going too fast for me but at the same time it's absolutely empty.

None of this probably makes any sense but i just had to speak. I tried to explain it to my partner when i was broken in tears but she will never understand.

I'm sorry.",14Aug2020,1

102,"After trying LSD for the first time, I could finally speak clearly again, retain thoughts and ideas for more than a few seconds, and generally understand the root cause of different types of things, whether it was why the lake flowed in a particular way due to underwater channels, or why so many of my relationships had fallen apart lately.

At this point in time, there's nothing that'll put me back ""on track"", and, prevent me from killing myself one day, next week, next month, five years from now, who knows, but, the level of clarity that I attained from trying a very, very low dose of LSD was just, liberating in so many ways.

I didn't experience grandiose hallucinations or anything, you could just tell that things were subtly, off, and it was really interesting in a variety of ways. Things were just, subtly weird, and it helped me make sense of the sheer deluge of information that my mind is hammered with each, and every day.

At this point in my life, I finally consider myself disabled, and after so many things have happened as of late, including being raped, blackmailed, extorted, being falsely accused of and prosecuted for sexual assault because I didn't want to marry someone after a month of dating them, being promoted to senior software engineer, making a lateral move from software engineering to an interesting research domain, watching my body degrade from years of neglect, announcing my research, and hearing that it was well-received, nearly being stabbed by a suicidal ex-partner as they were experiencing a psychotic break, and then repeatedly hospitalizing that ex-partner each time they tried to kill themselves or turn the lights off for a while with prescription drugs and ludicrous amounts of alcohol it was just, nice for all of that stress to melt away.

I can't underscore how poor my mental health is right now, and, honestly, how badly I wish that I could just end it all, but, at the same time, I can't underscore how freeing it was to have all of that stress just, melt away.

I could finally think again, and, honestly, until you lose your ability to think, and communicate clearly, no matter how hard you try to, it's tremendously difficult to articulate how liberating it felt to be able to speak clearly again, and hold complex thoughts for more than a few seconds.

It was like a throwback to before I was burdened by all of these cognitive impairments, and my ADHD and/or autistic traits began to shine through, and take over my life, and sadly, my executive function.

One day, it'll all be over, for better, or for worse - only time will tell, though.

I'll either give up, and be gone without so much as a moment's notice sometime next week, or, I'll write an interesting autobiography in my golden years, and nobody will believe everything that's happened ever since I moved to the big city.

Trying LSD for the first time allowed me to finally quiet down the roar of my thoughts, self-doubts, and what some people refer to as their inner monologue, even though mine's been mute for years, and just, focus on the here, and now for once.

112,"First I want to start off by saying that I have anxiety and depression, have gone through lots of counseling and am on meds for depression. Regardless I still feel like I‚Äôm not doing enough to be better for myself, my family, and my boyfriend. 

My family have tried to be understanding, and I love them for that, I know I‚Äôm not alone. But sometimes they get angry when I‚Äôm feeling anxious or depressed and I feel horrible for burdening them with my sadness and worries. 

The bigger issue is when it comes to my boyfriend. Quarantine has been difficult for me and this whole year has sucked. First my dog passed away, and then the next day we were all told to quarantine, I had to move back home from the university town I was living in, which meant I had to be 30 minutes away from my boyfriend for 6 weeks without seeing him. And then when we finally got back together again it started to feel as though I was getting lower and lower on his priority list. And I know I‚Äôm in the wrong here because I‚Äôm clingy and I need to find happiness in things other than the relationship and I try to. But every time he cancels plans to take another shift at work or because his parents said he has to do something else (he‚Äôs 21 but he lives at home so he has to respect their wishes) it feels like I‚Äôm just not important enough. Another issue is having to go to his house constantly because he has to take care of his 12 year old brother so I don‚Äôt get to be at my house where I‚Äôm comfortable very often because I value seeing him above my own comfort. At this point I feel I should just go along with everything and be on his time. 

The problem is that today I finally said that I‚Äôm tired of him taking shifts and canceling our plans and having to go to his all the time and sometimes not see my parents in days when he can see his all the time. And he got mad and said he won‚Äôt contact me until he‚Äôs home from work. So now I feel horrible and I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have expressed my feelings. Just like with my parents it just ruins everything.

I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, I just have no idea who I can talk to right now and I just needed to get this off my chest. If anyone has any advice on how I can be a better person then I would be happy to hear it.",14Aug2020,1

I'm here to tell you, most of the people fetishizing being alone would not last a week, much less years of it. 

I wish there was a machine that could switch people's ability to connect with others off temporarily. It would dramatically improve people's perceptions of each other. There would be way less nitpicking of every little thing somebody does to annoy you.

Just be thankful you can form meaningful connections with people, ok? Appreciate the people in your life who love you and support you. Whether you want to admit it or not they have helped shape who you are. Stop going out and looking for petty reasons to dislike them.

115,"I‚Äôm about to enter into my final semester of my MSW program. I looked through all the student loans I have used throughout my time in undergrad and graduate school recently and I‚Äôve never felt so sick in my life. 

After looking at the total amount I realize now I am a total fucking idiot. Why did I do this to myself? Even with a masters degree, the average salary for a social worker is still so low. But it doesn‚Äôt even matter because I‚Äôm sure there hundreds of social worker applicants way more qualified than me. Do I even stand a chance? 

During my masters, I worked full time at a foster care agency, went to classes, did my internship at a rape crisis center 25 hours a week. I sacrificed a lot. So many all nighters for too many papers. So much anxiety and too many panic attacks. I‚Äôm beginning to ask myself if it was worth it?

I chose this career because all I want to do is help people. I‚Äôve gone through trauma myself and I never want anyone to feel the way that I did. To feel hopeless and alone. I want to advocate for the voiceless. Fight for any unjust they‚Äôve experienced. Show them their life has purpose. Show them they are worthy. And no matter what, they never have to go through anything alone. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get to do that now. I thought I had a bright and prosperous future. Reality has set in and it looks like my future is giving most of my earnings back to my student loans all while living paycheck to paycheck.

I can‚Äôt bring kids into this world if I‚Äôm not doing well financially. I‚Äôll never get to have a life anymore. I‚Äôll never see the world like I had always planned to.

127,"Trying to get over a guy. I'm doing good, better than expected. 

I went to the store today and I noticed this clerk I used to find attractive last year. And he seemed to always notice me. Lots of eye contact and awkward tension, you get the picture.

Something interesting happened. Today when I saw the clerk, I got nervous again, like old times. It's been a while since I felt that way about someone else.

When I sat in the car I felt happy, relieved. Why? Because this mild crush got seemingly reignited. I took this as a sign of progress in my journey in getting over the other guy. I don't care about this crush nor do I want anything from him, he's got a girlfriend. I was just happy that I felt attracted again to another man. 

This entire year I did not give a single shit about any other guy I ever came across. Not even on a superficial level. All I could think of, was the guy I'm trying to get over now. My heart was filled with him. And now that has changed. I can like someone else again. He's in the past. 

Or so I thought.

Later that day, I stupidly decided to listen to some old voicenotes. My heart started filling up with affection for him again. Flutters. His voice was beautiful and I loved hearing him talk. His kind voice and  softspokenness do not at all reflect the shit person he actually was.

I work 40 hours a week and sometimes I want an extra day off so I give up my shift, only to have her mad at me about the extra money I could be making. She has complete control over my savings account and checks my purchases regularly. Every time I want to do something she had this way of suggesting whatever she wants me to do, not encourage me to try my best. Everything I do has to be her way, I have little to no free will to make my own decisions. She still tracks my phone as I‚Äôm entering my 2nd year of college. I want to just pack up and move across the country without a second glance but I feel like that would fuck everything up worse for me. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.",14Aug2020,1
