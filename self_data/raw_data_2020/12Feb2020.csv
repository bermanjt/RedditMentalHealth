0,"I'm not sure if anyone will bother reading this, or if this is the right sub (I can't find/think of any subs that would suit this better) But I just needed somewhere to let my thoughts out. I'm not asking for pity, compliments, ""I love you so much!"" messages etc.
I've always been insecure, from maybe 6yrs? Everything about me is disgusting. My hair, my skin, the way I act is pathetic. My hair has SO much dandruff- I can shake it for hours and stuff'll still fall out. Whenever there's sunlight, and I adjust my hair, dust/dandruff falls out of it like a mop. I swear everyone can see it. It's also super frizzy and poofy, and I without-a-doubt have some of the worst hair out of all the people I know. Whenever I try to add or change hair products I use, it just keeps getting worse, and I'm not sure if I'm washing it too much or too little, or if I'm using the right amount of product blah blah blah. 
My hairline? Was messy, so my dumbass tried to fucking shave it a bit to clear it up and oh god... no. Now I have to wait a year for the crap to grow out! 

My skin has thank god started to clear up a little, but now its oily AND flaky dry simultaneously. My arms and knees are black, and my hands and feet have dark patches; and they're really ugly. Do I need to scrub myself raw everytime I shower?

I have a lazy eye, and can't take pictures of myself without it being obvious. I also have slightly lower eyebags than normal that are genetic. My nose is short and a bit wide and in dull lighting it looks like I have a snobbed tip? My side profile is a quaking duck; my lips look so fat. I can't afford braces. I'm stuck with such gappy lower teeth. I live with a super stinky sister, and I'm scared her scent's rubbing onto me without me realising. I avoid hugs, walking past people or getting close as much as possible and it's so annoying! I'm waiting for the day someone calls me smelly, and for me to just shrivel into a corner. I want to feel comfortable with being intimate, but I just can't imagine myself ever being not insecure about the way I smell

It's so hard for me to change around other people, too. I have bacne, and trying to keep a shirt balanced on my shoulders (to hide acne marks) whilst trying to put on another shirt always gets me wanting to die; I swear people are watching me when I dress - someone watched me a month ago and said I was like a worm aha.. My boobs? What boobs? I am, again, one of the unfortunate ones blessed with nada. I always keep my arms to my chest to cover it up so people don't see how flat I am.

I'm a huge introvert. I find it hard to enjoy another person's company, and I absolutely suck at trying to hold an enthusiastic conversation. My mind is blank half the time so I don't know what to respond with, so I just smile a bit, laugh and say 'yeah!' God, I feel so dull when I do that. I'm the quietest in my group, and I have nothing exciting to say. I can't even stand still in a crowd without looking/feeling uncomfortable. Do I look relaxed? Tense? Am I slumping too much? Not enough? Did I say it enthusiastically enough? Wait, did it sound sarcastic instead?

I wish I felt comfortable in my own body, and around other people. I wish the only thing I cared about was school and friends, but here I am, worrying over absolutely jack shit. I hate being so sensitive, and overthinking everything. I hate it so much. I can't enjoy my life if I'm so uncomfortable with it all. I cry at least twice every single day because of my body, and the way I act. It bothers me so much and nothing I've done for the past 6 years has done anything to make me better. I'm scared it's going to become too overwhelming soon, and that I won't be able to take it anymore. 

*if you read it all, thank you so much. I know you're a complete stranger to me, but knowing that at least someone in this world heard me is enough. Thanks ❤",12Feb2020,1

2,"I am a fairy new driver (5 months passed), I have recently moved into a new area and no longer have my driveway. 

I have come home from work this evening and the only space left to parallel park was next to this big van and another car. It took me a while but I got it in there eventually. 

Now I can't help but wonder if there was a reason no one else parked next to the van? Maybe because it needs more room to move off? Am I blocking it in? Am I gonna end up with a squashed car in the morning? 

Any advice appreciated! 

Thank you!",12Feb2020,1
3,"I can’t do anything right, and I wish I just wouldn’t have to deal with any of this anymore. I recently had midterm exams at school and did really bad on those (like, I got a D on one of them and only because the teacher decided to be nice and give me half credit on one of the open response questions). 

Last school year I had started spiraling downwards (due to depression), but my friends were there for me to help me stay up, and I felt so, so happy that I had finally found true friends who would stay by my side no matter how dark things were. But now, none of them like me anymore. They all have some type of issue with me. Most of them have given up and have cut me out of their lives, accusing me of “manipulating” and “guilting” them. I try to ask why, but they just say that they’ve explained it before (which they haven’t) and that I take their words too literally and make them cautious of their word choice, which they don’t like. (But seriously though, if someone calls you manipulative, what else could it mean besides manipulative? It’s a pretty strong and straightforward word). They say that there were many things that they can’t remember, but made them feel manipulated. But like, I don’t even know. Obviously I did something wrong. They also say I’m annoying, frustrating, and that they’ve given up on caring. They call me an “attention seeker” and that no one wants to hang out with me because I “always want to be the center of attention”. 

I’m so bad at friendships, and I hurt other people too much. And I don’t even know what I did or how to fix it, no matter how hard I think. I just know all these adjectives, but I don’t know what the actions were. 

My parents don’t “believe” in depression and got mad when my doctor tried to prescribe me antidepressants. I honestly don’t care about that, but what I AM impacted by is that they’ve made me stop going to the therapist. I’m 16 so I can’t even go without them knowing. And I can’t talk to the adjustment counselor at school anymore either. One of my friends was telling me about how I’m an attention seeker, and how many people agree with her, and she mentioned that the adjustment counselor had said that about me as well. But when I had talked to her about all this myself, she told me it didn’t seem at all like I was an attention seeker. I just have no idea how to trust her. 

I can’t keep my grades up, I can’t trust anyone, and like, no matter how hard I try, I just can’t be happy. How am I supposed to go to a good college and be able to get a job and make a living? My social skills suck, so how am I gonna fall in love one day? No one would ever like me, let alone love me. And I don’t want to be stuck in this stupid deep dark pit anymore. I’ve had enough, and it hurts too much. I wanna give up. I don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to be selfish and hurt people around me by leaving, but honestly I think they’d be better off. I want to do this for myself. But I don’t know what to do...

If anyone actually reads through all this, thank you so much for listening to me. I really appreciate it.",12Feb2020,1

You don't deserve to have to come home straight from work to cook dinner and then get your kiddo ready for bed while he was home all day doing less than the bare minimum and throwing a tantrum because you're too tired to stay awake past 10pm.. You don't deserve to be bitched at because you're putting your career, child and mental well-being before sex.

7,"I am not here to argue the existence of a god; there is no meaning in doing so. Anything that exists will tend to fill things that are empty. Therefore, this applies to the human conscience. The human conscience has been forced to create an ideology of a ‘greater being’ in order to fill the contemporary lack of meaning of the universe. Maybe that’s what the ‘greater being’ intended for us to do. I don’t know. But what if the universe has no extraordinary purpose? Why does it need one? It doesn’t. I’m sure that now, and for a much longer time, we won’t be able to conceptualize the meaning of nothing. Entropy is allowed to die and there is absolutely nothing to be upset about. It was, by law, optimally used. Let the universe take it’s course. There’s no point in trying to change the future if the end will remain the same. Sure, things like the pursuit of happiness are exceptions, because they are ultimately negligible. 

The negative connotation of meaningless is should be eliminated. It should remain neutral because once all is said and done, existence is meaningless. There are relative goals, but there is no final goal. Accept it for what it is.

I’m open to civil debates or anything thoughts you would like to add. I beg you to not comment anything that will deter the main focus of this. Write Away!",12Feb2020,1

9,"I've graduated college in December of 2018 and spent 2019 attempting to be hired for a trainee position for my state.  Around the last third of the year I interviewed in front of a board of eleven state park managers.  I thought the interview went well but over a month later I found out that they were looking for someone with more experience which confused me for a trainee position.  I've since turned my sights on the Federal level but I'm worried about wasting more time than I have to.

I ended school with a degree in environmental studies and did volunteer work at the Flight 93 Memorial during my last semester.  I'm considering joining a branch of the military to increase my chances despite it not being what I want in the long run. I can also join a park ranger academy but that may be a lot of time and money for something that isn't guaranteed to land me a position.

I would be appreciative of any thoughts or advice and I can elaborate on my situation if need be.

Thank you",12Feb2020,1

14,"Since my grandma got diagnosed with breast cancer early last month, my life has kinda been flipped upside down. My grandpa has alzheimer's too so that household needs A LOT of help, which I'm happy to provide, but I've literally been the busiest I've ever been in my life these past few weeks and just emotionally drained on top of that, given my grandma's diagnosis. So I've kinda ghosted many of my friends and completely forgot about things I said I'd do. There have been multiple days where I haven't had time to be on the computer, let alone sit down to do this or that.

I have a few writing friends online, both for fanfiction and original fiction, we read and give feedback for each others stories. I just realized yesterday I told a friend over a month ago I'd review their fic but haven't. I finally messaged her and apologized for disappearing but I was vague because I don't know how to explain my situation without sounding like I'm trying to one-up them or get pity. We do share things about our personal lives but for some reason it just makes me feel icky.",12Feb2020,1
15,"So today I was going to go out with my dad and do some shopping, before we left there was this elderly man with his just as old dog walking to the vet, he asked if he could have some water for his dog. So we have the dog some water and we have him some water and then when he told us where he was going we decided to give him a lift. (it’s Australia, the heat was too much for an old man and his dog)

So we follow the directions he gives us, there’s no vet. So we google map the closest one and take him, we go and do some shopping and come back to pick him up.

(sad warning, the story goes down hill)

When we get there the vet tells us the dog has cancer of the stomach and rump and has internal bleeding and needs to be put down. However, there’s no one else there for the old man. So we take him home and try to find some family that can be with him. While my dad was talking on the phone with the family, he showed me all his old school photographs and told me how his father was in WW1.

We’re currently waiting out the front of his house for some family to arrive so we’re not leaving him all alone.

He’s got a foggy memory, most likely shouldn’t be left alone and forgot where his dog was and why we were here.

It turns out the vet he usually goes to is in the complete opposite direction to where he was walking, and would’ve taken him around an hour, maybe more.

I feel very overwhelmed by this whole experience to be entirely honest, and I really do hope he does ok.",12Feb2020,1
16,"About a year and a half ago I went out on a whim and applied to my favourite music/record store where I’ve always received impeccable customer service and smiles. I customized the outside border of my my resume with hand drawn characters from movies I enjoyed and album covers from music I’d bought from the store. This landed me a interview, which (despite my nerves) I thought went really well.  For the first time in my life, I was very open and honest in the interview, feeling able to talk normally and unrehearsed, even feeling heard by my potential employer. Being an introvert, this was a huge leap forward for me - trying to display who I really was in this interview and trying to talk a little bit about myself was really challenging for me but I did it and it felt good. I left feeling fairly confident. 

A few days pass and I get a call from the store and practically leap for joy. When I answer I hear the bad news that they regret to inform me that they chose someone else for the position. I’m sure they could hear my heart break from the other side of the quiet line. I thanked them for their time and opportunity and hung up. I closed my bedroom door and just cried and cried. 

Something in me felt very defeated. Someone else was better, better than my very best and honest self. 

I cried until I decided I should try to take my mind off it. I packed a backpack with
a few things: notebook alcohol sitting blanket hunters knife ukulele) and biked into one of my favourite recluse spots in the forest: 
The end of the trail.

This trail was very long, along the edge of a waterfront. It was rare that anyone ever got to the very end because
It was a dead end kind of island and every direction was water) 

I played some ukulele and cried there for a while and mourned an opportunity lost. This is something very rare for me: allowing myself to mourn and be sad. Usually I hold it in and it just burdens me forever. 

Suddenly my cries were interrupted by a strange sound comming from behind me in the forest. I instantly swung around to see a Canadian goose flapping its wings but couldn’t get off the ground. It had heard my cries and been silent for at least fifteen minutes. The goose seemed to be in distress and I was a little scared to approach it. Upon closer inspection it’s feet were incredibly tangled with fishing wire. I knew I had to do something. So I got some water and put it in a wendies fry cup that was thrown near by. This poor goose must’ve been there for a while because despite its fear of me and going wild, it settled down and drank the water. I sat and sang to it for a few minutes until it looked as comfortable as a tied goose could possibly look. So I took my hunters knife and cut the goose as close as I could to his feet. He started walking around instantly and wanted to get away. I could still see some line dangling from his feet and I was concerned he would snag it on something else so I had to chase him around a bit to get the strand left. He eventually made it to the waters edge and swam out as I watched him go. I stayed until dusk and didn’t see anyone else come down the path.

It really really made me feel better. I felt like I had purpose. I felt like I wasn’t meant to get that job so I’d be able to save that goose.",12Feb2020,1

20,"Basically,’I’m 17 and in my junior year of high school. And now is when everyone is starting to ask me - what do you want to do with your life? I don’t know! Well, let me rephrase. See, I’m a dreamer. I have all these big dreams for my life, which aren’t realistic, like being a musician, an actress, a composer, a writer, a move producer - but that’s all they are. Dreams. They aren’t realistic, even I know this. I’ve never tried to act before, pretty much all my stories suck, and I’ve never composed any serious music. I’m scared to try stuff, I just dream instead. I don’t know. I love creating, I love coming up with worlds and characters and scenarios. Honestly, I just LOVE movies. Like, I really do. I mean, my love for movies started recently, but my entire family discouraged me. My mom says I should go be a bet, get a stable lifestyle, then, if it’s possible, I should go and try to be a script writer, which is the one thing I’m seriously considering. But something about that is just not appealing. I want to graduate and go straight to college, and get into my career as soon as possible. Unfortunately, that’s not very realistic.

My parents dragged me home and it felt like i had no motivation, and no desire to really work towards a future. well that got boring fast especially since i was flat ass broke. 

I some how pulled together some motivation and enough pressure from my family to get a job. I got a pretty shitty retail position that took everything out of me. The customers literally bullied you everyday all day. (think customer service for a giant tech company..) I finally felt that i deserved more, i deserved to figure a future i was happy with. 

After a year of working terrible retail, I had one interview for an internship that paid less than my retail job but it felt right. And it was, i got offered the internship at the end of interview. I worked my ass off during that internship i mean being the first one to the office and the last to leave.

6 months into the internship they offered me a full time position with competitive pay and I accepted immediately. Since then I pressured them to allow me to design a diagnostic product.

26,"So I say ""undiagnosed depression"" because, even though I have seen a therapist, she couldn't diagnose it because I ""never showed any signs"". But everyone in my life can see it and it's been obvious that I have anxiety since I was a teenager. My therapist also brought up that I reminded her a lot of her son, who's high functioning autistic and when I brought that up with my wife, one of my closest friends and siblings, they all said that they could see it. I always try to stay positive, because my life has been R-Rated movie levels of shit, and letting my anger and sadness show never helped. I've had more breakdowns in the past couple years than I've had throughout all my teenage years and the worst part about that is that my life is actually really good right now, aside from a few physical ailments. I've got a job that pays well enough that my wife can stay home and take care of our son, all our bills are taken care of and we're able to float by with relative ease...

... But my depression is starting to kick my ass, I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, and the thought that having even high functioning autism and not knowing it could have made my entire life worse, and even now really sets my anxiety/depression off. I'm planning on going back to therapy and seeing about being tested for autism, however that works, but even once I do get diagnosed, and even if I am autistic, WTH am I supposed to do with that?

I’m honestly ecstatic when two people say they want to join a  tournament because that’s honestly plenty of people for a competitive scene. However, I’m getting scared that I’ll lose these people. Everyone’s been getting quiet and distant recently which is makes me think they’re dropping the game. I’ve been trying to make the community as fun as possible and as rewarding as I could make it but very few people are interested.

I’ve been getting really down about it and it’s something that I take very personally. I feel as though I’ve failed to engage or entertain the people or that I’ve disappointed them. Maybe I have a control problem, who knows? At any rate, it’s an intense feeling. A very intense sadness and doubt that kills me.

41,"Long story short, Me and my babysitter were both playing around, and running around the house laughing and stuff and playing very rough and stuff. And I thought it would be a great idea to tell her something like we had cookies inside this super small closet that was rarely used. And well... She fell for it. and she began following me, and once we were there, I told her to go right inside and that they should be near the entrance behind her on the shelf.

Once she actually went inside, I quickly grabbed the knob and threw the door shut and threw a door-blocker underneath it. Once she attempted to get it open a few times and hardly made any progress, I could hear her breathing heavily and start aggressively trying to force the door open, while still breathing rapidly. I ended up getting scared because for my imagination went wild with stuff, and I ran off while she still struggled.

It took me at least a minute to come back and open the door for her. I was terrified and I felt so much regret at the same time and I was rapidly apologizing to her. She ended up staring at me for a really long time. Like actually death staring me without blinking or moving with her eyes locked onto me in a blank expression, before telling me something like ""How would you like it if I did that to you?"" in a calm manner.

I had no idea what to do or say, besides that I was sorry and she only walked past me without saying anything.

I think she was claustrophobic. Very.",12Feb2020,1

I was diagnosed with ASD as an adult after my dad told me he was pretty sure I was autistic and my mom didn’t want to accept it because she was embarrassed. I talked to my family and they all apparently knew he had said it already and were pissed off and denied it. My whole life my family has been putting me down (which for the longest time I thought was normally how people treated each other) for what are in retrospect the symptoms of my autism and made me feel worthless growing up. I was otherwise pretty much ignored by my family. My brother used to constantly upset me to the point where I would have a meltdown which, again in retrospect was a symptom of my autism. I got bullied relentlessly in school and I didn’t realize that that wasn’t normal and my mom always made me feel terrible for crying about it and later confessed she knew I was being bullied and didn’t do anything about it because she thought it would hurt me. Wtf? How is it better to let me be bullied? She’s always telling me I’m not autistic and that I’m just stubborn, stupid, selfish, an asshole, etc. Nobody in my family does anything on my birthday or gives me any gifts, and the only time my mom does something like lunch or dinner on my birthday she always gets pissed off if I’m not smiling enough and calls me ungrateful. Every time in the past I tried talking about my problems with someone in my family it’s always that “I haven’t dealt with anything” or that I’m spoiled and they get pissed off at me for being depressed. One time my brother told me that I should stop talking about killing myself and just kill myself if I’m gonna do it. I feel like they just hate me and think I’m a burden. I’m working really hard in college to get a 4.0 so I can get a job and move out but my social anxiety is so bad it’s really hard for me to interview or meet people and the only work I’ve done is unpaid internships that never end with a job.

46,"Hey, I usually I would be trying to make you think positive but I can't in this situation, I feel the same but never let it out on posts and on social media, and I'm not going to lie and say that I've overcome it somehow and you should also overcome it, cause I felt the same way 5 years ago and that was when I was 6, and up to now I can't find a way to cure the sadness and sometimes I try to find online tests if I have depression or not, this sounds cheesy and too *fake*, but believe this if you want to and don't if you don't believe me but I hope you believe in me. I felt like I was adopted, I wrote newsletters about a child being illegally adopted at the age of 8, I threatened my sister and family somehow by holding a knife's blade point at my heart and trying to stab myself, when I was 8 and up until about 9, I would have a kitchen knife in my wardrobe. This may be different from your story and life but the last part is the same, the temptation of suicide. I started trying to commit suicide in front of people or alone before I even knew the word suicide, and even at the rare happy times the thought of my past comes back to me and each time there are happy moments, they just turn to the saddest moments. Having an argument with one of my family members makes me randomly cry and lock myself up in my room, sometimes I skip meals and don't eat until the next day, sometimes I start crying and writing how I feel in the library corner when I'm at school, but if I say a word about this to my parents or any of my family members then let me guess, I'll have to stay away from going outside or to anyone for 2 months, I'll get banned from going on *any* devices for a month? I feel like social media's taking care of me more than my parents are, I actually feel faint love coming from Reddit, the love that I don't feel from my family, and that faint love is a full heart if you compare it to the love my family's giving me, I'de rather not share anymore, people will start thinking this is fake and I only want it for fame or whatever but believe what you want to believe, I'm not going to force you to believe.

I'm just trying to find someone who feels the same and I feel like I found someone, I'm usually the one who's helping people with being positive, a way of trying to calm myself down, I hope you feel better by hearing this, and I feel better by reading this post, good luck, and that's all I can give you in this state. I thought a few days ago that I had to stop thinking about other people and start worrying about myself because I'm not getting any better myself, but I figured that nothings going to help make me feel better so I'll just continue acting like I'm fine, and I'm pretty sure most people are that way, they just don't say it.

About a 3 years ago, i started my first day at highschool. i didn't have many friends back then and they all attended different schools.

I was friendly, shy, usually clueless, little overweight boy. I made friends quickly enough.

one of my newly befriended people,(lets call her Clara. i gave her the nickname. Doctor Who), was an amazing person. Talented, smart (usually, sometimes does silly things xD), and genuinely very nice person.

She became my best friend.

...
I unknowningly took it as an advantage. I wanted her to be with me all the time and... in a result she suffered (She usually was really busy and has her own mental prooblems too). I think now that, She tried to be the friendliest and best person to me and i demanded more... i was selfish... i didn't realize.

Before this happened, i kinda wanted to date this girl. Enjin (from now on.) was goth-ish girl, whose sight was pretty bad. her glasses were twice the thickness of mine.

(mine is pretty bad -3 at the time.)

Well... It didn't work out well. i tried to be supportive, gave gifts i genuinely made with love.


My mental state was not good... i broke it off and stopped talking to her.


By the time i started my friendship with Clara, i had forgotten about Enjin, but the lasting effect remained.


Now here i am. Last year, before we graduated highschool, i apologized many many times to Clara. i wanted my friend back but i think i made enough mess. i left it at that.

Last time i met her, she was happy to meet me, she said she was studying English for IELTS exam and  apply for university in the U.S. she looked super tired and i felt really bad for her. She said she was fine, we said our goodbyes and i wanted to hug her but... She left in a flash.


I have a girlfriend now and we are doing somewhat well... I am working out my feelings and any disorders i have. (not professionally sadly)


I was an ass to her at the beginning too. I apologized more than i can remember and we are fine. I love her sooòoooooooooooooooo much. She started to get angry at me but i deserve it.
I cry a little when she say hurtful things. She doesn't mean it, even if she does, i deserve to hear that.


I never wanted to make them suffer but i did. it was my ignorance and entitlement. I love life, I love animals and I don't have any hatred towards anyone.
I love to explore and discover new things. Science and Math are fascinating.


I just wish they are okay and when i am better off i will help them best as i can.

I don't get angry anymore. I am incapable of doing so. My GF taught me that.
I will die for my Girlfriend, She is the only person i am close to and she is super special to me.


Now i don't get angry ,I think before doing anything, I genuinely worry and care about people. I apologize alot because of my silly mistakes and such. I don't know if i am in the right direction or doing things right. I know i still have alot to do to become favourable, trust-worthy person.

54,"I’ve always been an anxious person and more recently have noticed more depressive tendencies in myself. I’m starting to struggle at work and my sleep routine is absolutely trash. Some days my mind is racing and I can only get in 2 hours of sleep and others I just sleep 15 hours. My chest hurts pretty often and my hands start to shake at minor provocations. 

I’ve always pushed it aside because others have it worse and it’s not like I cut or had a plan to kill myself. But I’m tired of feeling like shit and losing interest in everything that used to make me proud of the person I was so I made an appointment to see a doctor tomorrow. It was really hard to say out loud “I would like to make an appointment to talk about my anxiety”.

I’ve never been on meds before so I’m nervous at the prospect of that. The side effects scare me but at this point it’s better than the alternative. I guess I’m just nervous about being validated too. I tried going to a therapist for a while a few years back but felt like she just dismissed my concerns and it really really turned me off from getting any help.

no more games and jokes. no more childish talks of the future or what  if. no more waiting and willing. no more gentle submission.   
the only way to change the world is to change the man in the mirror right? It's time to be the true beast of my nature, the start of another journey for one of many heroes in the sagas of time. its time to start kraft things.

61,"I’m at a crossroads.

I have a goal to move out of state to NYC this August , because, as ignorant as a statement, I am young and have nothing too drastic to loose. I fell in love with the city upon touch down last year, and told myself I had to live here, to find and follow “hubris” aka myself. 

I have a job that starts on the 24th of February that’s temporary, it pays 5$ more than this other job, that I may get, that starts on the 15th of March, but this other job is permanent if I pass the exams for it after a few months in.

Job A (24th), would allow me to achieve my goal faster and more comfortably than Job B (15th)providing less  room for fear and comfortability, all the while job B provides stability and longevity , but confines in state for 2 years before transferring.

I have wanted to move for years and now I am being provided outlets for doing so, I just don’t know what to do. There is the ‘smart route’ which leans towards stagnate stability, or there’s ‘rush’ route where I can save my money and move on a whim.

I’m not sure if this makes any sense whatsoever, I overthink things, I know, but my biggest fear in life is allowing myself to stay stagnate and confined to locality, resulting in an internal regret of fearing to ‘just do’. But at when and what time is ‘just doing’ ignorant, vis à vis when and where is it the right decision?

62,"as the title says

i am grateful of having things that many people wish for but yea... 

let me clarify things here. i don't hate learning i hate school. no i don't hate my school i just hate school as in 1 whole domain idk. idk about uni sounds boring af (don't preach me about it pls ill just ignore it). learning isn't a must to do thing for me i do it as a hobby/interested. but school takes it on a whole new level... you know what i mean

and do all that for 200 days(in my school its 200 days) and 7 hours a day (9-3)

200 x 7 = 1400 hours in school do you know how much of a waste of time that is? 

1400 x 11 =  15400 it doesn't look a lot but it is

anyhow.  you do that for 5 more years and find a job... im tired of these people saying ""SCHOOL MAKES YOU SUCCESSFUL"" when in reality statistic shows 1 out of 10 graduates (from uni obviously :D) finds jobs. thats so low. and lets say you did manage to find a job. you work in a office.... a fucking office. doing work for your boss. and that boss prob is just a silver spooned kid (saying as born rich) or not idrc. you be in school for alot of years just to be another person in the office.

dont get me wrong being a doctor or someone that saves life are different occupation (thank you docters for saving my life :D)

im year 11 male told my parents ill drop out. me and my mother, conversation didnt go anywhere. my father, he was violent i couldn't care less what they think anymore. idc what he thinks but its so sad seeing my father being violent (choking level) just cause im planning to drop out, but dont expect anything from middle eastern family dads! they all violent af(most at least if not they not from middle east) ANYWAY my mother is nice and not violent she just cares about my 'future' so she called my father's grandpa and everything went well, not going too deep into this. i can live with him now but i cant do it. i just can't... ill do it as last resort. (i sound like a asshole lol)  

ill be honest, i dont want to do anything for a living i just want to die feel nothing, do nothing, no connections to anything just in peace (dying seems better than living tbh) but i wouldnt kill my self for that.. nor will i ever.. i think .. im not suicidal.

i have no plans for 'my future' maybe just work part time in a convenience store and then make a living off of stocks, find info, if i cant find any.. ill make the info by having people (i have a big brain so its not difficult :) just difficult getting the right people to do it. not sharing it sorry lol) 

anyway hobbies time.  my hobbies are games, art (very bad tho). learning through my mistakes, anime, manga, being arrogant (who doesn't, if you see the opportunity to be arrogant do it until they wont talk back face) pro gamer doesn't seems like a bad option they don't get paid enough unless from tournaments chances of winning are not that high, other is becoming a streamer? ik its difficult but it seems more fun than being a pro gamer overall. art is not a option for me. im getting a bit off topic here. actually no, everything is relevant, like im the tree creating the branches  or so id like to think. 

people say the pen is mighter than the sword but that really depends on the paper, like the battlefield for example. idk im just waffling at this point. im giving 0 thoughts on what im typing, just typing on what i think.

anyway ill be for real. idc if i lose because you only lose when you give up. i prob will regret dropping out but its not really important thinking of the past or the future, im just an idiot living in the present.

ok and 1 last thing god why did you make diseases, or was it the humans who inevitably made them. oh well. might as well a zombie Apocalypse will come in the future? like when you kill them you eat their core to get strength (ive been reading alot of these stories) and how tf will there be any food for a decade there is bactaria all of the world by the first 3 hours. you cant farm.. unless...

ok this is really going off topic im just going to end it. i want my dream career to be a reality. a streamer. maybe . it doesn't require luck at all maybe some but not alot. anyone who dropped out below, and whats your story? 

IDC ABOUT MY GRAMMAR ITS ONLINE WHO CARES.

if id ever be a streamer id go with the name: zero

wish me luck pls even tho i said its not required it really is better than no luck :&gt; 

tldr: fuck this school system, i want to do anything i want with no regrets

68,"My fiance and I got to know each other through discord last year in October. I had just moved to Pakistan from the yhe Netherlands in the summer of 2018. Him and i were initially e-dating other people which we helped each other to get with btw but those relationships both went south. We started out as friends but soon enough started speaking about more intimate stuff with each other (e.g. Sex) in which one thing lead to another and boom before i knew it i was head over heels in love. I was occasionally flirting with him even though i knew he had a girlfriend, i felt incredibly guilty cuz his at the time girlfriend messaged me asking me to stay away from him but I was quite wreckless. (My fiance and I were both mentally unwell as we've had to withstand a lot of shit throughout our lives so at some point his parents wanted to send him to a clinic for addiction and mental health). On a daily basis he would message me saying how in love he was with his back then girlfriend and this would confuse me cuz sometimes he also flirted with me but as i was also seeing someone else i knew i shouldn't get these feelings i had for him get any stronger. However my back then boyfriend and i ended up breaking up and somehow i managed to convince my fiance to break up with his gf too. We started dating the same day he broke up with her. Near the end of November he had to go to the clinic for 10 weeks and my unstable ass was scared to get get hurt cuz i thought he'd find someone better and wouldn't love me anymore so i tried to push him away by breaking up with him just before he went to the clinic. Fast forward 10 weeks, he's back from the clinic but my mental health haf worsened, he strongly suggested that I'd also go to the clinic he went to. After discussing it with my parents I went there too about a month after he came back. (He saved my life by doing this. If i had not gone to the clinic back then, I'd guarunteed be dead now). During this time we had gotten back together but once again as i was gonna be away from him my insecurities got the best of me again and i broke up with him. Once i got back again (in March) summer was approaching, i still liked him a lot and he liked me too so we decided to jump back into our relationship where we left off. In the summer my family went back to the Netherlands and as Marvin (my now fiance) and I were also still best friends we decided to meet up. This was our first time meeting each other in real life. I was nervouse as hell, i made sure to wear a cute dress. I took the train to where he lives and i was getting more and more nervous with each passing second. Once i arrived at the train station, i scanned the place for about 20 seconds and then we spotted eachother. I gave him a hug and we went to the cinema to watch Aladdin, i really enjoyed cuddling up to him and could tell he was nervous too. Basically we had classic first date with a twist cuz we went to McDonald's after to get some food where i embarrassed myself :) this was in the beginning of June, a week or 2 later I started to realise that this was the first real life relationship i was in in which i was actually loved and also genuinely loved back, this freaked me out and I once again backed out. I was starting to get pissed with myself because i knew that if i i kept doing this I'd lose him yet at the same time my dumbass thought that if i hurt him enough to push him away now it'll hurt less then if it were to happen in the future. Which is fucking bullshit of course but i refused to see it until i reflected on myself some. My rationalization as to why it went wrong was that we kept rushing into things so i told him I'd rather stay friends for a bit first and then slowly see where things take us so on the 14th of July we decided to give this relationship another go and since then things have been going really well. 

This young man has proved to me time and time again that he loves me and i really hope i do the same for him. He makes me so happy, i love every little thing about him. How understanding he is, the great listener in him, the kind heart he has, the humour he shares with me, his hopes and dreams, he makes me wanna live my life and really make the best out of it. I love the way his eyes crinkle when he laughs and how he looks at me before every kiss. The way he says ""I love you"" everyday and how lovable he makes me feel. 

My darling Marvin, I'm so grateful that you've flown all the way to Pakistan to visit me, I'm grateful for your patience with me and with time, I'm grateful for all the smiles you've put on my face and grateful for the tears i was allowed to share with you. You've opened my soul to a whole new world and i cannot believe I'm the lucky person who gets to explore it with you. We've been through hell and back and each time we've only made it out strongly. I'm so impeccably proud of you, you make the world a better place. You give me a life that's worth living. I'm so haply to be your fiance and am still in slight disbelief that I'm actually going to be your wife. God dod right by you baby. I love you. ❤️",12Feb2020,1
69,"Hey reddit.
I’m 27m and I feel I’ve lost connection to my inner world completely. Back in the days, when I was 22-23 there were a bunch of things I loved and I loved about myself. I loved my job, my few friends, my hobbies which were playing, reading and some other geeky stuff. I was not completely statisfied about myself, but the statisfaction I had was geninue. Though, I had a lot of experiences waiting for me the next years which were great - like becoming more independent, getting my own car and place, traveling, career improvement, and not that great - like losing friends, bad romantic relationships followed by depression I still struggle. 
Quite a time ago I thought that changing employer could help, as far as I felt stuck professionally-wise, but now, no my dream position, I still feel like shit and things go wrong. I’m afraid I can lose that position and money I spent for moving to another city.

I thought reality is different thats why you were not a good hero. But then I just realized yiu would never be a protagonist in my story because you didnt love me. I was so wrong to put on hold of those my hobbies. Now I am going to go back reading and watching them and stop the bitter feeling for others,12Feb2020,1
72,"Okay guys so I'm stuck in a sticky situation. My boyfriend and I have been dating 4.5 years now and have been living with each other for 3.5 years. A year and a half ago our lease went up at the same time as his brothers. That was the same time their dad retired and wanted to invest in property so long story short he bought a house that his brother, my boyfriend, and myself rent out. Shortly after we moved in I noticed that his brother was extremely lazy and all he would do is sit in the living room and play video games. Also, with his work he gets home at about 2pm everyday and will play video games until bed. Now, he also smokes A LOT of weed. I have no problem with people smoking ( you do you I don't care) but he smokes so much to the point where he becomes a vegetable and slumps into the couch for hours everyday. In the last 1.5 years he maybe has done the dishes a handful of times, maybe bought grocery's once or twice and NEVER pays us back when we buy them every week (doesn't even offer), I have never seen him with a broom or vacuum in his hand, and rarely ever does outside chores (mowing and shoveling snow). My boyfriend and I fight about it pretty often and its slowly tearing us apart. I ask him to talk to his brother and ask him to do things around the house but he never really says anything. It may be because his brother is older than him but I don't know. His brother is a year away from 30 and I thought going into it he would be more mature. My advice is how do I handle this situation and not let it hurt my relationship anymore?",12Feb2020,1
73,"So what can we do to prepare?


Obviously there can be no doubt at all you godless Satan worshipping atheists that the Book of Revelations is true, as is the entire bible, after all the book itself says it is true.  You godless sinners had better take heed and prepare!


You are all in for some truly terrible times ahead.  Massive wars, earthquakes, the ocean turning to blood, giant monsters, rampaging armies of rape-demons, I think I saw something in there about flaming-corgis falling from the sky, but don't quote me on that part.  All of this is laid forth in the Book of Revelations so we KNOW it will happen!


So now do we get ready for this?


Obviously all terrestrial plans are futile since God will make this all come to pass.  


Thus the solution is clear.


We need to massively invest in the sciences and especially in space exploration so we can colonize other planets and escape from the weirdly jealous omnipott psychopath who is weirdly insecure and possessive about one tiiiiiiiiiny portion of the cosmos.  Since we know the Book of Revelations is literally true we have no choice but to evacuate the planet while God LARPs it up with Christian literalists because he is unconcerned with the rest of the universe!  After all, the Book of Revelations makes clear that this is all going to happen on Earth, so if we get out of here we should be fine!


Will O'Neill cylinders in Earth orbit be safe or do we need to go to Mars, maybe leave the solar system entirely to get away from this divine lunatic?

He is still occasionally lucid enough to understand what is happening. He knows that he is in a rehab facility until he can go to hospice. He knows that in rehab he has to go to physical therapy at least every other day or otherwise the VA won't pay for it.

He is beyond done with this shit. He wants to die yesterday. When he was lucid, he did not want to live like this, and he doesn't want to live like this now.

But he still goes to physical therapy, even though he hates it, even though he is beyond annoyed by his continued existence.

He thinks it's 2008. He thinks I'm my mother. He's ornery and petulant. He wants to unplug the goddamn machines already, legal consequences be damned. 

He could live on life support for another 20 years with the money he has in the bank. His children are financially comfortable. 

Despite all that of this, he's still following the rules, because he knows that misbehaving will cost him money.

96,"I really need help and support from this community as I really feel I've hit a huge wall regarding problems at home. TLDR at the bottom. Also posted in  r/relationships

To say I had a rocky relationship with my mother for years would be an understatement. She gets mad and filled with rage over the tiniest things and doesn't even want to control her outbursts and lashing out. Makes the biggest problems and fights out of everything. I know it sounds like basic teen drama, but I'm in my 20s now and I still struggle with it, so I ask you not to discard this as such. When she's angry she doesn't choose the words she yells, she just spits them out and later says that she doesn't mean it. Among those words are various insults and swearing towards me. I've really always tried reacting calmly as she is my mom and I love her, but she really hurt me the most out of all the people I know. Even though she has some really great sides and aspects, all of that falls into water when she gets like this. And it's not just my perception, my dad notices all of this but thinks it's easier to ignore it.

As I am becoming more of an adult, I realised I am a person as well, and couldn't tolerate entirely that somebody puts me down and humiliates me. This only resulted in her anger rising and expressing it even more each time something happens.

The latest instance of this is this night. I didn't pass one of my exams and it's left for summer. She started yelling and making different points how I'm lazy, incapable, stupid and even abnormal. That really hurt bcs of all the things she does. I tried responding to a few of her statements and she leaned in my face and grabbed the neck of my shirt. At that moment my reaction was to take her hands and lift them away from me, but I accidentally squeezed her wrist, and I screamed at her not to touch me like that ever again. During our entire discussion she banned a lot of things for me (I am 20 and still live with parents). 

I really feel cornered and all of these things are suffocating me, mentally, physically and emotionally. I know things aren't supposed to be like this in a place that you call home. Throughout the years, it was the reason for having suicidal thoughts, being really sad and unavailable for my friends. For the last 10 months I'm in the best possible relationship in the world. She's always there for me, supports me, and I know she is the one for me. We're both planning a life together, but my mother meddled with that as well.

I need some help, I've heavily thought about moving the hell out, getting away, living with my SO, but it wouldn't be easy running away from home because I'm leaving my dad and younger brother with both of whom I have great relations. 

Can anybody offer any kind of advice or help as I really need it. Thanks to all kind souls in advance.

99,"Guy couldn't have been older than 20. Was in a Shitty truck. He cut me off and almost hit me so I honked my horn and he gave me the finger with the most sneering punch-me-in-the-fucking-face grin ever. It took me every ounce of control to not follow him to the next stop and confront him.

I'm not a violent person, not really even a confrontational person, but this kid (and he was a kid) was completely wrong and I just saw red. I get how people can make violent choices even when everything logical says it's not worth it. The thing is, live in a tiny town too, so I've seen him before and recognize that dumb fucking grin. I know I'm going to see him again soon and have to contain myself again. 

I'm in my early thirties and had to deal with his type my whole life. They don't grow, they don't learn, and they think they're owed respect by everyone because they bully others into submission. I know people like him in their 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's too. They get away with everything. Good Ol'Boys. 

I really hate to make generalizations, but this type of shit is always the tip of the iceberg. The same guys drink and drive, beat their girlfriends/wives, and spew the most vitriolic shit about subjects they know nothing of. They're the least educated and the loudest to speak. I was bullied and given shit by them for years, but **now** that I'm an adult and bigger and stronger and smarter, (I wasn't nearly as tall or strong as I got in my 20's) I have to turn the other cheek. I can't give these people the beatings they may have earned at any other point in history. Instead I have to go home and look at President Bully, and neighborhood bully, and people too poor to get by on their own, all while I hold it all in while I kill myself trying to be a better person. All the while this kid gets to have a beer and laugh about how he cut off and almost hit me, then flipped me off, while learning nothing. I have to try to glean something about who I am and why I am angry, but he gets to go on being a turd in perpetuity.

I'm not one of those, I was born in the wrong time people, but I'm immensely frustrated at the lack of power and control I have over anything in my life in the face of perceived injustice. Be it a bully who deserves to be punched in the face, systemic racism and sexism, wealth inequality, or the plethora of other things that make me angry, I can't due anything.

I do vote, volunteer, try to help people, but I feel like I'm tilting at windmills here. That dude was an adult legally, but he's still a child, and nothing, **NOTHING**, I do or say will make this kid, or the world, better. My job is to literally help sick people and I still can't make enough of a difference. But that smug turd can do whatever and never face any consequences from a society that ultimately embraces and encourages his behavior.

100,"  

The last year has been the most difficult of my life. after 14 years working at my previous employer, i was abruptly fired in Feb. 2019. Almost immediately a couple former coworkers and actual real life friends reached out and suggested I switch industries and actually both suggested the same company. Through these friends, I got an interview with that company just a few days after being fired. It went really great and I had a 2nd interview just a few days later that also went very well. while the job would represent an immediate small increase in pay, the long term potential was exponentially greater than the dead end job I had gotten fired from. The company was very clear and upfront with me that they were growing, and hoped to have grown enough by April 2019 to be able to hire me. Well, April came and went and I never really heard much. I ended up bumping into my would be boss over the summer and he was very friendly and apologetic but told me the just did not have the growth they hoped to and never hired anyone. I ended up applying to something like 120 jobs and was unemployed for 5 months. It was a very difficult time. I've never had sleeping problems, heartburn, or indigestion problems in my life but I developed problems with all of them while unemployed, suddenly very poor, and very stressed. Luckily, they went away after I went back to work.  I ended up taking an entry level job with a different company in the same industry so that I could hopefully circle back at some point to that original opportunity. It took another 6 months and 3 more interviews, but my plan ultimately worked and I start my new job on Monday 2/17.

My bosses seem really cool, and I’m really excited about work for the first time in a long time.",12Feb2020,1
101,"There are certain experiences that mark you as a person. Things happen to you that shape the person you are. Not the person the world perhaps sees you as, the face you show the world through a filter, but the you that is your true self. I always knew I wanted to be a mother. To give life. To nurture life. I had no idea of the experiences that would truly ""shape me"". If you had told me years ago that my most awful relationship, would make me the person I was destined to be I would have told you to get lost, or something much more crude and direct. Turns out that being treated like a piece of shit while bringing forth my dearest wish (children) made me realise my true worth. Stupid but it's the truth.

My dysfunctional and violent relationship that was plagued with drugs, alcohol and mutual disrespect, showed me what I was not meant to put up with and what I should expect from a mature, grown up relationship. Working out how much you can drink to get the biggest bang for your buck isn't really something a ""grown up"" does. Having fun and letting loose shouldn't ever end up in violence or passing out to oblivion to escape your present situation. Having children in a situation like mine was is never a solution either but for me, it just so happened that I found my salvation in bringing life to the world in a hostile situation.

It's hard to say whether things were quite as bad before the kids came along, but safe to say, bringing a child into a hard situation only makes things harder. Truth is, I was lying about the state of my life before I had the kids. Once they were here, present and living the turmoil I had become accustomed to, I was suddenly motivated to change. Funny how when other people are really banking on you making the right decisions it all becomes suddenly clear. Things that were previously forgiven become sticking points. You want to do better because you need to do so. Their future depends on it. If you asked me the one reason I finally left my dysfunctional and violent relationship I would straight out answer you ""For the sake of my children"".

I have been accused of being selfish for having my daughter, straight out been told I should never have had her. That was from her father. The truth? I had her for myself, yes. But I also had her for my son. My children will always have each other. They have a sibling to always be by their side (here's hoping) no matter what the circumstance. These days her Dad loves her, he loves them both in the ways he is capable, but that's a story for another post.

Exiting a relationship that is toxic in the ways mine was, is nothing short of liberating. The walls I had put up slowly came down. The parts of my personality that had dimmed had the chance to shine again. I started making connections again, with people I had lost and new friends I was meeting along the way. I've had family say how nice it was to have the ""old me"" back again. Truth? I'll never be the old me again. Too much has happened, I've experienced things that have shaped me into something else. I guess what they really mean is that my happiness has returned. My purpose and my meaning is back with a new strength that I didn't have before.

Don’t take opinions from people who won’t listen to yours. Don’t listen to people who don’t respect you, who think that they’re smarter, wiser than you. Don’t listen to those who think that they know it all. If money is what makes you happy then you’ll always be poor because no matter how much money you have, there will always be more to money to collect. You’ll never be truly happy because you’ll never have enough money (even though you do). If you don’t like your job then why do you do it? Because that job makes you feel safe? The cure to the pain that you feel deep down inside you. That pain which you feel due to the realization that life is short and you only have one life and with each passing second you are straying further away from achieving your dreams. The cure to that pain isn’t something which you will find at liquor stores because alcohol will only temporarily numb your pain. But your pain, it’s permanent. You are not defined by how big your office is. NO, rather, you are defined by who you truly are. By the face you show to yourself. The person who you are when nobody is watching. Imagine if people's judgements didn’t matter, would you then, be the same person that you are right now? Why are you so worried about how much money is in your wallet, when no amount of money will matter in your coffin. When you are on your deathbed, you won’t regret not making extra money but what you will regret is the not doing the things that you wanted to do but you didn’t just because the money made you feel safe. On your deathbed you will realize that life is short and that you would’ve managed to survive without doing the job you hated and that you only had one chance to do what you truly wanted to do but it’s too late now… When all the self-realization hits you but you still choose to everyday wake up and go to the job that you hate and every single day you choose to make decisions that take you further away from doing what you are meant to be doing, you inevitably end up suppressing your emotions and all your emotions turn into anger and frustration. But remember that anger is a liar, anger has no respect for you. Anger is just a sign that you are doing something wrong. After all your emotions turn into anger, your body’s self defence mechanism kicks in (which you are used to now) it suppresses anger too. This causes it all to turn into pain. The type of pain that you feel all the time. It’s endless, it keeps on increasing and hurts a lot. But soon you get used to the pain. It always hurts but you have fallen in love with it now. It’s become a part of you now and there’s no escaping it. Each night you go to bed feeling empty, feeling numb. What you feel is just pain but you have gotten used to it now, but the emptiness makes you think about the choices that you regret but you don’t do anything about it. You sleep with your regrets. When you get so used to pain, all the happiness in your life vanishes. The things which once gave you joy no longer excite you and your life now is just a feeling of ever-increasing emptiness all the time. All this causes you to be numb to most things and you end up having problems with relationships but you don’t really care (even though you do, deep down inside). You are forced to take some of your relationships as a duty. Remember that the mistakes you make can help you grow as a person, however that doesn’t mean that your mistakes are your friends. Who you truly are is up to you and you alone, so don’t let your mistakes define who you are.",12Feb2020,1
110,I’ve done 1 year of cross country for my school. During races I was the social one to other people and would usually say “good job” or stuff like that or maybe even get into a conversation as we our running our asses off. I just want to thank those who were also social and got into conversations with me and made races more entertaining.,12Feb2020,1

112,So I have had this on and off crush on this girl for about a year. I usually go off when she is dating another dude but when she isn’t I try to get as close to her as possible. We are already friends and a bit close bcuz we played a sport together and we have had personal convos. She is pretty popular and I have lost majority of my reputation doing dumb shit in middle school. When I didn’t have a crush on her I told her one time that I used to like her so now if I full send or eventually tell her I feel like its gonna be awkward. I don’t really want to full send it all that fast I kinda just want to build it up over time ya know? So... what do I do?,12Feb2020,1
115,"Hey. I've experienced this a few times. I think it might have something to do with concentration or stress. It manifests a little differently. The last time it happened I imagined an object that was infinitely big and it really hurt my head to think about it.
The other times was on a math test and while I was lying in bed and staring at the ceiling (quite literally)

It triggered the symptom, which feels like my every move is echoing. It also feels as if each movement I make is extremely short, and it feels as if I can't speak (I imagine in my head that I can't speak and that only garbled sounds come out if I try) even though I can.

The things that help with the symptom are a change of environment, putting on music (or specifically changing the sounds in the room NOT to be static) or speaking with someone else - sort of to prove to myself that I can talk.

It's so weird because I can't find this described anywhere.",12Feb2020,1

119,"I love to debate online about topics, but my bad temper usually ruined the conversation. Occasionally, I could slow myself down and re-phrase comments to be more respectful and kind, despite my disagreements with others. 

I want to be better.

Guys, I’m sorry.",12Feb2020,1
