2,"Not sure how to explain it. 

Okay so think 7 years back. There wasn’t nearly as much police brutality, politics weren’t well.. uh. “This” now its just ignorant people literally looking for a fight by going into stores wanting to be thrown out but being attention whores and “I have a right to not wear a mask” 

On top of that everyone is losing their jobs, yet everything is going up in prices. So many people are struggling to stay afloat, when does it end?

My days now consist of what fees like a constant revolving movie, day after day it’s the same thing all Over. Wake up, go shower, cut myself shaving, go to work, read the news, everyone is pulling their eyes out, everyone being selfish, everyone looking for for themselves, rich get richer, ignorant people in position of authority but what blows my mind even more is that we are letting that happen.

Remember when we could blame the state of the US on the government? “Well, those laws exist because companies lobby for them, they have the money” but think 2020. 

We go into police officer roles, we are the racists ones, we go into stores looking for fights like fuck. 

I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. Sleep through it. I don’t even have to wake up, I’d be fine if I went to sleep and didn’t wake up later",29Jul2020,1

4,"I recently got offended by a dry text and acted toxic about it by saying it hurt but not giving much information on why it hurt me. It pissed her off understandably and she asked me why I was trying to start something. I wasn’t and then got really anxious and said I that I wanted to stop whatever was happening I didn’t want to argue and that I was sorry for starting shit. She got a little offended saying jeez sorry. I repeated that I was sorry I was just sad and that was all.

I’m always too scared to tell her I’m sad or hurt by something she’s said because it’ll usually make her angry. And the one time I brought this up to her it was at the worst time (she had asked me not to disturb her) and me being an idiot I did with my sadness. She blew up at me, started yelling at me over text and I don’t remember much because I just started crying and wanting it to stop cause I couldn’t think. 

I just want to feel like she cares and more recently she’s acted more like a “bad bitch” in her words but she’s just being a bad person. I’m too scared to tell her because she’ll get mad at me probably. She’ll find this reddit post and probably get mad at me for painting her in such a bad light.

Ive been tempted by suicide lately, but I’m on antidepressants and I shouldn’t be allowed to feel like this, but I just want everything to end, I’m failing highschool, I’m failing life. I hate being the fucking stereotype of “the world would be better off without me” but it really feels like that.

However, recently she’s been ignoring my messages and pushed me away. As much as it hurts, I try my best to understand her situation. I asked her why she was doing it.

One call later, and she told me that she didn’t have the emotional capacity for me and that she doesn’t want to drag me into her problems. She also told me that she needed time alone and that this battle that she’s facing has to be done alone. 

I feel sad because, I’m not there for her and I don’t want to lose her. I’ve been crying non stop. I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again or if I’ll ever even hear her voice again. I really miss her, and I’m afraid that I’ll never get to see her again.

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

Hello everyone this is my first time that I write anything on reddit and just saying english is my second language because my first is first so because that i use google translate and i dont know how explain all thing so but whatever it is me wondering if my parents are insane or entitledparents because in my childhood they hit me and when I am on my video game they come to tell me to let go because I'm not social and I just want to run away (ps google help me)",29Jul2020,1
18,"So here's the quick rundown. I'm not ugly or socially inept. I'm not really too dumb. However, I am prone to being lazy and will just not do stuff. For instance, I am currently in college and studying a field I enjoy however I have a hard time doing things on time sometimes and this has had a significant effect on my grades. I always overdo things and have very little impulse control especially around anything that makes me feel good.

When I start doing poorly I start to withdraw and stress makes me stop eating. I turn to doing drugs and in all honestly usually end up spending around two weeks in bed rolling around whispering to myself that I'm a loser. I don't even try to say it. It just comes out, ""budget-square is a fucking loser"". Or sometimes, ""Are you going to kill yourself? I'm going to kill myself"".

This has caused me to end most of my relationships with friends just because I can't be bothered to get out of bed. The issue that bugs me is I just keep doing this to myself over and over. Lately, I started slipping back into it again and I'm just tired of it. I feel like a loser and want to stop being worthless. I'm sure a lot of my issues are just an inability to cope which once again ties into a worthless person cause a normal person wouldn't struggle with this like I do. 

The funny thing is I never get this way with work. I actually enjoy working long hours because I feel like I'm succeeding and doing something right. I always fill in for people and put in the extra effort so that I know I'm doing a good job. It just seems like its school that really fucks me up. I'll admit I've gone through my fair share of unfortunate events yet there are plenty of people who do and do fine in life.

So my question is how do I stop being like this and become someone I can be proud of?",29Jul2020,1

35,"# Picturesque “About that one night I spent with Daisy Ridley” BEFORE she was famous

When I was 18 years old I had never gotten laid and stole my father's credit card to get a drink within the Disney World park ""Epcot"". My father was always an abusive prick and hated me so I didn't care about stealing from him. I have terrible DID because of the guy and my personality Max kept taking me over during this entire night. So my memory is still really skewed but here’s what I remember.

I walked back into the park, and either wasn't allowed into the bar or got a drink and then came back outside. I saw this gorgeous woman watching the fireworks above the big ball and walked right up to her and said “What a picturesque night…” She bummed me a smoke and

There's some confusion in my memory about what I said next but she definitely said to me after I said that, that she was about to be really famous for Star Wars Episode 7 and “to sleep with me while you can.”

I don’t remember entirely, but the next thing I remember is going on the big ball ride about the history of man with her and hugging her and making out with her the whole time. We were the ONLY ones on the ride and since she was about to be famous, so they let us on the ride.

After that, we took the monorail back to Disney’s Contemporary Resort. She had asked me on the big ball ride how we were going to get a room, and I just held my father's credit card up into the light and said “We have unlimited funds on this!”

We rented a room, and fucked like rabbits. Then we stayed up all night and watched the movie Jobs. That’s it, that’s all of the story. Pretty much. I loved her. Is all that that I had to say… badly too.

I was Max almost the entire time, due to my DID but my real name is Zeke Ortiz.

Skip ahead to 3 years later. I was in a theatre watching star wars when I saw Rey appear on screen. Instantly it all came back to me and I started vomiting. My father tried telling me how that wasn’t real, and how I couldn't possibly have done that, but I had.

I even met George Lucas that night and he seriously considered casting me as Po.

If it truly wasn't Daisy Ridley who I slept with that night, then I apologize to her profusely for this story, but it must have been.",29Jul2020,1

37,"
My mom and dad are divorced now but they used to fight all the time. I know people arent perfect and everyone gets overwhelmed and goes crazy. I still love my mom very much but I just wanted to get this off my chest. 

She has anger issues. She used to bash my dads head into the edge of bathtubs, kick him, throw things like blowdryers at him, etc. She bit him and made him bleed so many times (once in the middle of a grocery store and had to be escorted by security). She said the cruelest things to him and somehow made herself out to be the victim. I was forced to watch it and often forced by my mom to participate in it and say horrible things to my father and then defend her and “testify” against him (not legally, but just informally to other family members). 

They are divorced now thank God but I have so much guilt still. This went on for years.

I still can’t look him in the eye. I always took my mom’s side even though she raged at me and occasionally hit me, just because I was terrified of her. I should have reported her abuse of my dad and just gone and lived with my dad. But I wasn’t comfortable around my dad either, partly because I felt so guilty and partly because my mom made me afraid of him by telling me he was violent and probably also partly because when I was really young he was kind of sexually inappropriate with me and would french kiss me and fondle my breasts and stuff even when I begged him not to. Even now I can’t talk to him on the phone without having a panic attack. I haven’t seen him in three years. He is pretty mentally ill now, severely depressed and can’t have a conversation. I cry when I think of him. I still have so much guilt about what happened to my dad and my part in it.

I'm seeing my co-worker and getting really close to him. We're not in a relationship (nor do I want to be) however we're more than just friends. We have to hide it from everyone, so I'm lying to my friends, co-workers, family...  It's been four months and I'm not over my ex whom I broke up with because of our psychological issues, lack of intimacy and zero effort put into our growing continuous issues through the last two years of our relationship. I feel really guilty for not being over my ex and talking to him while being ""something"" with my co-worker (though he knows about all my feelings towards everything and everyone). I also feel guilty because my ex could perhaps think that we could be something again, while I'm here having ""something"" with my co-worker. I'm confused on both fronts, at the same time I'd give everything to have a normal, healthy, loving relationship with my ex because he's still amazing in my eyes and I guess I'm seeing everything through ""pink glasses"", while I also really like my co-worker, he's so kind and he makes me feel loved and accepted at all times, but I'm held back by the restrictions of him being my co-worker and not being over my ex. Because of my feelings of guilt and uncertainty around this ""relationship"" I feel like I'm slowly pushing him away. 

While I worked on my self growth a lot after the break up, lost a lot of weight, ate healthy, focused on positive, now I'm waking up with no motivation, feeling like crying way more than I should (a couple of times a day), feeling irritated for the most smallest inconveniences (tightness in chest, tears building up, wanting to break things,...) and my self hate issues which go long back to my adolescence (gotten worse during my past relationship) are showing again, I'm having negative thoughts and I speak to myself in a demeaning way, and it just... everything hurts. 

Feelings of lost love, confused emotions, not being clear with myself, guilt, confusion about the future, not having any focus or goal, self deprecation, anger,... are getting to me. I also figured out that alcohol has become one of my ""escapes""... Ever since the break up, I've been drinking quite regularly every weekend, however it was only the past couple of weeks when all of this weight started crushing on me, that I realized why I do it.. because I don't have to think about anything, decide on anything, figure out my emotions, clear anything, when I'm drunk.. It's just easy and fun and I'm a good old positive person when I drink.

40,"Sorry this is long and it’s probably confusing I can’t figure out a good way to get the words out. To make a long history very short, I never had many friends and ever since I was 14/15 boys became my unhealthy coping mechanism, although until I went to college I’d only actually kissed 2 boys, I just got a rush talking to them and obsessed over it. My feelings/moods were almost entirely dependent on how things were going with whichever boy it was at the time and they were intense. And I would obsess over them for months. I never actually dated until college though. When I started college I was extremely depressed and I kind of jumped off the deep end. I got into a relationship with the first guy I went out with and it was manipulative and sexually abusive and I stayed for way too long. I was taken advantage of sexually a few more times after I broke up with him and I decided fuck it I don’t care anymore sex doesn’t mean anything anymore. Then I started hooking up with this guy in a few times. The COVID happened and our college shut down so things kinda stopped. We lived not that far apart though and a couple weeks ago he asked if I was home and we made plans to meet up. Then I got blown off and left him on read the next day because there wasn’t really anything for me to say, which he did to me basically every time we talked, to which he blocked me.

The shift that hosts the training to qualify me scheduled me once for a time that would have been illegal for me to attend at (not enough time between shifts) and they’re not planning to have another session for a good long while.

I have to go around like a child in a “Why?” Phase, constantly questioning everyone and anything to get some morsel of information and direction and it’s grating on me.

I’m told I’m doing well, but I’m paralyzed with anxiety and it’s turning into simmering anger. There’s no direction with this company, but they want to expand and do so rapidly, but they have one supervisor on my shift who I can tell is working themselves to the bone and stretching themselves as far as they can.

There’s no leadership, and a resentful antipathy between shifts, but the push to expand and grow is all anyone talks about- but these people can’t tell their assholes from their elbows. I can tell there’s no plan, they’re just throwing people against a wall to see who sticks and whoever peels off and crashes back to Earth can carry bricks when they get there.

It’s also hard because I’m the only one in my dept on my shift now. Most people that seems like a dream, being alone. Just you and your work. For me it’s awful. I’m a severe extrovert and spending hours upon hours in a dimly lit corner, by myself, with almost no interaction with people is affecting my psyche. I have points during the shift I just, shut down. I have no motivation, no will, no desire to keep going. I feel like I’ve run dry and I have to close my eyes and breathe for a few minutes and chug back to aching life and see if I can force myself to keep going. But S the weeks are turning to months, this is becoming more difficult to do.

I’m tired to my core. I miss my old job, but because of reasons that go beyond Covid, it may never happen. I’m tired of jobs that destroy my clothes. Hurt my arms and hands. Exhaust my mind to complete nothingness. As well as working for company that strips people naked and feeds them to wolves; sets people up for failure- though not through maliciousness, just severe misguidance.

I’m trying to find something to better myself in the interim, but options are limited and if all goes right, I will graduate in two years. But I just don’t know how much more I can take. 

I keep crawling out of holes I find myself in- a massive recession, and now pandemic which saw me start from scratch each and every time, but I’m exhausted with each and every day climbing, only to slide or be pushed back down again.

How do you climb when your fingers are raw, bloody, and your nails have all but been shaved away?",29Jul2020,1
43,"I woke up the other night after remembering this story. I consider it a turning point in my life that taught me to think more critically outside the classroom. Its one of those stories that I would probably be embarrassed to tell in person due to my stupidity but ended up turning out alright in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

It happened when I joined my mom for her family reunion. One of my relatives had a cabin out on one of the islands on the Canadian side of Puget Sound north of Victoria. Its a beautiful area to visit, even coming from someone who lives in Western Washington. The islands are packed close together and full of forests and wildlife. The cabin had a great view and access to the water which was definitely a plus. There were also paddle boards and a canoe which I definitely made use of within my first few days, though usually with someone who knew more than I.

&amp;#x200B;

It was about the 4th day that I got cocky. Lots of the islands in the area are uninhabited, some are set up as refuges for wilderness. I of course thought it would be fun to go explore one of the slightly closer ones that I was fairly sure wasn't a refuge. Everyone else except one of my cousins was busy. She was not a fan of boats, but interested in going to the island I had pointed out. At the time I did worry a bit about my experience since this was Puget Sound I was canoeing in and I had pretty much only canoed in lakes before that trip. But I was an \~\~intelligent\~\~ arrogant 19 year old who thought I could make due, so I talked myself into it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think taking a small boat between the islands of Puget Sound is one of the best experiences I have ever had. You can watch kingfishers roost on sun baked branches that hang over the water only to take off and dive nearby to grab a fish. Tide pools are literally everywhere with brightly colored anemones, sea stars and urchins even. The hot summer sun almost added an extra layer of enchantment to the experience.

&amp;#x200B;

As we approached the island I looked out at the shallow beach, the ideal spot to land and saw a couple tents. I panicked a little. I wasn't even 100% sure I was supposed to set foot on the island, and I figured the campers/potential rangers might not be amused to see a canoe landing on the shore next to their tents. This is where I made one of my dumbest decisions to date. Instead of turning around, I set my sights on a more rocky part of the island. The part where all of the anemones and eye catching sea stars were. They looked even more brilliant as I approached. I attempted landing the canoe nearby. My cousin managed to successfully disembark the canoe and scramble up the side of one of the rocks. I slowly stepped out next, holding the rope for the canoe. I attempted to haul the canoe out of the water on to the rocks, but I quickly gave up. I didn't know much about canoeing, but I did have experience walking in tide pools. We use the analogy of walking on slippery shards of glass out here and its not much of an exaggeration. The rocks are coated in slick seaweed and have razor sharp edges. I knew hauling a boat up on that was just asking for a huge gash that would quickly become a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately told my cousin I was calling off the exploration. I had made too many mistakes and it was getting dangerous. Unfortunately it quickly got worse as we tried getting back in the canoe. I tried stabilizing the boat to allow for my cousin board, but it tilted and flooded. I remembered the procedure was to invert the canoe and dump out the water so I struggled to try and do so. Unfortunately there was no way I could haul it up before, and being filled with water didn't help any. Try as I could, on the surface of the water the most I could empty was about 2/3. Finally I deemed it enough, and I clambered in asking my cousin to pass the empty water bottle for bailing.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, having water inside of a boat makes it extremely hard to balance. As soon as the boat lurches one direction, the water follows exaggerating the motion until the boat flips. I reached out for the empty bottle and the canoe bucked, rolling in the water and filling once again. I remember being thrown in the water, scraping my leg on the rocks leaving a gash that I still have a scar for. I also knew my electronics were shot because the stupid bug had bit hard that day and for some reason I didn't waterproof. I groaned, got up with blood dripping from my leg, still holding the canoe somehow and proceeded to try tipping the water out again. the next boarding attempt I managed to stabilize myself and immediately began bailing water. Slowly the boat was becoming more stable until I decided it was good enough for my cousin to board. She was in tears at this point, and I apologized.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at the nearest land a nice inviting sandy beach only about 600 feet away. Somehow after the ordeal we actually had both paddles. So I grabbed one and started to row. The boat still had water inside and we quite nearly capsized again. She burst into more tears and I knew that I would prefer stabilizing the boat to swimming the rest of the way. I looked at the water level in the boat, which looked like nothing compared to what I had started with and started thinking back to the center of mass lectures and how the water shifted the boats. Then my thoughts turned to torque and my paddle strokes which had nearly caused us to capsize earlier. One equation flashed through my head  T=rFsin(theta). I realized how to stabilize the boat without draining the meager amount of water leftover. Slowly, I slid down from the boats bench onto the hull, my legs immersing in water. Gingerly I tested paddling at that location. The boat lurched less. I had minimized the radius. I grabbed the other paddle and like I was in an awkward rowboat began to paddle towards the beach.

I remember watching my bloody leg hoping to god some giant yacht didn't pass by trailing a giant wake. I thought back on all of my dumb mistakes that lead me to that point and vowed to put more thought into my actions. Shortly after I landed on the beach and my cousin, who had been smart enough to waterproof her phone called the rest of the relatives. I finally pulled my dripping wet phone from my pocket to inspect it to find that it was dead, no surprise there. Always waterproof your electronics, saltwater is not kind. I apologized once again to my now traumatized cousin as she stepped in the car to go back. I stayed behind with someone a little more experience and paddled the canoe back.

&amp;#x200B;

As it turns out that island had been a wilderness refuge, and the people campers. I know I'm gonna get flak for trying to land there, but again I was a dumb 19 year old college kid looking for a once in a lifetime experience that I did end up getting, just not for what I thought. My cousin actually admitted that before the trip took a turn for the worse she had an awesome time and although hesitantly she did actually go out on the canoe for another less exciting canoe trip on the second to last day we were there. When I went back to school that fall I made a point to tell my physics professor what had happened and thanked her for teaching.",29Jul2020,1

49,"I'm in emotional pain. She's doing really well with her new guy. I wish I was able to give her that type of love, to provide her with that happiness. She was able to find someone pretty quickly, and I'm still struggling to even come with the terms with the fact that she's out of my life forever. I loved her, I wanted to marry her. She sacrificed a lot for me. She even went against her own views at times, because she loved me. I didn't do nearly enough. Am I an egotistical person? I should be happy that she's doing well. Instead, I'm miserable. I didn't do enough to keep her love. Maybe the failure is eating at me. Maybe I know that I have no chance at love in this small town I live in. Maybe I'm worried that I will never find love like that again. I hear time heals everything, but an embarrassing amount of time has past since the break up. It has been months. She ended it because of our differences. She wanted the type of person that goes to church all the time. She wanted a family person, not a career person. She broke up with me over text.

I can deal with the anger, through song and punching bag, I can’t help the pain, the pain at the back of your mouth every time i try to hold a tear back, the allergies, well when I get them, they’ll always be severe, sneezing every 10 seconds for sometimes two day is a row, least that’s what happened yesterday.

52,"Hello I'm a 25 year old (F) and an only child to my parents. I'm new to Reddit and this is my first post here. I decided to create an account here because I just wanted to talk. To someone. Anyone. My country has been in lock-down for a little over 4 months now and looking at the current situation Lord knows how much longer it's going to continue. I had quit my job right before the pandemic in March. Currently I'm trying to apply to business schools but honestly, I have little to no hope. I have a good academic record and scored a 700 in GMAT but my work profile is below average. At this point I have no clue about what I want to do in life. Everything seems unreal. I have no will, no energy, no motivation to continue. 

To give you a little background, I have been struggling with anxiety and panic attack issues for the last 12-13 years. I was first diagnosed with an anxiety disorder at 13. It comes and goes in phases, leaving me exhausted, with little or no confidence, no self esteem and depression. I had to seek help again a couple years ago due to a situation at work where I had to file a workplace harassment complaint against my supervisor. It left me feeling pathetic, he would constantly tell me that I was good for nothing and did nothing. I had to file a complaint because he started attacking me personally, started escalating me for reasons such as not picking his call at 2 AM in the morning, and eventually trying to coerce me to do things that would get me in legal trouble. The HR investigation was another hell. The supervisor and his managers put numerous false allegations against me such as I was complaining because I didn't want to work and that I was not capable for even an entry level job and that the company made a mistake hiring me. I had no idea how to deal with something like this. I was then diagnosed with clinical anxiety. To this day I get terrible anxiety with anything related to a job. I feel like I'm not good enough for anything. Twice in my life I have wanted to just not live because the panic attacks were so frequent and intense. Once during my teens (14-16) and once last year. 

I have great parents and good friends. I also have a boyfriend who is a wonderful person. I'm grateful and happy to have finally found a person who is with me because he loves me and cares about me. He has had a tough life, he is currently studying for his MD admissions and is constantly stressed because of that. My friends are also probably having a tough time and therefore I do not share anything them. I try to be in constant contact, checking on them but do not share my problems. I don't tell my parents because they get immensely worried and I just do not want to bother them so I pretend that everything is great. I have tried telling my boyfriend that i haven't been feeling good but there just seems to be a gap in understanding. It appears to me that he simply does not have the time or energy to listen to me. He ends up getting angry or irritated. As of today he has asked me to please leave him alone. I know he needs time and space.

I currently find myself feeling really lonely, no one to talk to, constantly anxious, at the verge of panic attacks, crying myself to sleep at night and have no energy or will to go forward with life. I get out of bed everyday because of my parents. I know they won't survive if something happens to me. I have no interest left in anything. I am exhausted. I have been dealing with this for more than a decade now and I don't think it will ever go away. Thank you to anyone who reads this. I hope I can come out of this stronger.",29Jul2020,1

To be at the top you have too see every failure and set back as a process too the greater goal.

My point back then really was about how embarrassing being an American was, admittedly without making much of a case of it. I was just so incredibly frustrated at the time I wanted to know I wasn't unjustified in how I felt, and got berated for that.

My mind has remained the same, I've spoke of how much I hated being American with friends over years and that was just the tip of the iceburg with all the things in this country that are simply broken or fucked.

Now, all of those issues have been put on high and everyone and their mothers across the planet realize it now. Now the most common phrase I hear come up in so many topics is the exact same, ""I hate being American.""

It breaks my heart. Not because I'm sad that others share the same feeling, but so many have lost blissful ignorance.

69,"I have bipolar disorder and PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). I am 33 and my husband will be 40 soon. We held off on TTC (trying to conceive) for close to ten years because a former psychiatrist told me that I should never bear a child. After moving and seeing a new one, she gave me hope that we could actually do it! I made the decision to try unmedicated. Worse thing I’ve ever done and she almost immediately started my meds back up. Yes, she did support my decision as she understood and with close supervision some women are able to manage it... I am not one of those women.

Thus ensued previous meds no longer being sufficient. I was hospitalized three times and have since been in therapy consistently and am on new medication. During all this, no criticism please, we had kept trying. I was finally getting to a good place when I had a CP. I was devastated and my husband decided he no longer wanted a child.

More therapy and heart to hearts with my husband and his own therapy, along with proper medication, and we’re both ready to try again! I’m cautiously hopeful. I’m well monitored. I’m the most stable I’ve been my entire life. I want this.

PCOS is making things difficult. We will be starting IUI (intrauterine insemination) in January. I’m so ready! We’ve discussed extensively how we’ll handle anything and everything that may come up. We’re both clear and together on how far we’re willing to go and what we’re willing to do.

So, during this time, I decided to start my own NGO to help children living in rural areas with no access to internet, help continue to learn and grow as individuals. Our world was simply not prepared for a pandemic- so it isn't quite shocking how our education system has been unable to cope with this crisis and change for those who were already on the margins.

Anyway, I think that everything is possible. However, the only reason that they might seem impossible is due to the difficulty that they present. 

In doing a task, one's skill level  will determine how good is the output result of said task.

Draw a stickman, even a child could do that. However, give a medical diagnosis, only those with the required skill and certification can properly produce it. 

We as humans can adapt to fill in the requirements presented by the task. 

In other words, some things seem impossible due to the difficulty and the heightened skill level required, both of which, we still have to adapt to.

On my workbench by the shed

And offered her some lavender

To make sure she was fed


She curtsied as a thank-you

And with a loping arc

Adjourned our summer meeting

With a trip into the park


She danced on every tree and leaf

And flower growing there

And although the bee was tiny

It freshened up the air


And with the bee exploring

The flowers found their chance

To spread around some summer love

Through the insect and her dance


A light breeze bid the pollen

Down into the farmer's fields

Where the weathered, nervous man

Contemplated August's yields


Little did the man know

There was no warrant for his fears

The corn grew taller than it had

In every other of his years


The surplus at the Warren farm

Made it's way to kids downtown

Who made a meal of cherry pie

And passed corn cobs around


And in the hearts of all the men

And women at this feast

There was a sense of gratitude

That helped to grow the peace


Now my poem is over

And I hope that you can see

All the good that blossoms

Just by feeding one small bee",29Jul2020,1

I thought I was in love with her, but she always made me feel bad. Often ""forgot"" (""forgot"", but really ignored in favor of other things) plans we had. 

She'd never show any interest in things I did or presented to her, always saying ""cool"", ""epic"" and stuff like that. While in return if I didn't react to things she presented me well enough, she'd ask me if I was ""ok"". 

After our first year together, I was completely down prioritzed by anything. I was always 2nd or even 3rd in line no matter the situation. 

Every time I was pushed aside, every time my interests and accomplishments were ignored, every time I was forgotten about a piece of me disappeared. It made me constantly worry about being good enough, and made me develop panic anxiety. 

Every time I talked about my problems, talked about my anxiety or stress, she was supportive for a few moments, and then completely forgot about it and went back to whatever she was doing. 

Only after I got rid of her, and found new friends have I come to realize all of this. When it went on, I just bottled all of it up, thinking it was ""just me exaggerating and overreacting"". She's made me lose friends I had before her, and now that I've regained them and a few new amazing ones - And felt what it's like to be cared about and worried about do I realize the hell she put me through.

A few weeks ago, a huge number of memories involving sexist comments/remarks/experiences resurfaced. For some reason, back then I didn't think twice about it, I just sort of normalized it. I think seeing AOC's speech kind of set me off, and I've realized that all of the things I've experienced weren't ""normal.""  


For instance, I was traveling with a group of guy friends and went out to grab some groceries alone when I was catcalled, harassed, and lots of people tried to find excuses to touch me. I felt really icky about it all, so when I went back to talk to my guy friends about it they laughed it off and said that ""I should be glad so many men have the courage to let them know they're interested in me.""   


This, along with so many others small comments made by male friends/coworkers, have started to build up in my brain and I'm just so mad. I'm so angry all the time. I was hanging out with some other friends of mine, telling them that I was excited about sticking around town for two years, and one guy's response was ""well, you know you can get pregnant in those two years. Then you'll be stuck here forever.""   


I don't know why, but that comment really set me off. We aren't dating or anything like that, he's just a friend of a friend. All of these people who've made these comments would consider themselves ""allies to women"" or ""feminists.""

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it. 

I drank a lot of water yesterday will that help?

118,"Happy Hump Day! You're halfway through the week. If you're an older man, you've already passed your mid-life crisis and now your next crisis involves your enlarged prostate.  Prostate enlargement affects many older men, so much in fact that by the time you're in your 50s, around half of men will have this condition, and almost 80%-90% of men in their 90s will have it. Prostate enlargement is also known as BPH (short for benign prostatic hyperplasia). 

Camels may benefit from large humps, but men unfortunately don't benefit from large prostates. Symptoms of prostate enlargement include frequent urination, poor or slow urinary flow, struggle to stop or start urination, urges, and dribble at the end of urination, among other unpleasant urinary symptoms. If left untreated, the prostate could grow so large as to completely block the urethra, and you would need to visit an emergency room from the complete inability to expel urine. Other consequences involve damage to kidneys and the bladder. 

As the month of July comes to a close, and we're halfway through the last week of July, we ask men and the people who are part of men's lives to help spread awareness of BPH. Encourage men to get regular health checks, encourage them to talk to their doctors, and encourage them to lead healthy lifestyles that can slow the aggravation of BPH. These remaining sunny days, you can also make your way to the park for a jog or a walk. Remember if you go to the park, wear sunscreen, practice social distancing and good hygiene, and drink plenty of water to stay cool. 

July is Parks and Recreation Month, and it's almost at its close, but parks will likely be open long after July if we do our part and maintain social distance and promote the proper maintenance of parks. Don't discard gloves and face coverings on the ground. 

If you're a man with BPH, getting that jog in can promote good health and maintenance of your body weight. If you're a man who likes the outdoors and nature, going to your local park may ease your mind. If you like nature, your prostate health may benefit from a natural solution for BPH such as UMOOZE. UMOOZE contains astragalus and soy extracts for promoting prostate health and may help reduce BPH symptoms such as frequent urination.

Again, happy hump day! Enjoy the rest of the week! ",29Jul2020,1

Amidst this time of fear and loss, I have taken this time to do some soul searching and earnest reflection. This has brought to light a particular rumination about myself that I thought I should share. To be free, to be me, I must speak.

I find myself not being hemmed into my desirability to just the other sex. I know these words can bring on a lot of queries, and many more emotions. I've realised that keeping that matter arrested in the confines of my subconscious has been more detrimental to my being in the long term. It pains me to write this, I grieve for the words back, knowing I can never take them back for myself.  “Is pain not a sign of a life lived? A hero relishes his wounds.” But for happiness, it is worth it.

 I implore you to remember, I am the still the same person you know. This revelation may lead to detachments with many, I know, though it doesn’t change the experiences and memories we shared. Good or bad, I will treasure them always. I know this isn't something that one can fathom with absolute certainty overnight. It is never choosing a side, a gender, it’s always a person, just a person.

It's not like I'm shitting on someone else on their post, I legit make a post on some conversation sub and they are coming to my post to type this. The entire point of the sub is to talk and then you try to shut down conversation. You clearly care enough to respond. And I never in the first place claimed that my opinions should matter to anyone else. And if the goal of my post is to have my opinions/thoughts changed or expanded upon, and you think you are so enlightened with your opinions, why can't you just help my ignorant ass then instead of flaming?

124,"I'm a mid 30's single mom. No skills on paper. I don't drive, no license.

I had a traumatic upbringing with starvation and molestation ect as a small child. Then spent time in foster care with traumatic experiences, then I was adopted. It wasn't a great experience either.

As an adult I sought love above everything else. I choose a husband that was abusive. I left college after 2 semesters.

I've been working on myself. I've done counseling, and meditation retreats. I've been working on my trauma. It turns out I'm a great mom, learning what not to do... Unless you count the part where I don't make enough money to care for them. My children's father does not pay child support.

I'm working on my credit, mid 600's. No real savings.I am creative. I can write, do graphic design, video editing, audio editing, product creation, project management, virtual assistant work. These are all fine, but the income isn't a lot and it isn't steady.

I'm on government assistance.

I've been working on feeling safe for so much of my life, now it feels like I'm starting at the beginning of life, except of course I'll be 40 soon!

I've never had anyone to ask ""What do I do?"" or give me direction. So I'm asking, how can I start to improve my life? How can I make an income to take care of my children on my own?

I feel like such a failure at life. I feel like a bad human. Where do I start? I feel too late for college. I've never been good at math...

134," Bon Appétit, formally a great cooking youtube channel, now a husk of its previous self.  Look at them, accusing each other about being racist and homophobic and apparently not paying their employees enough (despite them all doing fairly well for themselves in New York City.)  

Racking in 50k a year but bitching about not being payed for the youtube work they do.  Seems suspect to me.  Sohla is at the for front, and I like her, but shes claiming shes not being paid for her youtube content.  Maybe that is true, but simultaneously she agreed to do it and has been doing videos for a while, with a smile on her face.  If she was aware she wasn't being paid why did she agree to do them if it she supposedly did not want to?  I bet this is all happening now due to the pandemic.  Working from home is stressing the staff out and their jobs are becoming uncertain.  We are not getting the whole story here.  

She and some of her co-workers got their editor in chief canned.  the editor in chief appears in a few  Bon Appétit videos and he seems like a douche so I understand why they did a mutiny against him.  They also found an old Instagram pic of him dressed as a Puertorican at a Halloween party just to guarantee he would resign in case the pay angle didn't work.  It is pretty obvious to me that is a mutiny first and foremost.  

They also went after the host Alex Delaney who is also a high ranking member of the staff.  He is in trouble for a confederate flag cake he made as a teenager and a vine of him saying ""faggot"" in the context of a lame joke about sticks.   Basically Delaney and the boss man are douchy and are having a mutiny against them.

One of there weaker points was a complaint about how  Bon Appétit does not feature enough POC and BIPOC food.  That is pretty doubious claim, how does one quantify ""enough""? It can not be done when people bring up the POCs.  When the POCs are out there is no point trying to reason.  And when the BIPOCs are out it's just redundant.  It could be 50/50 POC food and cracker-ass-cracker food and they would not be satisfied.  It could be 90/10 POC food and they would say that is still to much wypipo for their liking.  

The company as well as the accused are making ""sincere"" apologies.  The kind of apology after one has been caught fucking up and are trying to save face.  Personally I don't think these types of apologize help.  Everybody that is mad is gonna stay mad forever.  

They need to sort this shit out then get back to making videos.  I don't care about any of their office drama.",29Jul2020,1
135,"Hey guys, 

Wanted to vent a little bit cause I don't know how to feel. 

Me and my EX moved a little bit fast when we started seeing each other, I moved to her house 2 months after I've seen her. At the beginning everything was fine and everything was new, but after a while I started feeling too confortable and started to get tired of her. I know this is kinda bad to say but I even started texting other girls again while I was living with her.

After 2 years we reached a point that was enough... There was no sexual tension, nothing. We just woke up, eat and sleep. There was no excitement in our lifes... Now that everything ended I feel kinda ansious and I don't know if it was all my fault for this. I liked her as a person, but I feel like that I didn't love her... 

Feeling bad is normal at this point or does it mean I have feelings for her? I feel kinda insecure cause I'm almost doing 31 and I don't want to feel to ""old"" to meet someone. I'm good looking and a funny character but I don't know If I made a mistake or if this was normal to act if I didn't loved her.",29Jul2020,1
