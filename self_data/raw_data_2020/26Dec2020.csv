19,"Warning: This might be a long one. 

So this year has been hell, just like for everyone else.  And it’s been pretty stressful on my 6 year old. The first tough bit was not being able to go to school and see her friends after March break. Then We ended up having to move out of our apartment (the only home she remembers) in late August due to a waste pipe leak and a really bad mold issue. We had to move in with my in-laws, who are going to renovate their basement into an apartment for us, but for now it’s me, my wife, our kid and dog all in one room for now. Then school starts and we end up doing remote learning, which she’s adapted to well enough but still provides its challenges. All these changes has been very stressful on her, but she’s a resilient little girl. 

One thing she started doing almost every night with her grandfather is go out to the front yard with a bag full of treats to hand out to all the dogs going on their evening walks. She’s made a lot of puppy friends, and I didn’t realize how much of an impact she was having with her treats and cheerful demeanour until she received gift after gift from the owners of every dog in the neighbourhood. It really made me realize how wonderful her kindness is and how much everyone she meets appreciates and enjoys her. 

The next thing was last night, Xmas Eve. During the week she had an online winter camp and made a little reindeer ornament. So on top of leaving milk and cookies for Santa  (as well as carrots for each reindeer) she insisted on wrapping up the ornament she made and leaving for Santa. Although she was extremely grateful and excited for every gift she got, it’s her insistent generosity that really makes me proud of her and makes me feel like I haven’t screwed up completely as a parent. 

Happy Holidays everyone",26Dec2020,1
20,"Hey, all. I am typing here so I can avoid punching the mirror in my bathroom.

All my life, I've had dental issues. Prone to cavities, weak teeth, overbite, spaced, etc. I even have a dental infection that my previous dentist did not even touch. (Oh, but they fixed my sister's teeth, no problem! She always got better care...) And having severely botched dental work and traumatic incidences nearly every visit added to my mounting anxiety. My own biological father skipped out on fixing my teeth and my family was going from one bad living situation to another...

The thing is, I had a plan; I was going to get my teeth fixed so I could finally smile.

Then, my mom got aggressive cancer, which choked her throat internally. I tried to care for her, but she regressed, went to the hospital, writhed on the operating table (intubation failed), and died. Had to cancel the appointment I had.

Then, COVID happened. Dentist I had got sick. That was cancelled.

2020 was the worst year of my life and I don't want 2021 to be the same way...

My teeth, despite brushing and caring for them, are damaged. I need them fixed. I'll pay monthly, I don't care. 

And yet, I'm too damn scared to get a consultation. I know what needs to be done; I just want someone to knock me out and fix my teeth because I don't think I can look at a dentist without fearing for my safety. 

I've asked my family (they all refused, told me to *pray!*) Reddit, Twitter, my boss, my PCP, who never followed up --- several avenues --- for help.  Travel isn't an option, I refuse to get sick.

I've put in so much effort into reaching out, I'm tired. I'm afraid I'll never fix them. I just want to look in the mirror and smile and I avoid my fucked-up face as soon as I see a mirror. I'm already insecure (curly/kinky hair, identity issues, etc. I'm in counseling but it's my fault, apparently) and this dental crisis is likely my biggest issue.

I always joked that if I got my teeth fixed, I wouldn't need therapy, but I think I'm starting to believe that now...

Thank you for reading my late-night rant. I have work in the morning (retail) and I can't even get some rest because I'm now watching my nieces who are no older than three.

P.S. - I'm miserable, and my family has their own issues. Talking to them hasn't helped, lately. I'm starting to feel like no one cares about my health or my well-being. And on top of that, my 'therapist' is rushing therapy so she can discharge me in April, so I'm being abandoned again. Great.",26Dec2020,1
21,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

One instance she said she booked me in for a practice interview and I just looked down and nodded and she said annoyed ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ when I didn’t mean it like that 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

💡She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


◾️I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

27,"Humans are inherently animalistic in nature. We are all self-centered at our core, it is inevitable. It's long-ingrained in not only us, but all creatures, as our goal is to survive, and reproduce. Humans are the only animals that can think on a higher level, even our closest relatives- the gorillas, have trouble with the concept of self-awareness and many other pre-requisites to sapience. We're also *incredibly* adaptive, we evolve rapidly generation by generation as our surroundings change drastically, whereas animals like dogs are still on most levels, the same animal. There's a reason dog behavior is much easier to deal with than human behavior. This means that it's extremely difficult to control humans. Where many animals fall dormant in strict captivity, humans not only adapt, but strive to overcome. Prison escapes are more common than you might realize. Revolutions are a bi-product of our adaptivity.

An apt metaphor is that humans are water. We can adapt to any shape, but when we're over-stressed- we spill out. We will always find a way around boundaries- whether they be a threat to our species, our kin, or strict governmental regulation.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans are inherently depraved, and trying to control them is pointless. No amount of laws or regulations can keep humans in check, and there's evidence to support that after a certain point, it can actually have the opposite intended effect. Those who are cunning will find loopholes, or even completely avoid opposition entirely, those with resources even moreso. But in the end, we're all still animals at heart. We have the ability to care for those around us, but most people are self-centered at their core. They care for the well being of them and theirs, and everything else is secondary. Some people will use false altruism as a way to raise their status- finding excuses to never contribute to solutions themselves, but will gladly find an ""enemy"", and blame all of their problems on them. This is an example of inherent tribalism that's ingrained in us all from millennia of struggle.

We are strong, but nature is beyond strength.

30,"So this is my first post on Reddit, ever. Please be gentle. 

TL;DR I got friend-zoned by a girl I was dating and now I’m more scared to tell her how I feel than just ghost her.  

Earlier this year I met this girl, and she is a really great person, she and I have so many common interests. We started talking not long after we met, and next thing you know, I’m helping her get over her ex, and she did the same for me. (4 years with an overly manipulative/cheating partner.) I started to feel like myself again around her, but just before the time we decided to try and be something more, she slept around with a couple other people.Typically I’d would have been pissed, but her birth father passed away not long before, so I don’t blame her for not being in the right state of mind. But at the same time, she completely betrayed my trust. We kinda stopped talking after that, but something kept drawing me towards her. So I decided to bite the bullet, figuring what could possibly happen worst case? Fast forward a couple months and now here we are, as of lately we’ve been talking and she just sees me as her “best friend”. She’s claimed that she doesn’t want to “ruin our friendship” because she “doesn’t want to lose me.” But then I catch her looking at me, staring, like she wished she could have let it play out. I feel so torn over my “best friend”. I want to tell her I love her and how much I want to take her away from all of her problems, but I’m not sure she feels the same way. I have tried my luck with others, but something always brings me back to her. Maybe I should just be her friend, or maybe I’m the one to put a ring on her finger. I’m not sure, I just need a point in the right direction and she sure as hell doesn’t help. Any advise you can give me?",26Dec2020,1
31,"I feel that I am a lot more cautious with Covid than my partner and its put so much strain on our relationship. Today is our 7 months and we’ve literally been together since this all started. We are very strong, super solid as a couple. Healthiest relationship I’ve had. We are early 20s, both living at home and can only see each other so often.

We had plans to be together on Christmas and I made sure he was being extremely careful throughout the month (gloves, no contact with anyone not family, etc etc), so we could be safe. When we are together we don’t wear masks or distance to to make up for the risk we are extra diligent elsewhere.

Well, his brother came from a whole other state where I was bad unexpectedly and ruined things. My bf told me that his brother was being safe, and wasn’t exposed to too many people. I highly doubt that because his family isn’t that cautious, and regardless I don’t care because he didn’t quarantine for two weeks before coming. Since he is staying over there and definitely isn’t masked up I told my BF I can’t see him for two weeks then. Christmas, New Years both ruined. 

A lot of emotions were felt and now he feels upset with me because he feels that I am too stiff and that I’m treating him like he has it. I want to comfort him, but yeah, I kind of have to. My grandma could get sick and being around him would make me uncomfortable. Plus if he got covid he is immunocompromised and without insurance. I’m feeling like the crazy one here.

I want this relationship to work but its driving me insane. I just wanted a small holiday that was relatively safe and his brother came and ruined it and he is mad at me, not him.

32,"Will men not respect me because of my sexual history?

When I was 16, this senior 18, John took me out with his friends. We went to a party that was wasted. He and two of his friends had sex with me. They called me a gross and ugly after. They ignored me for a while. John kept hooking up with me. Before all that happened, he was helpful to me and would hang out with me after he would only have sex with me if he was drunk and ignore me the rest of the time. He would never want to talk to me only about sex.
He left for the military over the years he kept in contact with me and saw me when he came home sometimes. He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me. I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond. He always implied that I was attractive enough to fuck but not date.




He would also imply that I'm weird or annoying. When I was 17, I tried talking to him about the trouble I was having at school. At first, he was sympathetic but then told me to speak to someone else. Because of what happened I was bullied in school, I tried to talk to him because I was lonely. After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more.




That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken. He still tries to contact me trying to cheat on his girlfriend with me or see me again. I try to ignore him then he'll bombard me with texts it works to face time me. I moved away and didn't talk to anyone he knows. He still keeps photos of me and sends them to me, asking if I miss this. I feel so used and dirty. Something must be so wrong with me.





I blew up at him and blocked him finally. He was messaging me begging for pics, and he now lives with his girlfriend. I feel sick. He recently emailed me saying hey I called him a rapist, a waste of space, ugly, a coward, an awful person. I want this person to stop contacting me. I feel terrible. I haven't seen him for five years, but he still keeps original photos he took of me as a teenager he's says he took them because he thought I wouldn't mind.I thought he would have stopped when I blew up at him last time.




He acts like I'm a rude cause he says he's just like that and he's never done anything wrong to me. He even said,”I was drunk too. I didn’t take advantage of you. You just made the mistake of fucking me apparently. Yeah sorry I didn’t hit you up after but what did you expect? You think I haven’t been dealing with shit too? You think you’re the only one who’s got problems? Grow up. Stop taking out all your anger on me. I’m sorry I just use you for sex but I thought that was a part of our relationship that was mutually understood. Apparently not, once again.”




One time when I blew up at him, and he left me alone for a couple of months coming back trying to apologize to me then to come on to me sexually then I went off hard on him calling him scum and saying I wish he were dead also, he lives with his girlfriend Am I a mean person for sending these messages?",26Dec2020,1

37,"Sorry if this is frequently asked around here. I didn't really know where else to post this.

I'm 22, and have no experience with women. I have female friends in my social circle, and have no problem to converse with them. It's when I have to ask someone out. 

I have never had the confidence to do that. And when I'm home, I don't really care for it. I'm on a short vacation with my cousins right now, at a hill station, and you can call this place somewhat romantic. Most people here are around my age, early to late twenties. Here, I've felt this longing, to ask some stranger out, talk, exchange numbers, and if possible also have a casual fling. I don't really know how to do that. And if I think of even making a move, I start to palpate, and my heart starts beating really fast. Am I really that fucking horny? Or is this something else?

I'm fairly atheltic and would say okay looking, and have good manners. I am pretty short though, 5'3, but I don't really let that stop me from doing anything. It sometimes comes in the way of my confidence,but I know there's more to me so I try not to focus up on that. 

So...What do I do? How do I make small talk with others? How do I strike up a conversation? I feel I'm really bad at that,and long pauses just feel awkward, which I feel would be inevitable with me.

I know it's late in the West, being from India that feels like a disadvantage to ask questions here, lol.

38,"I want to quit my job. It's an amazing job and I really don't want to lose it, but I can't focus anymore and everything feels overwhelming. I've started abusing alcohol a few weeks ago at night to forget and stop ruminating. I feel like even that doesn't work, though, and I end up crying uncontrollably often. I'm afraid my suffering is hurting my partner too, even though they say their just worried about me...

I'm stuck in my head and I want to get out. As a teenager I used to think that I would never get to stop existing outside of who I am was the most horrifying and painful obvious truth. Luckily, I learned things that make me feel even worse since then. I hate that I can't stop this train of thought in my head. I used to cut but I stopped when it wasn't helping anymore. I don't know why I'm struggling so much, I must be a failure.

I tried seeing a therapist recently and they were useless. We had zero connection. I always feel like people are cringing at me. I try to cover my entire body except my hands when I leave my house to protect myself, but even then I know people think I look strange. People honestly terrify me. I used to get by (with sweaty palms and lots of blushing) but quarantine hasn't helped. I'm afraid people think I'm a creep so I just try to stay by myself.

I don't know what to do with myself. I feel like I'm drowning and I'm not even trying to stop it. Why shouldn't I quit my job? I have savings. I don't want unemployed. I'm afraid of becoming homeless. I know they know I'm not doing well at work, so maybe I won't even have a choice.",26Dec2020,1

41,"Letter to my former friends:

A few of you took me as a predator.  You felt as though I was preying on your emotional vulnerability, and that I was trying to make sexual advances on you.  Learning this from someone else was quite the shock.  Not once did I approach you with sexual advances, nor did I ever intend to do so.  My life is empty, devoid of meaningful, intimate friendships.  I always seek to build ones that are lasting, so I use language to convey my intent in wanting unconditional, loving and accepting friendships.  I know what it’s like to suffer alone, what it’s like to be alone, and if I can offer a friend a shoulder to lean on, or an ear to listen during the darker times, so they aren’t alone in those darker times, I do it.  Maybe my intentions were taken the wrong way, but I made you uncomfortable and for that I do apologize.

What I do not accept however, is how you all decided to label me, and ghost me, without an opportunity to defend myself, or hear any of the accusations of proof that you have against me, to provide context into what I was saying.  I’ve never had intentions to make sexual advances towards any of you, I’ve no interest in online relationships or online sexting, those things don’t interest me especially in a discord group amongst other gamers I wanted to be friends with.  I do not appreciate being told you were my victims, because such an accusation is something I do not take lightly.  I watched my mother and various women get manipulated by men, abused, escaping and running away to seek refuge from abusive men.  Not once did I ever in my life want to be a man like that.  I abhor the very idea of it, it’s so triggering that I’ve been out of work for months due to memories being dug up through therapy.

There are also things about me that none of you know.  Things such as my sexuality, in addition to my nearly full time a sexuality, that is none of your business, but had you known these things, you would’ve maybe not been so quick to accuse me of such vile things.  To be told that you were terrified of me cut me to my core.  What did I say or do that was so bad?  I did nothing but try to offer my platonic, unconditional love and friendship, and you all took that and accused me of manipulation and predatory actions.  I say this bluntly with no offense intended, but none of you are worth any energy to me in a romantic pursuit.  None of you are worth the time and energy it would take for me to pursue you.  None of you know me, which is why it must have been so easy to accuse me, ghost me, and treat me like trash.  

I thought I made friends, but you just reinforced in me the deeply imbedded idea that I’m better off alone, without friends, because I’m constantly misunderstood, used for support but not offered the same in return.  If I mess up, I’m willing to admit it.  No, the world isn’t out to get me, the world is indifferent to me and you.  But if I mess up, have the decency if you are my friend, to confront me and get to the bottom of it, not accuse me and ghost me.  None of you deserve a second chance after what you did, not that I’m asking for one, I want none of you in my life ever again.  

Not every man trying to befriend a woman is interested in her sexually.  Not every man is a fuck boy trying to get laid.  My whole life I have been looked at as a freak because of the sins of other men.

45,"The last time I logged in was in September.

It was like nobody noticed I had left. Everyone was just business as usual (as it should be, I suppose). There were no notifications, no messages, nothing. Not for me. I guess it's narcissistic to think that anybody would bother. I don't know why this upsets me so much. I had an inkling that nobody really gives a shit but I guess I never internalized it before.

I've been fighting my depression all my life. Sometimes it gets bad. Sometimes it's triggered, made worse by whatever shit thing happened to me that day. I don't know how many times I've almost lost to depression, how many times I've made plans to lose to it. It occurs to me that it wouldn't really matter if I lost to it or not.",26Dec2020,1

51,"&gt;Since my highschool, and throughout my undergraduate, masters, PhD and now postdoc, I have been suffering from low confidence and self esteem. I have so many regrets (I feel as if I made all wrong choices in my life, resulting in my current situation. I chose the wrong branch of engineering, I chose to do masters, I chose to not wait until I get a decent job offer and took the easiest low pay job available, I chose to not apply for more graduate schools for my PhD and I chose to not do enough graduate courses and be unmotivated during my PhD.....)

&gt;In highschool, I hated circuits and programming, so I did not choose electrical or computer engineering during undergrad. I wanted to do mechanical engineering but I did not get selected for the field in my desired university. I got metallurgical engineering and materials science instead. I hated my first two years of undergrad. Later, I hated myself for not working hard during the first two years. I graduated with a low GPA and low confidence. But I had fallen in love with my field. I went for masters as I wanted to do serious research. I did not choose hot topics like battery technology or solar energy as I found them uninteresting and too much chemistry but I chose conventional topics for my research like metal deformation and computational materials science. 

&gt;I later opted for a low pay job because I just wanted a job till I get a PhD offer. I left the job in 4 months because I didn't like it. I did not go for another job as I was determined to do a PhD. As a result, I have 8 months of gap in my employment. I did not apply for many graduate schools as I did not want to spend more money. I ultimately got accepted in one school. It was not my dream school. Somehow, I felt unmotivated when I started my PhD. I had this feeling for the first two years, after which I became serious about my research. I did not take enough courses as I feared failure in difficult courses. I have poor social skills so I did not make many friends or take part in university clubs. I failed to improve myself over the past 5 years. 

Now here I am. I got my PhD this year. I am still searching for a job. I am currently a postdoc but I need a change and stability. I don't feel confident about my skills. I have a poor CV and the job market for my field of engineering is not great. I don't know whether I can amount to anything significant in the future. I am 32 and I feel sad for my parents. They want me to succeed.
I have dated in the past, but never been in a relationship. This bothers me a lot too.

That's all that have been bothering me. I promise from this moment onwards, I don't look back at my regrets, weaknesses and failures. I am looking forward. I am working hard. I will achieve my goals in the next 180 days (24th June 2021). I will get a good job and have a relationship with a wonderful woman. 

I am going to be the man who would have made my childhood self proud.

See you on 24th June 2021.",26Dec2020,1

I got ditched by all my friends during the pandemic and have been the target of some mean things, and I’m just waiting for high school to be over. I don’t have a lot of people to talk to right now, so I just wanted to post here to tell someone.",26Dec2020,1
53,"I'm a 33-year-old man. I am finishing up college (undergrad - engineering) from a highly ranked university and I locked in an offer from a company with a base salary of over 100k but I feel lonely as hell. I sacrificed everything to come to this point, I didn't date, I didn't socialize much, and although I feel accomplished I feel depressed when I look back at my 20's.

Coming from a poor family, I had worked a lot after I graduated high school, I often juggled work and school, worked two jobs, worked overtime, I had to drop out of school to work extra to help my family and stuff for a period of time, which explains why I'm graduating at the age of 33.

Early 20's - I was attending a community college while I was working, I dropped out to work extra to help my family. Mid 20's - I was looking for ways to make money or advance my career/life without a college degree. I was depressed about my self-worth, I isolated myself from people. I was a little depressed but I always had a full-time job. Mid-late 20's to now: I decide to come back to school because I figure my life wasn't getting anywhere while working dead-end jobs. I juggled school and work again but I actually did stellarly and end up transferring. After I transfer, I realize that obtaining the degree alone is not worth it and engineering in the future so I switch majors, look for role-model friends who can guide me to build up my resume so I can get jobs and internships. So It took me longer than it should have as I anticipate graduating in the spring of the upcoming new year. I became really focused and fixated on finding internships and getting jobs. I ended up with one internship and I also locked in a job offer which I will start after I graduate.

Some people can do it all, work hard, play hard, have fun, and be successful at the same time. I'm not one of those people and I had to pick one and this is the result. I never had a ""wild phase"", I am quite vanilla and rather disciplined. It wasn't forced upon me but I did it to myself. I was always about bettering myself, self-reflecting, I have made friends, I'm not socially awkward but I feel quite lonely at the moment, and ""I missed out on life in 20's"" is a chip on my shoulder that I can't get rid of at the moment. I'm not going to squander my earnings all of sudden either, I'm going to be moderate, save and invest for better future. I'm also afraid that lacking dating experience puts me at a disadvantage when I start dating after I start work, out of fear that I might be seen as weird or something is wrong with me.

TLDR: I sacrificed my 20's social and love life to better my education and career but I feel lonely and ""missing out in my 20's"" feels like a chip in the shoulder for a man in his early 30's",26Dec2020,1

73,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

One instance she said she booked me in for a practice interview and I just looked down and nodded and she said annoyed ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ when I didn’t mean it like that 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

💡She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


◾️I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

I am so sorry for all of you. I know just how you feel.

My wife left at the beginning of the year. I have posted about this already. Her leaving could be considered a good thing because she brought so many problems for my household, but even if she wasn't a good wife, she was my best friend. We did everything together for 7 years.

And then Covid hit, and I began working from home. I've gone a week or longer without having conversations with people.

I have had feelings of hurting myself. A LOT of feelings. It scares me because it's so often. I've reached out to family members and asked them to check on me, and no one has. Not in months. 

I reached out to my church and they did not reply. I talked to 3 of the church leaders over a 3 month period. Each promised to stay in touch, and no one has. Not one single phone call. 

My best mate of 12 years is not answering his phone. I talked to him one time over Facebook and he's going through some really bad times himself, but he does not want to share. He has holed himself up completely. 

I had hoped that Someone would call or text me for Christmas, but no one did. And then to make things worse, my brother posted pics this morning of Christmas dinner at his house and my Dad was there. I never even got a text. I'm only 20 minutes away. 

I haven't had any arguments with anyone. There is no conflict, I'm just forgotten. No one remembers that I'm here.

I'm prior military and served during desert storm. People think I'm too strong to be this way but im so broken. I am 1 or two thoughts away from crying every minute of every day. I'm drinking too much but nobody knows.

I just don't know what to do or what I did.

I'm so sorry for anyone else that is feeling this way.",26Dec2020,1
80,"Sorry for the long read, hope it's worth it! In middle school and my first few years of high school, I was relentlessly bullied by this guy. It started on the first day of middle school when I hadn’t had my hair cut all summer. He started calling me a bitch, sissy, girl etc. I live pretty close to the school but in the short journey he'd make me start to well up, slapping me and then taunting me ""aw you aren't gonna cry are you?"". At the time I was a really quiet kid and had crippling anxiety about almost everything, so I didn’t stand up for myself. His dickhead friends were always with him and they just did the same, or messed with my bag. 

Over the next few months I found out how shitty it really is to live your life knowing every day is going to be hell. Every day, even after I got my hair cut (which I did pretty quickly, hoping it would stop) he would call me “girl hair” and take my stuff and push me around. The teachers either never noticed or didn't and I was too nervous and scared all the time to tell anyone. It went on all through middle school, and I thought I could escape it into high school. Yeah, no. 

I ended up skipping school a lot. I destroyed the letters the school sent, but obviously they soon rang our house phone and I knew I was in trouble. But I just told my dad I couldn't go anymore, it was too painful. All of the things I'd been keeping inside spilled out. But I still couldn't say who it was. What if he came round to my house and hurt me?? I moved to a different school and didn't see him for years.

I found myself doing much better in college - no more asshole bullies, and groups where I could meet my kind of people. I was weak as hell for all of my youth, but in my first year of college a friend introduced me to Muay Thai, which I fell in love with. We also took up BJJ classes in the second year. This combined with a regular gym routine transformed me from a doughy wimp to a fit 185lbs, no Conor Mcgregor but more than capable of handling my own. But most of all I was no longer a doormat and actually respect myself now. That's a story for another thread however.

Anyway, on Christmas Eve I was coming back from a friend's house (yeah, social distancing...I know), and heard a voice mumble ""spare some change?"" and didn't think much of it. I live in a city with a big homeless problem. Then however I thought why not, it's Christmas, the guy needs a break. So I go over to this guy, pull $10 out my wallet and give it to him. He thanks me and I say no problem, must suck being homeless at christmas. He started to talk to me, saying how quickly it all happened, etc. He mentioned going to our school (the roof is visible from where he was begging). I asked his age, and at that point my brain clicked. I asked his name then to make sure, and my suspicions were confirmed, it was him!

Anyway, we spoke for a while, I asked if he remembered me but he said he didn't. I kept hinting at it, asking ""you know?"" after individually listing the things he'd done to me. I felt such fucking excitement and resurfaced anger, this guy was in my palm now. 15 year old me was avenged. I called him EVERYTHING I wanted to, now he was the bitch, the rat-face, the human scum. Whatever drug he was on seemed to have slowed his mental faculties, so I decided to treat him to a less ""psychological"" punishment. I made sure no one was around, and kicked him as hard as I could. Then a few times more for good measure. I stamped on him, at this point he curled up in a ball. I told him what he was a few more times, and looked down at him.

I was still tipsy and the drinks I'd had at my friends had gone straight through me. I needed to piss bad, so I just unzipped my jeans, and let fly all over his body. I picked up his coin cup and took his shoes, leaving him there drenched and hunched over, gurgling in pain. Fuck it feels good to get even. Merry fucking Christmas!!!",26Dec2020,1

84,"When I was in school I was always a rebel of everything, cringe activities, teachers, education etc. I have had an average score throughout the academics, I was pretty famous in my school for my humour everybody wants to seat next to me not because I was an extraordinary person but I was entertainment for them. I started understanding the world and human psychology.
 Then after 11th, I started living isolated. And when I was in college I had no friends not even single friend. I was depressed, I would cry, I was always sad. I didn't know why. I would go to the theatre, a long drive, staying up till 5 am every day, junk food I was ruined. But I was independent, strong and fearless. Then something horrible happened in my life. I was 19yo, one day I was watching a movie, I was going to drink water I was feeling dizzy and I sat down I was unconscious and my cousin was with me then I went to hospital did CT scan and after sometimes this same happened it was Stroke I went to coma. I woke world was different I couldn't speak, write or read. I am 23yo I am still recovering from Stroke. But I am not same I was.
I had big dreams like being tony stark, then entrepreneur, then music artist, having a great job. The more I grow up the less energy I have to accomplish something. Not because I can't achieve something but it is because I am average. 
Now today I regret not having any talent, wealth, IQ. I want to do something great. But I still can't figure out I want, like. I like philosophy, music, stock market but I am nothing. Now I know I will never be wealthy, being called a genius, intellectual. No girl would date me.  I know I will never be an extraordinary person. I don't know how to be happy. I am weak I can't drive. Now I am fragile. I know I won't live a long life. That's how now my mediocre life is. I don't know why I writing this. The only thing I have know is loneliness.
I am just a ticking clock. I escape through music, films, games, books. I wanted to have a good life. What is your experience? How is your life? What matters in the end?

85,"I've always hated Christmas. In my family, it was always a stressful and toxic event. Think drunks and drug addicts and religious fundamentalists. Fights and tears and the occasional car accident or overdose.

I've never managed to skip the family Christmas; none of us have. It's expected and enforced.

This year was going to be different. This year I was able to sit it out because of Covid. My partner (of 15 years) and I were going to get to have our very own Christmas. For the first time in my life, I didn't get socked with the annual crushing depression that would normally start after Halloween. I was even a little excited. I made a list of Christmas movies to watch. 

Things got derailed a bit because I came down with a bad cold last week. I stayed home from work so I didn't end up running the errands I had intended. The house was a mess. We didn't decorate. But hell, it's just the two of us, and that didn't really matter. I had gifts to give him and the ingredients for a gorgeous roast beef dinner. We would watch movies and have cocoa and it would be great.

Yesterday I got up at 2 a.m. to try to pull things together. Cleaned the house while my partner slept. When he woke up around 6 I could tell right away that it wasn't going to be a magical day. He has some type of mood or personality disorder; no formal diagnosis beyond depression and anxiety, but that's because he's never asked for one. It's there, though.

He was being a little contrary to start. Made comments about how I was late on everything. Made a comment about the trash I had bagged but not taken out. Made a bunch of mean or gross jokes at my expense. None of this is out of the ordinary for him. I knew I'd need to be on my game to keep things cheerful, but I thought I could do it.

He wanted to delay opening presents to get in the mood. Fine, cool. We watched A Christmas Story. He offered to make breakfast, although when that time came he pouted about it, but whatever. I wasn't going to give him an opening to blow. I kept my cheerful face on. I made a couple comments to him that I could tell he was looking for a fight but wouldn't give him one.

When we opened gifts, he sulked a little because what I had gotten him was undeniably better than what he had gotten me (my big present was a clothing steamer. His big present was a handmade leather messenger bag). It didn't really matter though; I'm not a gift person, I like sensible things. I am always trying to unwrinkle my clothes. It was fine.

By midmorning I texted my best friend my bet on the timeline of the coming meltdown. I had guessed that he would pull it together a little after dinner and wait until the next morning to blow up. I like betting on these timelines. It's some kind of consolation prize to prove to myself that I can stay a step ahead of him.

But the meltdown came that night, the very moment dinner hit the table. He'd had a call with his parents, who I have never met and who he sees every couple of years. It didn't go well I guess.

When dinner was done I went into the room where he had been on the phone and told him it was ready. He was laying in bed, which he does a lot of, and gave me a little thumbs up.

I went back to the kitchen and since he hadn't followed me out I decided to make our plates. Plates done, I brought them to the table. Still no partner, so I went back to the room.

""Are you going to come eat?"" He groaned. At that point I was annoyed. I didn't really think anything serious was going on; it's always like pulling teeth to get him to do anything. So I snapped a little. I said ""well I would appreciate it if you did, I put some work into this.""

He comes out, sits down, and stares at his plate. I asked ""are you just not hungry, or are you not feeling well?"" I was afraid he had come down with my cold.

And that was it, the spark that lit the fuse. ""I don't fucking feel good! In case you haven't figured it out, that phone call didn't go well! I don't want to talk about it- I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going to talk to you about it, but it was terrible!""

Is everyone ok? Is someone sick? Did someone die? ""No! everyone's fine! I'm not going to talk about it!""

Then he ate. Shoveled that food into his mouth in absolute rage. My $40 roast, perfectly medium-rare. He just shoveled it in. Then he covered himself up with a blanket- a thing he does when he's upset- and went silent. That was it. He let the cat eat his dessert.

I eventually left him cloaked on the couch and took a bath and drank wine and cried in the tub.

I am done with Christmas. With holidays. I've already stricken my birthday from the calendar for similar reasons, and now I am done with all of it. It leaves me open and vulnerable. I stress for weeks trying to plan, hoping I'll get it right this time, and it's never ever been right. 

I was an abused child who grew into an abused adult. I've been walking on eggshells my entire life and I don't know any other way. 

I am tired. Too tired, too old and broken to even dream of starting over. I've wasted my entire life. It was never going to be any different. It was always going to end up like this. I was groomed to end up like this.

On Christmas of 2018 I made a decision: I was done with everything. I was not going to spend another year here. The kids I had always played Aunty to had gotten older. My friends had gotten it together. I wasn't getting anymore calls to talk anyone off a ledge or to lend money for the electric bill or to help put a birthday party together because Daddy was on the lam again. They were settled. I'd fulfilled my duties. I was done.

I made a plan and worked on it all year. How I'd do it, where, when. Hanging, hotel room, October. I'd bring a kiddie pool to put underneath me for any mess. Hang a sheet in front of the motel room door to shield the scene. Hang a note on the sheet in English, Spanish and Hmong: do not enter, dead body here, call 911. I didn't want to traumatize a housekeeper. Didn't want to contaminate the room, for the owners to have to bring in the crime scene cleaners. I'd make sure the police could take the whole scene with them. The room would be ready to let by the next day.

In July of that year, my lifelong best friend was in an accident along with her son, my godson. He was fine, she was wrecked. I spent three days in the ICU holding her hand. I had her blood on my clothes for the first two days. I didn't sleep for 50 hours or so. Next came months of inpatient rehab. The calls from the ledge started again. She struggled so hard. 

I knew I had to stay; I couldn't add to her pain just then. 

In the little more than a year since I've gotten a government job. My life insurance is more than a decade's salary. I'm worth more dead than alive. This weighs on me. That policy could give my godson, my partner, my family more than I ever could. I could do better by my loved ones by dying than I ever will in life.

I sincerely wish I had followed through in 2019. This whole year, I could have missed all of it.

This is not a suicide note. I am not back to making plans. But I wish I was dead. I have wished I was dead every day of my life, every single one. I tried to hang myself with a jump rope at 3. I wish I had succeeded. As a child I believed in God and I prayed every single night not to wake up the next morning. I don't believe in God now, but I have the same wish as I did then.

I know my relationship is toxic. It isn't all his fault. I watched this illness strike him during a mushroom trip in our early 20s. He was one person that morning and another person afterwards. I've watched his cycle: normal-adversarial-rage-shame-depression. We have a month or more of good times sometimes, and sometimes we can't go a week without a meltdown. I know he doesn't want to be this way. 

My problem isn't him. My problem started way before him. My problem was bred and beaten into me from birth. I am a tool for others. I exist to fix, to solve, to maintain, to mitigate. To calm, to cheer. To be the rational voice, the stoic. To never cry, never yell back, and to never say no. 

My problem is that the most marketable, valuable years of my life are behind me. My problem is that everything I ever enjoyed or hoped for has been used as a weapon. And to avoid it, I gave up all of it. And now I have nothing left. I'm a doll to be kept in a box until the next crisis. I work in social services. I make a living from my own dysfunction. I spend my life doing for others what I never learned to do for myself. And it's too goddamn late. I am too tired, too old, too used up. Too scared, too anxious, too depressed.

I am the shadow of a person that never was but maybe could have been, if every day of my life had been different. 

My problem is that when I left my parents' home at 17, I thought I was free.",26Dec2020,1

88,"19, living with my mom, middle-class family, in a huge city. Probably infj.

After studying almost a year in film school, I realized it wasn't for me, and I'd wasted around 5 years on convincing myself that film was the way to go, and for that, no other option was ever considered. 

So here I am now, I have until february to pick whatever the hell I'm suppose to do with my life and I have 0 idea. I researched every possible career option in my country and nothing calls my attention one bit.

I'm not looking for answers or for someone here to tell me: ""This is exactly what you have to study"", but maybe someone is or was in my shoes and some point, and can tell me about their experience plus their insight on the situation. idk or just talk

&amp;nbsp;

A bit about the old self now...

As you would guess I like watching movies, but I have to be in the right mood, there can be days or weeks where I don't watch any, and the I'll watch 5 a day for a week. (*this happens with almost anything though*).

I'm trying to improve my piano skills but I don't seem to progress that much. I'm picking up guitar, almost a week now (hurts like hell, but it's cool). I like art, any type of art, but don't see myself on the artist life, but again, if I'm going down the road of ""where do I see myself in the future"", I'd get nowhere, cause I just don't see myself doing anything at all.

I finally scored a job during the pandemic, it's an easy delivery on bike gig, pays little but I enjoy riding my bike anyways so I'm happy to do it if I get paid. (also don't see myself as a cyclist or something like that lol)

I don't have any real relationship with anyone. I've plenty of ""close"" friends, but none that get close to that crap you read or see on films or tv: the kinda friendship where you can say anything, and they are there on the hard times, or whatever. I don't have that with friends or family. I find it very hard to open emotionally even though I would love to do that with someone. Maybe I'm too much of an introvert. I don't think I'm shy though, and I doubt I have social anxiety, I've no problem talking with strangers BUT it does feel like every conversation is fake/scripted (I just want to finish so I can go home and be alone and then wonder why I've never had a real connection with someone).

I like reading, but I take my time (boy do I take my time). I love my cat.

I have a bit of a paranoia problem, taking risperidone for that.

*Used to* have a weed addiction problem, 19 days clean. Drinking has never been a problem.

Was the quite one in school. Used to hang on to my mom as a kid but as the time went, and as she got a bigger job, we distanced ourselves emotionally, leaving me to vent my problems to myself or writing stuff online that no one ever reads.

Alright this is been longer than I expected, I'm out. Thanks for reading, deeply appreciated even if you don't reply.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, the job is to save enough money to get the fuck out of my house as soon as possible, cause I could live off of any crap job for the rest of my life but my mom wouldn't agree, so if I ever get enough money, that'll be the road. (don't think I'll make it in a month sadly).",26Dec2020,1
89,"Idk if anyone will read this or read til the end. I guess I just needed to get it out. 

My ""dad"" has been horribly abusive to me my entire life. He has hit me before but only a couple times. Mostly his abuse is emotional/verbal. I always had to apologize to him after a fight because it was my fault for behaving in a way that made him mad. I always had to say sorry to him so life could go on peacefully in the house. He would yell at me for basically anything - making popcorn (I had to beg him to allow me to because he hated the smell), letting the gas mileage on the car go down .05, turning the air conditioning up because it was almost 90 in the house, asking him a question, etc. He broke me down every single day. He retired early without talking about it with my mom who had a serious medical condition when she was younger - while she did get a permanent solution with no trouble for years, no insurance company would take her. So she had to go to work instead of be a stay at home mom. Sometimes she would take me to work. But most of the time I spent the school year/summers with my dad until she got home.

He was always super unpleasant at family gatherings - we'd get into fights there and I'd get a lecture from mom. No one in my family would ask if I was okay, defend me, say anything. He was standoffish and preferred to sit on the couch when everyone was socializing. He was hostile/rude/abrasive to others sometimes. What I'm saying here is that the family knew what he was like (to an extent). My extended family is not great - they are ignorant, blatantly racist, and very judgemental. I was the youngest cousin by far and never bonded with them.

What I wished I had done - reached out for help. I felt so alone at gatherings. I stuck by my mom and her parents for comfort there. I never said a word to my grandparents when I stayed there. I didnt know I could. I never said a word to my extended family - not even my nice aunt. I didnt know I could. My mom knew things. Id cry to her when she got home from work, but she said she didn't want to hear it because it was every day. I had nobody.

I lashed out at school peers - hated everyone, kept to myself, was mean if they talked to me. I frequently spiraled and cried a lot at home. My mom always said I was too sensitive (dad too). She was complicit in some of the abuse - I have body image issues because of her, and she has dismissed me time and time again. Even significant others didnt believe my dad was that bad until they actually met him.

Thankfully, I met my now fiance who validated me from the start. He even said my dad was worse than how I had described him. He was the one who got me out of a bad situation at my grandmas birthday party April 2019. We were on the patio at a restaurant and he was being awful to the waitstaff as usual: snapping fingers, demanding the heater be turned on multiple times even though they were crazy busy. He started up on politics again (hard-core conservative) and berated my one democrat aunt. Long story short he started yelling at me, called me ""little girl"" (his favorite insult besides ""twit"", ""brat"", ""bitch"", ""dumbass""). I was crying at the table, and no one stood up for me. My mom told me to stop getting into it with him. My fiance was the only one. He pulled me from the table, and I cried a lot. We had ridden to the place with my parents so he called us a lyft to my parents house so I could get my car to go home.

It was that very night on my grammas birthday that I decided I had to go no contact. I realized he only brought severe unhappiness in my life, and I actually wasn't even reliant on him anymore. I had friends I could ask about car issues. They jumped my car before. I had my fiance to help me when some one hit my car. I had my own phone plan shared with my fiance, we paid rent, I had a steady job. I didnt need to call my dad for anything ever. I only regressed and cried about why I didn't have a good family. Just spiraled. Im no contact with him and limited with my mom now. He has never apologized and my mom still doesn't listen to me about now wanting to see him. Instead she cajoles me/invalidates me/begs to see me at holidays but I refuse to go if he's there. I wish I had known about no contact sooner.

In 2015, I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. I was spiraling. I started drinking every night, I cried for hours on end, and one day I just couldn't get out of bed. I had hit rock bottom. Thats when I finally went to therapy then saw a psych and got diagnosed. I did it by myself since my mom dismissed me, my boyfriend back then refused to go to my first appointment, and my grandparents dismissed me. Life got better, amazing, horrendous, absolute hell, and better again. The endless cycle and trying meds.

Without that diagnosis, I would never be where I'm at now. Without going no contact, I would never be where I'm at now. Without breaking up with my ex who said I lied to him about who I was and he couldn't trust me anymore, I would never be where I'm at now. Without my current fiance who I met in 2016, I'd never be where I'm at now. Without my wonderful friends, I'd never be where I'm at now. Without my therapists and psychiatrists, I'd never be where I'm at now. 

Alive. Flourishing. Steady job. Happy. And yes there have been bad times. I have wanted to end it. I called the suicide hotline and counselors came out to me within an hour. I wrote a suicide note.

But sometimes I still think about things I wish I had done. I wish I had known to reach out to other family members - it could've gone good or bad but who knows. I wish I had known that I wasn't just ""sensitive"" and that something really was wrong with me. I wish I had set boundaries way, way, way sooner. I wish I had just opted out of family gatherings earlier. I wish I had known that I have my own family ages ago - my fiance and my two kitties. I wish I had known earlier that I have a new family. I wish I had stood up to my mom way earlier - I didnt put my foot fully down until April 2019. 

I know these wishes are unhelpful. Sometimes I just think about it. I dont let them consume my life anymore - I'll never continue to make progress. But sometimes... I just wish I had known things.",26Dec2020,1
90,"Part of me knows how bad that sounds. The other part of me rationalizes it pretty well. He's old, I'm not sure how old but in his 80s. I never had a connection with him. My Spanish is awful for conversations and he doesn't speak English. I remember him walking cousins and I from elementary school, but that was a consistent memory. He got sick with depression and whatever else soon after. We lived in the same house throughout high school but I tended to avoid him. I don't feel like we ever bonded. He wasn't a grandpa I could go to with my problems and ask for advice. But to be fair neither was my mother.

I've recently started having huge panic attack episodes (never got them before lockdown), when I'd feel anxiety over something I did in the past, whether it be an embarassing moment or something I regret, this has caused me to randomly hit myself (not hard, I don't punch myself but just slap myself). But, quite worryingly, I've started desiring to hit myself with random objects, most recently a laptop, till my head is bloody and I have to snap myself out of it, it's almost like for a brief second I lose my mind &amp; all inhibitions.

I've also started picturing myself cutting my neck, like I put a pair of nailclippers to my neck and I had to stop myself... (This is want prompted me to make this post, as for some reason I didn't see it as a serious issue until this.)

I should also add I'm not suicidal at all, I suffer with depression, anxiety etc but most of the time I don't desire to kill myself.

I'm really starting to worry myself, I've booked a therapist but can't start until January. I'm hoping now that I've realised what I'm doing is not normal, it should put be on a road to stop doing this..",26Dec2020,1

For anyone who reads this letter

Please let me not write my name for you. I am an Iranian and I am thirty-nine years old. I have been working since I was sixteen and now I work in poultry farming. I got married nine years ago and have a four-year-old son. 

After twenty-three years of working, I still do not own a house. Due to high inflation in my country, we are getting poorer every day.

Our situation has worsened since Corona took over the world a year ago. Many of us lost our jobs. Our government only donates $ 4 a month to every Iranian. It's really funny .... I get a monthly salary of $ 105 which is hard to make a living.

While the basic needs of a family of three cost at least $ 400 a month. 

I work ten hours a day in poultry farming. Several times I wanted to do other work besides this job, but each time I was disappointed because I live in another humble apartment of my employer, which deduct a small amount of my salary, but instead gives me the repair work of his big house, and I haven't any time for doing the second job. It is not possible to find another job because if I leave my job I have to hand over the house and I do have to rent a house after that. But I do not have any savings money. Finding another job has become very difficult because of Corona. However, living with the current job income is impossible.

No government agency or organization helps us and all my friends and relatives have the same situation as me. I do not know what to do. The only thing that came to my mind was to write this letter and ask for help from other people in the world who want to help.

I do not have any account or credit card that you can help. Even if I had it, you could not have helped me because of the actions of our government and the boycott of my country. My only solution was to create an account in Atomic Wallet. Fortunately, digital currencies have made it possible to transfer money without the need for state-owned banks.

95,"For anyone who reads this letter

Please let me not write my name for you. I am an Iranian and I am thirty-nine years old. I have been working since I was sixteen and now I work in poultry farming. I got married nine years ago and have a four-year-old son. 

After twenty-three years of working, I still do not own a house. Due to high inflation in my country, we are getting poorer every day.

Our situation has worsened since Corona took over the world a year ago. Many of us lost our jobs. Our government only donates $ 4 a month to every Iranian. It's really funny .... I get a monthly salary of $ 105 which is hard to make a living.

While the basic needs of a family of three cost at least $ 400 a month. 

I work ten hours a day in poultry farming. Several times I wanted to do other work besides this job, but each time I was disappointed because I live in another humble apartment of my employer, which deduct a small amount of my salary, but instead gives me the repair work of his big house, and I haven't any time for doing the second job. It is not possible to find another job because if I leave my job I have to hand over the house and I do have to rent a house after that. But I do not have any savings money. Finding another job has become very difficult because of Corona. However, living with the current job income is impossible.

No government agency or organization helps us and all my friends and relatives have the same situation as me. I do not know what to do. The only thing that came to my mind was to write this letter and ask for help from other people in the world who want to help.

I do not have any account or credit card that you can help. Even if I had it, you could not have helped me because of the actions of our government and the boycott of my country. My only solution was to create an account in Atomic Wallet. Fortunately, digital currencies have made it possible to transfer money without the need for state-owned banks. I only ask for your help as much as I can rent another house and provide a better job for myself. Something around $ 1,500 to $ 2,000. Anyone who helps in any way has done me and my family a great favor.

Quarantine is being harsh i guess i just finished middle school and next year is already high school and to try and keep myself busy i planned a lot of activities to do in this quarantine and school break but the thing is everyhting i did ot actually tried to do i gived up soon after i started. Learning Programming, german, video editing even history i just stopped like days after i started. Same With my hobbies i don't even play on my ps4 anymore, can't watch movies or series. Other problem that i am facing is the constant state of daydreaming i already did that everyday before i get to sleep but now is even worse with me constantly having intrusive thoughts or randomly walking in circles. I'm already talking to a psychologist but i don't see any progress at least yet. I'm just confuse about my present and future and can't take any joy from any activity i practice nor i am in the mood to talk to friends about it as i feel i'll just be wasting their time.",26Dec2020,1

98,"So, I'm pretty into onlyfans and camshows myself. I don't feel any hang ups about my sexuality and I'd post pictures of my own dick if it weren't for the fact that it could mess with any future careers(as a matter of fact, I have posted pictures under a different account). Needless to say, I don't care if anyone sees my girlfriend naked. They can look, but they'll never be able to touch. Sex and nudity just isn't special to me, never has been and never will be. If a women get's undressed in front of me I'll be excited, but I'm not going over who all have seen her naked in my head as she's doing it, I'll be excited that she's sharing something physical with me. All that matters is that she's getting naked for me, which also means I'm probably about to go a whole lot further than most of the guys who are following her online ever will.

The other reason I don't mind is because I know the community so well. The models don't want to date clients or viewers. They have multiple posts saying how stupid that would be and how unhealthy it is to follow someone with the intent on hooking up. Plus I know what clients are like because I am a client. There are two types of guys who buy porn/ follow girls online. Type 1: Guys who are lusting over them and imagining getting together one day. They typically have little to no social skills and even if they do then they don't have any skills when it comes to picking up girls. This isn't to say that they're always bad people, I've seen some stupid idiots before, these guys are just completely naïve and don't understand how it works. I don't see them as a threat, I actually feel sorry for them since this way of thinking usually ends up in heart break(I know, because I used to be a Type 1 guy). Type 2: Guys who have their emotions together. They know it's all a show and understand that the girl behind the screen is just that, someone you can only look at. They're typically more chill and are just here to have fun, usually they just got off work and are relaxing. I've been in two discord servers for models and both servers have been full of Type 2's, and camshows are typically full of their own little nice communities as well(except for a few guys who'll try to direct the show without paying). Now, these guys have their shit together, but they aren't going to try anything because they already understand how the game works. They're already at peak interaction with her and now they're just enjoying the ride. I'd like to think I'm Type 2, but I'm still too much of a dork to be exactly like them, haha. 

This is just a topic that's always bothers me when people talk about how porn is degrading and disrespectful when I find the entire community so fascinating.",26Dec2020,1

What’s in it: A few years of intense self-experimentation condensed to nine principles. This isn’t everything you need — not even close — but it’s a start.
Reposted in its entirety from Homescreen Zero, a blog about improving life with healthy digital habits. There's a PDF available on the blog if you want this guide to go.
It seems like every other post on here is about too much Facebook/vidya/Reddit, so I really hope this is helpful.

Introduction

Maybe you’ve had the experience recently of sitting down and trying to read a book, and finding your mind start to… wander. Maybe you’re having trouble focusing at work or school, sitting through movies, or even TV shows. There’s a little itch there. “This is cool, I guess… but what’s happening on the internet?”
Or maybe you’re just more anxious these days. Depressed. Cynical. In a “The World Is Shit” rut. You’re thinking about all those IDIOTS out there who are ruining the planet for the rest of us. The Nazi/Fascist/Islamist/Patriarchy/Feminist/WhitePrivilege complex.
Here’s what’s going on: years of heavy internet use have (literally) reprogrammed your brain.
Your smartphone, your laptop your social media accounts, your streaming sites, your inbox and your favorite blogs are all working together to hijack your brain’s natural reward system. On a daily basis, you hit the brain with a barrage of chronic overstimulation that it simply isn’t adapted for. This is why it’s harder than ever to focus, to chill out, to make it through a meeting or dinner or bathroom break without stealing a glance at your phone. Your brain craves moremoreMORE.
The reprogramming of your reward system is hampering your motivation and creativity. It’s stressing you out and hurting your social life. It’s decreasing your academic or career performance. It’s turning you into a smartphone-addicted zombie. And it’s convincing you that the online virtual reality world is necessary to feel human.
The good news: it’s all programming, which means you can counter-program. This guide will show you how.
Ready? Let’s dive in…

Monkey brains pressing dopamine buttons

The reason it’s hard to have a healthy relationship with digital media is because our monkey brains see it as a low-cost way to trigger happy feelings.
Aside from fear, pleasure is the most important behavioral motivator. Pleasure is administered via the brain’s reward center, which releases feel-good neurotransmitters (such as dopamine) when we do things that have historically been linked with survival.
Here are just a few of the things that trigger dopamine:

Social interaction

Sex

Punishing those perceived to “have it coming”

Novelty and the unexpected

Humor

Information intake

Winning arguments/being right

Unlike in nature, when all of these things are tightly correlated with survival, the artificial reality layer of the internet can present them in rapid sequence to be consumed endlessly from behind the safety of the screen.
The internet, smartphones, your favorite blog, your inbox, your Instagram account — your monkey brain just sees these as big, shiny dopamine buttons. Press the button, get the hit. Repeat.
This wouldn’t be much of a problem, except the brain is malleable—highly malleable. Sustained exposure to stimuli programs the brain to expect and value certain things. What you expose your brain to cultivates patterns within it. With respect to the internet, the programming cultivates (among other things):

Mindlessness. A need to avoid the present moment and escape into the on-screen world, which is associated with safety and comfort.

Scattered thinking. An inability to set priorities and focus on what’s important.

Ego and insecurity. When more validation comes from externalities (one’s social media profile or online rep), it’s impossible to develop real self-esteem. People struggle with neurosis and self-loathing.

Diminished motivation. When your reward system is tuned to expect easy rewards from vicarious onscreen pleasures, why pursue difficult, messy real-world achievements?

Increased anxiety. Animals are meant to handle regular stress from stressors that they can react to, like predators. But stress systems are compromised, badly, by a diet of world-is-ending-and-you’re-powerless news.

Meanness and cynicism. People get used to indulging their inner child online, ranting and complaining, and it leaks into their real life.

The good news is that, just as you programmed your brain, you can reprogram it. You can create a healthier relationship with digital that will make it easy for you to:

Think clearly

Be more productive and creative

Be kinder to yourself and to others

Introduce more stillness and contemplation into your life

Reduce anxiety and cynicism

Or, more simply: You can move from a state of perpetual scatteredness to a state of calm, clear thinking.
The rest of this guide is all about how we do that.

Finding your sweet spot

Digital isn’t like cigarettes. You quit cigarettes. You don’t worry about “creating a healthy relationship” with your Marlboros.
Digital is like food. We have to eat. (I guess you don’t have to use digital, but going full Amish is neither realistic nor preferable for the majority of humanity). Within that obligation, however, is a vast spectrum. We can call it the “utility/fun” spectrum.
On one end, pure utility. The stuff that nourishes. Raw veggies, lean protein, eggs and tuna. Quinoa and lentils.
On the other end is fun. Chili fries and movie theater popcorn. Red velvet cupcakes. Dark chocolate and red wine.
What are we looking for? The sweet spot — mostly healthy, but with a few sensible indulgences. You probably can’t eat chili fries every day and maintain optimal health. You probably can enjoy a few if you’ve been eating well and working out. Certainly, a life with red wine and chocolate and a slice of birthday cake every once in a while is more fun than a life without.
Our relationship with digital is very similar. On the utility side, there’s work emails and Youtube videos about proper leaf raking techniques. On the fun side, there’s BuzzFeed quizzes and snarky Tweets and porn.
Your goal: figure out a “sweet spot” between utility and fun that allows you to lead an excellent, productive life while enjoying fun stuff online.
But this is much easier said than done. To get to the sweet spot, you’ll need to take a REALLY GOOD LOOK at your own digital habits. You’ll have to cultivate the inner honesty to recognize what is and isn’t working. And you’ll have to commit to making real change.
Sound good? Let’s jump in.

Counter-programming: 9 major principles

These are the nine major principles of counter-programming your brain. Follow these rules and you’ll dramatically increase the health of your digital habits — not to mention your overall quality of life. These have all been tested by me. They work. Put them to work for you, and watch your happiness and performance jump.

Principle 1: Be purposeful about digital.

The programming: Turn to a screen whenever you need something. Anxious? Upset? Lonely? Bored? The screen has what you need. Paw at the screen like it’s a slot machine. Trigger those hits of dopamine. Relish your superiority. It’s fine to take a spin on the hamster wheel of impulse gratification every once in a while. Where it kills you is when it becomes a way of life. When your every waking moment is filled with Instagram binges, and little tappy games, and refreshing your news apps, and texting friends, then — that’s where your dreams die.
The counter-programming: Be intentional when using your digital devices. Ask: “Why am I doing this? What am I hoping to accomplish here? What’s my goal?” Your digital devices are tools to be used purposefully, not slot machines to be slapped over and over for your amusement.
Remember the utility/fun spectrum? Intentionality is what lets you dip into “fun” without making it a way of life. When you purposefully decide to pull up Instagram or Facebook for a bit of social media doodling, it’s very different from compulsively pulling it up because you’re uncomfortable, or bored, or scared. You stay in control; you call the shots.
Cut back on your aimless browsing. Way back. Don’t treat digital like a cheap way to fill dead air with mindless clicking. This is like eating out of boredom. Use digital when you need to, and put it down when you don’t.
Reintroduce friction. Denature the “whip-out-the-phone” impulse. When you aren’t using your phone, put it away—in a bag or on a stand on a table across the room. When you aren’t using your laptop, close it and put it in a drawer. Create separation.
Oh, and… SLOW DOWN. Don’t whip out your phone like you’re going to resuscitate someone with it. Try thoughtfully stopping… opening your bag… removing your phone… mindfully using it… putting it back. It sounds silly, but these are precisely the kinds of tweaks that train your mind to be more spacious and calm.

Principle 2: Displace digital from its central role in your life.

The programming: Look at your phone. Look at your TV. Look at your computer. Answer this message. Respond to this prompt. Look here. Look here. Look here.
In the attention economy, your time and headspace are more valuable than ever — which has spawned a massive ecosystem of profit-driven companies who compete for it. Unguarded, you’ll find yourself doing their bidding — clicking, tapping and swiping as life goes by.
The counter-programming: Instead of treating life as an undifferentiated blur — an endless series of screens from which you very occasionally look up and go “Huh?”—strive to make a clean break between your (purposeful) digital time and your everything-else, real-life time.
I try to look at my phone sparingly, when I need to. I don’t use the screen to fill time, or as a safety blanket for when I’m uncomfortable. When I come home, I put it on a little stand on the table by the door.
I’ll look at my inputs (email, texts, Slack etc.) regularly, but only to make sure nothing needs my immediate attention. On my schedule, I’ll go through my inputs and zero them out. But I take pains not to flit from one thing to another like a butterfly.
And I never look at my phone when I’m out and about. I cringe when I catch myself text-walking. If I need to use my phone, I stop, take it out, use it, and then move on with my life.
Relocate digital from the center of your universe to a tertiary planet that you occasionally drop in on. Your quality of life will go up considerably.

Principle 3: Cut out junk-food content.

The programing: The high appeal of digital “junk food”:

Endlessly novel

Highly stimulating

Fast refresh (always something new)

Gleefully immature (Think fluff subReddits, Twitter, 4chan etc.)

Accessible everywhere, on demand

But like real junk food, too much of this completely ruins your diet. You’re conditioned to crave it more and more. You equate it with substance. As Marcus Aurelius wrote, “Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts.” Do you really want your thoughts to be like Twitter or Buzzfeed — endlessly sarcastic, relentlessly bitchy? Or do you want to think, act and behave like a human being?
The counter-programming: You are what you eat. This is as true for content as it is for food. Tier your information diet into “Never,” “Sometimes” and ""Always.""
Never: The stuff that is never, ever good. Complete junk, and liable to trigger a breakdown. For example, Twitter is on my no-fly list. Twitter is like 99% complaining. Every time I go, I find myself stumbling out of a rabbit hole several hours later. Frustrated, angry, and wondering where the day went. It’s useless to me.
My Never list also includes: Virtually all news sites, blogs that are cruel/snarky/gossipy, political stuff.
Sometimes: Sensible indulgences. Use this as a reward. Did you get up early and write? Great, enjoy some Netflix in the afternoon. Are you in the middle of a productive study session? Cool, take a ten-minute Instagram break. There are no hard-and-fast rules; you know when you’ve earned some fluff.
My Sometimes list also includes: Reddit (motivational/positive subreddits ONLY), Facebook, the New York Times. Intelligently written blogs. Entrepreneurs, motivational and health content.
Always: BOOKS. Read books. Not only do books train your mind to monotask on information, they're a decent screen for quality. Not every book is great and not every quality idea becomes a book, but writing a book is hard, and the standards are comparatively high, so ideas tend to be better thought out and researched.
Read: philosophy, self-development, history/business/biography, quality fiction. And keep a few entertaining books around, too, like fantasy/thriller shit — perfect for winding down at the end of the day with. Get a Kindle — mine changed my life. When you feel the need to look at a screen, look at your ebook of The Meditations instead of Instagram.
You’ll find there are people and blogs that are consistently good. Get on their mailing list and read their stuff when it comes out. Reward quality with attention. Don’t reward pandering.
Remember: Out of sight, out of mind. Unsubscribe from negative subreddits; use Social Fixer to block unpleasant keywords/domains from your Facebook feed. Use URL blocker to block Twitter.
Also remember: Triviality is suffocating. Does it really matter who did what at the Emmys last night? Does it matter that Twitter had THIS to say? Does it matter that some jackass in some other part of the world went online and said something stupid? If you want to think big, apply your mind to big things, over which you have some level of influence. Don’t scatter your thoughts among a million insubstantial flecks.

Principle 4: Stop multitasking.

The programming: Rapidly flick from one screen to the next. Notifications popping up to tell you about everything, all the time. Answer emails while walking to the coffee shop. Check your social media during the lecture. It all feels super-productive, but multi-tasking crushes productivity, increases frustrating, and saps your energies. A day spent multitasking is a day wasted. A life spent multitasking is fractious and ineffectual.
The counter-programming: Reacquaint yourself with the joys of deep focus on your work, and presence with your current state of mind. Continuous multi-tasking programs your brain to go shallow. To do awesome shit, we want to go deep.
Before you begin each day, have your priorities clearly in mind. Write them out if you need. Decide on what you’re going to do. Better yet, schedule time to do it — like it’s an appointment on your calendar. Make and keep this appointment with yourself.
When it comes time to work, configure your environment for actual working. Disable notifications for all but the most critical, time-sensitive things on your laptop and smartphone. Keep your phone on silent. Close unneeded tabs. Put on some chill, non-distracting music (This Youtube channel is a personal favorite). Use a focus/break technique, such as Pomodoro intervals, to motivate yourself. And go do it.
When you’re out in the world, resist the temptation to “multitask through life.” I’m not going to say it’s beneficial (or realistic) to NEVER look at your phone, but for God’s sake, not when you’re walking around or talking to a friend. Be present with what you’re doing.

Principle 5: Replace social media with real social interactions.

The programming: A live, always-on feed of social information from friends, family, colleagues, former dormmates, someone you met at a party once… Show off your cool life and celebrate the coolness of others.
Never mind the reality — that we’re all sitting around inside looking at everyone else having fun. Never mind that even when we do “make it,” when we get the cool car or gourmet meal, we’re still posting it online, enslaved to the opinions of strangers.
The human mind is hard-wired to be social, and social media offers only a simulacra that will endlessly entice but never satisfy.
The counter-programming: Engage in frequent, extended social bonding with flesh-and-blood human beings. Sit across from them at the table. Navigate awkward silences. Talk. Explore. Share a meal.
Call up old friends or acquaintances and go to coffee to catch up. Ask strangers out. Go out to visit a friend and just BE with them. Don’t worry about documenting it for your feed.
Taper your social media use. Try to go on it less. If you’re a hardcore user, limit session time. You can use self-discipline or any number of apps that time and reduce phone usage. If you’re a light social media user, consider going on a break or discontinuing usage. I personally maintain a Facebook and Reddit account but have shut down everything else, and it feels great. Yeah, I miss out on some stuff — but I conserve headspace for other things that I place more value on. It’s all about priorities.

Principle 6: No porn.

The programming: Indulge your hedonistic desires to your heart’s content. It’s normal, healthy and free.
Except… It’s not normal. The monkey brain wasn’t made for the world of on-demand, high-def, infinite-variety porn that can be delivered straight into the eye sockets of anybody with a working internet connection.
Porn, like compulsive gambling and spree shopping, is an extreme example of the brain’s reward system being highjacked by an exaggerated version of a naturally healthy stimulus. Just as the gambler needs to keep pulling that lever to get their dopamine fix, so do porn addicts learn to blunt themselves into docile submissiveness with their habit.
Porn usage has been clinically linked to changes in brain plasticity that mirror drug addiction. It’s tied to desensitization (a numbed response to pleasure), sensitization (powerful cravings for more), hypofrontality (weakened impulse resistance) and dysfunctional stress circuits (increased use of porn to manage stress).
It’s also worth adding that the industry exploits young women, arguments about “empowerment” notwithstanding.
The counter-programming: This one’s easy. Stop watching porn.
If the idea of giving up porn fills you with dread, then congratulations — now you know for certain that it’s a problem. There is no reason that a healthy and well-adjusted person should need to watch porn. None. Imagination was good enough for billions of our ancestors, and it will be fine for you. Better yet — focus on intimacy with your special someone, or work on meeting that special someone. Visit /r/nofap or /r/noporn. There can be some crazy mumbo-jumbo on there, but the underlying principles/motivation are solid.

Principle 7: Screen-free mornings and evenings.

The programming: Keep your phone by your bedside. Wake up, check your inbox and Twitter and Instagram before you get up. (Associate your smartphone with safety and warmth). Look at a screen until the moment you pass out. Wake up and do it again.
The counter-programming: It is critical to have a morning and evening routine that omit screen time. The first and last hours of your day should be low activity and screen-free. Honor your body’s natural wake/sleep cycles. I can’t overemphasize how critical this is.
(There are only a few exceptions. You can look at a Kindle if you prefer to read eBooks. And if you have a really good reason to be looking at a screen — like, you’re writing a novel and your writing time is 5-7am — go for it. But cut it out with the aimless browsing.)
Mornings are a foundation, a time to wake your mind up and ease it into the day. Choose reading, journaling, quiet reflection, stretching. Gradually ramp up the activity level. I get up around 6, but don’t look at a screen before 8.
The nighttime is a time to wind down and prepare for sleep. Stop using stimulating digital (video games, social media etc.) with a couple of hours to go before bed. The last hour before bed should consist of reading and relaxation.
It goes without saying, but your phone and computer don’t belong in your bedroom. If your smartphone is your alarm clock, cool — get one on Amazon for $7. (Better yet, get the Philips wakeup clock — worth every penny IMO).

Principle 8: Align values with behavior online

The programming: Act one way in person, but let your inner child run loose online. Bully people, complain endlessly, pick fights with strangers, leave nasty comments. What’s the harm? It’s not you. “On the internet, no one knows you’re a dog.”
Oh wait, it IS you. You ARE the person you act like online.
When you complain online, your real-life experience sours. When you obsess over doom-and-gloom news stories, your worldview darkens considerably. And when you’re mean and juvenile and nasty to perfect strangers, you’ll find your thoughts becoming sharper about the real-life people that you love.
The counter-programming: You aspire (hopefully) to be a kind, generous, emotionally stable, pragmatic, thoughtful, intelligent, purposeful and motivated person. So act like it. Don’t fill the web with cruelty, snide judgements, self-deprecation and immaturity. Letting your inner child run free is dangerous business, especially in this era where online and real-life identities are thoroughly merged. Regard your public face on the web like your public face in real life.
Of course, nobody's perfect. Hell, you could go through MY reddit/social media history and find some unsavory stuff. It's not about being perfect, it's about recognizing when you stray and getting back on the path.
There are no points for winning fights against anonymous strangers. Yes, they disagree with you. Yes, they’re horribly ignorant and stupid and wrong. So what? You’re not going to convince them over the internet. You’ll just give them what they really want: a reaction. So don’t do it.
BE POSITIVE. Don’t ever complain online. It’s pointless and narcissistic. Nobody cares about your complaints nearly as much as you do. Yes, I know that when you’re swelling up with righteous outrage, it feels really good to scream it to the world, but please — save it. Mom was right: say nice things or don’t say ‘em at all.

Principle 9: Cultivate real excellence.

The programming: Get the highest score, the most Likes, the celebrity re-tweet, the followers, the upvotes… Treasure them. These are signs of your value and worth.
The counter-programming: Life is short. We all die, but death isn’t the scary part. It’s the long, slow decline beforehand. Your health, hopes and dreams will probably fade before your mind and body do.
In order to meet the decline without regret, we owe it to ourselves to work on ourselves. We should aspire towards excellence. Not impossible excellence — superhuman beauty or effortless riches — but real excellence. An enjoyable, productive life filled with good experiences and good people, free of unnecessary suffering, beholden to no one. When asked if we’re happy, we should be able to say “Yes” without a moment’s hesitation.
Digital can support our path to excellence, but it can no more provide excellence than a paycheck or nice car or big house in the suburbs can. (Think of how many enraged mediocrities there are with well-paying jobs and great cars). Digital can’t make us kinder, or more mindful, or appreciate a sunset any more. It subtracts more than it adds.
Aspiring to real excellence gives you a path, the path of self-improvements. There’s a purpose, and a joy, to working on yourself — to watching your mindfulness and health and fitness and career flourish over time. It’s not fast, and it’s not easy, but it’s the real deal.
The specifics of how to get there are beyond the scope of this article, but it’s all the usual suspects. Eat well — mostly unprocessed, whole foods. Minimize drinking, sugar and processed food. Guard your sleep like a jealous lover. Work out at an appropriate intensity. Move around — lots of long walks.
The point is to do. The doing is the thing. The decline is coming. Fill it with happy memories. The rest will take care of itself.

Wrapping Up

The most important piece of this puzzle is your commitment to change. If you’ve made it this far, I think we can safely assume you’re at least part-way interested. So, congrats! Now, make it real.
If you create a healthy relationship with digital it will change your life. I know this for a fact because it changed mine. I have reached a level of relative peace and happiness in my life that I genuinely never thought possible. Certainly, it didn’t seem reachable when I was an stimulus-addicted information-overloaded smartphone monkey.",26Dec2020,1

My point I don't miss the old internet, I miss when everything on the internet had its diversity instead of eventually having every website and search engine fall into their bias.

Not bias for news or whatever opinions are being pumped and possibly paid for in Ad space. 

No I miss when there was enough content that was new to get lost in, even if it came in shitty 10 min videos on YouTube milking a subject. 

Now whenever I open any website and try to tailor its content I want to see, it will just bluntly ignore it.

I can't turn off Reddit live on mobile, YouTube won't stop recommending me dumb animal videos, and memes I've watched from years ago with no intent to rewatch it. Instagram doesn't have settings to remove COVID-19 vaccine notices, as well failing to adapt the explore page and its glory.(for while IG made it so reels took the place of the explore page.)

I've literary made new accounts to set up the all these algorithms to give me content I want to engage in. Eventually it just starts pumping its echo chamber that I didn't built from starch like many of us. Instead, it makes the echo chamber that wants it to have more so control over.

Now lets I want to learn to draw or something right, I have to put in an insane amount of effort to get whatever piece of content needed to avoid paid promo's(hey get your bag if you can) fluffed out scripting that doesn't provide much, misleading thumbnails, titles, content creators.

It's like the whole internet now decides what you should see, watch, and read. No matter how diverse or outlandish you try to make it, when in less than half a day it just doesn't let get the lee way needed to make the internet interesting again.

105,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

One instance she said she booked me in for a practice interview and I just looked down and nodded and she said annoyed ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ when I didn’t mean it like that 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

💡She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


◾️I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence. And she seemed very moody about it at the time tbh",26Dec2020,1
107," A name from an old kid's tv show popped in my head and I randomly, typed it in the search bar. I remembered in the past that tried to find some videos from that show. I could not find much.  My ocd tells me that I may have made a rushed, promise to God  and that maybe other Gods accepted the promise (in case Christian God is not real) about never searching for that show again. I cant remember making a promise but I got a bad feeling.",26Dec2020,1
110,"I have not cried before or after the exams sinds my third year of high school (14 years old). I was in a very strict school and the teacher had told me that he would fail me because I had an accent (lie: I am born and raised in this country). I also had depression at the time. I changed schools and had depressien for another 12 months.

I was happy this year but my exams and with covid messing up planning and me getting mostly 60% on my exams. I cried before and after the exams a lot and after I got my grades I cried for another 1 hour and was stressed for 5 days.

I feel like I am going to cry daily again after school begins. Is this normal?

P.S.: I did not get any help with my depression when I was 14. I was not caring about my health but my grades. I also feel more somber and alone sinds 14 years old. I am 16 years old now.",26Dec2020,1

I feel like these days it’s hard enough to care for your mental health and find out who you are than jumping into a family I don’t even know if I’m ready for. I don’t care if I have kids at 35 or if I wind up not having kids at all. AND THAT’S OKAY! Because I am happy with where I’m at in life aside from society’s picture of a perfect life and family. Sorry for the little rant, but can we normalize supporting whatever life choice people make. Maybe it’s just my family.",26Dec2020,1
