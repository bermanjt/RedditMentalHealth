1,"I’m talking to a guy and it was a dating website and in the first few texts he said to come over to watch a movie. And I was like no and we started to talk on Snapchat at first he would respond really quick and make good conversation. We talked once otp and it was okay we mostly just joked around. But lately he just said the same thing “wyd” and “watching Netflix” and takes like 4-6 hours to respond even though we’re locked in quarantine and usually saids he’s doing nothing. I confronted him saying what’s up I don’t feel like I’m receiving the same energy and I get the vibe I’m annoying you. And he’s like you don’t annoy me I’m just bad with small talk. Then I was like let’s talk we never have like an actual conversation and he just said start it, he doesn’t try? Opinions??",08Apr2020,1
3,"This is my first post, so I don't know if this belongs here. Also, English isn't my first language, so there might be some mistakes in my post.

I'm a seventeen year-old girl and my past was a mess. My brain functions in a peculiar way and my parents never cared about how my education could have been adapted, my mother used to beat me, I got bullied in grade school and so on. It has left me practically unable to function emotionally as I became used to focus on my academical skills because it was the only thing I have. 

I've overthought this a lot : because I'm damaged, my situation will probably never get better and I'm likely to die alone with my cats. But I find it unfair for someone who has suffered that much to just be unhappy during her whole life, then fade out of existence just like that. This is why death scares me a lot and this is why I never killed myself despite having contemplated suicide multiple times. I'm almost angry at the universe for not having killed me while I was still in my mother's womb, because my birth basically dumped me into an inextricable sh*thole : my mother's abusive behaviour made me quite dependent on others as a child, which made me an easy target for other children, which led to bullying and me having no friends before the age of thirteen, which caused me to become the mess I am today. I feel unworthy of being alive while there are tons of dead people who would have deserved an extra life.

I'm trapped in my own duality : I both love myself because I succeed in a lot of things and hate myself because I know I will always be alone in a world where everyone has at least one significant other, while I feel like I'm not connected to my own family. I long to be loved, but I've become a bitter and scornful young woman who can't say anything that isn't sarcasm and has horribly high standards. I don't even know whether or not I'm still able to love, since I never opened up my heart for anyone. I feel like a total failure who screwed up what little possibilities for a decent future she still had : yeah, I'm heading towards law studies and want to be a diplomat, but what's the point of travelling the world if you're desperately alone ?",08Apr2020,1
4,"With all this whole quarantine situation I've had nothing but time to wonder about my life and realized how ridiculous it is, so ridiculous and formulaic that it may be the structured like a TV show

For starters, I have a the luck of having a new girl come around at the start of every new school year to do the love interest character, and since it never really works because I don't care about dating that much, the role seems to be getting renewed

Then you have the fact that the universe has direct and constant contact with me, for example, I'd be out there having a bad day and when I put on my headphones to listen to my music which is set at random I get a really good list of sad songs that perfectly describe how I feel

If course none of that is compared to what is happening right now, and I'm not talking about the pandemic but rather about how it has to do with my relationship with my friends. Since this is my last semester in high school, this can't be more fitting for and ""end of an era"" type of story. First, my school changes to online clases before my country even decides to do the official quarantine, then a really big car crash happens right in front of my house but the most interesting thing is that I'm now getting farther away from my friends and it seems as though we won't be taking clases together again, so now that I am sitting here alone writing this I feel no regrets regarding my friends because I got closure with them, my most annoying friend who I wanted to get away from had its ""arc"" end with us going out to eat in a group after school a week before the quarantine happened and we talked about going to different schools for college, we also ended on kind of a high note for what our actual friendship was, then there is one of my newest friends who didn't really hang out with us that much but he was really cool, his arc ended with us playing on my switch the last class we had in our last day of school, then we have my friend who wants to sacrifice himself for the world and all, so from the start you'll see that he is very dramatic and in a dramatic fashion he sent me and our other friends a letter about how we should escape from the country while he stays to save the world or something and I wrote a letter back to tell him how I really felt about what he said and gave him tools to help tone down his self sacrifice suicidal ideas, and he said that he was moved by the letter and would strive to be better, then I have my closest friend who has been there for me everyday and we really ended that arc at the very last day of school with a hug and hopes to see each other again

So it might be just me, but if this was a movie or a show, these moments may represent that my friends are gonna move to the next stage in their lives and that I might not see them again, and I feel weird, but also ok, I just wanted to write about it because during my 18 years of life lots of weird stuff keeps happening and I feel like I should share some of this somewhere

Anyway. Do you have moments like these? How do you feel when you have them?",08Apr2020,1

( of course I’ll make jokes but not as much as others) but recently I’ve been noticing as I get older (I am 17) people just become more and more vicious, saying things that could really hurt others.

8,"There’s too much on my mind to get it all out without sounding crazy. But the past few weeks it’s gotten a lot worse. I have these thoughts constantly that I’m being critiqued for everything I do. I don’t wanna post anything on social media because I feel like people are going to talk about or me not like me. I feel like I need this constant validation. I just want to like myself and not worry about people. If you saw me or knew me you’d think I was very confident but my confidence has completely gone away in the last few months. I deleted Snapchat to try to breathe and not worry about what people are constantly doing but I still have anxiety a lot just worried. I’m also worried I’m never going to get out of this transitional stage of my life. My long term boyfriend (4 years were both 22) have agreed that we are growing apart and both just want the best for each other and think that trying to transition to a friendship would be what’s best for us - but it’s hard. But we are quarantined away from each other right now so it gives us some time and space to think about things. I’m just extremely insecure - I feel like I peaked in high school or right after and now I’m left with no real hobbies, no real goals or aspirations, working serving jobs, stopped going to school. I just want to be at peace with myself and happy. And I don’t know how to be. I try to meditate and workout and keep myself busy trying new things but I have those thoughts in the back of my head - I’m a poser, pretending to be something I’m not. But I truly just don’t know what I want out of life. Just needed to vent. I know this is rambly and all over the place and probably not enough information to pin point whwre all these insecurities came from.",08Apr2020,1
9,"So I come from a family that is not affectionate at all, especially my mom's side. We dont hug and we certainly dont say I love you to one another. My uncle has cancer. He has had it for quite sometime. He is my favorite uncle. He was the only one who has ever been their consistently for me and my sister. He is at every holiday and I know he cares about us more than anything. 

Due to the corona virus, we can't see him because he has to self quarantine. His cancer is pretty bad and they had to off a very important surgery because him being in the hospital could risk his life. It's starting to hit me that something could happen soon and I may never see him again in person. 

Like i said we arent very affectionate. We arent a family who calls one another, we dont hug, and we dont say I love you. He is completely alone and hasnt been in a relationship for at least the entirety of my life so I doubt anyone has said it to him. But I want to tell him before it's too late. How can I say it without making it awkward or uncomfortable?

TLDR: my uncle is dying and I want to be able to tell him I love him before it's too late and have never said it before.",08Apr2020,1

23,"I'm considered an essential employee cause I work for a huge retail chain. My particular job role (loss prevention) is already very stressful. But the longer this pandemic goes on, the worse things have gotten for me. Faces I've never seen before filling my store. More loss. More theft. Corporate is ordering us to take a step back from our actual job duties, to take a less active approach when it comes to preventing shrink, a more hands off approach. We obey. The amount of shrink walking out our doors increase. Suddenly the boss is trying to backpedal some of the decisions that were made that led to the loss.

I've gone about my days like nothing is different  with the exception of my work routine being vastly different. I act like the events aren't getting to me. Though I've made it known I want out of that position, I'm more than happy to take a pay cut to get out of it. I've been asking for over 6 months. I keep getting excuses from upper management. They can't let me switch yet. I'm needed where I'm at, blah blah blah. I've even gone so far as to cut back on the effort I put into my job, it doesn't help.

I'm also a single mother. I have a child that should be entering pre-k this fall if this pandemic burns itself out in time. 

Today is my Saturday. I wake up cranky and grumpy.. I usually am, don't try to conversate with me until I've had my caffeine, and even then wait two hours if you want to play it safe.
But I could already feel my nerve endings jumping,  that feeling that everything under your skin is shaking. That feeling that is so similar to the feeling of adrenaline filling my body when I'm face to face with a shoplifter who is trying to push out a cart full of unpaid merchandise and I'm confronting him.

Still I go about my day, it's my Saturday but I have lots to do still. I do it in tunnel vision mode.
Nothing goes right. My daughter hits her head. Its just a bump. My mother is being her usual unsupportive,  judgmental self,  always reminding me how I'm always too busy working. Sorry mom not everyone can spend half their adult life as a stay at home mother then move onto leeching off their youngest for the rest of their years. Some of us actually choose to work and earn their living. But it still hurts... it hurts that my daughter is being raised by my mother while I work to pay our way through life.

I go to get gas and the pump I go to pull up to is nearly flooded with icy water from all the break up that comes with springtime in Alaska. But we're in a cold snap so at first I don't notice that its actually still water and not the ice I've been driving over since I pulled into the gas station. One minute I'm driving on at least half a foot of solid ice, the next my car sinks half a foot lower. I have to make a split second u turn before my little car gets flooded. Thankfully it didn't. 

I get home. I unlock the doors, let everyone in including the dog and go to shut the sliding glass door back before I go to carry everything in when my mom cries out that I shut the door on her fingers. Why would you do that? Grab the door frame like that? Why not use the wall if your gonna hold onto something for support?

That was it for me. I was done. I felt like I couldn't do anything right. I carried everything in and went to my room. I broke down crying. Holding onto my pillow and rocking myself, full on screaming into my pillow crying until I had nothing left in my lungs and I had to gasp for air. Then more of the same. I did this to the point that I literally got sick and had to throw up the little amount of food I ate today. Then back to more crying.

Two hours later and I'm making something to eat but I can still feel the unsteadiness under my skin, down into my nerves, threatening to hit again at the smallest thing, threatening to send me spiralling back down into uncontrollable tears if I so much as spill some milk.",08Apr2020,1

Whenever I take my first sip of alcohol for the day, I get an immediate burning sensation that lingers in my urethra for about 5-10 minutes. It’s mildly painful, but goes away rather quickly, especially if you continue drinking. After the feeling goes away, it doesn’t return for the rest of the night unless I stop drinking for 5-6 hours and then take another sip.

1) sleeping, you’re only going to get 5 hours of sleep now, probably less, you deserve to get a good nights sleep. 

2) reading, you used to love to read but every time you pick up reddit again and get that simple mindless enjoyment it somehow lessens your enjoyment of books. 

3) creating, you love doing art and get just about as obsessed with each thing you work on as you are with browsing reddit all day. but at the end of the day you’re left with nothing but some anger/slight momentary joy from using reddit, and when you create even if it’s bad it’s yours and you benefit the world so much more making a painting of a skeleton exploding into the universe than with some angry post about why you disagree with someone. 

4) chores. Yeah chores suck but wanna know what sucks worse? Spending 5hrs on reddit procrastinating chores then having to do them anyways, but now the plates are all crusty and you have to put on the laundry again because you forgot to switch it over.

5) playing video games, you haven’t even reached year three of stardew valley. How are you ever going to find out what your grandpa thinks of your farm? 

6)watching movies. No I mean actually sitting down and watching them and not picking up your phone to use reddit, you definitely used to do this and definitely enjoyed movies a whole lot more then. 

7) meditate. I don’t really know what meditation is but when you were having a hard time overcoming bad thoughts before you could sit and let them wash over you taking the bad and accepting it. now you can only distract yourself with reddit. Not having distractions almost inevitably leads to bad thoughts, and you forgot your coping mechanisms. you’re more than this. 

8) talk to the people around you more. This is probably going to be the hardest. Yeah I get it, reddit is a crutch and helps when you need to mentally distance yourself from social interaction so that you don’t use all you social energies in an hour. And sure you take part in conversations but you keep forgetting /not hearing parts of conversations happening directly in front of you. If you need a break take one, absentmindedly hanging out for 5 hours is not as good as hanging out for 1 or 2. 

9) get your news elsewhere. Worried about media biases ? Reddit Is just as susceptible and much easier for ANYONE to manipulate if you have enough money

10) pet your cats. 


I compiled this list because frankly I feel like reddit had taken over my life, mainly as a time filler at first, but it slowly developed into an all-the-time-filler.

I know its my mistake but I feel offended, I am a human too. I feel emotions. I am not like that, I care about them a lot, I listen to her pointless convo about her crushes. Even if I do not believe in Astrologies and some sorcery, I still listen. I explain my side. She feels sorry. She told me that she is not good at explaining, She meant the way I change the topics makes our conversation worthless. Not me. But still. It hurts me because I am not aware how I make our conversation worthless because I care for her a lot. But the word “worthless” is on different level for me. She can be honest with me and I’ll accept it but she should say it in a good way and not in a brutal way. Because we’re friends ya know.

52,"I was always demotivated about my education up to grade 10. I used to study in an Indian curriculum school and that screwed me up pretty bad. When I was in grade 1 (I was 6 years old) I had this class teacher that I will not name. She was kind to everyone except to the kids that didnt preform well in class. She used to get mad at the smallest things, not writing on the line, inverted alphabets and numbers, not writing the date, not completing the homework. If you did any one of these things more than once, she will hit you. And her hit wasnt a small tap on the wrist. She used to used to slap our backs or ask us to close our palms and then hit it with a plastic ruler. If you cried, she would make you stand outside of the class where all the other students can watch you crying. She would tell us that we were bad and lazy, that we would become housemaids if we kept this up and other ""good"" kids would be influenced by this. Thats the worst part I think, when youre the ""bad and dumb"" kid that doesnt do work properly, other students dont want to be your friend because they think they would become ""bad and dumb"". From grade 1 to grade 3, I was beaten, told that I was useless, lazy, stupid, going to be a maid, and that I was never going to be anything significant. It made me lose motivation, I was afraid of doing homework because I was afraid of making mistakes which would make the teacher yell at me or hit me. I would, instead, act as if I already gave my homework (which worked for some time cause the class had 30+ kids and it was hard for the teacher to keep track). But when I did get caught, I was beaten and and yelled at.

I remember my grade 3 class teacher telling us that we were big girls now and that getting hit wasnt suitable for us. Which means it was a widespread form of discipline at school and every teacher knew about it. It was illegal in my country to hit kids, yet there they were, hitting us like it was their duty. I even complained to my school about the teachers being abusive when I had enough of it. I named the teachers, told them what classes they taught, why do they strike us. I was a third grader and I did that because I felt nobody would do it for me, the teachers that I complained about still taught us, except this time, they gave us a half assed apology and still continued to hit us. 

Grade 4 onwards it was all just mental abuse. The same old you're stupid, useless, careless, dumb, etc.. It got worse as I grew up because I actually started believing that I was what they said I was and I didnt preform very well in class because of it. It was like a cycle, doesnt preform well because of demotivation, gets yelled at for not preforming well, doesnt preform well next time because of demotivation, gets yelled at again. Grade 10, I tried to go against the current. I tried to show the teachers that I could do better and that I'm not a failure nor a lost cause. But it didnt matter, because I missed out on my previous years, I didnt know the basics and it gave me a disadvantage. I went to an expensive tutor, tried to get at least passing grades. I would study daily for 8+ hours, sometimes finishing my heavy load of homework at 3 a.m.. I tried to get my shit together and the thought crept in that even if I was working very hard, I was average at best. The rest of the class seemed to have no problems in getting good grades, some students were falling behind because of the difficulty of the year. I barely passed that year, and I couldnt even get my preferred course (my average was less than the required grade), so I left the school. 

I got into an American curriculum school. And things were so different there. For my last two years of school, I've never had so many supportive teachers that actually cared about me. They thought I was extremely smart, that I was worth listening to, and that I was a cool person to be around. It was hard to get used to, I was still scared of teachers, no matter how kind they were. My grades were amazing for these two years, I only got A's and I made some really good friends who have helped me realize that I was abused. I was aware of what abuse was, I knew how to identify it, I did not know that I was a victim. I even forgot about the whole thing until I spoke about my old school to my best friend a week ago. And suddenly all my behaviors made sense to me, I used to get really anxious when I didnt bring my notebook to school, my heart used to beat so hard and fast that I could hear it whenever I answered in class. I couldnt look a teacher in the eye when they were just having a normal conversation with me. I would go stiff whenever they walked over to me. I could never stand up for myself because I thought I would turn out to be wrong. 

Its just funny that I just tucked those memories into a deep dark place in my mind and forgot about it.",08Apr2020,1
53,"I was always demotivated about my education up to grade 10. I used to study in an Indian curriculum school and that screwed me up pretty bad. When I was in grade 1 (I was 6 years old) I had this class teacher that I will not name. She was kind to everyone except to the kids that didnt preform well in class. She used to get mad at the smallest things, not writing on the line, inverted alphabets and numbers, not writing the date, not completing the homework. If you did any one of these things more than once, she will hit you. And her hit wasnt a small tap on the wrist. She used to used to slap our backs or ask us to close our palms and then hit it with a plastic ruler. If you cried, she would make you stand outside of the class where all the other students can watch you crying. She would tell us that we were bad and lazy, that we would become housemaids if we kept this up and other ""good"" kids would be influenced by this. Thats the worst part I think, when youre the ""bad and dumb"" kid that doesnt do work properly, other students dont want to be your friend because they think they would become ""bad and dumb"". From grade 1 to grade 3, I was beaten, told that I was useless, lazy, stupid, going to be a maid, and that I was never going to be anything significant. It made me lose motivation, I was afraid of doing homework because I was afraid of making mistakes which would make the teacher yell at me or hit me. I would, instead, act as if I already gave my homework (which worked for some time cause the class had 30+ kids and it was hard for the teacher to keep track). But when I did get caught, I was beaten and and yelled at.

I remember my grade 3 class teacher telling us that we were big girls now and that getting hit wasnt suitable for us. Which means it was a widespread form of discipline at school and every teacher knew about it. It was illegal in my country to hit kids, yet there they were, hitting us like it was their duty.

54,"I miss the old mes. I was always one of two ways. I was shy and dashy. One minute I was casually talking in a conversation and the next I was dashing off to the bathroom to cry. I had no idea what was  happening but life was panic. I spent all day on the run from myself until I were on the verge of exhaustion. I was dizzy and would fall asleep quite literally anywhere. No one knew where I went and I don't really either but at least I never had time to think. Then we have type 2. Still dash because let's be honest, I can't stay still. This is the period ""Live life freely until you fuck up, and then die. That's how you live life in the happy lane"" was born. If I felt like something I did it. I went out at 3am, was flirty af, dyed my hair, and did anything I wanted. Death was always on my mind though. I could never be away from a razor and I could tie a perfect noose with my eyes closed ready to hang myself at any time. I was always asleep or doing reckless things, with hope one of one would kill me so I didn't have to do it myself. I was impulsive but I felt free. Now I'm in a weird place. In quarantine I have no where to run. I can't just zip away and hide myself in person 1 or 2. I have to stay still and I can't kill myself because more than 10 people would wanna come to my funeral. I hate this. I rather be anything then just sit still and think. I rather go back to addiction, I rather run from fear, I rather anything. Fuck the middle ground, I need extreme.

59,"i always thought i’d at least be mature enough to be able to move out of my parents house when i turned 18. I don’t even have a job and I’m 20 still living with my parents and it feels like things will never change. But I want my independence so badly. I’m in college studying computer science and want to make websites and/or video games. something in that area. I know I need to get a job to move out any time soon but the only jobs i can realistically get right now are like fast food and baristas and grocery baggers. That is not going to help me in the long run. The money will just go to my parents since they’re paying for majority of my college and living expenses, and the time will be a waste I could spend on building experience for web dev and game dev stuff for my career to help me get an internship or a job. 

what i REALLY want though is to have my own business making websites or games though I’d need experience for that too so probably have to get a job either way. but yeah so I’m just trying my best to finish college and build up some experience and projects that i can show in job applications and whatnot. 

i just want to be away from my family so badly. they’re so toxic and im old now and i need independence. i feel so behind everyone else. and i barely have any friends. just 3 from high school because i commute to college and its hard to go to social events at college to meet people when it takes an hour to get there. and now with lockdown theres no social events at all. so everyone i know are either 3 friends from high school or online friends if i can even call them that because I find it’s harder to keep friendships that were made online since it’s so easy to ghost and forget about people.

Anyway I’m just trying my best here and i know its not really realistic at least for another 2 years while im in college. but i just want to be free so badly. i hate wasting my young adult life basically the same way i spent it in my teenage years. And it doesn’t help that my father is creepy and controlling. 

how can i get out of here? Im worried with my social skills getting stunted from not being able to make friends easily that ill be at a huge disadvantage when it comes to applying for jobs and i just pray that i can pull together enough skills in the next 2 years that itll make up for my shyness. 

maybe if i live in a van and cut expenses it’ll be easier to move out sooner? but idk if thats even a smart thing to do. idk man i just need to get outta here. ugh",08Apr2020,1

And i messaged her is she okej, what is going on, does she whant to talk, but she hasn't replied. And i have a gut feeling she won't ever, and that we will never see each other again.

77,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

How would you like to be asked out? I don't have too many options but I can **FB/text/voice call** because of the world situation.

Obviously, I can't ask her out for somewhere/sometime specific either for obvious reasons, so it makes me job difficult imo.

I've worked with her for a full school year. I want to get it off my chest now before the passage of time turns things stale.

She's an extremely hardworking person who is successful in academics and in her social life (so am I), she's also very pretty. We've chatted a lot about random topics in life + a lot about the group project (obviously).

I've been once told ""If you don't do it, you'll just regret it later on."" So I thought I might as well go for it.

Also, I know all people ask this, but how can i phrase is so that they can back down if needed, so I can continue the friendship by accepting the response?

Specifically, **how should I engage in the topic + how should I pop the question not in-person?**

82,"Hey guys,

I have another special post. We are all dealing with a world pandemic. Therefore, **we need to focus on our mental health.** I understand its a difficult time for everyone. Consequently, I want to do everything in my power to help you get better.

In this post, I will go more in-depth on optimism and why you should remain optimistic when face with a crisis.

Follow [r/Crimsonpill](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crimsonpill)

**Message me to join our secret mastermind group**

**1- Understand that Love and Positivity is all around you**

I was checking Instagram and realize that there are pictures of many people with their families and friends. Therefore, it got me thinking about the closeness of bonds that some people have with others. Moreover, how every human came from other humans who had a relationship. **The bonds that people had brought life to the world.** While when people depart this world, they do so alone.

Therefore, instead of feeling down, you can remember the good times you had with family and friends. Maybe, see some IG stories of you and your friends going to the nightclub. Or even watch some youtube or old videos you have of you and your friends. For instance, a friend mine is the creator of ""The Vicious Challenge."" He filmed it with some friends. He was telling me how he was rewatching some older seasons.

**2-Talk to your family every few days**

You must catch up with your family every few days. If you have parents and grandparents, check on them. Make sure you are taking the necessary precautions to stay safe. I was talking with some family members, and I was advising them on improving their diet. For instance, my family should eat whole foods and vegetables to stay the healthiest. I'm trying to get them to give up meat products since it'll be more advantageous for their heath to become vegetarian.

The opportunity to help your family is paramount. Moreover, what is essential is that you keep your fears in check. Since you are aware that nothing wrong will happen to your family, you'll become much calmer. Therefore, you can focus more on yourself.

**3-Relisten to your favorite songs**

If you relisten to your favorite song, your mood will be uplifted. Music has the power to bring out emotions in us. Moreover, our favorite music its more likely to influence us and bring the best of us.

For instance, I'm currently listening to the Dragon Quest 9 full soundtrack. It's a very heroic and orchestral theme. It keeps me thinking about adventures in faraway lands. It has both a calming influence on me as well as it boosts my creativity.

**4-Follow the mantra, ""This too shall pass.""**

Once, when I was anxious about a test, my ex-GF Schatze sat on my lap and was telling me all about this Persian mantra, ""This too shall pass."" I didn't know much about it, but she told me it meant that everything would end—both the good as well as the bad things in life.

If you have this mindset, you'll see that this pandemic will end. You only need to hold on and remain calm until that moment arrives. You will get to see the outside world and breathe the fresh air, hear the birds sing, and walk around the park. You will seem people will initially fear, but sooner or later, they'll forget all about it.

5-**Follow your purpose more than ever before**

Now that you know how life is temporary. It's time for you to follow your goal.

If you've been waiting for a month to write a book, compose an album or paint a portrait. Now it's time to make it happen! In my case, I'm working day and night on my graphic novel. I have cut all the distractions. I'm about to finish the outline and to write a complete first draft.

**Conclusion**

I hope you guys learn from this list. While on paper, it might seem hard to face such a unique situation like this one. You should become even more internally focused in your reality. Once you are in your reality, you can concentrate on the things you care about. For instance, rewatching your favorite movies and listening to your favorite songs. In my case, I'm listening to Lilly Allen and about to watch Scott Pilgrim later today!

83,"I recently got in a little debate on Twitter with someone that blew up (not big but it’s my only tweet with over 1k likes so to me that’s blowing up). They tweeted a criticism of something based on incorrect information. My first mistake was thinking that someone on the internet would want to know when they don’t have factual information. Personally I would but I think I’m in the minority on that one. 

This person and I would both call ourselves feminists which is why the situation is frustrating. She comment was interpreted as defending what she was criticizing when I actually disagree with the same topic. Sorry I’m not providing more information but I don’t want to give too much away and then have someone find my personal twitter account. 

Anyway, this has been going on since yesterday and there’s no signs of stopping. People are mad at me for things I never even said! I know I should just let it go because I know people are always going to interpret things how they want to fit their own bias but something in me is making me still want to reply and defend myself. 

I think it stems from the fact that my childhood trauma really makes me want people to like me. I want people to view me as good because all my life I was told I was bad when I wasn’t. I don’t want people to see me in a negative light or in a way that I feel is untrue. These people literally don’t matter at all and yet I care so much. It’s like I have an angel and a devil on my shoulders. One whispering to stop and not worry about it, the other whispering to keep going and keep defending myself.

87,"I’m a Democrat, so I’d like to point out some silver linings in this crisis.

1. We know now more than ever that we have to FIGHT universal healthcare. We have the best healthcare in the world, can you imagine what it would be like if the socialists had gotten their way and we had universal healthcare like the rest of the developed world? Can you imagine how high our taxes might have been? That’s one thing progressives can’t seem to understand, taxes will go up with universal healthcare. Sure taxes the tax increase would be less than what the average American is currently paying their insurance company for coverage that’s full of holes and completely inconsistent, but TAXES WOULD GO UP. I will be happy to pay 40% more in premiums once this is over as long as 60,000 Americans are still dying from preventable causes every year due to lack of adequate healthcare. Universal healthcare means the Russians win. Then Venezuela.

2. Small Business in the United States is essentially over. This is a huge win for the Democrats and a huge loss for Russia. The only way any Democrat has had any kind of success was through utilizing contributions from large businesses and investors. Greedy small businesses listen to Russia and invest in their local economy instead of in the Democratic Party.  When large businesses have more of the market share, they will have a lot more cash on hand to invest in Democrats! As we know, every dollar invested by large businesses into Democrats yields huge returns for that business, so everyone wins! The end of small business means Democrats win and Russia loses!

3. We have seen the strength of Biden, the greatest candidate we have ever had running for President. Unlike the bolshevik Sanders, who is pandering to his base by raising millions of dollars for relief, Biden is showing the world how a real leader handles a crisis. His calculated exposure and reactive methods have truly inspired the nation. Drumpf and Putin are toast.

4. We can finally put #MeToo to bed. It was fine when it was taking down Hollywood executives and Republicans, but I think we can all agree that it’s gone too far. This “believe all women because it is directly harmful to them to lie about sexual assault” stuff turned out to be Russian propaganda. It turns out that some women are in fact willing to detonate their own lives just to smear a good man who has never done anything wrong.

5. Through the EARN IT act, we will finally be free from the dangers of the internet. With the watchful eye of government surveillance on all internet messaging, all American citizens will be protected from Russia. I have never had any reason to doubt the good intentions of the United States government (except when Trump does anything at all of course) and I sure don’t now!

Also, here’s a bonus little history lesson for all you millennials. The greatest Republican who ever lived was not Abraham Lincoln, but Joseph McCarthy. Lincoln was a radical leftist who forced his agenda through and alienated moderates while McCarthy was a visionary well ahead of his time who diligently protected Americans from Russia. Remember, there is no nation on earth that is more irredeemably evil and committed to the end of the Democratic Party than Russia. If you know anyone who has ever been in contact with someone from Russia, report them to the CIA immediately unless you yourself are a Russian asset.

90,"When I was very young (before I knew what race was) media I consumed started molding my perception of people. Tv shows I'd watch would portray people with other than white skin as mean or scary. My parents didn't take me out a lot and I was living in a bubble. After watching my tv show I told my dad that I thought ""darker people"" were mean. My dad asked me why I thought that way and I told him about the show. He explained to me that tv shows were make-belief and judging a large group of people based off of one person was inaccurate. He then later asked me if I didn't like him. I said no, that I loved him. He then pointed out to me that he was ""darker"" than me and explained why by telling me about his parents. Having my dad listen to me and explain the things that were being shown to me even when I didn't understand them helped my perception of people. I though I would share this story because it's a lesson on how media may be affecting children even if you think they are unaware.

I’ve been doing pest control for a few years and we’ve had some new owners take over the company roughly 8-9 months ago. 

They told us all of this heavenly bullshit and promised so much it’s too much to go into detail. 
They have failed to follow up on their promises, they are abusing their employees by overworking them and sending us into units that don’t have pest issues when there is literally a virus going around dropping people left and right. 

I am a good technician and I satisfy 99.9% of my customers without a complaint from them. 
I get compliments and I NEVER hear about them. 
If I do however happen to get a single complaint my company rips me a new asshole and essentially threatens my career. 

They slam my schedule with jobs and I get them all done 95% of the days they decide to fuck me. 
If I don’t get one done? Ripped apart.
These scare tactics are old. I’m sick of it. I’m sick of my new corporate company taking fat shits on its employees.

This job is mentally and physically draining. After a year and a half I have finally managed to get a huge raise of 50 cents. 
They told me I don’t meet expectations when it comes to job completion when I easily pump 250+ per month out, which is by far above average when it comes to ticket completes even including other companies. 

I can’t find another decent company to work for in this field of choice. 
Every month my manager says “things should be better next month”
Every. Single. Fucking. Month. 

Enough about my job. I also have a problem with some customers but I treat them respectfully.

To save yourself from yourselves. God hears your thoughts and knows your heart. There is no escape. Anyone you trick into coming to my residence (whose address you have only because i trusted you) will be guilty of aiding and abetting felony extortion. chances are they will have no idea why they were there to deliver a message. chances are they would prefer to talk to the police about who sent them, rather than take a felony charge. there is video surveillance all about the property.  sure you could sent an executioner and i would die, but they would be caught after. i play a long game, i will even haunt you after my death with a trial and a prison sentence. i hear south african prisons are no joke.",08Apr2020,1

2) Ive been moved out twice. The first time around was with a best friend from high school. We had a pricey 2 bed apartment, and I frankly wasn’t making enough and spent way too much to sustain the 12 month lease. Lesson learned.

The second time, I moved out with my (troubled) brother, who, 3 months in, got us kicked out because he violated our terms. He went to jail shortly after, and the apartment is coming after us for roughly 3,000. So yes, I have debt collections in relation to an apartment.

Dear America,

&amp;nbsp;

Do a kindnesses for our medical professionals any chance you get. They are fighting for our lives, and theirs.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's take a moment to reflect. How much better would our current situation could be if we had been prepared or even just taken this seriously at the beginning? We were not prepared mentally or structurally to respond to the danger of this pandemic. **Most of our nations medical supplies were bought by China near the end of January** and we were spouting about no danger and ""total containment"" through the end of February. America and China have different ways of doing things, but that doesn't mean we can't take a lesson here. Chinese citizens took immediate action and secured vital resources needed to protect themselves. They were mentally prepped from SARS 2003. **We don't have to wait for an authority figure to tell us we are in danger.** A solid month before we recognized danger, our local shelves, warehouses, and online giants Amazon, Walmart, ect, were sold out of N95 respirators, masks and a majority of other medical supplies. **GONE!** In addition, CDC released **280 million date expired N95 respirators** that were also sold off on **February 28th,** from reserve US warehouses. In a free market, anyone can buy them, and they **all got bought, but not by us.** With limited supplies, those that act will be protected and **we were sleepwalking right along. Nothing bad can happen in Merca? Right? CCP wouldn't lie to us...**


&amp;nbsp;

**Remember** how much this hurts. 

**Know** that we can solve this. 

**A tiny budget** will provide enough for us AND enough to share with the world. 

**Learn** all that you can about how the world works. History, Economics, Art of War, Socioeconomics, ect.

**Science** got us out of the dark ages. Devaluing it will bring us back.

**Knowledge is power. Ignorance is weakness.**

**Question everything.** Strive for truth. Fight for it!

**Admit when you are wrong.** Few things convey more strength than the courage to admit when we are wrong.

**Hold wrongdoers accountable.**

**Recognize your friends** and help them, always.

**Recognize your enemies** and determine their motives. Fight polarized division. Engage others with different beliefs. Learn from each other. State what you believe. Downvotes don't mean you are wrong. Majority mindset doesn't set truths. Debate everything.

**Cold War 2.0** Digital information warfares are the termites in our walls, deteriorating unity and testing democracy. We are under attack. This is the 21st century's weapons of choice. Man-made disinformation deployed in all networks near you. **Become aware.**

&amp;nbsp;

United we Stand,

&amp;nbsp;

- ""Now that the government has confirmed the first human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the U.S., a lot of people will be rushing out to purchase masks. That would be, specifically, the N95 air filtration mask, the one recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for blocking most airborne viruses.

- **""Oops. Too late.""**

- **""CVS is sold out. So are Lowe’s and Staples and everywhere else I’ve checked — even Amazon.** No matter how health authorities try to assure the public that a pandemic is unlikely, the creeping panic continues to creep a little faster each week. And no matter how many experts query whether the N95 mask would even stop transmission of the virus, supply still can’t keep up with demand.""

**Notice**: **These were NOT bought by Americans** because we weren't preparing for a pandemic.

- As more mainland Chinese consumers demand product quality and legitimacy—and show a willingness to pay premiums of up to 100% for them—the number and sophistication of daigous are expanding. This channel is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 60% between 2015 and 2018, reaching 7% of total Chinese e-commerce value by the end of this year.

&gt;The top-purchased categories for cross-border e-commerce are:


- Health and beauty, including health supplements
- Maternal and infant goods
- Apparel and accessories
- Consumer electronics

&gt;Popular goods from these categories are commonly sourced from the US, Japan, or South Korea because consumers associate these countries with high-quality product standards. The rising middle class in China is willing to spend more money on products in these categories because product integrity is essential.

Still here? OK, here are some quotes....

&amp;nbsp;

He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
Sun Tzu 

&amp;nbsp;

I will not go into a story unprepared. I will do my homework, and that's something I learned at an early age.
Ed Bradley 

&amp;nbsp;

Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.
Sun Tzu 

&amp;nbsp;

To each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their talents. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour.
Winston Churchill 

&amp;nbsp;

“Foisting an identity on people rather than allowing them the freedom and space to create their own is shady.”
― Raquel Cepeda, Bird of Paradise: How I Became Latina 

&amp;nbsp;

If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.
Sun Tzu 

&amp;nbsp;

“Censorship is to art as lynching is to justice.”
― Henry Louis Gates Jr 

&amp;nbsp;

“Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shore, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it. Our children are still taught to respect the violence which reduced a red-skinned people of an earlier culture into a few fragmented groups herded into impoverished reservations.”
― Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 

&amp;nbsp;

However desperate the situation and circumstances, don't despair. When there is everything to fear, be unafraid. When surrounded by dangers, fear none of them. When without resources, depend on resourcefulness. When surprised, take the enemy by surprise.
Sun Tzu 

&amp;nbsp;

I never know what I'm going to do for the Post next. Two weeks ago I had a piece on Homeland Security. This is one of my pig ongoing projects. How unprepared we are for a terrorist attack.
Sally Quinn 

&amp;nbsp;

Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.
Sun Tzu 

&amp;nbsp;

He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
Sun Tzu 

&amp;nbsp;

Ignoring a Reality doesn't make it less Real. It's still going to happen. Being unprepared for something doesn't stop it from happening. 
Yasmin Mogahed 

&amp;nbsp;

Always be thou prepared, and so live that death may never find thee unprepared.
Thomas a Kempis 

&amp;nbsp;

“Literature is indispensable to the world. The world changes according to the way people see it, and if you alter, even by a millimeter, the way a person looks at reality, then you can change it.”
― James Baldwin 

&amp;nbsp;

“The government does not have a lot of answers, so the more we rely on the government, the more dependent we become, and the more we put our faith into the hands of others. I like the Chinese proverb that says you can give someone a fish or you can teach him how to fish. Enough of taking fish, it’s time to teach people how to fish, how to create their own wealth. This is my mantra”
― Ziad K. Abdelnour 

&amp;nbsp;

Beware of false knowledge; it is more dangerous than ignorance.
George Bernard Shaw 

&amp;nbsp;

To acquire knowledge, one must study; but to acquire wisdom, one must observe.
Marilyn vos Savant 

&amp;nbsp;

“Its important to be comfortable with uncertainty.”
― Xiaolu Guo 

&amp;nbsp;

Any fool can know. The point is to understand.
Albert Einstein 

&amp;nbsp;

The beautiful thing about learning is nobody can take it away from you.
B. B. King 

&amp;nbsp;

The man who asks a question is a fool for a minute, the man who does not ask is a fool for life.
Confucius 

&amp;nbsp;

Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad.
Miles Kington 

&amp;nbsp;

To know that we know what we know, and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.
Nicolaus Copernicus 

&amp;nbsp;

It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.
Epictetus 

&amp;nbsp;

“Foreknowledge cannot be gotten from ghosts and spirits, cannot be had by analogy, cannot be found out by calculation. It must be obtained from people, people who know the conditions of the enemy.”
― Sun Tzu, The Art of War 

&amp;nbsp;

A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.
Marcus Garvey 

&amp;nbsp;

Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.
Albert Einstein 

&amp;nbsp;

“We did not think of the great open plains, the beautiful rolling hills and the winding streams with tangled growth, as 'wild'. Only to the white man was nature a 'wilderness' and only to him was the land 'infested' with 'wild' animals and 'savage' people. To us it was home. Earth was beautiful and we were surrounded with the blessings of the Great Mystery."" - Chief Standing River of the Lakota”
― Paul Goble, Dream Wolf

110,"So the first thing you’re gonna have to do

If you decide that you’re going to be

Someone who thrives in times of hardship

And there are always those who thrive in times of hardship, aren’t there?

There are those who survive epidemics

There are those who thrive in hard times

In other words, we want you to step back far enough

You know how when you’re in your airplane

And you’re looking across the landscape

High in the sky, 500 miles an hour, 50 thousand feet in the sky

And you look down, and it all looks pretty calm
Down there, doesn’t it

Put it on the ground at that speed, not so calm

We’re encouraging you to take flight

We’re encouraging you to ba- ba- back up from it

Get a longer view and understand it

It is not possible for things to get worse in a universe that is expanding

But, this is something that you may begin to notice

As contrast exists, and it always will

And as everything is expanding, including contrast

As contrast becomes more, then asking becomes more

And when asking becomes more, and resistance stays strong

Then more people beat themselves up by not going with the flow

That’s all you’re seeing right now


But when you, as an individual, who can’t control what the others do

Let loose of your own resistance and go with the flow

Then you become one who experiences immediate thriving

Now this is the part about something you’re going to have to learn to do during this interim

It’s just a few months

You have to decide that you don’t care what others think of you

112,"I was reading a study yesterday on covid19 subreddit where they suggested that Coronavirus cannot spread easily in temperatures above 22 degrees. Summer is around the corner and I think the spread will slow down. I know some people will say that it's spreading in hot countries but the cases in Thailand and India for example are much better than Europe. I think it will get better as temperatures rise.

Ofcourse that was just one paper and they could be wrong but I really hope they are right. Which means life will gain some normal in the coming few months. This will also give people working on medicines to find better existing medicines for corona.

116,"Okay, for context I am a guy who takes jokes seriously a lot at least in the YouTube comment section which leads to a lot of people bugging me about it.
For one key instance, I said that people who were killed in movies don’t die in real life because I saw a comment saying one of the guys in the movie got his head cut off and said it was “such dedication“ as he called it so I said that the people killed in movies don’t die in real life.
And they all started bugging me about it leading to an argument and during that argument, one person called me a stupid waste of oxygen ,some called me idiots.
Until eventually I lost it and asked them why they couldn’t leave me alone and why they had to bully me for having different views than them but they all kept going so I said “can’t you just leave me alone?“ and one guy said no.
And I left another comment in response to his and I’m still awaiting a response from him
And this all happened despite me responding with evidence that my point was correct even then they persisted but like I said I am still awaiting a response.

And I just remembered my stupid ex boyfriend from 8th grade and I remembered how those flowers bloomed in my chest and it hurt but it felt like magic. And then he broke up with me for the girl in his Spanish class and I cried.

I didn’t feel that again till years later. I worked 14 hours driving from one job I hated to the next, it was just a bad day. A coworker invited me over to her place to relax and do face masks. I was exhausted and was just waiting to go through the motions. Instead she did a whole pampering routine for me. Lied me down and took care of me. I told her she didn’t have to, she said I work too hard and it shows. She just wanted to make sure I was okay. I was so overwhelmed by it I went into her bathroom to cry. I felt cared for, loved.
