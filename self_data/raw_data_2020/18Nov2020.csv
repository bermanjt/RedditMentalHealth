3,"I remember when things started going downhill for my family back in 2008 12 years ago. Things haven't gone back to normal ever since. This year has been the worst out of the 12 years we have been suffering. Any money I made this year is all gone so that I could keep the banks off my parents. I am broke and don't have a constant income. I am hoping to get work soon since my mother is the only one with the income. My father lost his job so things have been hard and I tried to pay the bills for as long as I can but now my money is finished and we don't even have money for groceries this Sunday, nor Monday to pay the mortgage this month. I am very depressed and frustrated. I decided not to eat much today so that we have some food tomorrow. Life in South Africa is awful and a lot of the time I wish my heart would stop beating. Anyone have financial problems right now and how do you deal with it?",18Nov2020,1

5,"
the tittle, a thought that comes across my brain a lot. On my worst days I find that thought pounding in my head to the point i just break down.

I have this thought because i find the way i operate so strange as a person

given i’m only 18, i’ve seen/ been through a lot in life. I’m strong in many ways but weak in others 

I gotten through crazy family shit, i walked away 

I joined the military, got through the training, i’m strong enough 

But i can’t stop over thinking. 
i’m on this base rn and i leave to a new one in 2 months. I’ll be honest this has been the loneliness time in my life. I ended up hooking up with this girl and i thought that *i actually got this person to spend my time with for the next few months, good bye loneliness!* . Didn’t go like that at all. She went back to this other dude and i see her every day and  i have this constant anxiety and it’s eating me on the inside. i constantly overthink little shit

My fault for setting those expectations, after this shit i learned never set expectations because nothing ever goes the way you want it to go. But I don’t what do to with my own mind sometimes. it truly does get overwhelming sometimes. 

I’m trying to better myself by adding reading and meditation into my routine along with the gym but it’s not the answer. 

does anyone have any tips?",18Nov2020,2
6,"My boy snoopy has been with me since I was 13 and I'm 26 now. We took him to the vet 2 weeks ago for surgery. I was hoping in those 2 weeks we can bring him home, but the Dr said it  would be best if he stayed so they can monitor him. I visited him 1 time a week. At first he looked like he was recovering, but last Thursday they said they found bacteria in his blood. Finds out some of his poop got on the where they did on the surgery. He had a blood infection and had a 50/50 chance of survival. They gave me the option to take him home, but he would die with me. I wanted him to live so I left him there, so they could do what they can. 
I called them today to see if I can visit him, but was given the news he died last night and all I think about is he thought we abandoned him. When I came today to see his body, I broke down. I feel so guilty, I honestly blame myself for his death. If he had his surgery sooner than maybe he could of been saved, but I lost my job cause of covid and I saved what I could with my unemployment for his surgery. I wanted to make it right by him and give him the treatment he needed. I'm sorry Snoopy, I love you. You were my best friend.

Thank you everyone for your support. Please love your pets a little extra for me.",18Nov2020,33
7,"I'm cisgendered but I hate knowing I'll grow up female and be it forever.

See, I don't like being female. I don't like my female frame, voice, height, the fact I won't have a lot of muscle, fat distribution, everything- I hate it.

I hate the sexism and stereotypes and the fact I'm seen as sloppy and informal if I wear baggy, male clothing.

Pretty much everyone I look up to (on the Internet at least) is male. Sometimes, I like the idea of maybe doing YouTube like them one day, but I feel put off by my gender. I once made a post about that as it's own topic and someone said it wasn't about gender, it was about personality. And I agree, personality is key, and the main part of how you're perceived by people but I'm sure gender plays a part.

Then I think if I became as successful as them (which is unlikely, but one can dream lol), it would be a good example because I don't see many females doing the sort of gaming/vlogging/storytelling videos I like to watch. 

But pretty much everyday I'm thinking about how I don't like being a female 100%. The other day I just sat for hours talking to myself about it, trying to think it all out. 

Idk, there's just a part of me that's rather sad about knowing I'll never grow up to be 'handsome' or 'strong' or 'masculine' but I don't know if there's anything I want to do about it so I always end up stuck.

People who've seen my posts know my general look, since I try to give details but stay vague just in case. I'm a mountain of a man, and work out every day to stay that way. Exactly six feet.

Well she is absolutely speechless and I ask again if she'd like some help, and she nods apparently still shocked. So I take her cart and ask her to lead the way. Long story short I get it all in and help her into her car, denying a tip because it wasn't even effort.

I'm constantly incredibly scared of the jobs I need to get but keep putting it off, and the idea that my life will one day randomly get so much worse from how bad it already is because of something bad with the car. It might not even be my fault. Some other driver making a mistake can ruin my life. I've been incredibly scared of everything and ineffective for so long. I'm pathetic, and I don't know how to not be. My family desperately needs money. I'm gonna kill my mom by contributing to her stress. The stress is gonna kill me. Relatedly, if anyone in my family has any random medical expense, it'll also ruin us. Many nights I feel like I'm gonna die, and I want to. The stress is killing me but I'm doing nothing for it, because I'm even more scared of doing something.

I hate my voice now.

18,"My dad did his bachelor’s back in Egypt. He then got a full scholarship to a master’s program in food chemistry. Which then got him a full scholarship to do his PhD in the same field in Germany. He learned a whole new language, a very hard one might I add, in addition to Arabic and English and published his dissertation in it. All of that made him a very good candidate for a teaching position at one of the most promising universities back home. He decided to leave all that without so much as a second thought to come to Canada so we could have a better education. Without any Canadian experience, he was unable to find a job that matched his skill set so he resorted to working in labour in order to support us. I’m sure the story sounds familiar if you’re an immigrant. He has recently developed bronchitis as a result which is very dangerous considering the current state of the world due to Covid-19.

22,"I have recently had a heated argument with my friends about the representation of various minorities in media, literature and art. The argument ended without resolution since some people just cannot take the heat of a serious, exploratory debate. And, as it usually happens, it ended with phrases such as ""I don't want to talk about this anymore"", ""I don't care what you are saying"" or ""stop ruining my night"". Even though I am by no means an expert in any social subject, I feel the urge to address both the way the conversation ended as well as it's actual content. 

First, it's ending perfectly captures the state of modern debate. The pursuit of truth is valued below proving yourself right and your opponent wrong. The most common approach I see is to demonize your opponent or interlocutor in order to avoid contending with what that person is saying. Because why should you care what an irrational, racist , homophobic, bigoted demon from hell has to say? Why is that person ruining your night with all the nagging and questions? This approach manages to be dreadful in two ways. To start, the qualities of the person speaking are not relevant to the continuation or the ""winner"" of the debate. The pursuit of truth is what matters, which brings me to the second, and perhaps more important point. Even if it happens to be true that you are speaking to the devil himself, how does that reflect on the ideas that he proposes? If the devil gave you the solution to all the world's problems, would you not take them? Since when have we stopped judging ideas on their merit, but rather on the person espousing them? Obviously, people earn their credibility and reputation in such things, but that does not absolve their ideas from being scrutinized and investigated. One's devil can be an angel in other's eyes. 

This might seem arrogant, but I aspire to be a scientist, so the first thing I do after such debates is to ask myself how I could be wrong, and my opponent - right. And even though I am definitely not perfect, I , at least, attempt to search for the truth as much as I can. After the conversation ended, I considered my friends' arguments as well as my own to adjust my position, but neither of us will extract any use out of it since they have no interest in even listening to my thoughts. So I lose, because I don't get the chance to have my thoughts criticized and observed by smart people, and they lose, assuming there was even a tiny bit of merit behind my ideas. In the end, everybody loses... 

Now to the actual content of the argument. The statement my friend made was that black people are underrepresented in movies and literature, and thus it is needed that we push to have more of them in both. Seems innocent enough, but I had several questions.

First of all, will it be pushed superficially such that the characters represent minorities just for the sake of doing that (Netflix phenomenon), or will it be natural? What I mean by natural is that their belonging to any group (be it minority or otherwise) is decided based on it's relevance to the story, or availability of actors (in case of movies or tv shows). I don't see a reason why the race of a character has to be mentioned at all if it is not relevant to the story. Would we love Harry Potter less if he was black? Doubt it, I believe that the world is not populated by bigots who couldn't appreciate the same story just with the color of somebody's skin changed. That is a difficult and vague question, since it's in the hands of the author to determine what is relevant to their story. Nonetheless, it is worth asking, in my opinion. And it was not answered by my friends. In the span of a twenty minute conversation, whilst trying to address that question, they managed to make absolutely idiotic and closed-minded statements. And if a moron like me can detect critical flaws in them, it should really tell you how dreadful they were. For example, one of the things said is that the authors base their story and characters upon themselves ONLY, the precise words were: ""What do you think? Black people only write about black people, asians only write about asians..."". I didn't know Tolkien was a hobbit! I don't need to give my thoughts on why this or similar statements are absolutely delusional.

Here comes the biggest problem I had with their logic. I detest their Marxist, tribal mentality of thinking about people in terms of the groups they belong to. The fact that this philosophy led to hundreds of millions of corpses and billions of lives spent in terror was not moving to my friends. I also went into a Petersonian spiral of arguments of how people belong to millions of groups and we haven't agreed upon which groups are more important than others (and thus the logical conclusion of the philosophy of intersectionality taken to it's extreme is to treat each person as a unique individual). I can't claim to be an expert or even remotely educated enough to talk about these things, so I would like to take my own approach.

What would a perfectly prejudice-free society look like? Let's take an example of race, since other qualities like gender have actually been scientifically shown to make a difference in person's character (I will refer to Jordan Peterson with that statement). In terms of race, perfection would look something like this: people truly look beyond race. They don't pay attention to it, they don't talk about it, they don't notice it, it is completely ignored. Take eye color as an example. Nobody cares about it or talks about it beyond telling somebody how beautiful their eyes are. It really doesn't concern anybody, and no-one pays attention to it. Why then can't we just do that, but with race? If we stopped talking about it, paying constant attention to it, using it as victim cards and so on, I would assume that eventually we would achieve color-blind society. The way I see it is simple: through children! They are truly innocent in that sense until somebody plants the ideas of racial division in them, intentionally or otherwise. So if we stopped that, in couple generations we would be close to done, or at least that's how I, in my naivete, see it. If not done, we would be better off.

Ok, seems good so far. Now comes the usual argument that I am so tired of hearing and debating. It dictates that even though the end goal is, in fact, as I described it above, we have to compensate people for the possible current losses they experienced because of the historic oppression of their group. Here comes something I am actually confident in. Suppose that is true, and we need to do that. How? How, on a mathematical, practical level will we do that? How can we determine PRECISELY, FOR EACH PERSON, how much they ought to be compensated for their historic oppression. Is there a way to account for a billion variables which, throughout history, affected the lives of current people. The answer is NO. It is impossible both on mathematical and on computational levels. Can't be done. And if it was to be done, it has to be precise, because otherwise this circus of oppression olympics will drag on forever. If people are not told that have been given precisely what they are ""owed"", they will not stop whining for free stuff. It is just as computationally impossible to calculate the ""average"" oppression restitution that a certain race is owed. And how would that be fair? Is a rich black kid in Harvard as historically oppressed as a poor black kid in south side of Chicago? The people who presume to know how mistreated a person is simply based on their race are imprecise, arrogant and actually racist to their core. They are not gods to peak into the soul of a person, see their troubles, and then fix them. Unfortunately, people like that have completely penetrated the administration and intellectual realm of academia, where I pursue my career.

I understand that I know very little and that my language is flawed (hence the nickname ProfessorMoron). And in the responses to this post (if there will be any) I yearn to be criticized, humbled and corrected.

31,"hi all,

i am a 17 year old immigrant white male originally from a spanish-speaking country. i now live in the United States. my father is a left-leaning, very rational and intelligent man, a worldly citizen - he's passed on his values to me and as a result i consider myself to be very wise in some things compared to other ppl my age.

my father is a jazz musician who lived in Africa for a year and has an affinity for black culture. while i'm not as racially sensitive as i wish i were, thanks to my exposure to other cultures i think i am very open minded.

however, i am also very insecure. this insecurity comes up in many different aspects of my life, leading me to confront my prejudices against black culture. one of the biggest dilemmas in my mind right now is whether or not there is any credence to my feeling towards these insecurities, or if it is fully something that i have to work to change about myself.

black culture is extremely dominant right now. i listen to a lot of black artists, and they are by far the most listened to by young people, even outside of the US. the US is, socially and politically, right now confronting itself on its problems with racism, ranging from the fact the country was built on the backs of slaves, to the modern racism that plagues our minds and our systems. additionally, in my mostly-POC school, black guys are considered more attractive, white guys are often referred to as ""white boys"", the hypersexualization of black males from the slave era is still present. basketball and football, the most watched forms of entertainment, are mostly black; our music is black, etc. BLM signs are everywhere. none of these things are bad, and i'm not hinting at any conspiracy - as i've stated, i bear no voluntary hatred towards black people and i happily participate in this culture. i despise the police, institutional racism, and i have revolutionary/anti-authoritarian beliefs that align with the plight of minorities in the US.

overall, the culture in my school feels very dominant against white people, contributing to the image of a submissive white. even the word black often bears sexual undertones when used by students and teachers. it is clearly something that bothers many white kids, as you see them here on reddit projecting their insecurities.

so, from a rational perspective, i'm trying to understand whether my personal biases and insecurities are a personal issue that are something i have to resolve myself or if there is a significant fault in our current culture that pushes white people towards... insecurity, lessened self-worth, and image issues.

thanks for helping me work through my thoughts (even writing this helped!) :)",18Nov2020,2

36,"Hi, I'm an 18 year old, just started my first year in college this year. While the COVID pandemic has certainly taken away some of my drive, I haven't been a stranger to this feeling before. I have absolutely NO passion for anything whatsoever. I am currently a math major, and this was decided largely due to my affinity for math, but damn is it boring. 

I have been told to switch majors and take something else and *maybe* I might find something that I love to do. But the problem is that this was suggested by people who have already found their passion, and the relatability just doesn't hit. It's not so easy in my perspective; I have a fear of doing so much to reach something I want only to be fruitless in my attempt. My brother switched majors because he hated his previous major, and found some happiness in his new major. But I believe that this was sheer luck. He had prior interest in other subjects, and that's the difference between him and I, or maybe even me and everyone else who had some passion for something. 

I previously had a passion for music, which was early on killed. While I still enjoying playing music, the passion I have for it is not enough for me to want to make a career out of it. And thinking back, I think I know what the people who told me that ""I can't do it"" meant. While I don't mean to sound depressing, this is really just the mindset that I am in. I feel used to being passionless, and I guess to some extent, pointless.

I made some mistakes, such as not taking community college, or digging into something sooner, or even just not thinking a certain way when I should have. It's all an accumulation of several factors, but it's too late to regret things now because I'm at a time where I have to make commitments, not dwell on regrets. 

But I need to start somewhere, right? I decided to start with this post.

38,"OKay, so I'm just really curious what you think of my personality.

I'm really okay with black or white or gray opinions, just tell me honestly what you think.

So I'm a 19-yr old girl, 

* I'm not a perfectionist, but I get really irritated when some things are not done a certain way. For example, my eggs must be sunny side up and it should not be too fried. When I eat, there must only be one side dish because I don't like it when I taste different kinds of food at the same time, unless if I they come in a set, then I would want to eat a little bit of everything simultaneously because I want to taste them all at the same time (I know, I think it's kind of weird too).
* When I am irritated, I never never say what I want to say unless if I was annoyed by my mom, my cousin, or my brother. Only with these three people I can say when I'm upset, although I only say what I mean very rarely. Most of the time, I do not express my annoyance to them. 
* I cannot handle confrontation. Seriously. Especially with my teachers. I end up crying even though I don't even know why. I cry even if I'm sad. I cry when I'm angry. It's just so weird.
* I hate it when people speak highly of themselves. I feel so irritated when I encounter this type of person, and I always encounter them. I hate it so much.
* I never say that I hate a person to their face, though I would often point it out to my 2 friends from senior high school (I gossip). I also tell everything to my mother.
* I hate my friends from high school, especially my best friend. She actually sabotaged me a couple of times, and often let out snarky but subtle comments. She really underestimates me, but I never confront her about it even though I know so well how much she hates me. I also know that she talks behind my back with our other friends (we were a group of friends back then). 
* I always always see the bad in other people. I always see what their flaws are, and I love it when other people mess up. I think there was a german(?) word for that, Schadenfreude? though I'm not quite sure of the spelling.
* I'm so different at school and at home. At home, and in our neighborhood, I never speak more than 3 words(of course, that's an exaggeration). I'm really very quiet and awkward. I don't know how to deal with people at all. At school I'm very loud and talkative, like one of those crazy fun girls. When I was in junior high school, I didn't have much confidence, but I had always had a nasty personality hidden beneath shyness. Although, I was also quite wild with my group of friends back in high school as well. When I was in Grade 11, I transferred to a university in the city because I really want to go to a school where I do not know anybody, and I was also on a full scholarship there (I'm from the province) . When I was in Grade 12, I transferred back to my school in the province, and I was like a changed person. I behaved to everyone like how I behaved with my friends only. Basically, I became shameless.
*  I like anime and reading stories.
* I used to hate kpop because I thought it was overrated, then when I checked out BTS, I actually liked it. That was when I was in grade 8. However, I hated it when BTS became super popular, and basically everyone was joining in on the bandwagon. I ended up liking EXO more, because they weren't that popular anymore then.
* From preschool up to senior high school, I always ranked first. However, I thought it was just dumb luck or something. I always found that there are many others who are much more eloquent, more well-versed, much 'smarter' than me. However when we took college entrance exams and scholarship exams, I passed everything, but only 1 of the other 10 smart people in my batch passed in the most premier university in the country with me. I... actually, don't know what to make of that. I really don't feel like I'm smart at all. I don't understand how I was able to ace my exams and rank first. Even our salutatorian ended up studying in just one of the small schools in our hometown because she didn't pass the entrance exams for the top universities in the country. I'm not even bragging, I'm seriously baffled.
* I like it when I find out that people are talking about me, even if it's good or bad. I don't know why either. I don't know if I love being the center of the attention or not, because sometimes I would deliberately shy away from it, and would prefer being in the sidelines. However, I am thrilled with the idea that I am superior to others. It's so weird.
* I like it when leaders are disciplined and strict. I like it when my environment is like this, but of course not to the point that I am disadvantaged.
* Despite that, I'm a big procrastinator. I would rather be lazy if I can help it, but I've never missed a deadline or a school day.
* I don't drink, or smoke, or anything like that. I get anxious when I'm late going to school and going to home. Even if my mother doesn't get angry. I don't like hanging out with my friends because I feel like I have to act and then feel exhausted afterwards.
* I don't go out of our house unless it's super important. I don't like going to parties especially.
* I feel like the only people I truly care about is myself, my mother, my father, and my brother. I don't feel sympathy for other people, even for my grandmothers, my cousins and my nieces.

44,"Okay, okay so let me clarify upfront that there us no actual cheating happening, it's just....cheating adjacent. 
To start with some background, everyone here is in college, my girlfriend and I have been together for three years, and we're very long distance. Long distance has actually worked great for us so far, today's story aside. My best friend is much closer, going to my university with me, although he's from out of state. Being from out of state, we realized that if we just got married, then we could totally make his tuition way more affordable. So we got married.
Now, my girlfriend was fine with this, seeing as I don't like men, but she also has a pretty bad jealous streak. She's been very possessive over my time lately. She knows it's a problem, and has started to work to get better about it, but progress is slow. In the meantime the solution I've found for having a social life without making her jealous is simply to sneak around, hanging out with my friends under her nose while she is none the wiser.
  Now, recently me and my friend that I married have gotten much closer after some pretty intense life experiences led us to bond. We're hanging out more, and as a result of getting closer we've also started to be physically affectionate. We're both very affectionate people, we tell our friends ""I love you"" a lot, we kiss on the cheek platonically. This is all a fairly new development, however, and since my girlfriend has been having all of these jealous issues... I simply haven't told her.
To make matters even more complicated, my husband and I have started sharing a bed recently. Again, this is totally platonic, but we like to snuggle, and his roommate is trouble sometimes, so he's just started to come over at night to cuddle and sleep in my bed. My girlfriend also likes to sleep on the phone with me. So my current nighttime routine right now is to tuck my girlfriend into bed, mute myself in the call, and then call my husband over to spend the night, snuggling and kissing and being affectionate while I am still in a call with my girlfriend. 
So I am sneaking around to secretly sleep with my husband without making my girlfriend jealous. If it weren't for the mere fact that I am not attracted to men and this is platonic, this would absolutely be considered some light cheating. But to be fair, we are married.

I don't want advice, or even consider this a problem or anything, I just think it's a deeply funny situation to be in, and I wanted to share it with people who  might also find it funny.",18Nov2020,0
45,"Not everyone is rowing your boat 

I always say that I've learned more lessons in the last 10 years than in my whole entire life.
It is because I am open to see them, to realize that things are not happening to me but for me, like I wrote about yesterday. 
I have learned to look for the lessons, what is this trying to teach me, what is the lesson here, in this pain, or in this storm. 

It is in these times I have learned the most, it is also when it hurt the most. When you think someone is for you but realize that they aren't or another big one I've learned lately that many people are jealous of you. Of what is going on in your life, of your success or what they perceive you to have.

I never before thought this, why? Because I am not like that, if I am your friend I am happy for your success, for your happiness but again another big lesson I learned is not everyone has your heart. Oh tough lesson, that one was and every now and then it seems that I forget it. Yes, sorry to burst your bubble not everyone is for you, not everyone is rowing your boat, some are drilling holes in it behind your back.

I realized that some people will never be happy with your success, with what God blesses you with. They will secretly curse you behind your back, they will say things because they haven't been blessed or that they are always trying to scheme something out of someone.

They try to make you look bad in front of others as in the case of recent, when a former friend said I was a whore because a man I dated four years ago helped me with some things in my home. By the way, I didn't ask, he offered and besides isn't that what you do when you date someone, want to help them?  
He knew I work 6 days a week, 10 hours a day, that I have 2 girls and a mortgage payment. That I do this all by myself and he wanted to help me out so because of that I'm a whore?
Or maybe she was talking about my best friend who took off 7 days and flew down to help me when I first bought my home and who wouldn't accept money from me even though I begged him to take it. Do you know what he said? ""I know what kind of friend you are and I know you would do this for me"" 

See sometimes it's about things you did in the past, things you continue to do by blessing others that come back to you. Another friend saw my post and told me to tell her husband what I needed done because she wanted to pay me back for all the times I gave her free haircuts when her family was in trouble and didn't have money to pay. But people who are jealous of you don't see any of the things you've done on the back end of your blessing. They are just thinking why her and not me, look at that? She must be using these people with her body because she shouldn't be getting these things I'm not getting.

Yes, some people are that petty and small, they are that overwhelmed with jealousy that they will make up anything to make you look bad because of the blessings in your life.

But I have learned that these are the same people that have skeletons in their closets. We've all realized that nothing will make them happy, that they will always be petty and small and that's on them. You need to keep doing you, you need to not get in the mud and roll around with pigs to justify your blessings or your life. You know the truth, you know what you've done, so keep it moving but just know...not everyone is for you.

Not everyone is happy for your happiness, even the closest to you may not have your back even when they are hugging you. Watch out they aren't pulling out the knife to stab you in the same back they are hugging. Yes, not everyone is for you, even if you may be for them.

 So today my friends, remember just keep doing good, keep blessing others because eventually you will get blessed back and when you do many others won't get it. Many will be jealous and petty, many will talk about you, put you down, say you're not deserving but you know the truth, keep it moving, caulk it up to who's on your side and who's not and just know that not everyone is rowing your boat.

46,"For the past couple of months, I have been doing everything I can to battle racism with my friends and some awesome strangers I met on the way. Here in Portland its really fun, because there are so many people that are aware of the systemic oppression and racism, and it is just easier to battle this thing and put it down in a group. I love to get together with new people and meet new members of the African-American community. It is great to listen to there stories and learn about there experiences with racism. While this is fun to do, it makes me incredibly sad to see this sort of stuff. African-American people even at my age (17F) already experience the evil that lurks in every corner of our society. Lately I've been trying to educate myself and listen even more, so that I'm more aware of what's going on and so that I know what I should focus on when trying to help the African-American community. 

On the many protests and get-togethers I was at for the past half year , I learned about the oppression that prevents African-American people from doing a LOT of stuff that white people like me can do easily. I also learned about how this slows their development in life down, like with education or there career and I really want to do something about it. What's even worse is that they can get shot for wearing a hoodie, I can't image living in constant fear like that. While I do sign petitions and try to take part in activism as much as I can, it still takes a lot of time before some proper reform happens and African-American people are able to start at the same level as white people. Because I feel really guilty about just simply having it easier in life then them and because I am sad that they have to deal with racism from white people, I really want to do something that would ease the struggle, even though I know I can't take it away completely. For the past month, I was trying to figure out what I could do to make at least some African-American people's day's brighter. Because my financial situation isn't the best rn, a huge donation to charities isn't an option (even though I did donate what I could already :)).

Then it struck me. As I said, I realize there is a lot of stuff that African-American people can't really do, because of systemic racism that prevents them from doing it, so I decided would love to volunteer and take some African-American folks on a trip, where they can experience things they normaly couldn't. Please, if you live near Portland, drop a comment below and sign up, I'm looking forward &lt;3 !! The things we would do are obviously up to you guys, but here are some ideas I came up with. We could go to HOTLIPS Pizza, I heard they've got some great pizza there. Another thing where I could take some new African-American friends is the Sunday Funday Drag Queen Brunch at the Darcelle Showplace (its on Sunday, 12-2pm). If we had time after, we could even go watch our first movie at the cinema (if it's open though, I didn't check). If none of those sound good to my possible new african american bros, bras, and my non-binary friends, we could go hang at my place. Because of the long pushed-for legalization, we could have a little bit of fun. I realize that some of you folks maybe can't afford this kind of stuff, so I though I could get you some weed, maybe some molly or crack and that we would have a good time (I would love to buy coke, but as I said I'm not in the best place financially). 

Finally, I want to say I would really love to give some of the members of the African-American community the chance to try some new experiences and maybe make some awesome new friends. If you are interested (and i would be really happy if you were), drop a comment below this post and we can link up, maybe exchange numbers and be friends, I want you guys to know that I think African-Americans are awesome people (sadly very often better that the whites). Please, comment or send a message and we can meet up and have a blast. **Peace out &lt;3 !**",18Nov2020,0

53,"I [24F] was in a relationship with a man [39M]. We had been seeing each other for about a year before he moved in. He painted himself as a Christian who was 100% straight. I honestly thought he was what he said. Many times he made comments against the LGBT community and lifestyle. He was going through legal troubles and hard times. He had no income. And like a fool, I allowed him to move in with me. He almost never helped with rent the two years he lived with me. I found out eventually that he had been secretly meeting up with a man near my apartment and both had been having unprotected oral sex with each other for months. I found out by going through his phone. The texts I read between them have traumatized me to this day. Things such as my ex telling him “I know all your spots ;)” or “let’s do 69.” In the texts, he also talked about how he thinks he likes both men and women but he wasn’t sure. He enjoyed sucking dick and tried finding other men to have sexual relations with as well. I was an idiot for not ending the relationship then and there. But I hated the thought of being completely alone in my apartment and he was supplying me with free marijuana and at the time, I’d say I was addicted since I allowed him to stay just so I could keep the supply coming. He apologized and promised he wouldn’t cheat again. But honestly, I had no feelings or attraction towards him after that. A few months later, I found out he was looking for other women to sleep with. He basically told me he lost attraction to me because I wasn’t taking care of myself. Those days, all I did was lay in bed and smoke. I quit school and I went through a pretty bad phase. He eventually found a job offer out of state and cut ties with me once he left. I’m pretty sure he still owes me money, like around $200, that I loaned him but he refuses to acknowledge my texts. I feel used and disgusted by myself. Throughout all this, I still had unprotected sex with him. Even after all the cheating. It’s been two years since I found out about the cheating and one year since we pretty much ended things. I just feel so sad. I did so much to help him. Loaning him money and giving him a free place to stay. And he appreciated nothing at the end of it all. I badly want him to face some kind of revenge for what he put me through. I’m also hating myself these days. I’m so embarrassed and ashamed that I don’t even think I can meet with a therapist and admit all of this. I think him cheating with the man is so disgusting. I know cheating is cheating, but it just feels so much worse knowing he did it with a man. Knowing he sucked dick and ate ass. And would come home and kiss me afterwards. I keep hoping that time will pass and my prayers to God will be answered because I just want peace in my heart. I want to never think about this again but I can’t get it out of my head. I badly want him to face pain and failure in his life and to die with God angry with him for being two-faced. I’m sorry I’m all over the place. I feel so ashamed that it’s even hard posting on here. So many bad people have entered into my life over the last couple of years that I feel so overwhelmed with the thoughts of what they did to me. I feel so used and tired. I’m afraid about getting into another relationship in case the next guy is also secretly into both men and women. I feel disgusted by men in general. And maybe all people. I’m turned off of love and refuse to date or consider marriage. I’ve wanted nothing but to live alone and be alone after everything that I’ve been through. I can’t get the thoughts of what he did with that man out of the head. It’s like I can picture it all in my head even though I’ve never seen it happen. I also searched the man on Facebook and saw his pictures. It traumatized me even more to see who he did it with. Please give me some sort of advice. Even if it’s harsh. I know people can only do what you allow them to do. So I blame myself a lot. Please tell me something that could give me some sanity and peace. I feel so much anger and disgust. I’m nothing but disgusting. I’m hoping to start working soon and keeping myself busy and maybe that’ll keep all these memories and thoughts out of my head. I also keep feeling like I’m the only one going through this sort of pain and trauma. Also, if this is important, before him, I was with a man who emotionally abused me and put me through hell and left me devastated and heartbroken. Then he came along and I thought things would be different. It took me years but I’m over the first relationship. But this last one, the one this post is about, is what I’m currently in pain and anger over. Please don’t find humor in this post. I’m not joking about anything. I’m humiliated by it though, that’s for sure. I haven’t been able to talk about what fully happened with anyone I know because it’s so embarrassing. Now I get triggered by things I read or see and it makes me think of what he did. Would that be considered PTSD? Please give me some advice. Am I the only one going through this? The reason I mainly feel ashamed is that I didn’t kick him out after finding out about the cheating. I let him stay for another year. Even after later finding out he was looking for other sex partners, I still let him stay. I still kept having sex with him and kissing him and all that. Also, I’m not going to be pursuing love or another relationship anytime soon. I just don’t have it in me anymore. Though I will probably hang out with men and keep things casual and not serious. But that’s it. 

Tl;dr I stayed with a man who cheated on me with a man and looked for other sex partners to cheat with and used me for a place to stay and blamed me for the cheating.",18Nov2020,1

63,"COVId has definitely done a number on all of us, but now I feel like it might be ruining me financially and I’m not sure what to do. In the early Spring I moved my trans gf in with me, but we lost our apartment we had on hold because of our states executive order; I’m a felon so finding a place to rent is like finding a needle in a haystack and after 8 months of searching for a place for us, it slipped through my fingers. I don’t condemn our governor for the order, it prevented people from being evicted. I was next in line to get this apartment once the guy was evicted. Honestly I’m glad it helped him out, but it kind of screwed me. I paid to let her stay with my little brother for a month, then we had to live in a motel for a month and a half before my old landlord decided to let us “both” move back in (God bless his soul).

At the same time we were laid off for 3 weeks because inspectors wouldn’t come out to the field to sign work permits. And when we did return to work it was a lot slower than the year prior, so I began looking elsewhere knowing that it was time to move on. I found a job with another concrete company for $26/hr, which was $5/hr more than what I was making at the time. But after a month I didn’t get more than 32 hrs in a week and ended up making “less” than I did at my old job. Then at this time, my older brother quit yet another job and couldn’t afford the car I co signed for him the previous year. The car payment and additional insurance added an unexpected $500 a month in expenses, right when I was making less money.

Then God smiled upon me and I found my way into a union job, paying me $34/hr on the check. But more medical bills kept coming in from not having insurance, and it took awhile for my girlfriend to find work as well. Paying money to help people out, and to finally start paying an old loan from a car that was repo’d when I went to prison. I want to buy a house someday and know I need to take care of all of that, so I gave them a lump sum down and started payments there, too. 

My new job is seasonal and our season abruptly ended early because of early snow and cold here in Minnesota. And a side gig I had lined up has been totally waylaid from the weather we’ve had in the last couple of weeks. I know this Union job is the one for me and I’m going to go back when the season starts again in April. I’m building a pension with them, and now I have excellent insurance. But this year wiped me out.

I got out of prison about 2 1/2 years ago with $600 or so in my pocket and a broken down vehicle that I fixed up to start working. Right now my unemployment is less than what I figured it would be and with all of the financial hits I took this year, I don’t have enough saved up to make it until the spring. I know if I can make it until April I’ll be fine, because with our hours we make about $80k in our 7 month season. But now I have a $700 part to buy for my second vehicle and another $400 for a mechanic to fix it for me, and my girlfriend needs to have a vehicle to keep working. She has two jobs now and it’s embarrassing to have to ask her to help pay the bills now. She didn’t have to pay for anything because I was doing so well last year and for the first month I was in my Union job.

It just hurts. I want to give her a life she never had before, and pushed and helped her finally get her driver’s license, among other things. She passed her behind the wheel test last Thursday and I couldn’t be more proud. But it sucks because I’ve been able to take care of everything and now I’m worried that by March I’m not going to have “any” money left over. 

I need a miracle, and I believe I’m doing the right thing with the new job, I’ve just never had a seasonal job before. But the shorter season pays about $30k more than my old job, insurance is free, and I know that building a pension is a phenomenal benefit that actually makes my hard work worth it. I just need to find some way to make it. But I’m about out of ideas and I just want 2020 to be over.

I was told I wasn’t creative in the 4th grade. I am 23 now but its still in ingrained in my head to this very day and I feel like I’m not creative and sometimes not good enough because of one teacher/test. How to overcome this?  (Full story below)

The story: In my elementary school, when you get into 4th grade, the school will put, into an “enrichment program”, those students that seem to be excelling in all areas of academics. (I was one of those kids)

 To be admitted into this “enrichment class” you had to take an admission test that tested all areas of knowledge and measurable skills... 

One part specifically tested how “creative” you were... on the sheet of paper, there were printed three vertical lines and the test asked you to create an image or a drawing of anything that we wanted stemming from, or using, those three vertical lines... 

I didn’t know what to do or what they wanted me to draw (I’ve never been imaginative when asked to create a drawing, nor did i ever like art) so i just drew some shapes and called it a day because i killed it on all other parts of the test.. once we got the results back, I learned that I wasn’t accepted into the program because I wasn’t “creative enough”.

Ever since that day, I have believed it and I feel like it has created a huge block in my imagination for my whole life, not allowing me to be confident in my abilities to learn and work..

Then I started developing sharp pains in my lower abdomen. Now I was really freaking out: “Oh my god, I have cancer, it must be advanced, oh my god I’m gonna die in the middle of a pandemic!”

I got my period about an hour ago. The sharp pain I was feeling? It was cramps. Moral of the story: if you’re in pain, don’t listen to the internet.",18Nov2020,2

86,"Age is all in your mind

Yes, I am the Energizer Bunny and when recently somebody said that to me and I laughed because he's like 20 years younger than me. 
He was asking me what I did this weekend and I told him that I redid my front and back yard.
He said he didn't think he could keep up with me, which was a real compliment but come on your twenty years younger, you should be running circles around my old ass!  

What's wrong with the young people today? They don't have the work ethic that I grew up with, to me I'm not even working hard now. If you want to talk about hard work, it was when I was married and trying to take care of 2 kids under the age of 2,  running a bread route from home, taking care of 200 plus animals and making sure the house was perfect and the dinner was on the table every night at 6 o'clock.
After cleaning up, homework,  baths and bedtime, I would be doing hair until 11:30 at night.

See that was hard work, this... this is a piece of cake. I will admit that it takes a little longer to recover now than it did 20 years ago but all in all, I'm hanging in there.
 Obviously I'm making a 35 year old tired just listening to me so not so bad. 

But seriously, I like doing what I do, I like getting out of my yard and cleaning and mulching. I like  painting and doing things around my house, fixing stuff. It gives me a sense of accomplishment, like I did that and that makes me feel good that I can do all this myself. I can show my girls that they too can do all of this by themselves, if they need be.

Now don't get it twisted I would love a man who we can do it together but until then….I'm good. I don't know why I am like this, I guess I saw my parents work all day and then fixed our broken down farm house at night and on all their days off. My mother worked beside my dad and never complained, these are the genes I got. 

I wasn't fortunate to have been born with a golden spoon up my ass, if you wanted something, you worked hard for it. It was just life for me.
I wasn't born with a sense of entitlement like so many kids are today. You either won or you lost, you didn't get a trophy for being half assed. No one got to be ""famous"" by taking pictures of themselves, you had to have a real job.

I do what I have to do because I have to do it…
I have no other choice, I know no other way. I want to keep active until it's my time. I will never be old inside my head, I will keep acting and doing things until it's time to go home.

So today my friends, my advice to you is don't act your age. Keep doing the things you love, keep active, exercise, learn new things, try different things, be open to everything and anything.
You give yourself the energy. Your mind controls your body, so if you say you can't, you won't.
Anyone can be an Energizer Bunny, it's just up to you.

Besides, despite the popular notion these days that the purpose of therapy is you telling all your problems to someone else so the people in your life don't have to care about you (why would I pay $150 to vent to someone lol), what you should really be using therapy for is to do things like learning how to develop good habits and manage any negative behaviors (shit like staying up all night, impulsivity) that you find yourself engaging in.",18Nov2020,3
90,"I was on the fence about this for a while but I haven't been enjoying the program that I was in and with Covid and all, I wouldn't be getting any field placement experience for this semester and the next anyways. I don't have perfect grades and I doubtful I'll easily find a job once I graduate.

I got a seasonal job I'm about to start soon so I'm really looking forward to that. I was planning on completing this semester while starting that job since it is night shift. Though, after a bad test and a lack of motivation I just want this semester to be over. 

I weighed the pros and cons of withdrawing from the program and it seems that pros outweighs the cons. It's just that it feels like I'm still a failure from wanting to withdraw. That alone is the reason why I didn't want to leave the program. I think that I shouldn't see it like this but I do...

 I didn't have any particularly bad grades and including the current one I'm in, I have 2 semesters left. I feel like I'm close on completing but at the same time I'm not certain what that accomplishes. With the test I did today, as well as my computer crashing during the test, it really feels like I'm not cut out for this program and that this program isn't for me.

94," Hello everyone, I'm 24, F. This is going to be a very long and possibly complicated post. But I hope someone out there will read it, or some of it. I don't know who else to speak to, and I've become so desperate and lonely I'm confessing everything on the internet. I never ever imagined I'd see myself here, but life is weird.

 I've always been very embarrassed of myself- I think it began with my appearance. One of my earliest memories, is actually my dad commenting on how weird I looked, sadly. My parents gave me a weirdass Greek name. I've always hated it, but since people tended to see me as a weirdo to begin with, I just kept it. Changing your name is weird. Man...

Anyway 
(I'd later find out my own dad is a narcissist and a racist, manipulative, abusive man, and borderline pedophile.) My mom is quite sheltering. But I never wanted to hurt her or cause her stress because my dad would do a fine job of that. I'm a compliant pushover of a person at times and a manipulative asshole at others. It's like I learned to judge who I can and can't mess with. And I'm so scared of making a mistake, I just don't live.

 I started kindergarten at 4, the youngest kid there, and the only non-white one. I'm Creole and Canadian native, with very dark eyes, light skin, and dark curly hair. 

 Kids made fun of my curly hair constantly, among other things, calling me 'not human' 'it', and later, vampire. People mispronounced my name and created embarrassing nicknames for me. I grew up believing I was ugly and 'wrong', straightening the hell out of my hair, ect, trying to be 'perfect' (white) I felt like my family was wrong. I just wanted to disappear. So I basically did, I became shy to stop drawing any more attention to myself than my looks already did. From 2-6 years old I went from a kid that would tell you off to super quiet and anxious due to my home life and school, there's never been anywhere I can feel safe. My dad became crazy over money. He used to budget out an amount my mom could use, and if she went over, the whole family was lectured and he yelled at my mom over silly things, like I remember asking for a pack of cookies in checkout and she bought them for me, only for my dad to yell at her and make her cry that night. I felt like it was all my fault, if I hadn't have spoken up or been 'greedy'. If I'd never taken a 'risk.' I think that fear began to rule my life with an iron grip. 

My parents got divorced, when I was 7. It was while my mom was staying home to take care of my 2 younger siblings. During the divorce, my dad sabotaged his career in an attempt to get out of child support, among many other things. They would continue to drag the whole legal ordeal out until I was in middle school, we would continue to get poorer and poorer. This prompted many trips to the counselor's office to meet with social workers, many times I had to leave school or come in late- kids began to spread rumors about me being mentally impaired. I don't know if they were slightly racist, or what, maybe it's because I couldn't afford the nicest clothes- but they did it. I've had psychoanalysis done and nothing has come up. 

I would make friends, and my dad would drive the child or the parents away with his personality. Kids would come over to my house, and I felt like all they were doing was gathering reconnaissance about my family to fuel rumors in school. So I quit letting people get close. People didn't want anything to do with me, because I always said no to sleepovers, or anything else, out of fear they'd find out I had the 'wrong' pj's or see how fluffy and crazy my hair was in the morning or any way I was otherwise 'uncool'. Stupid little things.

My self esteem is fucking shattered. 

I went to high school for a year before transferring online because I was so paranoid of anyone knowing anything about me, I was afraid to go out- because I was afraid I'd need to pay for something, I was scared again that someone might find a little fault in me and use it to hurt me. I didn't have a car, or I wore X shirt last week, *anything.* I developed a fucking eating disorder. I fell into a fog, I made *myself* better because I was too ashamed to ask for a therapist and too scared to go to the hospital.

  I kept to only a small group of friends I already knew, and then- they all left come time for college.

Ah.. College. I've never been able to make that work out. It's too expensive, the applications were too expensive. I remember filling mine out (paper) and later saw them in our trash because my mom couldn't afford to send them. I took a gap year and hopped around retail jobs, always quitting because I was just ***SO SO*** horrifically embarrassed of myself. So afraid of handling other people's money, messing up, being lectured by my manager. It's irrational but I felt like I traded one 'handler' for another. I was being controlled *again*. Normal people are fine with this, but the conditioning my dad had subjected me to reared it's ugly head for me. I realized.. I cannot handle money. I found out I couldn't buy myself food. I cringe so hard at myself. I started cutting, because my family never let me express a single emotion. I always had to be a perfect happy little angel, sadly I'm human and I have emotions.

2016. I sent in the college applications for myself.

 I'd missed the SAT in high school due to stupid home stuff, so I applied for a college that didn't require the score. I messed up the financial aid, and ended up $5k in student debt in a semester. I freaked out. I knew my mom couldn't pay that, and I was so scared of the debt to come, I just withdrew. I started reviewing for the SAT, but my advisor suggested I try community college instead, so I did.  


What a fucking mistake. My dad (who still owned the house my mom and I lived in), decided he wanted it. He evicted us about halfway into my first semester and bought a young wife from Africa (I know this is sooo convoluted, but it's true) He moved into our house with her, my mom had just lost her nursing job, so we moved into a hotel halfway across the state. I never went to my classes again, failed them, and got put on academic probation. Since we had to stay in a seedy part of a city, my mom's car was stolen a week before christmas. We lived in a shelter for a while- too long- we got kicked out, thankfully, we were able to buy a decent SUV before that, though.

We moved to another hotel.

I took the SAT, I got approx. 1200. But I'm still in debt and now I have a GPA of 1.8. I'm an academic wreck and unemployed, aside from selling my shitty art to DnD campaigns.

My mom and I lived in hotels for about 3 years. I worked at a gallery a little, I felt so fucking alone again, as the only young person there- and my anxiety became so intense, I stopped sleeping (shitty hotels are hot as fuck in the summer) and became suicidal last summer. Really, walking to work in the snow I thought, I think I'll just get shitfaced after work and lay down here in the fucking snow.

We got out of the hotels in May. Moved in with a friend and my mom. I've pissed away this year, being a NEET, trying to 'freelance' (it's a joke, I can't sell myself) using the pandemic as an excuse. I've always had a fear of working. See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/jru1wd/im_like_an_extreme_agoraphobic_except_its_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) post. I live in a rural/small town and with that + the pandemic regulations, it almost feels more lonely than being homeless. At least I could sit in a coffee shop or something back then.

 I had a girlfriend (I suspect my dad made me hate men too) but I couldn't deal with the commitment and basically manipulated her into disliking me so *I* could be the one telling her to leave me. I think I could be psychologically damaged or have literal developmental damage. My emotional response to everything is ""They think I'm incompetent, I should get out of their sight."" I get off on controlling people, because my dad never let me control a goddamn thing. I'm afraid of risks, especially financial risks. I'm basically afraid of money. I feel like my childhood, teen, and early adult years have been completely and irreversibly depraved. I haven't had a friend since 14, I haven't been to a concert. I haven't had sex, I've never been on a vacation, never had an allowance.

 I no longer have a driver's license or ID, or social security card. My dad has all those. I'm basically subhuman. I can't own or rent property, I can't own a car, my credit is so bad from my student loan mistakes.

I don't even have facebook because I hate people knowing my disgusting past and current state. Everyone posts cool stuff they're doing, I never got to do any of that stuff. I have nothing to say when I talk to people, what am I gonna talk about? This shit? 

And life has so much.. shit to deal with. Insurance. Jobs. Bills. Loan repayments, cars, politics. I have no idea how to navigate any of it alone, you can see that with how bad I messed up in college.
  
I don't want to die. I realized I'm quite pretty, when I talk, people like what I have to say. But I don't know if I can stand living with the damage it's paired with. Every little thing has welled up into an unfathomable pile. My family never let me have emotions, so I've been bottling everything up for 24 years.

There's more where that came from but I just started typing, man. If anyone reads this and has any tips on getting my life back, I'm so desperate. Thank you.",18Nov2020,10

96,"I feel I've acted legit crazy. I've always been pretty anxious but I'm like 10 times worse for the last 6 months. My boyfriend was a dream come true for the first 7 (?) months of our 2 years together. He had bad OCD after this and refuses to get help. He had the type that makes you unsure of who you are anymore- really disturbing sexual thoughts, makes you doubt you love your partner, makes you think you're racist, makes you have violent thoughts. He would cry to me occasionally because he felt so scared. My heart broke for him but after comforting him everyday and hearing his scary thoughts, I became so terrifed because what if it isn't OCD? After all, he has never been diagnosed. Some of the thoughts really hurt me- he found Rachel hotter/he worried i was cute but not hot/unattractive/ he worried he only wanted me initially for the sex but I turned out to be awesome, I was so hurt and I couldn't be upset about it cos it was OCD, not him.
 
He acted normal for a few months but it came back in summer. I made it worse by asking for reassurance it was OCD and he wasn't all these evil things he was thinking. I said he needed to see a doctor to prove to me it's OCD so I can feel safe continuing this. He was too scared. I turned to Reddit day after day for months for reassurance it was OCD and he wasn't bad. I did it so much my accounts got suspended over and over. It was a crutch/coping mechanism. I guess instead of drinking/drugs or binge eating, i vented or looked for help on reddit. I spent hours everyday trying to reassure myself he was a good guy in my head or on Reddit. I've been somewhat better as of late but I've been losing feelings because I realise how broken this relationship made me. Now I'm terrified if it does end, I will be single forever, even if I become me again. Imagine dating a ""normal woman"" for a year or 2 and she hits you with this red flag of a story.

100,"During a rather severe depression low, I put on over 40 lbs, bringing my weight above 200 lbs, 220 to be precise. Last year, I got really sick (before Covid) and couldn’t eat much for several weeks, and had to be very careful what I ate in order to not trigger another gallbladder attack while healing from another surgery. I lost 20 lbs, but it wasn’t a healthy way to lose weight. I did manage to keep those pounds off, but wasn’t losing any more. 

Back in September, I started dieting again. I’ve been eating a bit more healthy, but haven’t given up carbs or anything this time. Instead, I’m eating smaller portions, not snacking out of boredom, and moving around more. I’ve also been taking a green tea supplement that is mainly caffeine, which helps with low energy levels. Also, since having my gallbladder out, I can’t eat greasy or deep fried foods like I used to, so I’ve been able to train myself to stop comfort eating, which I’m sure makes a huge difference. I weighed myself for the first time in about a month and was shocked to see I’m down another 10 lbs! I can see the difference when I look in the mirror now, and clothes that weren’t fitting are again. I still have about 40-45 lbs to go to get to my ideal weight, but I’m so happy to be on the right track! I feel good and I don’t cringe when I see by naked self in the mirror anymore.
