2,"I'm 15 and I am born and raised in oahu hawaii to be more specific Honolulu. I'm conflicted on whether I want to be here my whole life. I'm in a lucky enough situation where my family has money and i am able to go to America for college and not have to worry about money but do I really want to do that. The last time I was in America it was kind of hell it didnt feel like home I felt lost even if I knew where I was going. My main concern is the price of living here in Honolulu. My parents have a 4 bedroom condo we live in we own it and it's almost paid off. Most people are lucky to have a studio apartment here. Am I going to be able to make it on my own here. The cost of living is so high I have just recently learned that it's not normal to pay 8 bucks for a gallon of milk. It's really scary and I know I'm just in my head right now and when I wake up in the morning all of these worries will go away, but can you give me some advice.",02Feb2020,1

5,"I'll probably never be able to understand what it feels like to have an emotional connection with another person. I may never get to experience the joy of genuine friendship or know what its like to love another person, let alone have my feelings reciprocated. I probably won't ever know what it's like to just enjoy another person's company and not feel like I have to be a more ""exciting"" version of myself just to be accepted by others. 

Everybody talks about these normal occurrences they have on a seemingly regular basis and to me it's like reading an alien language because I'm unable to comprehend how good any of it feels. I used to think people were just trying to be ""deep"" and were acting over-emotional, but as it turns out, the only flaw in the equation was me. Every normal person feels these things. I don't.
Everyone else is normal and can relate to these experiences so easily. I'm tired of having to be the one that needs to put on a different personality in public in order for people to like me. I don't get anything from that except people who expect me to behave differently than what my actual personality is every time they see me. They like someone who's not even me. 

I've always been alone. Even when I had friends I was never ""close"" to them. Every interaction with them was just trying to see if I could come up with something funny to say or do before the conversation ended. When my friends were upset, they turned to each other for support, not me. Not like I'd have any idea what to do in that situation anyway; I just wanted to feel included and I didn't understand how to do that.

What the fuck is the point in me even being here? Oh, society needs people like me b/c I'm a deep thinker and all the greatest inventors or leaders were thrived in solitude. Too bad the only things I think deeply about are my own thoughts and feelings. I'm not fucking smart either. I'm not going to become some computer whiz that advances the human race with my innovative ideas. At this moment, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not capable of doing anything beneficial to other people. 

This is how I am. I don't crack jokes b/c I'm not concerned with making people laugh (not to say I can't make jokes every once in a while, I'm just not the type of person who gets a hit of dopamine from making people smile and apparently, this is another common thing people experience), I'm monotone in most day to day conversations b/c that's just my normal day to day voice and when I do speak with high energy it's usually when I'm alone (I talk to myself about stuff I'm doing sometimes) or because I'm meeting people for the first time and want them to think I'm normal and engaged, meetups in this area are no longer appealing to me and the one I actually did attempt to join b/c of an unusual common interest ignored me, I was more relieved  when I found out my kickboxing classes were being cancelled b/c I'd no longer have to worry about trying to interact with the other attendees every day, and at work I'm more interested in working and talk about 5% of the time and I don't bother with daily greetings every day (unless I end up face to face with a person) b/c I don't think it's particularly important to say hi and nothing else for the rest of the shift so people probably think I'm boring or rude or maybe even fucking retarded. I tried the common advice of joining groups and volunteering and learned how to hold conversations, but then I find out that I don't particularly want to ""hang out"" with people outside of that event, so the whole ""invite them out for coffee or lunch"" step never comes into play. Even if we did hang out, it'd probably either be me trying to continually apply social skills by asking them about themselves and trying to relate or me deciding to be my actual self around them and focusing on the actual activity, not being interested in trying to entertain them or make sure they're having a good time.

Apparently, with genuine friendship, people just enjoy being around each other, but since I never get the desire to want to hang out with most people I meet, I probably won't be enjoying their company if I even ask them to (and if they agree to afterwards). I actually did invite a group of people out one time, quite recently, and they all either ignored me or declined in one text after saying they'd be down for it in person. I'm not bitter about this incident or anything, they just didn't want to hang out with me  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I absolutely did have social anxiety at one point, but after overcoming that and most of my social ineptitude, all I found was that I just didn't care that much. Unfortunately, not caring is really only beneficial if you're a huge socialite b/c rejections can't get you down. If you're like me, you'll probably just be alone forever and never get to experience the full range of human emotions. If you put on a persona for people to like you, you're not being yourself and every interaction you create from that will be empty and meaningless. On the flip side, if you are yourself, it's harder, if not impossible, to connect with people b/c you come off as weird and people will probably just consider you rude or boring and not want to talk to you either.

All of this leads me to doing literally everything alone. Please, tell me what other option I have. I'm not going to sit on my ass and be a bum until I die. 

I really don't want to become the fucking hermit who hates people and spends their days living in the forest, but I'm literally wired differently than everyone else and there seems to be nothing good that comes from it other than being independent and not caring about impressing people. Oh woohoo, I could go live alone forever and no one's going to care.  I really don't believe I feel loneliness, I'm more bitter about the fact that I haven't been able to feel or experience what everyone else does b/c whoever's in charge of the universe decided to put me on this planet with a shit ass brain that couldn't be bothered to develop like everyone else's. 

I don't even know if I'm looking for advice b/c I don't know what else could help me.  I probably could just try to meet more people to see if I can more naturally relate to anyone, maybe I'll just post more online where people sort of like me tend to hang out. I want to try shrooms too, I've heard success stories in that area.",02Feb2020,1

I want to tell them to cherish these moments, to hold on to them and to commit them to memory. Don’t take these times for granted. Some of my own happiest memories are of moments just like this 30 years ago. But I also don’t want to embarrass my son in front of his friends.

15,"I have emetophobia, basically explains my actions. But one day in 7th grade chorus as we were all rehearsing one girl ran over to the trash can a few feet from me and began vomiting. no warning. I remember i tried to hold my sheet music up to cover that side of my vision to at least make it so i would only hear it and not see it. The teacher wouldnt let me, don’t know why i didnt just hold it up anyway. But now i have a forever scarring memory of having a panic attack, my whole body felt cold, i could barely breathe, and was crying while i saw a girl vomiting just SO much into a trash can in my peripheral vision a few feet away from me. I have lots of memories like this and they all haunt me sometimes. 

Another time I came out of a movie and there was just a pile of vomit in the parking lot, do the people i was with remember this? definitely not, i do. 

phobias are just SO fun, especially when its one people think is funny so they put random “haha shes so drunk she threw up everywhere” scenes in movies. Relating to this. I have some movies I absolutely *hate* because of random vomit scenes that made me have an attack. Like Pitch perfect, very first scene had vomit, I watched it so long ago and still remember this, wanna know something else? that wasnt the only vomit in the movie! theres another scene were they ALL vomit, nobody i know remembers this scene but it terrified me to the point of having to have my friend turn it off because i couldn’t look at the screen. 

I remember when movies have vomit in them, no matter how little, if it was off screen, if it wasnt even heard, all. 

I think the worst vomit media thing was some tv show that used to air where people were entered into a competition to eat as much food that they hated before they threw up, when they did, they filmed it *real* close. I would come home from school to see my father watching this show. fucking terrifying. 

i am so damn grateful for that website that lists triggers in movies, stuff ranging from is there blood,  are there scenes of abuse, are there clowns, does the black person die first, etc nothing made me happier than being able to check if things i wanna see have vomit in them, some shows so i just skip those episodes entirely.

16,"I'm pretty miserably cheap and do not like buying things. But when an opportunity presents itself I grudgingly  will buy something I need.

My current work boots were a horrible buy. I needed a pair fast and bought some brahma brand workboots from walmart for $28 (if I remember correctly). Three months later the thin ""leather"" on both boots cracked. They look like shit if you look closely. But I was determined to get my moneys worth of them so I kept wearing them. Had them for probably three years no. Also, one the soles (the heel part) is coming off, but still wearable (I can put some glue on it to fix it). 

ANyways... to the point of this .... I needed some new boots. And I got an email from a discount company offering 50% off any order.  So I go look on their site and found these Xray brand black men's Jack hiking boots (they look like workboots... I wear workboots for their looks) for $20 (free shipping and the 50% off discount). 

I looked up their prices online at various places and they go for about $40, but I didnt look up a lot of places like I would normally do if I was trying to save money.

The smaller one had a little girls voice and was saying something like “mommy, why is that person staring at us” and raised a sleeve to point at me. the voice was quieter than the monkey screeching but loud enough to hear the “mother” dress didn’t respond. i had a roommate at the time and i thought “hey maybe i can call him in here to come shake me fully awake or something” so i gave it a shot. did not work. i just wound up stuck in bed quietly squeaking?? if that makes sense. like when you try and make sound but just cant. eventually it went away and i got up feeling really weird and in a cold sweat. it was so surreal and strange.",02Feb2020,1

21,"This is going to be written from my (29/M) POV but it also applies to women as well.

I got married and had kids at 25 to a woman that, honestly, was the wrong one. We decided to marry rather than go our separate ways and just 'have my child out there somewhere in the world with his mother'. We gave it a pretty honest shot but it just wasn't meant to be.

We argued a lot, couldn't communicate and watched as the 'love' turned to like, like turned to tolerate and tolerate turned to dislike. Definitely not saying I was perfect along the way but I dealt with a lot from her that I shouldn't have had to. Needless to say, 5 years later, we're going through divorce. Arguments, deployments, infidelity, stress. All just too much. Too much damage to heal and at this point, we don't want to. Holding onto the past just makes you resent the present more. For the best. The children suffer as a result of our (the parents) failed relationship. 

Even *before* we got married, I should have seen more signs, listened to them, trusted my gut and, as the post suggests, known my worth. I'm not the best looking guy, I'm not the smartest etc etc but I do well enough that it wasn't a concept of 'its her or I'm going to be single forever'. I think I was so interested and happy that this woman liked me that I just put my self worth and respect to the side.


Fast forward to the other day. There's woman I've known/liked for a long time. She and I talked a few months back (after knowing each other for a few years) but just for circumstances, it didn't work out that time but she did do a few things I didn't like ( I know that makes me sound controlling possibly but it's not that. We're allowed to not like things). We would text during the day and at night she would go home, get high and then FaceTime me. I would set aside time, not go to the gym, not do things so I could be present for her and during the call, I'd basically just sit there, not high, and watch her just watch TV and not really interact. I have no problem with her doing that at all but then just tell me you're gonna just chill rather than ask to FaceTime and then just not interact with me. 
I mentioned it to her once and she did actually stop but that was after weeks of it happening. I'd sit through the whole conversation, it would finish and instead of sticking up for myself, I'd just say everything was fine. Rinse and repeat. Honestly, probably my fault. I should have said something but maybe she should have realized too that it wasn't really productive?

Anyway, back to the other day. We start talking again. Texting during the day, all good. Then she asks me to call her. I do. We talk for 5 mins, she says she has to go real quick and she'll call me back after. Alright cool. So I shower, eat and just wait for her to call back. Eventually I tell her I have to go to bed soon so if you're gonna call, call (ffs). She basically blows me off and says let's talk tomorrow. No explanation. She texts me after asking if I've seen different tv shows and how funny they are (basically she blew me off, after not talking for months, to watch TV) Felt like we were back in the facetime days. 
The next day, same thing. Text all day all fine, laughing, joking etc. Get back home, we're having an awesome FaceTime for like 5 mins. She tells me she's gonna go out and grab food and she'll call me back once she's back. You know the rest of the story; 40 mins goes by then she just says lemme call tomorrow. Of course she asks me if everything is alright and I just say yes. 
To me, that was the final straw. I stopped talking to her. No point explaining to her why I was annoyed when she can't even see it herself. For years it feels like I've just let women basically dictate how the relationship goes. I'm gonna seperate this next phrase because I feel it's really important:

Men, realize that you have to be courted too. She's trying to win you, as well. 

I put my self worth and self respect second to 'getting the girl'. But realistically, why do I *want* the girl that can't even call me back? Why do I *want* the girl that can't put the same time aside to talk to me as I do for her? It's not fair to me. She was basically using me as a short term confidence boost. I feel like she knew that I'd always be there and if it didn't work out with some other guy, she could hit me up, act like she missed me and she knew that I would miss her, compliment her and make her feel good. And realistically, she was right. I was so focused on ""getting her"" that I put myself to the side and not even seeing how I was getting treated. I was spending so much time courting her that I didn't see that I wasn't getting courted or being treated with a, in my opinion, very base level of respect.

Throughout public school I always just talked to people in my classes, and while I enjoyed speaking to them every day, I never hung out with anyone outside of school or clubs. I spent all my free time with my family, I guess because I was afraid to put myself out there. 

I'm now in my second semester of college. The most meaningful human interaction I have in a given day is shooting the shit with my roommate about our classes. I've driven two hours back home, three weekends in a row, to be with my family. All I do is work on my schoolwork, play video games, or sleep. I never imagined I would end up like this, I always thought I would change myself before I graduated high school.

I feel pathetic. I feel like I'm turning into one of those creepy people that only ever gets spoken to out of obligation or pity. I want so badly to go out and meet people, get a job, join clubs and organizations, but I'm terrified what people will think of me if I speak to them. I feel like I'm boring, and socially awkward, and an asshole even though I want to be kind. Most of all I feel like nobody cares that I exist.

I feel like I've stunted myself, that I'll always be alone, and that terrifies me. I want to have people that enjoy talking to me, that I can share my thoughts with and listen to. Eventually I want to have a family I can take care of. I just don't know how I'm ever going to get there from where I am now.

33,"At first I was a little upset about it, but then a little while later I changed my mind about the whole situation.

So here is how we got to this point:

I have liked this girl for a couple years now. We met at a previous job, and became pretty fast friends. We had the same major, same interests and same goals in life.

At the time I was not mature enough to want a girlfriend. I was a college senior living his best life. A girlfriend wasnt on my mind.

But I grew to like her a lot. Just was a super awesome person and is a great to be around. After a year or two, and after I graduated from college, I was over the college lifestyle and was feeling ready to move into dating someone. I wanted to ask her. But before I even got the chance, she started dating someone else. I knew he sucked for her, but i stayed with her as a friend throughout the whole thing.

So then I graduate college, and then move to another job in the city. I work there for a while and offer her a job where I worked to get her out of her current job because she hates it. (We were both servers for our time in college. She is still in college and I am close to 1 year graduated). My new job was a server at a very high end restaurant in a downtown city. It was very selective in the hiring process. 

I was looking for a high paying job that can alleviate financial stress while I study the MCAT for medical school, and this job landed right in my lap.

It is an awesome restaurant and extremely enjoyable to work at. Everyone is extremely nice to one another and it just feels like a family. Never thought to say I liked a serving job, but i genuinely like working here. So much so that I was promoted to a supervisor position. Once I got promoted to this position, I essentially told my managers, that ""I have a friend who would be a perfect fit here and would help us immensely as a server."" Then she was hired.

Anyway, i got her a job in my new restaurant to get her into a higher paying serving job so she wouldn't have to work as much during the week for her classes. I knew what classes she was taking, and they weren't easy. So she needed as much time as she could to so well. And I genuinely wanted that for her.

A month goes by and some crazy shit happens

she broke up with her boyfriend and he became somewhat inhinged.

He stalked her, broke into her apartment, and was using a find my iPhone connected to his PC to see where she was at all times.

It was extremely fucked up and I totally supported her by cutting all contact with the guy (we were friends). I think that was total bullshit and I'm not gonna be friends with that garbage.

She was pretty traumatized by it and I always just let her talk about it. I just listened and told her that it is totally okay to feel the way she does.

I became really good friends with her at this point because I just wanted her to know that someone was there for her (lots of our old friends at our old job kinda didnt give a shit that this happened to her). So I kind of cut ties with all of them except a few who also were pissed at this whole situation. It ended up leading to a pretty tight friend group with her and I and then a few other people from our new job who were totally pissed this had happened to her.

It was me, her, another couple girls and a couple other guys.

We hung out a lot as time went on. After a couple months of letting her wounds heal from her traumatic breakup, I figured I was ready to ask her on a date. (Please keep in mind, I never gave her any indication that I liked her because for most of the time I've known her she was in a relationship with her ex. I never will cheat or allow someone to cheat on another person with me. So I just hung back as a friend to her during that relationship.)

So she invited me out for her birthday with us and a few other of our friends.

We all had a great time and I was drunkenly considering finally telling her how I feel about her. We went to the next bar and I was gonna buy her a drink. But then she said this ""hey, I just wanted you to know, I am seeing ______ if that is okay with you?""

This guy (let's call him Matt), is one of my favorite people that I work with at my job. He was a good friend of mine, and he had just gotten cheated on by his girlfriend a month prior (her fucking loss).

At first I was hurt but played it off like I was cool. I said ""oh yeah! That's totally fine""! And still bot her a drink anyway.

I was hurt but got a couple drinks in me and realized that i was just being selfish.

Matt is one of the most genuinely nice people on the face of this earth. He has so much going for him. He is a genuine soul, intelligent, hardworking, and morally sound. He is pretty damn good looking to boot.

She is one of the most genuinely amazing people on this earth. She has so much going for her. She is a genuine soul, intelligent, hard working, and morally sound. She is pretty damn good looking to boot.

She is the kind of woman youd want as a president. Just an overall, 100% to the core, a good woman.

It just clicked on me that she found what I think is her soul mate. Everytime i was with them, they were always talking, they were always laughing at each others jokes, always smiling at each other. They are made for each other.

I felt like I was made for her, and who knows, maybe I still am. but watching them too, and how much respect I have for them as people, made me realize that her happiness matters a lot for me. She is really happy with Matt and Vice versa. While I was hurt that I was not the Matt for her, i am more happy that she found Matt for herself.

It added a lot of closure for me to have those feelings, and now I'm ready for to move on from her for the time being and starting finding my Matt (theoretically speaking).

Thank you all, that was a story I've just been trying to get off of my chest and I dont know who I could have told it too but anonymous strangers on the internet (and I'm tipsy lol so that helped)

35,"Last year was the worst year of my entire life. I got injured back in November 2018. Then, my brother crashed my car and it was total loss but he was okay. Then, I lost my job because the injury got worse and worse. My injury made my back look crooked and that brought down my self esteem so low that every time I looked at the mirror, I cried. I did not like the person I was looking at; I looked horrible and weak. I used to be this energetic  girl who was working and going to school full time, traveling, dating around and just having the time of my life. Seeing myself in the mirror so weak, broke my heart to million pieces.

 I had a successful surgery on September because I'm back to normal. MY BACK IS NOT CROOKED ANYMORE!!! I still have some pain but I don't pay attention to it anymore.

 Well, my friends and I cooked dinner today and we had a little reunion. You guys have no idea how much I laughed. It's been an hour since I left and my stomach and my throat still hurt because of how much I laughed. I used to be this girl who would make other people laugh and seeing that girl today just made me so happy. It made me realize that not everything's lost and just because I had a tough year, doesn't mean it's gonna be like that for the rest of my life.

 I came home and I found my parents hugging each other and as soon as they saw me, they ran towards me and hugged me. And my mom instantly said: You have no idea how much we love you *mi amor.* Then, they both gave me a kiss on the forehead and I simply started crying of happiness.

I'm trying to survive through school, but I'm having trouble focusing in class, I find it hard to be motivated to to do work, I feel distant from my friends even when I'm spending time with them or talking to them, I don't feel like interacting with my fraternity brothers, I want to resign my officer position in my fraternity, and I don't want to be active in my fraternity.

I'd talk to my friends, or my brothers, or my family, but I'd feel like I'm burdening them. Even if I could afford therapy, I haven't had good experiences with therapists (or psychiatrists), so I'd really rather not go back to one.

I'm concerned about my behavior too:

* self-isolation
* drinking alcohol even when I don't want to (not binge-drinking)
* smoking cigarettes (no more than two at a time)
* watching porn
* obsessive swiping through Tinder
* irregular sleep cycle
* skipping meals

40,"So this is the story of how my friends cancelled on me, and I used the magical powers of reddit to meet up with a random stranger, who I guess I convinced to bring booze. Long story short, I was going to go to my schools basketball game but this is one of the most hyped and anticipated games of the season, and tickets sold out instantly and they thought they had a ticket but they didn’t, and nobody ended up having one except me. They all just said “sorry bro,” and I was met with a dilemma, that was answered with a quick direct message to a random reddit user. 

I met this guy in the parking lot the old fashioned way, and i should mention that I almost died on the way over there quite literally. I thought the turn signal said green but I guess it was red, (I’m still not sure tbh), and i almost got T boned by oncoming traffic. So even things look were bright straight away if I’m being honest. 

I get there, he then offers the beers right away, I oblige, I chug down 3, and then have one for the walk over there, and am starting to feel a little warm, but the excitement is still there. We got free t shirts, I got to see a couple NBA players, and it was a decent time considering all things given. 

Honestly I would probably do it again, but maybe would’ve wanted more hard liquor or something to get drunk faster bc I had to pee a couple times. I wished I would’ve done dumb drunk stuff and hi fives people, and embarrass myself trying to talk to girls, but I just was cheering and clapping.

And the game ended, I said thanks, we said our goodbyes, I smoked some weed and ate my COSTCO hotdog that I left in my trunk, and hopefully I can use this as a good story for a conversation one day. At the end of the day that’s all I really wanted and I think this stuff builds character somehow, and hopefully it now becomes a cute little story to tell.

She's been distant and drinking a lot. Christmas felt like an acquaintance gave me Christmas presents instead of my wife of 5 years. I felt like an afterthought. About a week ago, I received a text that said my wife was having an affair and the text named the person. Things started adding up. I checked phone records and she has been talking to him daily, for long periods of time for months now. On top of everything, she has been avoiding the house and often staying with her ""girlfriends"" overnight. Tonight, I went to the house she said she would be at and her car was not there.  This is killing me because of all of the lying and mistrust that's going on. I haven't been able to catch her in the act with the guy yet, but I imagine it's only time. She doesn't have a full time job and is reliant on me for income. She has a son that I have raised since he was 2 (he is 13 now).  If she really is cheating I will lose him too since I have no legal rights to him. My whole world is upended and I'm just so desperately sad. I don't want to believe all the signs but there are too many to ignore. I want my old life back. I know I will come out okay on the other end if we get a divorce.

55,"I am not much on politics, but during our last elections, the thing I heard most was that people chose one candidate so the didn't have to choose the other, but didn't think that anyone running was worthy. My first thought is that if you don't think anyone is qualified, show that by voting null or not voting at all...in mass. 
But my new suggestion for political elections is to use a sort of double blind approach where candidates don't especially have to have parties, but rather choose from a list of issues that are important to them. This would not be made known to the public and multiple candidates could be in the running. At election time, the Americanpeople would go to the polls and choose the issues that are most important to them (democracy) and the issues would be tallied. Then the candidate that most closely matched the desires of the people would be elected. 
This way, we would eliminate confusing electoral colleges and long drawn out campaigns where huge quantities of money are spent to get into power. 
Leadership input country shouldn't be about who puts on the biggest show and digs up the most dirt on everybody else, but instead about issues that affect the people on a daily basis.

I don't really know what to do, any advice would be much appreciated.

Back in early November, I met this girl while out partying and we ended up having sex. That was the first and last time we saw each other until I got a text from her two days ago.

She told me she is pregnant with twins, in the text she said I can have nothing to do with them if I want, and that she just thought at the very least I should know they exist.

I was at her house within 2 hours where we talked about what was going on, she told me they're identical and she's definitely keeping them and I can have as much to do with them as I like.

Even though I'm 19 and I have no doubt it will irrevocably fuck up my life, I can't just leave her with two kids on her own, and I couldn't live with myself knowing I had offspring which I wasn't giving the best life possible. So I committed to taking care of them.

I'm just in shock, I'm absolutely baffled. I used a condom, she took a pill, both failed, not only did they both fail, but we've got twins now, so they really went above and beyond in terms of failing.

I don't have a job or any form of income currently, I'm living with my mother and was about to start a year of studying, but now I'm thinking of just finding a stable job, getting some money and finding my own place. It's really lit a fire under my ass, two days ago I woke up as a child, with trivial problems and a general sense of aimlessness, now I have 6 months to completely get my life together and prepare for two kids.

She has an ok job at a supermarket, in my country she will get 12 months maternity leave, receiving $700 a fortnight from the government for 2 kids. I can only imagine what she is going through, when I spoke to her she seemed calm and collected, but she has had time to process everything, and she doesn't know me enough to open up I'm sure.

I've only told a few select family and friends in total confidence. I CANNOT tell my mother, she is so emotionally fragile right now because she is having a rough time with her boyfriend, and I know news like this would shatter her completely. She had me as a teenager and has always warned me against it with all her heart, and now this happens.

In a way, I almost feel it's some kind of poetic destiny kind of thing, it's forcing me to grow up extremely quickly in a way nothing else could. The odds of both layers of contraception failing are less than 1%, and to end up with twins? infinitesimally smaller still. They better grow up to cure cancer or something, because with the freaky cosmic fluke it took for them to be conceived in the first place they're MEANT to exist.

I want to enter a relationship with this girl, we don't really know each other, but I feel like it's a best-case scenario that we're compatible and can raise these kids together, she is at least into me enough for us to have sex in the first place, and we seem to get along well, but it's far too early to call. I don't want to pressure her into anything, I can only imagine the mental anguish she is experiencing and feeling forced into a relationship with someone you may not even like at such a young age would be crushing. But still, I'm hoping over the next 6 months we can really get to know each other, and maybe we would actually work together.

So yeah, two kids, identical (girls probably apparently), a girl I don't know, a mother who can't know, and 6 months to get an entire life in order. Advice?",02Feb2020,1

* find the balance between helping others and helping yourself

* socializing isnt as scary as you think it is. people want to get to know you just as much as you want to get to know them; its a two-way street.

* let loose! have fun but also be serious.  there's a time and place for everything.

She commited suicide completely unexpectedly, left no note to her family.

My parents-in-law are heartbroken, of course. They are desperately looking for answers. I feel incredibly bad for them. They are very quiet, introverted people who appreciate their privacy. My partner isn't very close with them because of that but they have a normal, healthy relationship. Because we always see each other at my place, I'm a bit awkward around them. They are nice and kind people, though, and I feel nothing but empathy towards them now that they lost their daughter in such a tragic way. I also really appreciate the fact that they let me bid a final farewell to my sister-in-law together with them, that I got invited to the funeral and got to sit together with the close family, and that they listed me on the In memoriam card as her sister-in-law.

I've visited my in-laws together with my partner the day we heard the news, a few times after, and at the funeral. Since then I haven't seen them anymore. I (of course) offered them my condolences, sent them a text message the after returning home the day we heard the news, and gave them a hug after the funeral. The reason I'm telling all this is to give a better idea of the situation right now.

It has been two weeks now since the funeral and I'm thinking about giving them something to let them know my thoughts still are with them and that my condolences are genuine. After the funeral I told my SO that I was thinking about gifting his parents flowers. He said that maybe it would be better to do this on his mom's birthday over a few months as their house was full of flowers and cards after the funeral already. I really want them to know it is meant as a condolence to both of them instead of a felicitation for her birthday, though. About a week ago I also asked him about sending them a text message and he thought they would appreciate that.

When I arrived back I called my mom to ask where they were and she told me they were almost there but stopped because she had to calm them down. Why? Because her friend woke up and ate something too! I know it's unrelated but it did touch me in a weird way. I'm so happy I got to have this experience and the tattoos ended up looking great on both of them (it was their first!) and they left twice as happy as they came.",02Feb2020,1

People always say ""take a hike get some fresh air that's why you're depressed"" But has anyone actually talked to you about the shit you're going through?

83,"So I got a hair cut I’ve been wanting forever and my best friends ( I’m in a group chat with them ) only 4 to 5 out of the 11 people actually commented on it and said they liked it and they all opened the picture. Like I know I shouldn’t expect them to like it but I’d at least think they’d be nice and say something you know?

I saw one of them today ( my best best friend of the group ) and he said that he didn’t know how he felt about it and him and one of the other guys were like... uhh I don’t really like it haha so do we just like the picture and say nothing? Then he proceed to tell me it makes me look like a 12 year old. Like bro.

Ngl That shit hurts a lil. Tbh I thought the hair would was an adult move and would make me feel confident with going into the adult world soon but at the moment it’s just making me feel like I’m dumb and childish. 

A lot of my not so close friends and peers love the hair cut! Which is great but if I also wanted validation from the people I trust a lot. 

Idk. Maybe I just need new friends.",02Feb2020,1
84,"That's what i'm asking myself right now -- how long will I have to wait to move onto the next step of fixing my suicidal depression.

Usually posting this kind of thing would be opsec hell to me and it is but it really doesn't matter anymore. This is just sort of a little diary/self post for no real reason i've got nothing to do except wait till midnight to raid on world of warcraft and smoke some weed inbetween maybe lift some weights and eat a chocolate bar, it's just gone 7:30 pm. Pretty down, pretty bored. That is just nicotine withdrawls though -- I don't smoke I just relapsed 2 days ago. 

So i've been contemplating microdosing LSD or shrooms to help combat my depression for the better part of two years now and I finally decided i've had enough -- it was the relapse really which has made me go in this direction. I can't keep relapsing it doesn't work it doesn't help it doesn't fix anything, but I do enjoy it and without it -- I do have nothing or at least it feels like that.

Starting a microdose trial is taking a leap of faith; a bit of a risk and kinda interesting. But it is definitely a last resort. The medications will only get stronger now if it doesn't work. After psychedelics will be perscription medications, something like tramadol.

So I used to use the dnm's a long time ago but then some bad things happened and I just started getting my weed and any other drugs I needed in real life instead of off the internet. It was less hassle and I didn't waste as much money.

But getting psychedelics is hard you need the internet for that. So now I want to microdose shrooms probably 0.1g in the mornings 3 days on 2 days off something like that and it just so happens that there is two major markets atm apollo and empire and apollo just did an exit scam and empire is getting ddosd to hell or something  because the site is just not working. It is working, but it's not. 

How long will I have to wait.

How long to make the next step in my master plan of fixing my depression. It's probably going to be about 3 or 4 days.

Just annoying.",02Feb2020,1
85,"It seems that every few months I just come back to vent to strangers about my own problems that they cant do anything about. With that said, here I am...

Lets just get the point so we don't waste anyone's time. I have basically no emotional attachment to anything or anyone. I also have a lack of emotions. 

Although, the emotions part is confusing me, since I do feel it if Im having a good time, or a bad time or whatever, but the thing is I cant describe it as... I dont know... Anything to be honest... I can ignore it, change it or ""strengthen"" that ""feeling"" as I please. It has no effect on me. I dont know if Im just being over dramatic or stupid, but thus far I havn't seen or met anyone that experiences it the same as me, or has the same level as control over their emotions as I do(Just saying emotions, I honestly have no idea what to call it). 

I know it sounds stupid saying I have emotions, and then immediately afterwards saying I have ""feelings"" is entirely contradictory, but thats only I dont really know how to describe it. Its like an emotion, but... I guess... softer... More of a suggestion of how to act at that moment than an actual feeling. For example, if someone is frustrating me, I could act angry, following this ""feeling"", or I can totally ignore it, or even just change it to an entirely different ""feeling"". I hope I'm saying this correctly, but it's not really something I can put in words. But I've noticed this has been coming with age. When I was very young, I used to genuinely feel emotions. I felt sadness, and I felt happiness. But it dissapeared as I grew up. 

Then I also said that I do not have any emotional attachment to anything. Not to my parents, sibling or friends. If I so desired, I could instantly just forget about them, abandon them, or hate them with no reason without even thinking about it. Of course, I do not want to, and I dont plan on doing that since I still like them and value them... I thought that maybe if I could get a tinge of attachment with someone then I'd somehow get it and really know what it feels like to truly be attached to someone, but it did not end up that way. I've recently started seeing a partner. This is the first experience of romance I've had, and I like it. Things escalated, and we've made out a few times. We've been seeing each other for a few weeks now. And yet, I just feel so empty. It does not make me sad, it just feels alone. I just keep everything to myself since I have no one I can talk to about it, nor do I trust anyone with my thoughts. 

I think I explained this very badly, but it doesnt really matter since it's more me just venting.",02Feb2020,1
86,"I was pregnant for the first time ever. I found out the week before Thanksgiving and I was so excited. I had my first ultrasound the baby measured a week behind. They said it could go either way. So I cried and worried then I felt like things would be okay.

So then 2 weeks after my first ultrasound I go back nervous but hopeful and the baby is just gone. I had seen it's heartbeat been so happy now it's not even there. Just an empty sac. I was so sad and angry and confused.

So I ended up taking medicine a week later to get things going and that weekend I'm passing huge clots and passing out. I had to be running via ambulance I was bleeding too much too fast. I needed emergency surgery.

So this was 3 weeks ago and I'm so sad. My husband and I were so excited and happy like happier than we'd been and now we are the most depressed we've been. I lost my younger sister not even 2 years ago, my grandma 13 days before her... Now my tiny baby is gone.

My husband has been great. He took care of me, watched this whole thing in the hospital. And now we are left depressed. I'm trying to get better but right now I'm still in bed. It's almost 3pm. I don't even care. We are a bit older and I hope we have a baby one day. But right now I am so engulfed in grief. If anyone reads this thank you.

I never really wanted to have kids and after a night of drunken antics with the one guy my boyfriend of 5 years hates, I'm starting to think he may have gotten me pregnant. I'm lost, angry, ashamed, and scared senseless. 
I know, I should have known better and wrapped up. Not only that, I should have stayed away from the guy in general. I was too drunk to really know what I was doing and I don't even remember anything happening. All I remember was leaving. I wish I could remember..
I told my boyfriend about it last night and everything blew up. Things were said that I'll never forget and that guilt has ingrained itself into my heart. I never in my life wanted to hurt him the way I did and it tears me apart to acknowledge what I've done. I destroyed the most amazing man I've ever met. 
I know there is no possible way to salvage the remains but I have been looking  for a way out. I'v been looking into getting an aborting but I have no medical insurance, I have a shit job, the nearest center in state is 4 hours away (I don't have a car), and either procedure is 500+ dollars.

102,"I (F22) don’t know how to put it, but I’m a very enthusiastic person who is happy most of the time. I like my life, friends, work etc. But whenever I have  down day, like today, I get extremely frustrated because I don’t know why. I suddenly feel lonely and sad, but there is absolutely nothing that justifies that feeling. So whenever I feel down I don’t know why that is and I get super frustrated with myself, even though I tell myself it’s okay not to be okay sometimes, but somehow I won’t let myself?
I don’t really know how to deal with this. I don’t know if I’m surpressing or avoiding negative emotions but I surely can not deal with them in a healthy way.
I don’t really know how to explain this, maybe someone else has the same feeling.",02Feb2020,1
103,"So I’ve been out of high school for a few years. I’m currently in college pursuing a degree in journalism. During my time in high school I was in a rock band with my three best friends. I played bass, and modeled myself off of Mike Dirnt from Green Day. I was a tall skinny kid who would swing my bass and jump and eventually I got pretty decent at drawing in a crowd. We played parties and talent shows and small festivals and literally anywhere we could. We were from a small town and we’d practice our songs late into the night then hit the back roads and go on adventures into the wee hours of the morning. Eventually we graduated. Our rhythm guitar player left for the Air Force, our lead guitar player/singer left for Nashville to chase his dreams of making a career out of music, and our drummer goes to a different university. That means I never really get to see or talk to the guys anymore, unless we happen to all be visiting our hometown at the same time — which usually only happens around Christmas. Today I pulled out my bass for the first time in years and fired up my stereo and just jammed my heart out to some of the songs we used to cover. All of the memories and nostalgia came flooding back. 

So I guess you can take it from me, if you’re currently in high school and getting to do cool wild stuff with your friends, cherish every minute of it for absolutely all that it’s worth because one day you’ll all have to grow up and those guys that you spent every waking minute with won’t be around anymore. Live as much as you can while you can. If you’re thinking of starting a band, but you feel like you’re not good enough at your instrument, or whatever it may be — just jump in and do it. You only get to be a punk rock kid once. Play those three chords with every fiber of your being. Buy a $20 bass at the pawn shop down the street and wreck it at the end of your set. Break a cymbal or two. Scream the lyrics until you’ve lost your voice. Tear up the dirt roads in the middle of the night. It’ll leave you with fond memories to look back on for the rest of your life. 

Even though I don’t get to talk to the guys in the band anymore, I often find myself reminiscing about all the cool shit we got to do. Like the time we played a show on top of a ramp at a skate park and I jumped off into the crowd and played my bass solo surrounded by a group of people screaming my name. Anyway, I digress. 

Point is, live it up. You’ll be glad you did.",02Feb2020,1

I guess I don't know why I got upset, but the first comment I got on Reddit was about a perceived mistake on the drawing. I completely melted down and threatened to delete the post.

Fastforward and we're now roommates at an apartment complex. He isnt cruel anymore by any means, but he definitely isnt pleasant. Mainly just things that make him human (complaining, taking advantage of people). 



He has a huge scar on his arm from a knife. The story was my little brother left a knife open on the bed and my older brother just landed on it and sliced his arm. Thats what everybody, including my little brother believes. So my little brother thinks he caused it (this was 3-4 years ago).

In addition, after the first year of college, I just pretty much stopped socializing with people. Because I didn’t have to. 

Instead of going to class or hanging out, I mostly just vegged our in bed, in my room, on Reddit, YouTube, Netflix, etc

Been out of college almost 4 years now, and I have a stable career that I go to most 5 out of 7 days of the week. Because I feel like I *need* to be there. But on the weekends, or if I don’t need to be at work, I will just literally lay in bed the whole day (like today). 

I just feel like I physically cannot make my body go through the ritual of getting out of bed, showering, brushing my teeth, doing my hair, putting in clothes, getting into the car, and GOING somewhere. I don’t need to be there. Why go through the effort? It’s just thinking about doing all those things stresses me out to much and feels like such a big burden on me. 

How do I stop this? How do I stop wasting my life and learn to just enjoy going out and doing things. Even when I don’t *need* to?

How can I make the seemingly insurmountable burden of just getting out of bed manageable? Why am I like this?

This weekend, the weather has been beautiful and sunny, mid 70’s. Perfect weather for me (because I get super gloomy when it’s cloudy). At night, I prepped myself up and said “tomorrow I will go here and there and do this and that and enjoy the day!” 

When the morning came around I just struggled with myself the whole day (until now, 4 pm). And I am still in bed. Because a voice keeps telling me “why bother” and I can’t think of a reason of why bothering. The time will pass either way, and passing the time in bed or on the couch alone is just easier to go through. 

Tomorrow I will *have to* get up to go to work. And I’m worried that one day, this arbitrary line I’ve drawn in the sand will get moved back so far that I will feel like “no, why bother going to work. Why bother getting up at all”",02Feb2020,1
