3,"I used to be proud of being arab Muslim but after educating myself about the Middle East politics,culture and history I realized I used to be brainwashed arab-Islamic propaganda and how Arabs are hateful people first of the Arab mentality is braindead and full anti-semetic and western conspiracy theories even a common anti semetic belief in Arab world is that Jews have stinky smell and breath the second reason that made me hate arabs is that arabs are praising terrorists like osama bin laden, gafdafi, Erdogan  Adolf Hitler (yes Adolf Hitler is seen as hero in arab world for the holocaust) and saddam Hussein the third reason that made me became a self loathing is the culture, arab culture is the most misogynistic culture that ever existed, Arabs believe that women who travel alone,work or don’t wear hijab are whores, even Arabic language sounds annoying and loud unlike European languages and Arab food is disgusting as fuck, the fourth reason of why I became a self loathing arab is arab imperialism, arabs invasions are the most brutal and barbaric, the invasion of India caused the genocide of more than 80 million Indians, even the Arab slave trade is the largest slave trade in the world, the number of African who enslaved by Arabs are 20 times bigger than Atlantic   slave trade, and the fact that arabs see their invasions and slavery as pride makes me sick, and the final reason is arab supremacism, Racism is pretty common in arab world, arabs are enslaving non-arabs in arab countries so they could their slaves, Arab supremacism Isn’t like white supremacy, arab supremacism means violence and slavery of non Arabs, I hate our see themselves as the best nation when the fact that they are the worst nation ever and I hate how Islam is Arab imperialists cult


There’s dozens of reason I became a self loathing arab but those were the main reason",18Dec2020,0

Idk who or what triggered this desire at such a young age but ever since i was 3, iv had this desire to be the fattest boy/man on the planet. 

I just remember stepping on the scale as a child and being so obsessed with my weight, but not in the traditional sense. I wanted to see that number get bigger and bigger. I constantly overate, not because i was just some fat kid who enjoyed food, but because i needed to get bigger. 

I took pride in always being the fattest kid in my grade. My older brother was always stick thin and i took pride in the fact that he got MY hand-me-downs. My parents were slightly overweight themselves but even at 7-8 years old i was bigger than them. 

I eventually peaked at around 500 pounds by the time i entered high school. Eventually, my childhood desires just seemed really dumb and i eventually got into liking girls and realized i needed to lose weight to date and i did. 

Now, im no fitness hot shot by any means but at 21 years old, im now 350 pounds. Still a big guy but not 500 pounds on a 5'4"" frame lmfao.

I still struggle with my body identity, and i wont lie, i still find myself looking in the mirror and wishing i had my old body but hopefully i learn to stop glorifying obesity and move on.",18Dec2020,2
19,"My story has been a hell of a journey... How I am alive at 30 years old... I don’t even know. My story started from when I was just a baby... mom and dad were alcoholics and drug addicts, who know the real truth... so many stories that’s been told through the years. Unfortunately I have to live with the fact I will never know the whole truth... my family would rather live in the dark and live with hidden secrets... I know one day it will all come to light.  As the story of my life is told by family members, my mom would leave my siblings and I in the back of cars while she went into bars late at night. I was a baby at this point, and she even did this in the winter, and if you live in Minnesota you would know how brutal winters in Minnesota can be. Years of neglect went by, and of course I don’t know exactly what happened in the very early years of my life. Stories have been told my siblings and I were taken by CPS a few times. To be honest, and honestly I believe in my heart the first 5-6 years of my life was bad... how could it get worse... well here I am at 5-6 years old and now I’m living with my grandma. My mom disappeared and went to Arizona, not to be heard from for the next 10 plus years. My dad, not sure where he went, rehab, prison, halfway house, I am unsure. I just know he up and left... And to this day I don’t even know. All I know, I was without my parents and confused as to why, why did my mom leave, why was she never coming back, where was my dad. Why can I only talk to him on the phone and not see him in person. What is going on.????. And when your family rather live in the dark. Hard to know what the fuck was going on or why it was happening. Was something wrong with us, why didn’t our parents love us. Why didn’t our parents want us. Why did our parents even keep us if they were that fucked up... Sadly to this day, I genuinely believe that in fact they really didn’t want us and they just kept us because being Catholic, they don’t believe in abortions. Being in Catholic; let’s get married, have more kids and just hope that faith will keep us together. Well, that obviously didn’t fucking work. Even though adoption would have been an option... but knowing them, they probably thought kids would save their relationship or they were just that fucking selfish and didn’t want to admit that they couldn’t do it. That they couldn’t be parents to us. Thanks a lot.. As the story from my dad goes, he swears he was drunk and my mom found a way to get pregnant without telling him or tricking him... or some crazy story.. I don’t exactly know, I’m not to sure. My grandma who was supposed to be a saint taking us in was very abusive to my siblings and I. What could a 6 year old child do so wrong to be beat like this? What could a 6 year old do so wrong to be treated in such a horrible way. But because I was so strong willed and head strong, she could beat me and tell me to not cry, so I would just take it. A story I was told by my eldest brother, I went to see my aunts and I had a black eye, and my grandma said I tripped down the stairs... what a wonderful lie. And they probably knew the truth, but would they say anything. Of course not. That was their mother. I remember nights she would force me to stay awake if I didn’t want to go to sleep at the exact time she said, if I dare dozed off she would hit me in the back of my head and force me to stare at the TV until the sun came up and go to school. She would starve me if I didn’t like what she made for dinner... I didn’t get to have sleepovers with friends, I didn’t get to go to friends houses.. why, I have no clue. Maybe she wanted to make sure no one knew the dark secrets that lied inside that house. I was really close to my cousin and she was the only friend I had besides my imaginary ones. The next 7-8 years I had to endure unimaginable of pain and abuse, and I couldn’t tell a soul. I mean who would’ve believed me. My grandma took us to church every Sunday, to the world she seemed like a saint. To the world she was an angel for taking in 4 kids while trying to take care of my grandpa who was very sick and passed away when I was 8 years old. Finally what seemed to be a small light, we all finally got to live with my dad. I was about 13 years old... I thought finally things would be a little better... we struggled a lot and my dad worked 3 jobs and it was up to my sister (she is 5 years older) to help take care of my brother and I. My brother is one year older than me. My oldest brother had been gone for idk how many years at that point. Well, due to lack of attention and care I started seeking attention in boys... (I guess they call that daddy issues). Well at 15, this boy who was a good friend of mine and my brothers raped me... May 12th 2005. My whole life got flipped upside down. I couldn’t even go to school without being bullied... to everyone in school, I was lying and wanting attention. I went to attempt suicide... and my dad had me move in with my aunt (moms sister), well she was in her early 30s... had her first kid when she was 17... and she was a hoe... and well definitely not capable of taking on a third child when she could barely care for her 2 sons... I got bullied every day and she didn’t care. So again, I confided in boys... well this time it wasn’t a boy... it was a 29 year old man, his nickname Dinky, he convinced me to runaway to him... I did and he forced me into prostitution... I was 16 years old, he beat the shit out of me, drugged me and allowed his friends to have sex with me while I was unconscious. That went on for over a year... I finally got away, went back to my dads but my aunt had a restraining order placed against him (she lied to the judge and told the judge my dad molested me when I was a young child). I wasn’t even supposed to be at his house and because I didn’t want him to get in trouble, I started living on the streets... no one in my family would help me... I ended up in the wrong crowd and got tangled up with a high power drug dealer... left that situation and got tangled up with yet another pimp who came off as a caring person that just wanted to give me a place to live... and round 3 at that point, getting beat every day, strung out on pills... when I left that situation I ended up on the streets once again... at 19 I went to Chicago to live with my dads cousin Jody and she was a drug addict and she made her boyfriend pimp me out... so there I was at 19 yet again in this situation... at 20 I finally got away from everything. Got a real job, lived in a motel and my daughters father was someone I trusted... a friend I thought would take care of me, but he forced me to lay down with him and I got pregnant with my daughter... mind you in the midst of this my sons father I knew since I was 15, was in and out of my life. He knew I was pregnant and knew I was all alone and afraid... he took me in and agreed to help take care of her... well he never beat me, but he mentally abused me and verbally abused me on a daily basis for years. Kept me away from the world and eventually my son came along. And I stayed, I stayed in an abusive relationship because I was told by my own father I had no choice. I had a kid with him and that was my life now no matter how much it destroyed me mentally. No matter how badly I wanted to die because of this man. And in 2015 I found out I was pregnant again. I was devastated and that sounds so horrible, but when you are stuck in a relationship that is killing you, it becomes a very dangerous situation (mentally speaking). And as horrible as this is about to sound, a sense of relief when I had a miscarriage. I just couldn’t endure anymore. I wanted my life to end. An amazing girl Alisa (Smiley) was in my life and she fought to help me realize my worth and because of her, I did. I finally got the strength to leave. I was at a point where I knew I was done. I wanted out. I wanted to restart my life. I wanted to be happy. I wanted love. I wanted a real life. And I didn’t care what anyone thought anymore. Smiley and I dated for awhile and she was amazing. But she and I together forever wasn’t in Gods plan. But I am blessed for the time I got to spend with her. She even made a song for me and there are a few times I go on YouTube to listen it. She was an angel meant to come in my life and make realize I was good enough. That it was okay to be with whoever I wanted to be with. And I knew in all those years I wanted to be with a woman... and allowed the fact my grandma said I will go to hell dictate the reason I never dated a woman... and don’t get me wrong, my grandma and I are so close now. But for years she was abusive and because I am so strong in my Christian faith, I forgave her and built an amazing relationship with her. She has become my best friend.... but back to what I finally decided to do to change EVERYTHING... the next year I built up my self esteem, and got my mental health in a little bit of a better place.... because after 3 suicide attempts in 5 years that failed only proved God needed me here for some reason. In 2016, I finally moved out of my sons fathers house and restarted my life. My dad was pissed and angry (and also mad because me and the kids lived with him), but eventually... he grew to dislike my sons father. Go figure... after coming out, I felt like a weight was lifted. But my story doesn’t get a happy ending. I dated a few girls, one who I moved 500 miles away from my hometown for only to end up with a broken heart. Got an apartment in 2018, lost that apartment and ended with an eviction on my record. Got married to a man, why? I can’t even answer that question. He was someone of wealth and status and I thought since I had no money, no job and no future why not? At least I wouldn’t be homeless. Well is a verbally abusive man and wants to control my life to a point where I couldn’t see my children often, talk to them often, or even work a job. He wanted to be the first and only person in my life. Went as far as getting my daughters father deported back to Mexico because he said and I quote “He got in my way. He helped you so much and you needed him and not me”. Trying to divorce him now, is proving almost impossible. Even though I am trying to walk away from the divorce with nothing. I left him awhile ago, but life is only getting harder. I am making $8 a hour in fast food, barely enough to pay my phone bill and help provide for my kids (Who now live my daughter lives full time with my dad. And my son who lives full time with my brother). I have no car, so working is extremely hard because I have to walk most days. And at $8 a hour, saving for a car.... impossible. I have no college degree and only a GED, so no one wants to give me an opportunity in a real company. Even though I am extremely book smart and probably could do their job better then they can. My life is a mess and at 30 years old... I feel like I am getting nowhere and losing all hope in everything and not even caring if I wake up in the morning, kinda hoping I don’t. Because let’s be honest, the world would be better off without me.",18Dec2020,3

32,"I just need to vent. My aunt and I have always been somewhat distant, but we’ve gotten along well in the past. She’s a flight attendant and has been all over the world, and she’s brought me along with her in the past. We have been to 27 countries together and have had lots of fun. Those experiences were really formative for me and informed my worldview profoundly.

Today, she sent me and my wife a video from a right-wing propaganda site about how unsafe the upcoming Covid vaccines are. I was shocked to see this because in the past she would’ve laughed this kind of behavior off. I explained to her the process through which these mRNA vaccines allow our cells to become immune to the spike proteins that Covid uses to infect us. I was hoping that it might have been a joke, or she just wanted my input as I’m pretty plugged in to the scientific world. 

She came back with straight-up conspiracy theories. “Bill Gates is making the Moderna vaccine and doesn’t know shit! Follow the money!”... Um, what? I tried to be reasonable with her but it just continued to get more and more ridiculous. 

“We must take off our masks to protect our rights before we never have them again! We need to fight back!” - at this point I really started to hammer my points home. I was getting pissed. Unmasking is an idiotic tactic, it only serves to prolong the pandemic. According to the numbers of infected vs. dead Covid is at LEAST 10x as deadly as the seasonal flu. The list goes on.

Then she started rambling about how liberalism is destroying the country. I responded by asking for examples, and of course there were none. 

I dunno. It put a really bad taste in my mouth. My aunt is a worldly, well-educated woman who has never displayed behavior like this before. I finally stopped responding to texts when it was obvious that she was picking a fight. She sent this same bullshit video to my entire family, including my elderly grandparents who have been taking it seriously. It worries me because the only person my grandparents have been seeing on a somewhat regular basis since March is my aunt. I don’t want her to poison them against the obvious, logical, data-backed path to get out of this situation alive. 

I’ve kind of settled on just not talking to her again. The situation in the United States has devolved far beyond just a tumultuous “political” landscape - I’m watching my own family member be brainwashed by fascist propaganda. It’s just so frustrating and disheartening. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",18Dec2020,3

41,"tw: mentions of panic attacks and suicide  


This is something that comes up every time I speak my mind over something I thought I had every right to be annoyed about, get negative feedback, sleep on it and then realise ”shit, I may have overreacted”. I always feel like my emotions are valid, especially in the moment. But then when the tide turns against me, I notice that yes, my emotions are valid, but now I’ve hurt and insulted people who really don’t deserve it in the long run. And then I tell myself “well, I’ve learned from it, I’ll do better next time.”

and then something extremely frustrating or annoying or angering happens again and I forget everything I’ve learned.

 

I worked on a project a few months ago, something in my... uh, trade, I guess, but wayyyyy below my level. I was there with 5+ years of experience and everyone else was a beginner. I’ve been in a similar situation before where my experience outshone everyone and I tried to help the project along by sharing my experience and it all just went to shit instead because nobody wanted to listen to me. Months later, they came back to tell me I was right and the “i told you so”s were the best vindication ever. So now with this new project, I vowed to myself to take it easy, to not preach to an audience that doesn’t want to hear it, we’d all be severely underpaid for this project so it’d be just something to get through quarantine while the world resets.   
Really soon, I discover how much I hate working with people who aren’t professionals. Most of these people learned from the internet, had never worked in a group environment before, kinda just did their own thing without working together with the rest of the group, etc. It was like expecting to enter a government building, but instead you enter a children’s birthday party. People were also being arrogant, praising themselves for finishing early and how good a job they did, all while misnaming files and exporting them in the wrong format, their finishing early meant other people had to work longer or wait longer before they could start. It was frustrating to watch because my experience gave me knowledge into how to avoid all these things, how to be considerate when you work as a TEAM. But I had told myself to not interfere! The person in charge wasn’t really doing anything to handle all of this, they just kind of told us to do as we wished and that was that.   
These also just happened to be the kind of people I’ve grown to really dislike over the course of my life. The best description I can give is “fake as hell”. Maybe through inexperience or a desire to be liked No Matter What, if asked feedback on the project, I couldn’t trust a single word anyone had to say. It was all “amazing” or “just brilliant” or “wow”. Things that are so frustrating to hear when you want actual feedback and pointers, what can be better, what specifically is so “wow”. If I in turn tried to give actual feedback, I was either ignored or questioned. Thank christ, some people actually didn’t mind some of the feedback I gave and actually used it. And then at the end of the project, after i had counted all my grey hairs, there was a wave of people putting paragraphs of texts in the chat (we used discord, never again) saying how much they enjoyed the project, how much they learn, how nice and talented everyone was, and i just wanted to scream “good for you, i never want to speak to any of you again, this was a mess from start to finish!”

And it’s stupid because I basically just came in with the wrong expectations! They were there to make friends, and that’s all fine and good but they never knew where the line was! At some point, you need to take off the mask of constantly wanting to please everyone and say “no, that’s not efficient, we need to be honest now”. And that just didn’t happen, and they never felt like it had to happen, as far as I know, I was the only one having such a hard time when it came to interacting with everyone else. Which must mean the problem lies with me.  
At one point, and this might be triggering for some people (tw: panic attacks and suicide mention), someone came on the chat and they basically hinted at wanting to commit suicide and this was their goodbye but it was clear the initial talk had happened somewhere else and they had come onto this chat to... i dunno, notify everyone. And by ’this chat’, I mean the chat that was meant to be used for info on the project and general questions. For the rest of that night, people were asking if they were okay, are they hurt, are they still alive, it was a whole thing, people were panicked and worried. Eventually, hours later, the person in question lets it be known that they’re fine now, and that they’re sorry for causing such a fuss. Everyone then starts saying how that person shouldn’t be sorry, it’s not their fault and that this is a safe space. And THAT is bullshit.   
Look, here’s the thing. When someone is in such a state, they don’t have control over what they say or where they say it. Understandable, makes sense, happens. But FUCK OFF, they should indeed apologise because no, a chat made specifically for info and questions is NOT the place for this kind of things! Casual chats or chats specifically for mental health talk can be muted, so people who can be triggered, won’t be triggered. Chats meant for announcements and info CANT BE MUTED and so there’s no blocking any triggers! On a worse day, that whole chat would’ve sent me into a panic attack of my own, or even worse, made me send on my own suicide attempt! An announcement chat is not a safe space and the person in question should fucking apologise for that without people bringing out the coddling and the safety blankets! Just say “thank you for apologising, I’m glad you‘re feeling better” and move to a more appropriate chat!

And once again, nobody had a problem with this except me (though I never spoke out about any of my grievances, be it because it wasn’t the right moment or because I just didn’t want to start beef in a project that I’m never gonna look back on again anyway), so the problem must be with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to now: those same people who wrote paragraphs full of love and appreciation for the project are now sending mails of complaints to the project manager. And I just think that’s fucking hilarious.   
All their complaints are legitimate complaints (being underpaid, bad communication, etc.) but I think it’s the funniest thing that the things they were praising the hell out of 4 months ago, they’re now putting under fire. Being underpaid, they knew that when they signed the contract, but most of them didn’t read the contract they signed because they’re inexperienced as fuck. The bad communication was always bad, but because they’re all people-pleasers, they never spoke up or honestly about how bad everything was truely managed from the start. And I think it’s all goddamn rich.

In a moment of stupidity, I commented on one of the youtube videos talking about the issue, basically saying “nobody in this project was truly innocent, both management and the people who worked on the project have stuff to work on” In the nicest way I could manage. And that’s where I made the mistake. After 4 months of this annoying the shit out of me, frustrating me, making me never want to touch another passion project ever again, I finally cracked, spoke my mind, and now I’m the rightful asshole.

Because in the end, what I did in general terms was attack children. No matter that they’re all 18+, they all signed a contract, they all got (under)paid, but they were all inexperienced, naive, they had no idea wtf they were doing, and I basically attacked them for it, because I wanted to feel satisfaction for weeks of frustration.   


And I notice I do this a lot. I get frustrated over something nobody else has a problem with, I lash out towards them because of it even though they really didn’t do anything wrong, and I get to feel sorry for myself and tell myself I’ll do better next time. And I never. Fucking. Do.

I tell myself it’s because I’ve run out of patience, you know. I’ve exhausted all the nice ways to fix my frustrations; take lead in things I have experience in, try to teach them, try to talk about it, step back and just let it happen. I’ve done all the nice things and they don’t work so now I act like a boomer grandpa who sits in his chair and laughs and then mocks the youngings for being so stupid.

I don’t want to be that boomer grandpa, I want to be nice and dependable and encouraging and someone people can look up to and feel safe with and I hate that I’m not that person. I know that I do better when my mental health is better and when I feel better in my life and that’s just absolutely not the case right now but even then, I notice I overstep boundaries pretty quickly, overreact.

I am in the process of getting diagnosed for adhd, autism, social anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, whichever it turns out to be, cus I’m pretty sure something is wrong with me.

58,"Before we begin, I know I am an looser/jerk/misogynist ... etc for doing these things. I don't ask these women for money/nudes and have no intention of harming them physically.

Long fucking rant ahead.

I have catfishing women for the past few weeks. Made a separate email account and created two profiles, tinder and OKCupid. Made these profiles look as much authentic as possible, like nice bio, pictures of good looking guys as the first picture, pictures form google of doing fun stuff like snowboarding, and whatnot in POV style, and some flexing like image from within a high rise apartment of a city during night. I watched numerous youtube videos for opening lines and bios and made the best out of them; and really paid off. Within 3 hours of creating the profiles matches started coming. Then every 2-3 hours I would get 4-5 matches. First day I got near about 22 matches total. The numbers varied between 25-30 matches per day.

 I know that it was not me who got the match but the first match made super happy. I had accounts on these same platforms for one whole year and never ever got a match, now women are matching and even initiating the conversation. Maybe it's by self loathing and insecurities, but getting this many matches and attention form women really made my day. This is not even the best part; you see I am an below average looking brown guy living in US, and I know my worth so I knew that I shouldn't even bother with white women. And now I'm getting matches from white women too and these are some really good looking ladies. I don't even have to bother about what I write, a few of the matches even asked to exchange numbers really early and a certain few asked if I was interested in meeting for coffee/drinks. I'm like holy shit, this is unbelievable. I didn't even used pictures of models, it was just two images from the google search result of ""good looking bearded guy"" that looked kinda similar ( I wanted to make the account look as authentic as possible ).

 I try to lead the conversation to a point where the lady gets an impression that I'm serious and then I just go ghost/stop talking out of the blue. This make me feel good, gives me a sense of power/authority. Some of them get frustrated and try messaging back asking why I'm not responding, some don't bother; either way I get to feel good. I know that women have more options than men on dating apps so it's obvious for them to not bother if I ghost or stop talking. I worst I have done is set up a date, went to the cafe sat there at a distance and watch my made up character's date show up and sit there waiting. After sometime they try to call and text, to which they get no response and leave after wasting sometime. I did this twice.

 Today I'm really feeling good about my catfishing journey. Anyways I'll continue this shit-show for a few more weeks and will delete the accounts. But it does feel good to see those beautiful ladies messaging me first and saying flattering stuff.",18Dec2020,0

83,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign?


I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

89, I live in Northerner IL right outside of the Chicagoland area and I cant see to find any jobs that I even qualify for. It's always been my dream to be a counselor and get my LCSW but I feel like giving up and looking for a job outside of my field right now. A lot of the jobs that I see want a couple of years of experience. I've done 5 internships in about every area of social work one could think of. I honestly didn't really care for any of my internships and I'm wondering if I picked the wrong profession. I currently work doing therapy with children with autism and I truly enjoy that it's the only job I've had while in school.  What kind of jobs should I be looking for to start my journey to my goal?  I  don't want a job where I have to drive around to different homes and I'm really not interested in addiction as it hits too close to home for me. I think I would like to continue working with youth at a university or school but I'm not a school social worker.,18Dec2020,1

96,"Hi, I came across a reddit post posted 3 years ago about someone ruining friendships and I'm putting it out here about my story too.

i had a group of friends whom i treasured alot in my high school days but one day they stopped talking to me and started bullying me for god knows whatever reason. i guess thats where i started being paranoid of losing friendships. after awhile i became okay and reached back out to the same group bullies and befriended them again (bc hey, i didnt want any drama, i had to act like i was okay). by then, i became a frequent friend group hopper. i was traumatized by the bullying experience and i was so scared that i will do something wrong, so i would leave them first then come back to the group a few months later. the same cycle repeated until the end of high school. (till now i still do not understand what on earth they had against me, so i just sucked it up all the way through)

after we graduated from high school i stopped contacting them. but turns out we were in the same college, and they reached out to being friends with me again. as naive as i was i became close to them as usual, until one day they fucked me over again by spreading rumors about me around school for no reason. i became really hostile and confronted the main bully. at that point, i don't even know if it was my fault for ruining the friendship or their fault since both of us was very hostile. i didnt take this publicly but i confronted the main bully and ended this off. i cut them off from my life and social media. but until today i still feel guilty for hurting them, even though it takes 2 hands to clap. everytime i see them i shiver and my anxiety strikes. i am reminded of how they screwed my life over and over again and kept wondering was it my fault for the break of the friendship. i saw this bitch at my workplace today and i was shitscared but also frustrated at how normal this bully was while im still tormenting and condemning myself for the breakup of the friendship.

not only that, but today, i lost another high school friend. let's call this friend ""Billy"". this time, i am sure confused of whos to blame for the end of the friendship. the context was that i was a middle person who tried to loosen things up (a conflict basically) between Billy and another friend of mine. it was painful how billy asked me to just fuck off and take the side of my other friend. problem is, i told billy i had no hard feelings and i was just putting out whatever that ive felt as the middle person who dont have any intentions to hurt either parties and am not taking any sides. it sucked like a bitch lol im still trying to process all of this.....

overall i feel that i should be liked by people and after all that has happened i feel like i have to take the blame for every broken friendship even when i did nothing wrong for real. I am accountable for my own actions but it just really scares me how my friendships with people end so fucking easily. then when it ends i shut them out completely and i hop to another friend group, i dont bother reconciling and that itself is a very toxic trait of mine. some days when i am better i thought ive healed from my past, but no, whenever i run into them coincidentally i panic and i shake because of the past that keeps haunting me. its making me believe that its hard for me to be liked, and i am to be blamed for every broken friendship. i dont know fam, i dont even know how to save friendships anymore.",18Dec2020,1

1) Sometimes the love of your life comes after the biggest mistake of your life.
2) You need to talk to the right people when experiencing a slump in your life. Talking helps alot if you've got the right people around you - I promise you they'll never think you're a burden.
3) No one wakes up in the morning with an intention to hurt you deliberately.
4) Emotions are temporary. That includes what you and me are feeling at this very moment. There are around 27 different kinda emotions one can feel so whatever you feel on that day at that point may just be a new emotion you encountered and you're learning to embrace it as and when it awakens/pops in your head over time.
5) Critical self-talk steals your joy. 
6) Sometimes the best kept secret is not the one we keep from others but the one we keep from ourselves :)
7) You can be confident but also have anxiety. This feeling starts to dissipate once you share your thoughts with people around you and you start realising that you are not alone and that your problems aren't unique. 
8) Don't search for closure externally. Internal disclosure is a form of self-care 
9) If you're happy... Honestly... Who cares? Don't be stuck. Move the fucking fuck on lol. 
10) Things are gonna change whether you like it or not. 

You can completely recreate yourself... You can rise up from anything. It all starts with that one positive truth that you see in yourself...

STAY POSITIVE ❤️",18Dec2020,2

If you aren't into going through books. These are **some** of the **insights** I have gathered while reading it.

* Follow your passion just might be a terrible advice
* Passion mindset **focuses** on what the **world** can **offer you**.
* Focussing on what work offers you makes you hyperaware of what you don’t like about it, leading to chronic **unhappiness**.
* The **craftsman mindset** focuses on what **you can offer the world.**
* You need to **get good** in order to get good things in your working life.
* The more **experienced enjoyed** their work more was because it takes time to build **competence** &amp; **autonomy** that generates this enjoyment.
* Acquire **career capital**.
* **When no one cares what you do with your working life you probably don’t have enough career capital to do anything interesting**.
* Constantly **stretching your abilities**, don’t just play, practice your craft.
* Of course, Mastery by itself is not enough to guarantee happiness.
* Work that doesn’t have clear training and philosophy is where most people are stuck.
* Clear goals without them it’s hard to get effective action.
* **Control** is **seductive**.
* When deciding on an appealing pursuit, decide if **people are willing to pay for it**?
* To have a mission is to have a **unifying focus for your career**.
* The mission must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others.
* It must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.

**Though you can share your own insights.**",18Dec2020,1

128,"Hi, 

I’m 21 and I was diagnosed with testicular cancer today. I don’t know any more details. I don’t know what type of tumor it is or if it’s spread or not. I’ll know this on Monday. 

My mom started crying today and it made me feel really bad. But I’m okay with the cancer, I guess? I’m a happy and positive person, I’m just like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ guess it’s life lol. I don’t really know what the purpose of this post really is, guess I just wanna talk. 

I’m going to get my ball removed and get a prosthesis. Unfortunately it’s the “big” one which supposedly is the one that produces the most sperm. Therefore I’ll freeze some samples of my little babies and freeze them at the hospital! I also hope the fake testicle feels realistic ahah :).

But those things aren't deeply true, I'm just used to them, all goes or changes (even my perception). Now I feel that emotionally and it frightens me. Can anyone relate with that problem?
