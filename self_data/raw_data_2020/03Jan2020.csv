Iv been working voluntary in a charity shop and there was an older lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam me and Sam  were tagging clothes about 10ft apart ...anyway they were asking how old we were: 

🔹Sue: I’m 48

◾️Sam: *bubbly points up to the air* I’m 31

🔹Sue: *looks over at me* how old are you? 

🔸Me: 29

🔹◾️Sue and Sam : *act surprised* awwwww are yer!?

🔹Sue: when yer birthday?

🔸Me: November 30th 

◾️Sam: *bubbly points up again*  mines 21st

🔹Sue:  oh close birthdays eh....gonna have a litttle birthday bash? *laughing a little*

◾️Sam: (very seriously and abruptly reacts) 
 Ooooo no, ooooo no. Oooooo no, don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like thaaaat *shaking her head a little* (seemed very arrogant with her reply and loud too) (could have been an ewwww) she said it acting all la Di da (snobbish) 

She stinks really bad too so the audacity from her to act like that 


 Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in community service for the same crime idk what it is and he does call Her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes and fancied another guy in the shop (who called her all sorts to me because of her hygiene) but has poor hygiene BO and looks like a hard drug user. ’m A guy. The fella would be out if prison by the point of our birthdays tbf but it was just a joke",03Jan2020,0
1,"I’ve always hated when friends and even now family members try to set me up with guys because it feels forced, and I prefer for them to meet me in person first and me approaching them W/O other people being involved! Now my mom keeps bitching at me that I need to have more guy friends or go out more. If only she knew I’ve been sexually assaulted before and every fucking guy friend has always tried to fuck me that’s how I got assaulted. And this year I’ve really not been wanting to socialize or have had interest in meeting guys. I’ve been dealing w depression and my sex drive has been nonexistent, plus I’ve been bi curious. Let me know what u guys think or how to handle this? 😞",03Jan2020,1
6,I saw a post on Instagram and it mentioned how the person goes to the gym bc they love their body.  I understood it in a sense that a person could like their body in a way that encourages them to change it or maintain it by working out. I admit I’m confortable with my body because it performs well and does what it suppose to do but at the same time there’s a few things that I wish I can change. Like the size of my gut and the strength of my arms. I just recently started going to the gym and it feels great. Pumping iron and endorphins. Working out is a form of relief and I can definitely notice the difference after I work out. Idk if this mindset is damaging or bad but weirdly it keeps me going. For too long I’ve been looking at myself and not feeling pleased with it. I want change and I’m going to do it. Thanks for sticking with me in this long post.,03Jan2020,8
7,"So, around half a year ago I started getting very frustrated with my work. I kept aiming for it to be realistic, but it's just not my forte. Because of that frustration, I decided to start using colors, markers instead of mainly pens, pencils, and charcoal, and lastly, I would use different resources such as making collages to help me come up with ideas. I would take those collages I made and add designs, colors, and whatever else came to mind. For the first time in a long time, I am really happy with my work and I am continuing down this new path.",03Jan2020,1
8,"I saw a couple walk in at my work today who resembled my highschool bestfriend and her boyfriend. We've drifted a few years ago, we still have contact but its definitely not what it used to be. And seeing this couple just reminded me of that. Reminded me of how much I miss her and her friendship. I know its part of life, and these things happen, but it really does suck. 

To this day, shes still probably the only person I can say was truly my best friend and I miss that friendship a lot. We went through a lot of bs and I definitely remember all the shit times and why we drifted in the first place, but that doesn't stop me from missing her.

12,"This is a problem I’ve had for a long time now, and I’m really just sick of it at this point. It’s usually pretty mild, a tiny little voice in the back of my mind saying ‘what if they don’t want to talk to you’ around most people. But, while it’s a bit rarer nowadays, when I actually develop feelings for a person, or feel that first little spark of chemistry, it becomes an anxiety filled constant presence in my head. The usual play by play is that I’ll meet someone, we hit it off (usually involving alcohol when I’m able to shake this feeling off and be relaxed), I start liking them, and as soon as I do I have no idea how to act and start overthinking it all. Should I message them? But won’t that seem creepy? I’ll rack my brains thinking of something to talk about even though it’s been quite natural in person before, and oh fuck, she opened my message and didn’t reply, she must think I’m a fucking creep. Of course she does, why did I ever think us together was even a possibility. Maybe I’ll just message her again. Fuck, now I’ve double messaged her and seem like a clingy weirdo. Repeat the cycle again and again until eventually whatever spark that was there fizzles out because I act like some kind of awkward fucking robot around them who can’t be natural at all (again, unless alcohol is involved, but that’s hardly a healthy coping mechanism for this shit, cause what usually happens is that a girl is gonna wonder why the fuck we only ever talk while drunk).

But this time I’m done feeling this way. I’m 21 for fuck sake, I shouldn’t be like this with girls anymore. There’s this girl in my extended group of friends who I’ve really fucking hit it off with recently too. I’m talking us hanging with friends over a good chunk of the festive season but the nights always ending up us two just goofing off in a corner for hours on end, her trusting me and telling me some really private, difficult shit about her past that she hasn’t even told some of her closest friends, her buying me hundreds of drinks and food on nights out, making me get hundreds of photos and videos with her while we’re out for her socials, and even a kind of hesitant, ‘innocent’ kiss the other night that maybe went on for a couple of seconds longer than it should have (think Jim and Pam at the Dundies kind of thing). 

And the thing is, I really fucking like this girl. When she told me the hard shit from her past she’s went through, and how she feels like she always has to put a tough front up and not let people in, I found myself opening up to her about my own struggles with depression and shit that I’ve not really told anyone about. It felt safe and comfortable, and I was like in awe of how kind, caring and strong she is. I really feel like there’s something genuine here. She’s said to me that right now in her life she doesn’t want anything serious, but I’d like to at least just get to know her beyond drunken nights and at least be in each other’s lives a bit more than a night a week at most. We were out together a lot over the festive period, but that’s done with now, people will be back to normality and I’m not gonna see her as much as I have been recently which is gonna fucking suck.

The thing is, even now I find myself overthinking it all. I think it’s pretty clear there’s SOMETHING there at least, and I want to be able to get to know her better and see what happens, but she’s an admittedly bad social media replier (she told me one night how she barely talks to anyone on it ever). But the thing is, my anxiety takes over. I like her a lot, and I’ll instantly perceive any possible bad side to what she says as ‘oh fuck, she must think I’m a creep, she’s out of my league anyway and I was stupid to message her’. I’ve went through too many periods of liking someone from like nights out or whatever when things are relaxed between us, only to see it fizzle out when I try get to know them more deeply cause I act so fucking awkward and get stuck in my head. So, how the fuck do I stop this thought process? It seems so ingrained at this point that I don’t know how to fix it, but I’m not fucking letting myself get in the way of what I want this time.",03Jan2020,1
13,"My mother is caucasian and my father is african american, making what is referred to as “mixed”. My mom raised me for most of my life up until now and I spent a lot of time around MOSTLY white people growing up. This was only because I went to white school and a lot of my friends just so happened to be white. Fast forward to the start of my freshman year, a lot of things in life happened that changed my family’s income and housing, and I was forced from going to a private high school that was predominantly white to going to a very ghetto public school that was predominantly made up of black and hispanic students. I’ve been going to the school for a year now and have noticed how uneducated (regarding basic social skills) the majority of my peers seem to be. Not saying my previous schools didn’t have “dumb” people who made bad life choices, it was just a lot more noticeable here. I can’t complain about the education because some of the teachers are good at their job, but the environment of the school is just so toxic and mostly full of people who act like they’ve never been disciplined in their life. Now I’m not oblivious to the fact that people grow up and deal with things out of their control that make them like that, but it’s hard for me to ignore that I’ve seen this behavior more in minorities than the white people I’ve grown up with. I just feel a little embarrassed to have to go to this school where I feel like everyone else grew up on the streets and I’m not able to connect with anyone, much less have a reasonable conversation using actual English words. Anyway, I just feel like things would be better if I went to a private white high school where I know many people grew up similarly to how I did. Am I wrong to think that? Does it seem like race may play a part in how I feel?

31,"6 months ago, after spending 9 months sending out 10 applications a week, I got hired as a web developer for a small studio.

I had been freelancing for a while but I was a very green programmer. I didn't know any frameworks, I didn't know the tools, I was just a philosophy major who jived with programming because at the base of it, both philosophy and programming are about logically breaking down complex problems into discrete and basic steps.

When I finally got hired, I was extatic, but that 6 months was tough. Projects that would take my coworkers 8 hours took me 20. Simple things like WordPress upgrades took me hours when they should have taken half an hour because I just hadn't worked with that kind of stuff.

On top of that, I've had severe insomnia most of my life and there were days that I couldn't even think through basic concepts because I would just lose my thoughts. On those days, I often couldn't finish my hours and thus far I've ended up almost 40 hours behind. 

But I did my best, I really did. Sometimes I would pause my clock and work an hour for free just to keep my time down. I would look stuff up after work so that I could come in the next day as a better programmer than the day before.


And today I had my six month review.

At the end my boss says,


""The way we do things here is that at the end of every review we offer you a raise.

If it's 0% it's probably time to start looking for a new job.

If it's 1% you're doing ok but not great.

If it's 2% you're doing good, and 3% is very good.

That all being said, I'd like to offer you 7%""

Holy. Fucking. Shit. 

You could have seen the white in my eyes from the moon. 

And the kicker? Not even a big deal that I'm behind on hours. I can basically just buy them back by cutting my pay on a few paychecks.

If you read the post titled “A Call to All”, and were genuinely confused: it served it’s purpose. If the piece resonated with you, as if you were the one stroking the keys, then it served it’s purpose. 

The initial post was curated to filter and gauge where the populous is at as far as receptivity to otherwise abnormal concepts. 

The feedback was better than anticipated. 

I purposefully structured the post to be dense. I made it bloated and lofty for a reason. If the “idea” is to manipulate the masses and enroll a new regime of positive constructs, we need to gather the best and the brightest minds. So, the first thing I did was give you a haystack. If you resonated and found the “needles” or “points”, then you passed the first “test”. 

You remember. Or at least you FELT or FEEL something when reading that post. Something that’s all too familiar. 

That familiarity will indeed grow. 
Until you can’t ignore it’s existence.

The “Idea” itself: Society is fucked, it’s been fucked. The general mass is kept distracted with copious forms of entertainment short of anything with actual substance. They’ve been lulled to sleep over the past few millennia. They’ve been desensitized to violence and devalued to nothing more than their material accumulated. The hierarchical structure is depraved of light. Systematic oppression=modern day slaves. Almost Every source of information that spills through the screens we drool into daily, is propagated and personally curated to manipulate you through things like UX design. Integrated software that pulls and extracts you’re personal data (which is your online behaviors) I.e. “personality”, and then analyzes for patterns of said behavior; literally reading you like a fucking book. Each and every keystroke. It’s brilliant, don’t get me wrong. I mean the scale is ungodly. Sooo, it’s time to turn the tides. It’s time to manipulate the masses in the name of what is holy. What has been written and currently writing. 

Kings, Queens, Bishops, Knights and Rooks. Reflective on the playing field, with the pawns only seeing from the perspective of one linear direction. 
Which means: we have to separate the pawns from the “king”. Disrupt the opposing players plan by manipulating his pawns into leaving him vulnerable. 
We must get into the mind of our oppressors. Use their strategies against them, for we are not the pieces of the game, we are the players. We are omniscient, we see the whole board. 

Like I said. We are the brightest of the bright. Congratulations on finding the needle.

42,"I have very few things posted of value on Reddit, but would like to start. Here's my first attempt.

In 2003, I got married to the man (Jasper) I had been with for 7 years, having just gotten custody of his 8yo (Susie) daughter. It's not often that a man gets sole custody of his female offspring in a southern state, but his ex-wife had made some very serious decisions that gave him total control of the custody arrangements. At the time, he was a home-craftsman and had remodeled a nice 2-story house owned by a local baptist minister. The house was available for rent, we had just gotten custody of Susie, and the monthly rent was more than comfortable for us. HOWEVER, because it was a baptist minister, he INSISTED that we be married, go figure. Him, ever the romantic, proposed EXACTLY like this:

Me: (sleeping)

Him: Hey! Wake up!

Me: (startled) What! what?

Him: You wanna get married?

Me: (shrugging) Sure.Him: I thought you'd answer a little differently...

Me: I thought you'd ask a little differently...

That night, we went to the local ""giant box store"" and bought sterling silver rings for about $8 a piece. He chose a standard band while I chose a thin band with a small engraved flower on it. I still have mine.The next day, we walked into the very small courtroom of the very old justice of the peace. With a raised eyebrow, he asked us if we understood that marriage was a serious commitment and should be taken seriously. I could most definitely sense the skepticism in his voice. We nodded and probably seemed rushed, as, after the ""ceremony"" we both had to get to our respective jobs. He did the preamble respectfully, clinically, and seemed very detached until we began exchanging vows. My wonderful husband and I, both, could barely speak through the emotion that swept over us. The sincerity with which we spoke those words, locked in each other's gaze. I saw the  justice become real. His eyes were damp with the knowledge that we weren't there on a whim; that our love was intact long before we had ever met.

""As long as we both shall live."" we repeated in turn.

We didn't know how much that would mean to us fifteen years later. We've both cheated death, though his escape was drawn out over the last 7 years.

Any interest at all, and I'll share more. There are SO many stories I don't know where to begin. I've thought about writing a book or something but am too dependent on feedback.Here are some story titles (summary sentences?)

Homeless for a year

Shattered Jaw

Racist Frog's Legs

Flippin off the cops

Cross country with a stranger

Evangelical Fostercare

Borderline Personality Disorder (tons of stories)

The band that wasn't (Part I&amp;II)

Death of a Clown

Abscessed Teeth can kill you

Brown Recluse are scary

There are so many more, but I figure everyone has stories, so idk.  I lost my mom to brain cancer when I was 11, foster care with brother, brainwashed, kidnapped, went to PTL (Jim and Tammy Bakker), became evangelical, became a metal head, became a witch, became a hippie, became a very good office worker bee, became a professional cook, raised a kid, gave a kid up for adoption... I've got so many stories, they MUST be good for something.

If you read all this, thanks so much for your time. I have no expectations.

Further thoughts and examples:
I don’t do it on purpose, though maybe it’s a learned behaviour. One time I lost a job an I recall not feeling like management had faith in me. I find myself constantly disappointing my mother for chores, and I don’t feel like sherbet  has faith in me to do them. I do rather well in school, though I often find people calling me smart and that’s one area where my mom has a very “I don’t know if you’ll do well or not” type of attitude, which I appreciate. My father is very trusting, and when he asked me to code his website it was clear he believed I would do well. I ended up feeling very accomplished on the website and basically did it from scratch for him, with him seeming super pleased with it. When I take photos for people, the best shots always seem to be of the people who just have an inherent trust in me, or seem to like my work or believe it will be good. I feel like when other people trust me I can trust myself, and I will go to great lengths to not break the “promise” to myself or others.

56,"So, I just want to vent a little because tonight has been weird, it’s 3:41 am and it just feels bizarre.

So, last night after spending some times and getting drinks with some friends in the house of one of them I went home, a little drunk, a little sad, and I started browsing Tinder, and then I matched with this smoking hot girl.

I talked to her and she answered, I tried to chat a little bit but she very buntly told me about how she likes sucking dick, and well, alcohol, loneliness and hornyness all combined.

I sent her a few messages and then she stopped answering, so I decided to follow her on instagram (she had her insta on her profile) and when I did I realized her account were all really hot pictures, and not long after she started a live video where she showcased her ass and then showed her cellphone number and basically told her followers (now including me) to text her.

And so, as horny as I was, I did, I sent her a message but then backed down and deleted it, but then decided to give it a try and send it anyway, she was online but didn’t answer, and after like 15 mins I decided to send a sticker, which she answered to, I told her about how attractive I thought she was and how I wanted to see her, she then very directly asked me to send nudes to which I responded that if she sent one I would too (because of safety mostly, I have nothing against sending pics but I want to know who I’m sending them to first) and she seemed to get mad and just responded by saying “bye”.

I then answered telling her I’d sent her one, I just needed her to give me explicit consent on that (unsolicited dick pics suck after all) and she didn’t answer, then I finally sent her an apology text and said I was sorry for bothering her and that was it.

Or so I thought, later she started another live video with the same premise, and so I sent her another text tellong her I saw the live and asking her if I could send her something, and so I did, then she sent me a pic of her ass, and then I sent her a short video jerking off, asked her if she could send something next and she didn’t answer, I sent her a sticker and she just answered with another one, to which I responded if I could see her, to which she didn’t reply at first, some time passed and I decided to delete the photos I sent because I felt uncomfortable having them there, and after I did she answered and told me I was lame for deleting them, I explained why I did it, and then told her I could send them back if she wanted.

She didn’t answer after that, I waited for about an hour and then gave up and just sent her a text telling her I was going to sleep and wished her a good night, and that was that.

It was weird because i’m not used to sexting strangers, and less when they seem to be so popular, it makes sense she didn’t answer as much specially if she was answering all of her other followers as well so I understand.

I feel kind of happy because it was all so hot, but I also feel a little shame because of sexting a person that is so “popular”, but I never did anything without her consent so I don’t think there was anything wrong, also I took extra precautions with the pictures and video I sent so that if she happened to share it or post it somewhere I’d be safe.

And that was that, my crazy night sexting a popular instagram model, weird and lame but cool in retrospective :D

59,"It took a while, but I finally been able to get rid of the mask I put on myself in middle school. It just feels like there’s a storm I never thought I had inside me before is slowly growing in size.

This decade I grew in was rough, I was bullied and made fun of my classmates, grew into a period of depression and self-hatred, the death of an important family member, me failing my first semester of college due to stress, and the memory of my dad making jokes about my depression and thoughts in my face.

I overcame that, but since I stopped being my fake self, I felt blank, like I’m me but also nobody. Of course the solution is to grow and experience life so I can find myself, but I feel like all that’s happening is clouding around me and growing into a storm that’s changing me.

I can feel this rage inside me, all of the pain I tucked away before coming back to me in so many memories.  

I went through so much as a kid, but I never could go to anyone. My dad even dismisses my vivid memories and PTSD of my mom boiling me and then leaving me on my own when I was 5, the event that made me afraid to be abandoned in the first place. 

I was going to run away to the military, so I could separate myself from the area that’s caused me so much pain. Run away from college because I failed it and myself. Run away from myself because I can’t help but cover my ears and try to ignore the wrong in this world.

But the first thought that came out full of anger when I took off my mask was that I want to stop running away from everything. The anger, the storm, its not directed towards anyone but myself. The more I try to run, and try to cover my ears, the more it grows. 

I’m a coward, I want to run away from everything, I want to go out there and find myself, find a new home.   I want to run away from school, because I’m lonely and hate feeling abandoned looking around and seeing everyone being happy in groups. I don’t feel like I belong at home because I never have anyone to talk to, because all I can do in my free time is think about my problems and failures. I know all of this about myself now, and it’s no wonder I’m angry at myself deep down inside. How can I expect to accomplish my dreams by running away from my problems instead of fighting first.

I’m tired of running... the storm is nothing more than my strong desire to stand up and fight

62,"These homeless shelters are full of people gliding through life. Blaming, denying, or just plain hopelessness. The Sanctuary and River of Life are both dysfunctional. The Lighthouse is run by the River of Life people. All can pound sand. Nothing personal. They are not nice and are extremely underhanded. I've met better people in county jail.

I'm not going to go into the full story, but these people (shelter) essentially threw a stumbling block in my path intentionally. I'm a self-starter. When a goal of milestone is identified I head towards it aggressively. They saw this and had some internal issue with it and decided to behave this way. My guess is that they're after the State and Federal drug-alcohol recovery boo-hoo money. Thanks, but no thanks. Drug and alcohol addiction is childish and not an issue I deal with.

Idaho is an interesting place. Lots of racism but hardly any Blacks or Mexicans. Whites are pushing all the dope and molesting all the kids. Even the Muslims are having trouble though it was a Christian leader that got arrested for pedophilia. That this area was promoted as the Great Escape for Whites fleeing California is too funny. Lots of weak character up here. 

My sole concern is paying off the debt that I owe. Not really concerned about anything or anybody else. Not looking for a relationship up here because I'm not staying long term. Not interested. No thank you. 

Moving on to the next topic, someone asked who the woman was. American Intelligence knows who she is. Her name is Rebecca Ford and she works for Digital Extremes. I don't know her but she thinks she knows me. These people can provide the background on the situation involving her. Never knew her nor did I ever instigate contact with her in any form. 

Jennifer is an older case that's been brewing for sometime. Excellent example of the wrong person being given unrestricted access to intelligence of various types. Complete disaster.

The rest of the crowd are various life forms with who I have no connection. The guy calling me Jack Black looks like a pedophile. He would hang around the Upland 24 Hour Fitness and never work out. He's looks to be in his 40's, bald, unemployed, and living with his parents. Apparently he's a police informant too. Typical have not and can not personality.

I think I made a terrible mistake here with this other issue. I'm a beginner Muslim. While I want to focus on the Quran by itself right now, I like Shia Islam. Excellent literature. Very loving of women.

You people tossed me out onto the streets more than once. Islam brought relief to my mind. It was there for me when there was nothing there for me. It answered my inquiries unresolved through biblical research. I converted in jail but didn't really announce to prevent drama and unnecessary conflict. 

The Christians turned me out onto the street twice. Both times I was steadily employed and maintained great mannerisms. There was no excuse for that, then again, this is all about where Christianity failed through corruption and Islam corrects the path. 

I figured teaming up with a wife or girlfriend would be beneficial to both of us, but I see now that Islam has much to teach me there too. I cannot even get simple confirmations or commitments. Cannot even organize a date of departure or how much money I'll need. Obviously a bad idea on my part. I apologize.

Jerry called me a nigger multiple times, insulted Islam and Muslims, and accused me of threatening both him and his grandfather with harm. In reality, I only dared him to call me a nigger one more time. There's no way I can pretend that never happened or look past that. He's a good guy that needs real world experience. He'll change for the better when that happens.

I didn't realize my programming notes and projects were going to be such a source of continuous drama. They are MY NOTES that I came up with all on my own. They were not taken from anyone nor is any project stolen or belonging to a third party. I may not program computers anymore. Would rather study the Holy Bible and the Quran.

Lastly, some of you just want to interfere in the lives of others. You add nothing, but take a whole bunch all the time. You're a form of dark energy that has a vampiric affect. It's in the form of looking after my best interests, but I'm always left with a lot less afterwards. No thanks.

69,"I 22M went to uni after finishing highschool and dropped out after first year due to mental health reasons stemming from a variety of issues I experienced at uni. Nothing malicious - I felt almost like I was too young and had been thrusted into this world of uni because it was the thing to do after highschool as opposed to something that I actually wanted to do.  I was also so wrapped up in the idea of making friends and that became my focus which surpassed the actual studying aspect of it.

Since then I have worked in bars and travelled parts of the world and have recently returned from a trip and have been working a bar since. But I have decided I want to start focussing on a future career, and for me that would be in the (probably) biomedical/biochemistry field.
So, I need a degree to get there and so I have been thinking about going back to uni. This is somewhat daunting but I have grown so much since then and I think this time around I won’t be as influenced by social trials and would be able to focus on, and enjoy, my studies. The deadline for applying is in a couple of weeks and even though I have only just decided to do this, I think it is better for me to get an application in to start later this year instead of waiting for another year and kicking myself because I could have started earlier.

I just wanted to get this out because dropping out really affected me - all my friends went to uni and have graduated this year and I always felt ‘damn that should have been me’. So I’m hoping this will be good for me and give me some sort of direction.

71,"The poem is follows. 

I met a traveller from an antique land who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert. Next to them, half-sunk, a shattered visage lies who's frown, and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command told of it's sculptor, well those passion read, which yet survive. Stamped upon these lifeless things, the hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed. And upon the pedestal, these words appear

""My name is Ozymandius, king of kings, look on my works ye mighty, and despair"" 

The meaning is... there are no works, just a broken statue somewhere in the desert that the mighty of the day will pass by, trampling his once great empire underfoot without so much as a thought or care. 

No empire, no great power, lasts the test of time. Look at every previous empire in history. Once they ruled huge swathes of the world for centuries or even millenea, but what exists of them now? Ash, ruins, rotten and half destroyed records that are a nightmare to keep from disintegrating under their own weight. Their power is long dead, their names once household knowledge to millions, now forgotten. Many fallen empires dont even have the luxury of records or ruins, all has been reduced to ash and dust and said ash and dust has been blown out and scattered in the desert. 

Its a message to the empires of today, to the American global empire, to commumist china, to Russia, Saudi Arabia, to every nation and every state. That one day they too will die, that a time will come when someone considers them to be a great power for the last time. When someone remembers their empire's name for the last time.

72,"I need to stop procrastinating. This might seem simple but I want to know how to drag myself out of Netflix, playing and Reddit. I've had this kind of problems since always. This is probably going to take a while to explain, first off I want to apologize for any mistakes as English is my third language.
Like many others I was a kid who was often complimented on their intelligence. I'm pretty above average, but I am not technically gifted (I did some tests and I scored slightly below 130 even thought I can't remember exactly the number). Anyway I've always been kind of different, I used to spend recess reading books in a corner rather than playing, those were fantasy books such as Harry Potter, Eragon or The Chronicles of Narnia. This used to drive my teachers nuts and they even made me make a schedule by which I would play with other kids three days a week and they would let me read two. I guess that ended up working because I stopped reading altogether, thank you very much (/s).
I ended up getting over much of my social awkwardcy so that is not such a huge problem anymore. My problem is that being ""priviledged"" made it completely unnecessary to work at all to pass all my subjects with good (if not great) scores. Until high school. So far I haven't failed anything and I'm on my senior year, but my grades have been steadily declining over the past few years and I never started working seriously, I only study what I deem necessary to pass, which often means starting the day before or even the same day of the exam. My average has gone from 8.5 two years ago to 7 this semester (out of 10). This sin't that bad for now, but I know I won't be able to keep up like this in college or anytime later in life. I find it impossible to remain determined to work unless I absolutely need it, and I often spend entire days procrastinating. This has been a problem since I was much, much younger, I used to spend pretty much all my free time playing videogames and I now suspect I had a slight addiction, I used to think about them literally all the time I wasn't playing, waiting all day in school for the moment I got back to keep playing. This also faded with years, but I didn't substitute it with anything productive, instead now I just waste my time on social media, Reddit, Netflix or playing (I never grew out it completely, but it's not the problem anymore).
It might seem dumb, but the last straw was reading the other day a post on AskReddit asking the ""former gifted kids"" about how they turned out, and I felt identified with what many of them said. Some were able to get over problems quite similar to the ones I now have, others never could. I know for certain that success isn't going to come out of nowhere and I don't want to be part of the second group. I also know that I can't only trust my ""enlightened"" moments to work this out, those are useful every now and then but after a couple days I get back into my routine of procrastination.

Im 23 now, but through my whole childhood i was more of an observer. My mother married my now step father when i was roughly 9. Now this step father...loves to hear himself talk. And i believe he is the main reason i get so annoyed in conversations. 

You know how some people you just smile and wave, or do the ""mhm, yeah, oh wow"". Well, just imagine that. For years. He had stories that i tried to follow but after a bit, they were just false. He had no friends, alcoholic, druggie, no job. So he had nobody to talk to. So my brother and i became the people he talked to.

Everything either became a fake story, became a reason for him to rant/lecture, or he'd find a new way to insult. Obviously as a child i never confronted him, then i moved out.

I believe ive brought the same feelings with me. Since ive just observed and bs'd my way through his conversations, i feel i can tell when people are just like him. Just wanting to hear themselves talk. 

I rarely ever start conversations, though i can sure hold one. Ive just gotten so good at letting people hear themselves. And usually as soon as somebody calls my name (at work for example) i know almost immediately what they want. And as soon as they call my name i get annoyed as frick.

I don’t know if I look back on things with such rose tinted glasses that I exaggerated emotions and feelings, but I always loved Christmas time and the fuzzy feeling that came with it but I just kind of didn’t feel anything this time. Opening presents with my family was just a chore to make sure I was grateful enough to them. I kept to myself that I don’t like having more things. Having more things makes me sad. Anyway that’s pretty unrelated to the rest of my rant(?) or whatever this is. 

Yesterday some friends that I haven’t talked to for a while used our group chat again and we played Stardew Valley. Every time I make new friends it’s just a matter of time until they give up on me for stupid things I do, but this time I was sure I wouldn’t ruin it, so I tried hard to be annoying or anything, but everyone is just so loud, nobody listens or answers me even if I address them by name. I still had fun anyway because even though I have very little of it, social interactions with my friends make me happy like playing video games on my own just don’t anymore. 

Today, I opened my computer and turns out they have made a new group chat without me so they can play our multiplayer farm. I didn’t say anything to any of them, but I guess it just sucks. I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing for them to be interested in me. I’ve heard the advice that I just need better friends but honestly I think I’ve ran out of options.

We got free drink tokens, I used them and I wasn’t that drunk. It was probably my fault for using them all and trying to keep up with my colleagues. 
I was in a respectful way throughout the night and at about 12 the night manager invited me and my friend (also 18) to his after party. 
He is a 33 year old man and one of the chefs came too. When we got to the house it was just us, I got a drink from the house owner and soon got fed up as it was just us there.

91,"I was reflecting on my depression today and wanted to put it down in writing and share it with people because I don't think this is something that I have seen expressed before. I used to think that I didn't want to have kids because I didn't want them to have depression and struggle with it. I've changed my mind on that and feel like I live a full and greatful life even with my depression today.

I have had depression since I was a young teenager and struggled a lot through adolescents. I had some extremely dark and isolated times, but every once in awhile there would be a good day, couple of hours, minutes, ect. I didn't know how to hold on to those moments and try to elongate them, but now I do. When I'm in a positive place, I try to keep my possitive thought loop going for as long as possible and actively fuel it with things that feel meaningful at the time like sharing time with others. 

I still have depression where I'm apathetic about everything, can't leave bed, tired. But I have been able to stop my negative self talk that just compounds the problem. Now, my depression is much more manageable that I don't work together with it and actively fight it. I'm not going to say that you'll feel happy, or like doing anything, or that it's fun. But I can say that the lows aren't as low. If you don't work with your depression and stop and challenge your thinking, you aren't helping your brain chemistry dig a deeper hole for your emotions. 

 I don't lay blame on myself as much anymore and am actively stopping my negative thought loops and it really allows me to lead a full life even with my depression. 

I can hangout with friends without feeling like I don't deserve to be there because I challenges that thought over many weeks. I dont feel guilty that I didn't get out of bed for a few days, because I know the effort I made, albeit it feeling like nothing, was all that I could offer at that time. If I could have given more effort, I would have, I just wasn't able to that day. I don't get mad at myself when I can't shower. I do what I can, put on some deodorant, put some dry shampoo on my hair and use a face wipe to feel fresher. I have learned a lot of coping skills to help myself with my depression and even when I'm feeling low, apathetic, tired, and sad, I am now able to name those emotions as separate from my self worth and it has saved my life.

97,I’m feeling super stupid &amp; stressed this morning. I was applying to my school’s dental hygiene program under the impression that the application was due on Jan 20th. Come to find out it’s actually due next week Friday &amp; now I’m scrambling to get my last requirements.,03Jan2020,1
98,"(I’m not good at english) I’m a bartender at night. I have this regular customer who always wanted me and only me, to mix her drink (probably cause I’m the only female). 

Today she came, and I knew what she wants and i mixed it up straight. Each time, she’ll order from me directly. And I somehow know her timing intervals of orders.

So at her 5th drink, she was... late? I mean, you know what I’m saying if you’re a bartender with regular customer base. 

Something in me told me to go look for her (sixth sense probably)

I found her outside being held by two guys, she seems blurry, tipsy and not her usual self. 

She loves to drink but she has never looked so tipsy before because I know whatever I served her, it’s based on her taste and alcohol tolerance and with just 4 drinks, is not gonna make her look so tipsy. 

And she always come with her girls friend so who are the two guys?

I went up to them, tap them at the back and say “she is suspected of stealing, i have called the cops and i need her back in to wait for the cops arrival” and the guys bolted off.

Lol.

I bring her in and sit her down at staffs corner. She’s still there, but dead asleep now. I have informed her friends she’s asleep in staffs corner. 

TL:DR: A regular in my bar is late for her 5th drink order, I went to find her and found her tipsy with two guys that I know isn’t her friend (probably), tapped them on the shoulder and told then I need her back in as I have called the cops on her for stealing. She’s now dead asleep in staffs corner.

Edit: sorry if I didn’t reply, I’m still at work. Saw the comment about checking her breathing. Yes she’s breathing still and has called for ambulance.

Edit 2 &amp; Update: i read ALL the comments but I’m sorry I can’t reply to all, I worked a day job today and then back home to shower and eat and off to night job. Sorry. I’m a lil tired. 

Seems like I need to clarify my “bolted” means “running away” to one of the redditor who commented.

After one kind soul told me to send her to the hospital, I called for ambulance and one of the friend followed, (I can’t leave my job as I need to oversee the operations and the ambulance here only allowed one person to go along). Her friend told me that she will contact her parents so that they know where their daughter is :)

100,"I’m 22 and I party a lot, I’ve slowed down a lot this past year and I’m trying to continue to try and only drink on special occasions. 

I already broke my new year’s resolution because I got pretty drunk at a party for New Years. Then I woke up hungover and an hour late for work and I just started this job and haven’t missed a day or been late once, so I was pretty disappointed in myself. 
But I’m proud I even made it to work because the old old me would have called in no matter what if I was hungover. And I made it through the day and it was an easy shift.

I shouldn’t beat myself up for breaking my New Years resolution, I should just continue to work on myself and try harder and be better to leave the past me behind. I can’t change completely over night.

101,"I’m happy, successful and in a healthy, loving relationship with my SO. Just posted about how awesome life is with him on IG when I get a follow request from a handle I don’t recognize. My account is private, but the requester is public so I check it out to see who it is before approving.

It’s a blast from the past. If I’m honest with myself, I have secretly wondered what this person is up to and have frequently revisited memories with him. As I looked through his photos I found myself wondering if he missed me the way that I sometimes missed him. Obviously he’s thinking about me if he went through the trouble of looking me up (there’s no way I would have popped up on his suggested follows since we don’t have any mutual friends, my profile doesn’t use my real name and my phone number is not connected to the account). I’m conflicted on whether or not I should approve the request or send him a message. 

And then I see it. Photos of him with those ugly sunglasses. The kind that wrap around your face. The kind that only bro ass military guys or police officers wear. Not that every military guy or police officer is bro-y, but these are the sunglasses that the bro ones wear. Thing is he’s not a cop or military. He just LIKES these garbage-looking glasses. I know they’re just a pair of glasses, but they served as a reminder of how our lifestyles did not align. We did not like the same shit. We were not from the same cloth. I dodged a bullet. 

And I remember how much swag my current SO has. He’d never wear ugly sunglasses. But not only that, he’s an amazing partner. A little fight has never scared him off. We both know we’re worth a little struggle sometimes. I am so grateful for him. 

So I left the requester’s profile intending on ignoring him. But I accidentally approve him! I’m sweating a little bit like *please no drama*. Then I convince myself that it’s alright. Let him follow me and see all the happiness I have without him. My guess is he did. This morning I logged on, slightly curious. He unfollowed me and that was that. I got my closure and I hope he got his.",03Jan2020,0
102,"I apologize if this doesn’t belong here, I don’t believe I will receive any sympathy which I’m not looking for, but just wanted to confess.

I’m a 20-year old piece of shit. I come from an abusive household with parents who basically just aren’t fit to be parents. My dad was hit by a bus and was in a coma which mentally made him not all there, to the point where he’s not competent and people think he’s strange while dealing with other issues like OCD, etc since his accident. My mother on the other hand also struggles with mental health issues but abandoned us, including myself when I was about 8. She found another man, cheated behind my dad’s back, barely coming home and providing food, items and for other children that weren’t hers, all while giving a lot away. At 10 years old I was raising infants that weren’t mine and missed out on childhood. She also stole the $2,000 I had when I was younger that was given to by other family members for college funding and used it on that man she was cheating on my dad with who took too much money by leeching her clean, bought a house and cut contact with her.

Back to myself. All my life I’ve been abused by teachers and shitted on by parents, other children, my own family members and I could never comprehend why. I had teachers tell me I’m a failure who wouldn’t be getting far in life, and they were right. 

Unfortunately for myself, I’m a dumbass with absolutely no skills. I cannot even do basic math, no matter how hard I try, according to teachers all my life, who would tell me things like, “you have a math disability.” They would pull me behind class and give me grade 3 homework when I was a teenager and wouldn’t let me do the same that my peers were doing no matter how hard I fought and tried. My parents were never involved or showed up so teachers easily were capable of taking advantage and shitting on me because they had a dislike for me.

Getting older, I’ve lost almost all my friends. The only friend I have is one, literally. I don’t blame them for leaving - I’m a negative person, I have a bad habit of complaining about everything even though I have no ill-intentions. No one reaches out to me, and every birthday I’ve spent is alone.

I’m 20 now. Never dated anyone, I’ve been rejected by anyone I’ve ever liked and made fun of by men, I’m physically unattractive I got an odd face. Which led to a lot of girls and guys shitting on me behind my back, and even sabotaging me whenever I played sports, as an example. I don’t care that I’ve been single all my life, but sometimes it sucks knowing you’re so ugly and the treatment from others can be so cruel. I wish I could get into acting as a dream of mine, but I have a terrible dorsal hump nose, and receded chin, doubt Hollywood would want to be scarred by my looks. 

At age 20 I’ve never had a job, or well, I worked with my mom since I was 13 but she doesn’t like paying me. Anyone else she works with she pays on time, but not me, she rarely talks to me unless she wants something from me as well, same with most of my family. They only care about me when they want something. If I don’t have what they want my entire existence is ignored, or they talk badly behind my back and joke about running out the door so I cannot tag along.

I probably should get a job at McDonald’s or any basic job because minimum wage until I’m 60 is all I’m good enough for because I’m just not intelligent enough, broke and a joke in life. Every time I try to pull up the resume though, anxiety just destroys me. It’s just so hard to communicate with people. I barely leave my house these past 2 years since my friends all ditched.

Anyways to summarize. I’m a pathetic loser, crying in the bathroom isn’t a cure. I utterly hate myself and wish I wasn’t a piece of fucking shit. Fuck myself. Hate myself. Just a piece of shit who deserves absolutely nothing.",03Jan2020,5

115,"After 16 years of friendship I made the decision to phase my best and closest friend out. At one point I genuinely considered her my soul mate, as she'd been a part of my life for so long and through so many things that I honestly couldn't imagine being without her. I didn't have the retrospect to see how toxic she'd become and how much of a negative impact it was having on me, and was in denial about it for the rest of the time.

It was hard then and still is now - I went through a pretty deep depression a couple of months after the initial break off, almost like a grieving process. I went back into therapy and on meds for the first time since 10 years ago. The hardest part by far was fighting the desperation to go back to her, send a message, turn up at her house begging for her forgiveness (which she didn't deserve by any means).

I started to have frequent, vivid dreams about her vengefully coming after me and my family, or me reappearing at her house like I'd never left, feeling a palpable tension that stayed long after I woke up. (I don't know if they were the result of the meds, the general emotional turmoil I was feeling, or both, but I never had dreams like that usually).

As time's gone on I do feel like I've changed for the better in this past year because of my decision. I'm less stressed, less hateful and angry towards people, less negative about life in general. I've been able to lose weight and focus on my physical and mental wellbeing. As well as having more availability for other friends and family I've gone out and met new people. I've become more content with what I have instead of constantly comparing myself to what I don't. Most of these were things I didn't even realise were a result of being tied to her until recently.

I do still think about her a lot and wonder how she's doing and if she even cares that I left, but I hope that will get easier as more time passes.

It's people who (surely with best intentions) answer post, but forget to listen.


Recently i've been on a post by someone who's BF tried to cheat on her while he was drunk and out with friends.
Sure, it sucks. But theres much more to the story

10 people adviced she should leave him immedeatly, even though they knew hardly anything about what had happened.
Only 3 actually made an effort to ask about the details, the background, the aftermath etc.


and we all know why that is. Its the Textbook Answer. What more could there be to it that could make a difference?
But this is the real life, things are more complicated, more meaningful, more important, more permanent, more irreversible.
i'm sure you just want to help and that is great. But make sure to actually have all the facts.
And most importantly, ask questions. i've never seen any post on here where everything thats important was stated in the post.

you could really ruin someones life. This is not a game.

Something similar happens with suicide posts.
of course you want to save them, but usually theres more to it than just saying that everything is probably gonna be alright.
A good start is to try to understand them. Theres no simple solution. Every single one of them is different. It's not easy at all

130,"I'm a 22 year old student, in college about 4 hours away from home. I come home maybe once or twice a month, depending on how much money I have and how much I have to study.  Now I've been home for two weeks over the holidays, it's been fairly good because I got to bake a lot and felt the happiest I've ever felt because I got so many compliments from family and on some subreddits, however once again, and I think this happens every time I come home, I start feeling so shitty and I can't help it. I'm mostly surrounded by my family which is fine of course but sometimes it's too much. I think my feelings stem from the feeling of inadequacy, like I'm not up to the tasks that I have in college despite being in my final year, I just get so scared when it's time to go back and study because it's so overwhelming, plus my dad will be retiring in three months so I am worried about that too because of course he gives me money for college. Other than college, what really gets me down is the fact that I don't really have any good friends. Some college friends sure but nothing special, no hanging out after classes or meaningful conversations. Also, two weeks ago just as I was on my way home, my boyfriend of almost two years decided that was a good time to break up, saying basically that he has been leading me on for months, which sure I felt bad about in that moment, but the more I thought about it when I got home it simply pissed me off because he was the one who kept saying we should communicate. I don't even know why I'm mentioning the break up, but since I am, I do know that I didn't lose anything with that person and I'm glad I'm not hung up on them (and while I may be countering myself with that, yeah sure I get a passing thought about this person but I would definitely never put myself in that relationship again). I don't think the break up is really causing me to feel this way right now, I just thought of mentioning it because he was the person I thought I could actually rely on when I needed to but I guess I was wrong.

134,"Don't you just hate it when your parents just don't understand something and overreact about it too? 

Well, I know that feeling all too well here. I had a small YouTube channel that I would occasionally make videos for in my spare time. It wasn't anything special, just some silly Sonic Sprite Videos made using Microsoft Paint, Windows Live Movie Maker and a text-to-speech program called Speakonia. I had about 350 subscribers by the time my parents found out about it last year. 

There was a good reason why I never wanted to tell them about my channel in the first place. It wasn't because I was embarrassed about having a channel, but because I knew that they didn't fully understand how YouTube works and would make a huge deal out of nothing. And guess what, that is exactly what happened.

They started telling random people that I was a YouTuber, including one of our neighbors when we moved back to Canada last summer who I didn't even know as well as a waitress for a pub restaurant we frequently visited back in England. It felt so uncomfortable, since my channel was insanely small; not even large enough to be eligible for monetization. I tried to explain that they shouldn't be doing this unless I had a decent number of subscribers that was well within the 10k - 40k range at LEAST, since my channel at those numbers would actually be considered legitimate. 

But no, my Gen X parents who have essentially no idea how YouTube works as a platform from a creator's perspective didn't listen to me. It went right over their heads and they started making me out to be like Pewdiepie or any of the other big name celebrities from the site whenever the topic of me having a YouTube channel somehow found it's way into a conversation. They should know that a channel like this needs to grow gradually and you can't just introduce me to someone I just met with me being a YouTuber as the first thing they mention about me. There are other important things about my life than that.

Not to mention, constantly asking me whenever I'm going to make a new video is off-putting too; especially when a channel is that small.

I also like how they also found out that I was writing fanfiction in addition to having this YouTube channel in my spare time, but haven't bothered to check out one bit of it. Instead, they started obsessing over my channel and making a bigger deal out of it than it needed to be at it's given size.

First off, you mean the world to me, and I truly believe that you are the only person I can say that about. Since we first met, that seven odd years ago, there’s been a aura I’ve noticed around you. One that I have never seen around someone before, encased by the way you spoke with such kindness and tenderness. As we both grew and matured, so did our friendship, and you became one of my closet companions. Someone I trusted to open up emotionally too, something that I’ve always had trouble with. I learned so many traits from you, from empathy, to compassion, to expanding my view of just how different people are from one another. We can both agree we are very different people, from our views, to our personalities. Though we looked pasted that and saw that our hearts were both good at our core. So, over the years of getting to know this wonderful person, that I am lucky enough to call my best friend, I must have subconsciously developed feelings for you. I suppressed them, hoping that they would pass, so it wouldn’t affect our friendship, so you wouldn’t see how I truly felt. So that Friday night, where I thought something that would never happen, happened. It caused something in me to erupt, a wave of emotion, but my gut told me something was off, that your tone had changed. So, when you pushed me away, I was hurt, hurt like I’ve never been hurt before. You were the first person I have ever cried over, not because you didn’t feel the same, but because I knew I was losing a best friend. I know that this unfair of me, and that you have your own problems to work through. If time passes as I hope it does, whether it be one, two, five years now till whenever you are ready, I’ll be there for you. Until that day comes, I can’t see you. As hard as it is, I know it will be for the better. I don’t want to be angry anymore, I don’t want to feel the urged to break everything I see. I don’t want to be angry at you, at myself, at whatever is keeping us apart. Shall pray to god, if there even is one, that I hope you are doing better than I.

Love

“Go give this gift to her” to my friend.
He said no and all my friends also denied my offer. 
A part of the gift had a “-s” as a symbolization of my name but I changed it to“-staycmtc” in order to make it symbolize all my friends.
I gave her the present and said something like:
“This is from all of us.”
And that was the only thing I could say.
She moved like if I would try, she could hug me. 
But I did the same movement too, we looked at eachother with nervousness and I went back.
I wish I hugged her.",03Jan2020,2
141,"I'm srsly freaking out idk what to do. I'm gaining so much weight. Everyone still calls me small and skinny although my bmi is 24.5 now!! It's so weird. I turned 20 this year and I'm 159 cm and i weigh 61 kg now. I feel so bad. I just don't get it that no one is telling me i've gotten fat and they still call me skinny although my bmi is close to being overweight(i still tell them i'm 53kg tho). I also don't see too much difference and my clothes still fit. Today i was 60 kg then i downloaded a 20 minute ""losing fat"" exercise and after the exercise i was suddenly 61 kg!! I'm actually crying bc i'm gaining weight everyday and i feel like it's unstoppable and i'm already picturing myself getting obese and there will be nothing i can do about it and i'll be starving myself and i'll still gain more and more weight idk what to do!! I also have finals so i can't go on a diet bc i won't be able to study when i'm hungry and the exercise made me gain even more weight i feel like it's just gonna make my muscles bigger instead of losing fat! I feel so insecure i keep wearing different clothes to see how fat i look in them and i feel like sooner or later ppl are gonna realize how fat i am.",03Jan2020,1

150,"Backstory - I was walking along a main road on my way home when I noticed a guy get out of a car as I was walking past. He approached me from behind and called out to me to stop. The guy asked me where I was from (pretty common thing in london due to postcode beefs) and that he would stab me in the face if I didnt give him my jacket. Ended up giving it to him cos a £400 jacket really isnt worth it

For some reason still feel like an absolute dickhead cos I feel like I shouldn't have been mugged. I'm not shaken up or anything but I guess in hindsight these things stick out to me:

1 - he never pulled a knife so maybe didnt even have one

2 - it was on a main road and multiple people walked past while this was going on

3 - I am well trained in multiple martial arts and feel like I could have easily fucked him up if it had come to it

Just wondering if anyone has anything to add cheers",03Jan2020,1
