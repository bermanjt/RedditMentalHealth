2,You would think I would learn never to expect much on Birthdays or holidays. They always seem like such a disappointment.,19Oct2020,1
3,"I never in my entire life knew what I wanted to be and it’s always made me depressed. I had no direction, nothing to move towards, I just wasted time for the most part being sad. I hated school, I hate work even more and from the start at my first job knew this wasn’t for me. I had no desire to be anything that required college I was so lost man.

Throughout my entire life however, video games have always been there me. Me and my dad played them all the time when I was younger. They helped me stay in touch with my cousin and friend who both moved away from my town. Even now I can play and talk to my cousin every day on video games and he is all the way stationed in Japan.

So I realized that I was passionate about something, so I started a YouTube channel a couple months back to turn my passion into a job that I would love, I play video games all the time so I started streaming and uploading videos consistently. I love improving at making videos and love becoming a better player and streamer. After a long grind I have finally reached 1000 subscribers and now I can make money from what I love. It might be a while before I can do it full time but at least now I have something to strive towards.

I never knew how important it was to have a passion but it was definitely important for me and it’s made my life so much more enjoyable. I still remember the days of looking at myself in the bathroom mirror at my work crying after having to clean up a pile of shit laying in the floor for me to clean up. I remember it man and I use it as motivation to know that it’s not permanent because when you have nothing to move towards you feel trapped.

If you dreams fucking chase them and invest every ounce of energy you have into making them a reality. Love you guys and thanks for all your advice along my journey, that’s all.",19Oct2020,1
4,"Hey everyone! New to this subreddit, honestly just looking for a place to talk about my situation and hear some motivation.

Quick background: I’m a 21 year old male in college currently living in Baltimore city, even though I go to college closer to DC. My parents live about 20 minutes outside of Baltimore. 

My mom is currently undergoing chemotherapy for the third time. She’s had two major surgeries and I’ve spent a lot of time with her for her treatments. Currently, her chemotherapy is only able to be administered in Chicago, and due to COVID, we drive there and back every month. 

My father has very little emotional care for either of our lives. He will always be there for both of us, but in a material way... he will never sit down and give us a hug but he’ll make sure the bills are paid and such. He also gets extremely stressed out at times and verbally abuses me saying that I have no right to be part of the family and that I’m a disappointment and basically knocks down my own personal self worth because his personal self esteem is so low.

Anyways, this year has been tough, my father would basically yell at me every day over the summer so I moved out to Baltimore where I live with one of my graduated friends. I cannot live at college because it is a covid hotspot and I would not feel comfortable going back and forth to see my mom.

I have a solid amount of friends. People who I can lean on if I need. I will do mostly anything for all of them. I guess you could call me compassionate. However, a lot of the times, my friends don’t do the same for me. Easy to say, oh they don’t care about me, but I want to believe it’s just I care about each one of them more than they care about me. I reach out to them but they don’t really know what to say to me regarding my situation.

Anyways, I’ve basically come to terms with my mom potentially passing away. Obviously I am hopeful, but if she passed away, I would look back upon the past three years as happy because I was able to spend so much time with her (I chose to go to a local college rather than one farther away). I just don’t really know how I’m going to live without her. Most of my extended family is india. I have a very cracked relationship with my father. I have one recently married brother in Boston. We have gotten closer recently but he has his own life to live. I think about how life would be for me without her and I feel like I will truly have nobody to lean on when things get tough.

I also kinda caught feelings for this girl. I told her about them (I’m the type of person to always tell the person. Much better for me to talk about it than constantly think about it). She basically said that what we did (cuddling) was platonic and she doesn’t look at me that way. Totally okay with me, just once again I feel like I care about someone more than they care about me.

I just feel like I need someone in my life to be there for me when my mother is gone. It’s difficult because I feel like I should figure myself out and gain strength internally before seeking outside approval/care. Is it selfish to want to have someone care about me more than I care about them for once? I don’t know.",19Oct2020,1
5,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for almost 3 months now. Things have been going well and moving relatively quickly. We’re already talking about getting married somewhere not too far down the line. I already loved him and wanted to help him, but the last few weeks have made me realize just how much. 

About 2 1/2 weeks ago, my boyfriend’s grandparents tested positive for COVID. He lives in a separate house on the same property, as do his dad and step mom. His aunt just so happened to be visiting at the time as well. All of them eventually tested positive as well, though most of them (including my boyfriend) were asymptomatic. Thankfully, somehow, I never tested positive. It did mean though that I couldn’t see him for nearly two weeks. I never really got a chance to truly miss him before because I saw him at least three times a week. I understand now what it feels like to miss him and I know that I never want to feel that way again. 

His grandfather took a turn for the worse about a week ago and ended up passing away early yesterday morning. Throughout all of this, his diagnosis, his going into the hospital, and ultimately his death, I was incredibly proud of my boyfriend. I feel like you don’t really know a person until you see how they react to something like this and I couldn’t be happier with his response. He was emotional, as you’d expect, but he didn’t break down. Since he’s the only one in the family who’s now officially gotten a negative test, he continues to be the one who runs the errands and sets up funeral plans. I am so impressed with how he’s held it together and done what needs to be done. I love him even more now knowing how he reacts in crisis. 

This was also the first time I’d really seen him hurting and been unable to help. When I couldn’t see him especially, but even after when the news finally broke, I did everything I could to help him. I brought him homemade food while he was quarantined. I sat in the driveway and talked to him from across the yard. I continue to go with him for all of the uncomfortable errands he doesn’t want to do alone and I’m here for him when he wants to talk (or not talk). He says I’m helping and I think he means it. I only wish I could do more. Even just watching myself react to the idea of him in pain though, I’m beginning to realize that I love him even more than I thought I did. 

I wish he didn’t have to go through this. I wish there was something I could do to take away his pain. But since tragedy is a part of life, and this was bound to happen at some point or another, I’m starting to see the good things that have come out of it- at least for our relationship. When we first met, I wasn’t completely sure about him. I’ve liked him more and more as time has progressed and without even realizing it, I found myself falling in love with him. But this situation, more than any other we’ve been through, has shown me how much. I’ve seen how he handles crisis. I’ve seen how much I miss him when he’s gone. I’ve seen how desperately I want to make him happy, especially when I know he’s not right now. 

This whole thing has made me more confident than I have ever been that this is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.",19Oct2020,1
6,"To specify, I have a major problem with people who advertise their engagements when they've been divorced before. I just had a coworker make and post about how she just got engaged, and she's been waiting for this ""moment"" her whole life. But the reality is, she's been married before. I remember her first engagement announcement not that long ago. She's only in her early 30s, so its not like she's a widow, or someone who's suffered in a shitty relationship for years. I've heard the story of her ex husband, and honestly, he wasn't an abuser, or terrible to her. Just an incompatibility. So to see her getting hundreds of ass pats and congrats and people sharing her engagement story really bothers me. You've already done this and you got all the attention just a few years ago. You got gifts and money and praise when you got engaged the first time.

I'm absolutely not looking for a pity party. I've been with my boyfriend for almost 8 years. We are in an extremely happy and healthy relationship. We've talked about marriage, but we haven't gotten there yet. I have no doubts about his commitment or fidelity to me, but the fact that we haven't gotten married yet does bother me. I wish it didn't, but there is a surface level superficialness in that I want to be the center of attention, in the pretty white dress, being congratulated and praised by hundreds of people.

 I know my time will come, but also I really cannot give a care about your second engagement and wedding. It makes me mad that she can go through all the attention, praise, gifts and adoration of being a new bride when she's already gotten to do this once before. I'm genuinely sorry if this offends anyone who's lost a spouse to death or abuse and remarried.....but when you just ""went your separate ways"" I'm sorry, I cannot care less that you're engaged again. Please, someone tell me I'm not the only one who feels this way.",19Oct2020,1

8,"Want to thank my cousin. During the start of quarantine I was feeling down or sad or whatever because I was almost always by myself because of online classes and my mom would still have work from 9 to 6 or 7. But after like the third week I got to stay over his house with him and other family members for a while. But what I want to thank him for is the fact that he was there for me when I was vulnerable and was considering killing myself and if it wasn't for that act I wouldn't be here right with my mother and preparing to go into my third year of college.
I will always be grateful, thank you.",19Oct2020,1
9,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

12,"Last year in November an unfortunate series of events took place in which my best friend got expelled from my school. My best friend, who I'm gonna call Jake, had been in a Romeo and Juliet type relationship with my other (female) best friend, who I'm gonna call Harmony. Jake and Harmony had been told by their parents not to see each other anymore because they were doing some pretty... risky... things at 16/17 years old. After the parents got the school involved, long story short, Jake got expelled and honestly... I haven't seen him in person since. I saw him once right at the beginning of quarantine because of my birthday and that was it. I've played online with him a bit since then... but there hasn't been human contact or a ""normal"" conversation in ages. So for just shy of a year I never felt as if I had a really good friend.

Cut forward to August, I'm at band camp because covid restrictions lightened a little bit and on the last day of band camp, one of the school administrator is giving a campus tour to a student who happens to be a percussionist. After his tour he comes into the band room and we just throw him in with the percussionist and have a blast for the rest of the day. This kid, who I'm gonna call Graham, joins our band and immediately clicks in the little friend group we have. Now, Graham is a senior... and everyone else in the group are juniors. Anyway, we ""add"" Graham into our friend group and honestly... he is an amazing guy. I honestly think he is awesome. He's funny, he's chill, and he's amazing to be around. I've just started to get to know the guy... like... in the past month and things are going great. Well as of a week ago guess who he's dating..........Harmony. After only knowing each other for a few weeks they're just dating now.

Here's my issue with that... the last time Harmony was in a relationship... things crashed, burned, exploded, got nuked by North Korea, and then became inhabitable for 20 years. It was a year-ish long relationship that hurt everyone in the friend group, especially me, as the emotional powerhouse/therapist of the group. Another issue is that the previous relationship Harmony had (with Jake), I always felt third wheeled, excluded, and ignored. And honestly... I'm scared for how this new relationship with Graham is gonna turn out. Harmony is a great woman... and I hate to see her hurt. Graham is a great guy in the few weeks I've known him. But I don't know if I can mentally handle their relationship if it gets serious. I've been wanting a really good friend for almost a year... and Graham is that guy I wanna be friends with... but after the last relationship I saw where my existence was basically ignored, I don't know what will happen if this falls apart. Graham is a senior... Harmony and I are juniors... we only get one year with him assuming all goes well. And I'm terrified of growing up... the uncertainty of knowing who my friends are gonna be... which friendships will make it past graduation day next year. I don't want their relationship, or my fear, to screw up any possibility of maintaining what ever level of friendship I have with them.",19Oct2020,1

15,"Goal to break over $10,000+ one day.

&amp;#x200B;

I do the giveaways streaming on Twitch giving out $100 every Sunday to (hopefully) someone in need. Just finished the 7th Giveaway of $100, the other $300 came from direct donations to others to total over $1,000 to date. They're every Sunday at 8pm CST (GMT -5).

&amp;#x200B;

If someone is short on a bill, in need of food, replacing an old device - anything they are short on and not able to afford. I request that those in need of financial help enter the giveaway and those who are financially stable to not participate. You only need to be present with a PayPal. I will also be finding smaller streamers to gift subs, cheer bits, or donate to that are in need.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always had the mindset that if I won the lottery, I would spend a lot of my time going around giving it away to those in need. A little bit can go a long way for someone who is short on a bill or needs to replace an item. I came to the realization that I don't need to win the lottery to do this.

I think it’s an escapist desire to leave but since I can’t do that I’m trying to drastically change my surroundings and assert some sort of control. I’m torn between wanting to honor what my subconscious/emotions are telling me and not wanting to invest time or money into a feeling that may go away and leave me regretting the money spent. 
I’m wondering if this is related to the weather shift and may be the beginnings of my seasonal affective beginning to rear it’s head, or maybe it’s just that this year has been crazy!

20,"My wife and I were separated for a while. It was a low point in my life and I was deeply depressed and not eating pretty much at all. I think I went almost two weeks of nothing more than a cup of yogurt and some applesauce. But trust me, the vodka was flowing. I got to the point that at 6 feet tall I was down to just under 136lbs. 

I cleaned my shit up though. I quit drinking. I reconciled with my wife, and decided to make the 2600 mile journey back across the country to work things out with her. See, at the time we were living in Virginia, and my drinking habit had gotten so bad that she left me. So I drove back to my home state in the southwest part of the US. I drank myself stupid for the first week or two, but realized that it wasn't helping anything. It was only killing me slowly. 

Even after sobering up I still couldn't eat. That was a difficult drive. The drive through Texas was the worst. I had stopped in Fort Worth for the night and stopped and got some yogurt to try to get some food in me. My wife called. We talked while I finished the yogurt and I actually thought I was going to hold some food down for the first time in weeks. 

Nope.

Not only did I throw up the yogurt I had just eaten, but I was straight up throwing up blood. Not the coffee grounds looking blood that you sometimes get when throwing up, but I was literally throwing up straight bright red blood. It's all that was coming out at that point. The taste of blood like that was awful. Long story short, I ended up driving another 30 miles to a hospital in Dallas. I checked in, got pumped full of IV fluids as well as a whole slew of medications (zofran, Ativan, and several others to stop the bleeding).

I started feeling better. My shakes went away, and they brought me a turkey sandwich. Man, that was the best turkey sandwich I'd ever eaten. I devoured that thing. And I felt good too. Probably from the Ativan mostly. But whatever the case was, I was able to eat food for the first time in what was probably closer to three weeks. I slept in my truck in the hospital parking lot because I was alone on my journey back to Virginia and didn't feel comfortable driving while drugged up the way I was. 

I won't bore you with the rest of the details of the trip back to Virginia, but I will end it with this. My wife and I are back together and extremely happy. I'm sober except for the occasional glass of wine with dinner, and we're okay with that. I'm going to be starting Celebrate Recovery meetings this coming Thursday and not even having the occasional wine anymore. We found an amazing church that is helping both our marriage and our family life as a whole...

And I'm happy to say that after that steak dinner tonight, I'm up to 154.6lbs and steadily climbing. I'm eating like crazy, feeling healthier, and overall happier. Cooking is so much more enjoyable when you can cook for the people you love.  I love cooking and I love my wife. And I can't wait to see where we go from here. I don't have really any friends or family to share this with, so I figured I'd share with my reddit family. Stay happy and healthy everyone!",19Oct2020,1

22,"Okay so... I live with a couple and their kids and we also currently have a male house guest staying, he has been for a long while now, 6-12 months, who is a family friend (at least 10-15 years) of one of the people I live with.


The male partner has some anger issues and can lash out at times but this isn’t so much about that. Yet.


To keep it short, the house guest sexually assaulted the female partner while she was driving and tried to force himself on her while he was very very drunk. Groping, touching, grabbing, telling her to pull over, even went as far to say “come to a hotel for 2 nights with me, I want to punish you”. She had repeatedly said no and he kept trying to force it.
(She is doing somewhat okay just trying to process everything) 

We thought that he would play it off the next day and pretend like nothing happened. 

We were wrong. The next day he said to the female partner “I’m sorry about lastnight, not all of it though”. (I mean who tf says that? Fucking dick).

Then later the next day confronted the female partner again and said “you still haven’t answered my question, you’re driving me crazy” 
(Female partner thinks that he might be talking about the hotel proposal 🙄 but still back the fuck off dude)


The house guest knows that I know and has been giving me not so friendly looks and has us both on edge to no end. Her more so than me definately. So much for your home meaning to be your safe haven.

We cannot tell the male partner AT ALL because WW3 would ensue and it would impact everyone in the house if that happened. Like they’d beat each other half to death. No joke. And female partner would cop it as well unfortunately.

I'm trying to find a way to get the house guest out of so that it doesn't blow back on anyone and no one else finds out what happened (at least for the time being) 

Telling the partner is not an option and pissing off the house guest is a concern as well as we don’t know how he would react against us when all is said and done. 

So reddit, I need your help! Suggestions, advice, it has to be subtle, discreet.

23,"There are many examples of individuals who had a vision - something that on the surface seemed unattainable or absolutely insane. Yet with the right connections, money, or luck were able to see their crazy ideas and wishes come to fruition.


I feel like what makes those people different than me, is my desires and ideas are not because I am someone who is creative or intelligent, but a symptom of some psychological disorder that I'm not aware of.


I've invested so much mental energy building and evolving these dreams and desires for years, the thought of abandoning them feels like I'm exterminating some core piece of myself. They represent ""me"" in some way, and not living towards achieving them sends me spiraling in and out of depression.


I struggle with assessing if there is actually any value in these concepts. If it's worth the risk. If I'm chasing something/someone because it will actually fulfill happiness/comfort in my life or if it really is an illusion.

My thesis was always so daunting and now that I am taking the thesis proposal class, it's so much less scary.

I also found out that like an undergrad thesis is usually like 30 or 40 pages (at my school anyway) of like the essay part and the rest is all citations and graphs.

I just want to feel a space where I’m loved by the people I love but I’m nothing but a let down. I’m the worst thing you could imagine I have no good traits and I know it. I don’t want to be here ever again. No one cares and that’s ok cause I don’t expect them to care in the first place.

35,"This phrase perfectly encapsulates the reason my limitations as an 18 year old in the ""best years"" of my life take a toll on my happiness and my ability to appreciate the things I do have. This is the ""best part"" of life because it's when the greatest amount of opportunities to experience fun, fulfillment, and growth present themselves. In other words, it's only downhill from here in terms of access to these opportunities. So, not being able to take advantage of them right now means I'm missing out on the best shot I'll have at reaping the benefits of being able to do so.  If I had some reason to believe the phrase isn't true, it wouldn't bother me as much. But it is true, otherwise people who have already lived through most of their lives wouldn't all have to come to the consensus that it's true, and they wouldn't constantly be urging young people to enjoy these years while they last. And it's undeniably true, even just through simple observation. I'm trapped with the role of a spectator watching as everyone around me is lucky enough to be able to live through this part of life the way it should be lived. And I'm painfully aware of the reality that it's something I can only experience for myself in my imagination. If this is as good as it gets, there isn't much to look forward to.",19Oct2020,1

37,"I'm taking advanced accounting online and it's seriously ruining my mental health and my life. The professor gives homework based on super confusing/all over the place pre-recorded lecture videos with no solutions. His teaching in the videos does not correlate with his homework questions. I'm on my third homework of his class and I've worked on it for hours upon hours. He releases solutions right before exams and then gives an exam which is full of curveballs and a very limited amount of time. We have just about an hour to submit the exam which is full of questions. I never get to finish. We have had no in-person via video mandatory lectures, only optional ones, and those have been used to work on only 1 homework question by hand. He takes 1 hour to work out 1 question. I have a C in the class and am pissed. It seems like some professors wanna make the class format more ridiculous and unnecessarily hard than need be. Also, the class is based almost entirely on exams. Each exam is worth 480 points. Quite ridiculous. It's my last semester and I'm losing my mind, and I have 3 other classes to deal with.

38," First time posting. I'm normally confused a lot with shit so reddit might help :) 

ok.

I'm questioning my sexuality recently :l

I believe I'm Asexual because I don't view uhh intimacy is needed in a relationship and the topic of s\*x is uncomfortable to me. Gives me bit of anxiety. (I'm not totally up-butt about it; I have severe anxiety anyways.) 

The real problem is I feel I'm possibly Pan or Bi. I'm more platonic love then romantic love with people. I keep saying that having a girlfriend would be better because it would be easier to relate I guess, but I've only been with a male (Asshole Ex). I find myself looking at girls sometimes but not guys that often at all. I was bullied by guys through school, like ""Hey! He want to go out with you!"" or ""Wanna go out with me?"" then they'd laugh at me no matter what I did yes, no, silence, walking away. That most likely made me twisted my view/hate romance and relationships. 

I know you can like one more than the other; I know that. I'm like scared to be in a relationship yet want one. I don't want to be hurt in anyway, shape, or form. 

I mainly just want someone to love me for me.

If anyone can give me a clue or advice, heck tell me what you thing what I am. I'd appreciate it :)",19Oct2020,1
39,"TLDR; despite several efforts my dad is a greedy asshole who would rather see his gf than see me or his kids and I only saw this after my mom died. I feel that being adopted plays a role. 

In 2017 I lost my mom , and both of my grandmothers within a period of 10 days. Since then I suffered but I am also proud because I have accomplished many things in my life. I felt that their spirit was guiding and strengthening me and I was able to get a good job that has a good opportunity coming up.

I should be happy, and I am. I also feel very angry sometimes. Since my mom passed my father took a girlfriend and spends months with her in her home an hour away from me but will only visit once for a couple of hours. He has no interest in seeing his grandkids and doesn’t call. If he does message it is rude and short. 

I can’t talk to him about the good things happening . I am a woman and he’s very sexist so he doesn’t listen to my life or take anything I say or do seriously. He did this to my mom also when she was alive. He doesn’t ask how we are even though it is in a pandemic and I live in a city with young kids doing virtual learning. 

I also have 3 younger brothers. He helped one buy a house and start a gym. I feel that that was always his favorite son . My two youngest brothers he told them after my mom died that he didn’t want them to live with him because it would make his health insurance cost more. So he took the money that my brother wanted to use to go to school ( he is 20) , and bought a trailer in the country. My brothers lost their mom so young and I feel that he sent them away . He doesn’t talk to them either except to yell at them about the trailer. 

He basically just spends 3,4 months with his gf going to resorts , biking, hiking, etc and enjoying a life that my mom did not get to enjoy. My mom got all the hardship of raising us (we are all adopted), and then she died from cancer before she got to enjoy her years. And now this new woman is getting the attention and affection that he withheld from my mom.

I always understood and fully supported him having a life/happiness/relationships and I understand that sex and human connection is important. 

I just really hate him at this point for his disdain and how I feel that he walked away. He has always been very concerned with money- and through investments he has built up a lot for himself. 

He is very greedy and selfish not just in money but now I see why my mother would cry because above all he is greedy and selfish in relationships. 

Seeing his grandsons reminds him that he is older and he doesn’t want to feel old. He wants to have a girlfriend and meet up with old high school buddies and fix cars. 

He won’t answer if I call so I stopped. I decided to block him. Yes I have tried SEVERAL times to speak with him about this and explained how much we miss him . He won’t spend the night and last year left my house after he had been there for one hour to go spend Christmas Eve with his girlfriend. 

My kids are little and love seeing him and get confused when they don’t hear from him. 

I know that because we are adopted I feel that he doesn’t feel a connection to us.

That’s it that’s my vent . Thanks for listening",19Oct2020,1

45,"I came back from a weekend out today, and was shocked to find two flies buzzing about in my room. I hate flies with a burning passion. If I had two bullets and a gun in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and those two flies in a room, I would shoot myself in the head twice because there's no way you'd be able to hit a fly with a bullet. I don't even know why they were there--I didn't leave any food out in my room, so there's nothing that they could've eaten. I didn't have one of those electric fly swatters either, and besides the flies always seem to know what's coming. I guess they're able to feel the air currents before the swatter gets there. I thought I might make a fly trap with something sweet, but it would've taken a while to kill the flies and I wanted them gone immediately.

I decided to go with the second best option, which was of course to roll up a shirt into a tube and swirl it around like I was Indiana Jones' exterminator protege. And I really didn't expect this to work, but as soon as the fly leapt up from my sink countertop, I swung the shirt-whip as quick as I could. The shirt cracked with the power of a small thunder clap, and I swear it sounded like a thousand industrial grade flyswatters booting up simultaneously. At first, I had no idea where the fly had gone. I'd lost track of it after the incident. After a little bit of searching, I found the fly. Or at least, half of it, on my shirt, bleeding profusely, barely visible above dark purple print. The other half took a little bit more searching, but I found it 10 feet away, smeared on the side of my toilet, brownish-red impact site marking the landing. I threw away the T-shirt (I'd burn it if I could, it was free) and wiped up the mess. I decided going into the trash was too dignified for this piece of shit fly, so I threw it in the toilet and left it there. Then I took a shit on it. I flushed with a particular happiness that I hadn't felt in a while, the kind that only comes upon vanquishing your deepest enemies. 

While on my victory high, I'd forgotten a critical truth. This fly had an idiot girlfriend or maybe wife zooming around too, who must've been looking for her dumbass slow and dead husband. Retardation must run in their genome, because instead of flying around inside the bathroom like its idiot friend, it followed me outside into my bedroom and I was now both pissed and experienced. I rolled up a different shirt, and exterminated this small fly family with the routine callousness of an experienced murderer. This time, my shirt was only left with a wing on it. The fly was left struggling weakly on the ground, bleeding out, blinded, crippled, and loveless. I grabbed the fly with some toilet paper and drowned it in the toilet bowl. Then I took a shit on it. Then I flushed.

59,"I'm standing here in the garage of my childhood, the one my dad ran his Kung Fu classes from and I am suddenly stuck in a moment.

Surrounded by the portraits of his Masters on the wall and the 4 x 6in photo of his small club through the decades. He's cultivated a small following, mostly older adults, that have mostly sought a social outlet under the guise of fitness. While my dad is given the chance to rekindle his youth. His spell only broken at the end of the lesson when they draw up chairs, eat nuts and drink tea.

My youth was spent showing of my dads swords to friends and of the Chinese New Year parties he'd host with the club. The grunts and hard breaths I heard from the house, and the sound of the garage door closing on cold nights as they reclaimed warmth from their tea.

Now I stand here in the cold watching the snacks go stale, everything is still and untouched. These memories only bring me back sadness and dismay. Desperately trying to conjure up every emotion I felt across that period of my life and feeling helpless. My nose tingles and my eyes water as a different type of grief pours out of my face.

The virus has ended the club for now, though it was already beginning to dwindle. See my dad has a toxic personality, he's abrasive and brash once he's comfortable with you and it only gets worse as he ages. He doesn't have friends and the ones he had have died, the ones that should've been here with him in his 70's.

I wish things could go back to the way things were, the past is too permanent, give him back the twilight and the happiness, he's not happy where he is now so why can't he have his forever in his 20's or his 30's.

When we dig through old photo's of him he never participates, but I get it. Even now when I am experiencing the highs; I think, is this it? is this the crescendo which will echo through the rest of my life when I think about how it used to be?

And so I hate nostalgia, I hate how I indulge in it, how I revel in the moments, to be brought back to stasis, to void, to nothing.",19Oct2020,1
60,"The first SARS-COV-2 infection in my state was on March 3, 2020. Ever since I and my friends have been adamant about staying distant and wearing masks. But I absolutely hate every agonizing minute of it. I've told this story a million times, but lemme explain a little bit about myself: I am 29 and was raised in an emotionally neglectful household. My parents never spent time with me as they were always at work and were distant and cold when they were around. My older sister was always out partying, and I was too ""dull"" to make friends as a kid. This, along with having skipped several grades and having Asperger's Syndrome, made it very difficult to socialize as a kid.

I feel like I didn't get a childhood - no sleepovers or playdates, and I actually wasn't hugged until I was 17. So, in 2010, I graduated college with degrees in microeconomics, personal finance, and accounting, got a job at a local accounting firm, and in March 2011, purchased my own home. The following month, I chose to recreate my lost childhood by spending my free time eating childish foods like pop tarts, chicken nuggets, apple juice, and cotton candy, watching cartoons like Adventure Time, and later We Bare Bears and Steven Universe, jumping in bouncy houses and on hopper balls, and cuddling stuffies.

Between 2011 and 2013, I made a collection of friends who engage in these activities with me. One was raised in an ultra-orthodox Shia Muslim house and never got to spend time doing childish things because they were deemed ""sinful,"" one is a transgender woman who spent her childhood suppressing who they were, and the other is just a normal woman who wants to stop adulting every now and again. We are 29, 28, 28, and 26 respectively.

We haven't hugged in 7 months. We haven't snuggled watching cartoons in 7 months. We haven't shopped together at a mall impulsively buying any clothes we want in 7 months. I just wanna cuddle, hug, kiss, and give them raspberries again. I miss affection. We're already planning on what we'll do when this is all over (which Fauci is saying should be September 2021 or so.) We're thinking we'll get together after work on a Friday afternoon, have a bunch of hopper ball races and spend hours jumping in my bouncy house, have dinner at this nice Japanese restaurant near my house, come home, bake some brownies, and binge-watch every episode of Steven Universe, along with several seasons of We Bare Bears and Adventure Time together while stuffing our faces with chocolate brownies.

63,"Well i don't know how to begin with, will start with my introduction. Myself (18M) living in the city with my sister and grandparents (my mother's parents) and along with my mother's mother's mother. We are from a conservative family and so it might sound awkward to most of you because we are not like the western people. Well covid hasn't been eased in my city and still there are thousands of new cases rising every day. Needed to talk about my relationship with everyone and myself too.

Will start with my parents. They live in another city, both of them, my father is a doctor but still has to take medications regarding diabetes and pressure and needs regular insulin. I might not be so much into the medical science but when I knew that he started to take insulin it scared me and made me sad that he has to live far away from us in order to support our family. My mother needs to stay with him in there to take care of him and yeah me and my sister have been separated with my parents since two years. Well it's more than two years because before those two years my father used to live with a relative of our who used to feed my father and take care of him. But before two years they left and went to shift to another place making my father alone in that home and then my mother had to go full time with my father. And since covid hit, my parents have been stuck in there and us in here and haven't met for around 7 months and we don't see each other meeting for the next few weeks more. He is a Frontline worker and was soo soo scared about it because he is vulnerable to the virus and thank God he managed to take care of himself and all his patients. Now he goes to work but still this virus hasn't gone and its still not so safe and i am extremely worried about him the most. Well for my mother, i have always been a mother's boy since the day i was born, like i am still her little boy. She loves me alot and misses me alot and has cried a thousand times because we haven't seen each other for a long long time, before we used to meet like in every month but this time it has been different. We did make up our mind that we would meet this month anyhow but guess what many problems in our home and everywhere.

My grandparents have been living here since covid struck in our nation and since then we have been together. Before it was just me and my two sisters. And now it grew to 5 members, and this month a new member added who is my great grandmother. Well she's a 100 y/o and she had her own home with her sons and grandchildren but in her home covid hit and then she had been shifted to our place. And she was supposed to go a few weeks ago but that didn't happen because on her home, it's still dangerous and i still am alot disappointed with my uncles because of their irresponsible behavior which made everyone suffer, they don't get to see their mother and as she's here my parents can't come to their own home. And the thing that infuriated me alot was one of my uncles directly said no to my mother when she was telling she was coming back in our home. Who does say that? Who disagrees someone to come to their own home? I cried and shattered and was in anger and confessed them all to my parents because of my uncle's behavior and still i have that dislike to that home because of their irrelevant things. This is the first reason why my mother and father can't come to visit us and the next one is that our city has been a Hotspot for covid and then it's scary for my father specially to come here in the city iam living.

I'll talk about my grandparent now, my grandfather is a bit dumb not in the sense he can't speak but he is kind of dumb xD so i don't talk to him, even if i try to talk to him beside the casual talks he doesn't give enough attention and i have done my trying. But my grandmother she's active even in this stage where she's 70 and serves her mother and all of us. We often help her in the kitchen stuffs but she is tired of how uncooperative her mother, husband and her siblings (my uncle and aunts) are. And she is tired of everything and everyone, and my mother told me care for her and make her laugh because i am the joker of this home, make jokes, banter and do stupid things enough to make fun and make everyone laugh. And i am proud of this because atleast i am capable of handling a few chores and the mentality of this home and turn it into something funny. I feel sad for my grandmother because she doesn't get enough credit by her siblings on what she has been doing till date and how hard she has been trying and it makes me sad as i can't do anything and fight for her because they'll all ignore me and my thoughts but i try to make her laugh and do her jobs to make her feel comfortable.

Now will talk about my relationship with my girlfriend. We have been in this relationship for 10 months now but only dated for 2 as again the same reason covid hit and then she went back to her home town and iam here in my city. Well for the past two months things have been pretty messy and have had lots of fights but we haven't broke up yet. It used to be due to my expectations, i am generally a very high libido guy and she's a LL, before she used to send her pictures and videos of those stuffs but it completely got reduced for the past two months and i tried my best to make her feel better about it and made up mind and scenario but she didn't get excited enough which did hurt my expectations because before those months the same talks would have made her excited but now it's not like that. And we had so so so many arguments that we busted like a dozen times in those two months and made me sick of it. This was the first reason for our argument and the next one was stupid one. I know alot alot about her but she doesn't and when i asked her in anger why don't you ask me the same thing about this and that in order to lengthen our conversation when she lacks conversation skills and she replied that's for the future. Next one was i don't like her posting unnecessary stuffs on her social media, i don't like her making tiktok and was furious on why does she do that, because I told her that she can keep the things that makes her happy with herself without showing it to anyone. Well communication issues burst, i had many expectations from her but she said she can't be like how i want her to be and it sucks still. And i have another reason to worry about her because she's a heart patient, she has a hole in her heart and has to go for frequency checkups. And during her last checkup she was referred to a psychiatrist because of her high level of stress hormones. The psychiatrist told her she had symptoms of mild depression like not wanting to talk to anyone and like that and am sure i am the reason for it. Because i had alot of expectations and a few boundaries on her which she couldn't fulfill and was bursted on a night she told me to not have any expectations from me and then i was sad. Now i compliment her and give her enough space for her personal growth because i don't want to add a fuel to the fire i had set in her life. Me and my girlfriend are alot alot different. Iloveher but still loving only doesn't strengthen a relationship. Well she set up a boundaries on me and i did everything she had asked me to do, EVERYTHING but still when i had a few expectations from her, she got mad. Well many things to worry and make me sad but there's still another one, her past relationship, well being this far and not meeting for months now has made me sick of everything she has faced because of her past relationship and her ex who was abusive when she was broke up with him and she even cut her self once due to that and still i take it as it's on me everytime and blame myself for everything. Like her past life it just is something that makes me so soooo sad i can't take it and then i cry alone. But I don't talk it with her because she'll feel extremely sad.

Now would talk about my sister, she's 20 and is currently on antidepressants, actually it's a polar disorder and have to take care of her too because she can burst out on anything and any time and am extremely fearful she will do something unexpected making us all sad. Ilove everyone, every people and shit it hurts to be in this position, a joker outside of my room, a crying maniac in the dark nights, hunger for the future but still worrying about my parents health, and then need to be there for my girlfriend too. Well it's hard to be here but still will manage it all out and feel damn good sharing all of these things with all of you beautiful people. 

Well am currently waiting for my final examinations which has no any notice and routine, ambitious and many plans, shared with my girlfriend and my sisters and parents, because i want to make them happy and feel proud of having me but still there's time and am very positive about everything and grateful for the things i get, good food cooked by my grandmother, security felt by my sisters, care from my parents and love from my girlfriend but still it's all on my own and want to conclude it now.",19Oct2020,1
64,My life is a fucking mess and it just shouldn’t be I’m only 17. I have my senior project to do my grade are slipping due to the bullshit online set up. My dad is an asshole. Yesterday I had a good day I had work but it was an easy shift I thought for once I wasn’t gonna hate my day but I came home to see my parents and my dog gone because my dumbass step mom let him run into the street so know he’s at the hospital so I can’t visit him because of COVID restrictions and idk what to do.,19Oct2020,1
65,"Now I don’t even want to be touched, I have needs and all but the idea of letting someone touch me without those hands being the only that ever touch me again is cringe worthy. 5 years single and it’s feeling like it’s going to be forever",19Oct2020,1
66,"Here's an incomplete list of what he's done.

1. He takes advantage of people who are protesting for BLM, and uses his skin color and homelessness to get stuff out of them, including a place to stay and weed money.

2. He knowingly committed statutory rape with two 15 year old girls, and plays the victim by crying about how their friends want him ""dead"", and how he can't go back to that part of town, and how ""sorry"" he is despite not turning himself in.

3. He criticizes everyone else for their life choices that mostly don't affect him at all, and the moment you rightfully fire back, he starts yelling and throwing tantrums to intimidate you.

4. He will emotionally and financially abuse people, then when you try to cut him off, he throws tantrums and causes a scene until you give in.

D, if you see this, you know who it is, and you need serious help.",19Oct2020,1
70,"As someone who wants to be sensitive and inclusive, I also want to know the reasons why I am avoiding certain words and phrases. I want to understand why it might be offensive so I can help others understand. Is it because it makes it sound criminal?   

Also, if you are someone who attempted suicide or knows someone who has, does this phrase offend you? Why or why not?",19Oct2020,1
71,"The stadium was full, the brass was pumping and the song was called “gimme that world”. It was sung by a group that had backing vocals with a sound that had the same kinda style as the way John Oats backed Hall and Oats back in the day. The lead singer had a more youthful voice than frank Sinatra and he was the show. The music had the intensity and pace of “livin la vita loca” especially with the brass power that is in the bridge of the song. Paul Schaffer’s band that played on David Letterman could cover this backing track 100%. The closest style of the vocal and music backing vox was in the dynamic of the might might boss tones. 

I’m coming out of my sleepy state and forgetting lots as I awake but I’m glad I got the post off to you all. 

I’m thinking it’s dumb now but I’m pressing post now just cause fuck that was a great dream.",19Oct2020,1
