0,"I never tell this story. It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life. Not to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.

I am a 22 year old geek.

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude.

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know.

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake.

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it.

""Beautiful, simply beautiful.""

It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent.

She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera. And directly taking photos - OF ME!!!

I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds.

Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery.

I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me.

""You can't take those pictures!""

She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit.""

I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!""

She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here.""

That made me blush beat red.

She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting.""

As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger.

I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze.

She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability.""

I said ""I'm no model for a painting.""

She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off.""

I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree.

She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air.""

She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress.

""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you.""

My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!""

She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name.

""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months.""

Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes.""

She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold.""

As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos.

A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was.

A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My small penis and balls prominently displayed right in front.

With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. It was sold for $5,600.

And it is about to hang in a 60 year old woman's home in her living room, forever.

When I think about going out and talking to people and even going outside by myself gets me anxious and I don’t do it. The problem is when I get older I want to be someone who help people with those kind of things like social anxiety, anxiety in general and depression, but I don’t see how I am going to do that with my extreme fear of it now. Also it is hard for me to speak loud and I talk weird so people sometimes don’t understand me so I don’t talk. I thought of starting a YouTube channel and telling people about social anxiety and depression and I also wanted to document my journey to overcoming social anxiety and make my life better.

8,"We are in a difficult situation. They call it a “once in a century event” which may be true for society as a whole - but it is not true for our own personal lives.

I want you to really embrace what is happening around you, remember what it is like to have to wear a mask, not able to see friends, perhaps economically struggle. Accept what is going around you. This is a challenge that has been bestowed upon us (whether it is someone else’s fault, a government, a country, our partner) it is your responsibility on how you manage it. 

How you manage it emotionally, economically, physiologically, all aspects. This may sound like a lot of pressure - it would be so much easier to blame everyone else for this, for everything that is happening in our lives. 

It is not to say that we are not all connected, and there is outside influence - but at the end of the day YOU control how you respond; Act don’t react. 

Let this feeling, this pain of the current situation serve as a weapon for the future. Let it be a reminder to make better economic decisions, to appreciate, to complain less, to love more and be kind - let this be the turning point in your life.

10,"My (19f) friend (19f) has a bad home life. So when I found out I was house sitting for a week and had space to take her in, I invited her. I knew that she would be spending the week prior in close contact with another family because she doesn't like to be home, and because I trusted all of them, it was fine.

I saw her on 7/26. I found out on 7/29 that three members of the family she stayed with the week prior were COVID positive. We did not test until 7/30 because all sites were closed by the time we found out.

We tested 7/30 and found out yesterday that we were both negative. She claims she is asymptomatic, meanwhile I have had ear pain, mild sore throat, maybe sinus and chest pressure. To be honest, not sure which parts I'm overthinking and which are real. The ear pain is not something I can manifest though. I can still taste and smell and I have no fever. I have no underlying conditions.

What are the odds that she would be an asymptomatic carrier with a false negative? I feel like they're low. And I know I'm kind of freaking myself out. I took a spit test today for school and will find out the results in three days.

I am trying so hard not to freak out, but there is so much we don't know. I feel stupid because I had been so careful, and the one time I break a quarantine I had kept since March, when I didn't think I was even breaking a circle of trust, I could have a disease that will kill me or affect me for the rest of my life. And at this point, because I have gone back home, I am doing my best to distance from my father but we live in a trailer and it's not easy to stay far apart and stay clean all the time. I feel doomed. Someone help me.",04Aug2020,1
11,"Yesterday, a girl and I said goodbye to each other for a while. We were becoming close friends and I caught feelings pretty early on. I ruined it, I sabotaged it, I smothered her. And then I had to walk away for both of us. I bided my time for months. And when I showed a crack, she asked me to explain what I was feeling and I did. 

I’m moving to her country. Then I told her thinking it would be a good idea. Stupid as fuck right? And I’d be lying if I didn’t say a good part of the motivation was to try something with her. Why would I do that? How can I fall in love with someone I never met irl. When I told her she basically shut down. She couldn’t understand how someone can love you or feel this from so far away.  At least I managed to never say I love you in conversation but damnit why is that the best I can manage. 

I could have salvaged the friendship at this point if I let it rest but my anxiety wouldn’t let me stop telling her more. It’s not even like I had an inkling she felt something for me back. I went all gas no brakes even with the warning signs like an idiot. 

I really liked her. She was unique. And not 1 in 7 billion, perse. I held on to some realism. And it’s not like I didn’t try to prove she wasn’t special. So I slept around to get my mind off her before I told her how I felt and I hated it. I was depressed, miserable when talking to other girls. But I felt like I had to at least try so she would be convinced I wasn’t bullshitting. 

I’ve always been the type of guy to be interested in getting to know someone on an emotional level. I feel too much. I keep a girl in my thoughts, trying to understand how they feel. And maybe I’m selfish? Maybe I really don’t understand. 

I write letters, send gifts, tell people what I appreciate about them. Tell them I’m thinking about them. Tell them what makes them special. Have long conversations about dreams and the future, tell them special things. And it doesn’t work. I’m the only one who ever falls in love and then I burn the friendship down. 

But in the end I don’t really understand the situation. I convince myself that they might be interested in the same movie romance crap that I am. And every time this goes down in flames. 

This happened before, about 10 years ago. I was traumatized and left college. I thought I had finally gotten better, more realistic. Maybe something is wrong with me. 

I’m feeling embarrassed that I did this again more than anything. And extremely guilty for doing this to a friend who wasn’t interested, who told me not to be before I started this train wreck. Before I left I sent her letters I hadn’t sent yet and there’s some hard hitting emotional, romance novel level declaration shit in there. Maybe she feels distraught. And I caused her to have to reject me. 

I thought I would write out my thoughts before I begin an earnest effort to completely change who I am and maybe try and kill this side of me forever. I can see myself trying to do some redpill or similar stuff to do so. Wondering if there’s anyone out there that’s struggled as hard as I have with this. 

I’m just feeling numb, and like a bit of an idiot. I need to do things a different way. Maybe close off a bit. Because I only have two ways of doing things. Being a flood of romance or being completely shut off. I can’t open up just a little. Maybe I have to do this.",04Aug2020,1

And anyone who is like ""but he is a human too"" yeah and so was the poor person he raped, he should get the consequences from it.

    Despite looking all over the internet, i've yet to find any good awnsers. Perhaps I just suck at wording things? Who knows, i'll get on with it.
   Here's some history about me, when I was a kid I was very caring and empathetic but when I was around 13 I developed harm ocd. I was so scared of going insane and hurting people because of the bad thoughts I had. The amount of anxiety I felt was horrible! But one day.. I guess like a switch flipped in my brain? I remember the exact day, I felt what I beleive very well to be depression. I felt numb, barely talked, felt very exhausted and I didn't want to do anything. Now instead of worrying about going insane, I feel like i've already lost the battle and it's felt that way for maybe 4 years now. This is all complicated to explain but now I feel like I don't value the lives of others anymore. I'll try to tug at my heart strings by imagining scenarios where someone gets hurt so I can understand again or just sorta argue with myself but.. yeah..It doesn't work. It's just a cycle of rumination I guess? This ruminating just makes me depressed knowing that I'm a heartless bastard cause I can't find a reason to care again yet it's very hard to stop cause I feel like I have to. I know i'm probably really fucked in the head but you know what? I want to fix this. Any thoughts or advice on this would be very much appreciated. I want to know How I became so heartless, Why I lack compassion these days, if the ocd still therei n some way and.. how can I help fix this?

20,"I am entering my second year of college planning to study electrical engineering, but that last part may change depending on how this semester goes. 

I have grown more and more interested in mathematics as my first year went by, taking calculus 2 in the fall and then calculus 3 and linear algebra in the spring. This summer, I aced my last required math class, differential equations. Expecting to have my interest stifled from these courses, they completely shocked me by making me even more fascinated in the subject. 

After some quick research on the university’s catalog, I learned that I could go for an accelerated program that essentially allows me to study the math courses I want to take and leads to a masters program! But for it to work out, I’d need to take two more required math courses and pass them with at least a B.

So for this coming semester, I’ll be taking two courses required for my EE degree and the two required courses for the mathematics option. I’ll be seeing if I am changing majors or not this semester based on how the semester goes grade-wise and it is both thrilling and nerve-racking. 

I found the textbook for one of my math courses last week and I’ve read through the first couple hundred pages and completed all of the exercises before the syllabus has been posted, and I don’t consider myself a reader. This is how ecstatic I am about this. 

I don’t really know how to handle this level of excitement, so I’m just posting on here to sort of vent and articulate it.",04Aug2020,1

How could I find him to talk to him (preferably online)?
_____________________________________________________________________________________

There’s a couple people from school who I’ll see in the hallways or who I’ll have classes who I’d really like to get to know. The things is, I have social anxiety and struggle to approach people in real life. Through texting wouldn’t be as hard. There’s one person in particular who comes to mind. Recently, I’ve noticed that I’ve been thinking about him more than I do, well, anyone else from school except for my friends.  

I haven’t said a word to him. He probably doesn’t even know I exist. The closest I’ve ever gotten to him is sitting at the same table at lunch on the first day of school. I didn’t pay too much attention to him then, but now (or at least when I was still in school... thanks coronavirus) he catches my eye in the hallways. I know he’s friends or at least was friends with a close friend of mines sister. I’ve never had a class with him. I think he’s a year above me (I’m going to be a sophomore— he’ll be a junior). I’d like to talk to him but I don’t know how. I was thinking about asking this close friend but it may sound weird. 

I have the feeling that I really, really want to be friends with him or get to know him, but I don’t know if it’s more than that. I’ve never had a crush before and I don’t know if I’m starting to crush or not. I’ve actually worried about it (never having a crush) a lot during these past couple months (thanks quarantine mental health). I think I’m demisexual (must get to know someone and develop a connection with them before feeling romantic/sexual attraction towards them), but it’s probably too early to tell. Anyways, my heart doesn’t flutter or anything, but I feel a comfort wash over me and I start to daydream a bit. It’s hard to see myself dating anyone right now, but I can see myself with him more than I can everyone else. 

I mean, I’ve thought about a future partner and he seems to have a lot of the same qualities. We have (some of) the same views (I know he’s a part of the LGBTQ+ and straight alliance club (which, once again, is rare around here)— no he’s not gay), he’s intelligent, he’s a sweetheart, he’s funny, we have similar music taste, he seems to respect women as human beings and not objects (which is rare for my school), and more. He’s pretty cute too. Honestly he’s shares a lot of the same qualities physically with my future “dream partners”, too. The thing is, one of his most attractive qualities will be my downfall. He adores and respects his girlfriend so, so much. He talks about her all the time (I could tell when we sat at lunch together) and in a very respectful way. Normally I’m annoyed by this but it was so genuine that I couldn’t even get mad. I mean, his girlfriend is pretty cool too. I’d like to get to know her too as we seem pretty similar but, if I’d have to get to know one, I’d like to know him.

I think I’d be okay with just staying friends because he just seems like a fun guy to be around and someone I’d like in my life. Anyways, sorry, I know you didn’t ask for my life story, but maybe someone’s dealing with something similar...?",04Aug2020,1
25,"Short title, but long description.  Firstly it's important to differentiate between gay and bisexual people.  The ones who identify as gay do not have any sexual relationships with the opposite sex. The ones who identify as bisexual have relations with both sexes. They are separate letters in The Acronym™, and should be looked at differently.

Gay people have made the conscious choice to enter relationships only with the opposite sex. There is no purpose for this union, as they're unable to have children. It is only for superficial and hate-driven reasons. They have decided that ALL members of the opposite sex are incapable being in a relationship with them. This is truly a hateful stance, and is emboldened by other members of the hate group who call themselves gay.

Also, the idea that people are 'born gay' is ridiculous. Babies are born without any sexual preference. It is experiences growing up that determine sexuality.",04Aug2020,1

27,"I feel like this belief, more than anything, is hindering my growth significantly. I resist taking responsibility for myself largely because I feel like I couldn't have done anything differently and can't control anything in the future. 

There are two parts to this. The first is the subjective ""feeling"" that I am not in control. Like I want to do something but I won't/can't do it. Or I'm doing something destructive and stupid and from the outside of myself can hear the other part of myself thinking you should not being doing this, there is nothing to gain from this, stop doing this, and the other part me just says ""oh well! can't stop."" 

Then there is the more philosophical problem of pre-determinism. I've always kind of intuitively prescribed to this, even when I was a really young child. I guess I was a materialist, still am, and just couldn't understand how it would be possible for things to be different than they are. I don't know if this kind of fatalism is merely a defense mechanism (an excuse for all of my shortcomings), or a resistance to change, or if it really does stems, like I am telling myself it does, from  an inability to comprehend a logically sound alternative to pre-determinism (I'm not a philosophy major or anything, this is just my intuitive belief, so please if you have a counterargument, do share).",04Aug2020,1
28,"People care about stuff most of the time, right? Most people I know care about being 'normal.' I think I'm a normal person. I'm a bit of a narcissist and love talking about myself and my plans, but I'm normalish besides that.

I feel like the only thing I SHOULD be talking about is poverty. I don't do anything about it. I don't volunteer for the homeless, I don't sponsor third world kids, and I don't even give beggars a dollar. I've become callous and I hate it. The beggars I interacted with are a-holes. Maybe it's too small a sample size. It's weird having so little empathy for people I don't know. Is that normal? Is it normal to watch a horrible traffic accident happen and watch with detached awareness? I mean duh, you still provide first aid and stuff because I'm not a friggin monster, but I don't care about their life. They could bleed to death and I'd only feel bad because I was embarrassed of being a bad life saver. I think I might be a psychopath, but I don't want to be. Normal people shouldn't be psychopaths. 

I should care, but I don't. There are horrible, terrible, disgusting things happening to 10,000 kids at this very moment, but I ain't looking for trouble. I'm a coward. Everyone should want to be a cop and find horrible people. Everyone should be seeking to enforce justice. But I'm a fat white guy going to college and enjoying AC. 

Apparently, I don't care enough to try to work in social services. I should care about people more, but I'm too busy studying anatomy and math.

33,"Earlier today I walked into a soap store. The woman inside seemed to be incredibly sweet and informative. We talked about soaps, body scrubs, etc. I told her I struggle with severe eczema on my legs. I even went as far to tell her I go to the dermatologist regularly and have been putting a steroid cream all over my legs. She proceeded to sell and plead that her products in store are designed for eczema and psoriasis. I was beyond excited and even tipped her 30$ because I thought she cared (After swiping my card it asked for a tip). I head home and try out the scrub. Instantly my legs started burning like crazy. I get out of the shower and my legs are completely red and itchy. This is why I genuinely do not like people. She completely used my “skin disease” as a way to make money. I searched this product online only to find no correlation to helping eczema nor psoriasis. Why are there people out there that are terrible human beings. In my eyes, I have not met a truly kind person. I give too much trust in people only to be fucked over. Am I overreacting in this situation?",04Aug2020,1

35,"Haha, I know this sounds really stupid. Not sure if it even fits here. 

My neighbor next door is big into one of my hobbies, and he offered me a tool that he otherwise was going to sell. I wrote down his cell number that day as we shot the breeze, but when I tried texting him (as he instructed me it was his cell), I got an error message, even for other numbers that looked similar to the horrible scribbles I'd written down.

This was probably 3 weeks ago at this point, and he was trying to have it gone by the end of last month.

I kinda sneakily dropped an index card into his mailbox with my cell on it a couple nights ago (bad move? is this even legal??) but haven't heard from him and basically haven't seen him or his family since the day I ran into him, even though their cars are there. (Vacation maybe? But sometimes the cars aren't there..)

No idea what to do here within the bounds of legal and good etiquette. Also not sure if I just need a boost of confidence, or if there are other ways to just \*get\* his correct number, or some other ideas and solutions in general. I hate the idea that he may think I'm ignoring him when obviously I \*want\* the tool, and of course he \*wants\* to get rid of it to make room... just not sure how to go about it.

37,"I wanted to save up enough money for my first year’s tuition at university. I left high school early  to community college, but I was aiming to have no debt with my undergrad and part of that was to have enough money to cover my first year after I transfer. I’ve been slowly inching my way to my goal for years now and I pay for my car insurance (which is extremely expensive), classes, and gas so it’s been a long process. 

However, recently I decided to invest in stocks and I took a risk to give my dad almost all my savings to invest since I can’t do it myself yet (I intent to make my own account and transfer the money as soon as I can do it). It paid off and I made a lot of money. I’m also still going to work during the pandemic, so I put my paycheck aside for savings/needs and use my tips for wants. 

I haven’t shared my goal with many people because I wanted to keep it private so it doesn’t get jinxed (I’m superstitious that way). And now I feel bad about telling anyone that I’ve reached my goal because the pandemic has screwed over a lot of people financially and I don’t want them to feel horrible over my progress. I decided to post it on here instead. 

To anyone who is struggling financially, I hope you aren’t negatively affected by this and even though things are difficult now, I wish you the best and believe in you! And thank you to anyone who made it to the end of this long post!

They would rather avert their eyes to the fact that we are ALL just animals, and that therefore humans don't have any rights over any other animals. But we continue to treat animals like they are subservient. And we continue to treat human lives as if they are precious. Why? Why do humans deserve special treatment? All causes can be traced back to the big bang. there are NO causes in the macroscopic world that are truly random. None. And you believe that somehow you deserve to be praised for being intelligent?

42,"The Von Restorff effect, also known as the “isolation effect” states  that when presented with a group of similar objects, the one that  differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered. According to this  theory, different doesn’t necessarily mean better but rather just more  memorable than others. [(Original Post)](https://models.substack.com/p/von-restorff-effect-being-different)

A lot of companies across the board use this effect to their advantage both in terms of brand cosmetics and product design. 

Modern day internet companies are not the only ones who use these  tactics, they have been part of nature and business for a long time.  Apple as a brand stood out because it didn't have the cold, complicated  imagery created by other computer companies at the time – with names  such as IBM, Digital Equipment and Cincom. 

&gt;Apple is  relatable because you are immediately driven to an image of a fruit  which is familiar to the prospective customer yet distinctive in the  industry it operates in.

However, had the other computer companies also had fruit names at the time, Apple would not have had this advantage. 

The  Von Restorff Effect plays an important role in other aspects of our  professional life like networking where you need more than a fancy suit  to make a lasting impression. People come up with all sorts of things to  stand out ranging from wearing a distinctive cologne to outright faking  an accent and what’s worse, most of us do it without even realising it.

To avoid being lead on by the Von Restorff Effect, you can practice the following:

1. Deliberately delay impulsive decisions &amp; wait for it to cool off
2. Discuss your options with someone else with no aesthetic context
3. Do the math behind a deal before making up your mind

While  it feels bad to have the Von Restorff Effect being played on you, it  can be used as an asset to gain an edge in your business or personal  life. Here are a few tips:

1. The idea is to nudge the  user/audience not push them, so keep it subtle. Soft selling is the key,  hard sell will be an overkill here.
2. Use colors to your advantage by studying the different triggers caused by different colors ([Colors &amp; Emotions](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/)).  For example, warm colors often evoke feelings of optimism, energy and  happiness hence you can use those for buttons or slides.
3. Use  the poly method where you stand out because you are associated with 2  or more things rather than just one. For example, a bear at a circus  riding a bicycle will be forgotten in a day, but a bear that rides a  bicycle while smoking a cigar &amp; balancing a ball on its nose at the  same time will be remembered for much longer. 

Hope this  post helps you take advantage of this effect and thrive in your  business or personal life. If you like this piece, let me know in the  comments. ",04Aug2020,1

48,"Just things that are happening in my life. I'm not doing so well. Long post.

(20 F) I haven't spoken to my friend since late May, and we last interacted on May 28. Not because we fought, just because I was busy with work and she probably was too. I reached out to her via text, discord, phone call, Instagram message, Tumblr, tik tok, and she seems to have just disappeared on all but discord. I tried to catch her on discord when she was online, and over the several times I've messaged her (starting on June 23) she had not responded. I tried calling when she was online and she either ignored, went offline, or actually hung up. I just miss my friend. I don't know what I did and I'm so sad that she doesn't want to talk. I know she must be going through something on her own, I just wish there was some way to know she's alright. I messaged a mutual friend of ours, but she hasn't made any contact either, and I don't know whether to worry more or less at that.

I have a pet rabbit who's about 10 years old. Lately, he's lost the use of his back legs and just seems to struggle to move or even get up. He can't keep his legs clean and I have to wash him, but I don't think he can control his bladder anymore, and he just soils himself again as soon as I dry him off. His quality of life at this point is really low, and even though we feed him the best leafy greens from our field and garden, I feel like he's in pain. I probably can't afford treatment for him, and he's so old I don't know if it would do him any good anyway. I want to at least get him assessed, and discuss with a vet whether or not to put him down. My dad wants to keep him around because his mind is still there, but my poor bun just shouldn't have to live like this. My dad swears that he'll keep him clean, but I just don't have the heart to keep doing this. I love my bun so much, but in reality, I don't have the final say in what we do with him.

I worked very hard to get myself happy again. I was sexually assaulted in 2018 during my first semester in college, then I spiraled so far down in my second and third that I landed in the psych ward 3 times. I've been free of self-harm for over a year, and I don't have any wish to do that again. I left college over a year ago to work a grocery store job and get my license, but the people in my life take everything at a snail's pace. I bought a used car in April 2019 and it wasn't fixed until May 2020. Even pre-pandemic I was stuck at home during my days off, unable to even practice driving because none of my family wanted to chaperone me and go anywhere (except to my job 10 minutes away). I live in the middle of a field near no one I know, and there's nowhere to walk to that isn't 2 hours away. I'm one parallel parking lesson away from a driver test, but my car has a check engine light that my dad put off fixing because the yard sale he wanted to do was more important. I left my grocery store job for a different one, and they hired me and had me fill out all the tax forms, but I haven't heard a call about orientation in three weeks.

I am stuck. I can't control the people in my life, I can't control the world, but I can control me. What can I do to stop being so sad about everything? I feel the familiar pain and tightness in my chest that I used to know, but nothing is helping. I read my books and watch old videos that made me happy, I changed my diet (16lbs down since March and it's a good thing) and get out of bed, I keep myself clean and I even managed to fold and put away all my clothes. But I am so sad. I miss my friend, my rabbit is injured, I'm trying to be adaptable, but I just have no one on my side. Even my one outing every two weeks to go grocery shopping is stressful and unpleasant because my family members refuse to properly wear masks if at all, and I can't go where I want to because I have to accommodate them. I will do anything in this world to just survive at this point, wearing a mask is nowhere near a violation on my body when I've been assaulted and shoved in an ambulance on three separate occasions against my will. I try to convey to my family that we can live normally again if we all work together, but they don't care. It wouldn't be so bad if they at minimum worked with me. I feel like I have no one to talk to because the world is hurting right now. I struggle all the time with whether or not my problems even matter at all, because of course they don't compare to the greater issues in the world, but I'm still really miserable.

TL;DR: If anyone has some words of encouragement to keep moving forward, suggestions on how to contact a friend who is ignoring them, rabbit health tips, or parallel parking tips, I need some of that.

49,"They just couldn’t help it. This usually  happens with kids who are younger than 10 years old. They really get over energetic. Sometimes they will hurt themselves and they will all have a period when they start beating me.

Parents of the kids are annoyed but not visibly.

I think I have that chaotic energy thing going on. And I don’t  know where to draw the line. I like to entertain people but I don’t  know how to calm people down.

It is very unusual from an outside perspective.

Let me tell you a story related to this. So I went to pickup some stuff that my brother sent from abroad. The person I am picking  up this from is my brothers friends sister in law.

So, I went there and the lady ask me to sit down and while she goes to the kitchen to get some tea. Her son who is a child can walk but hasn’t  learned to talk yet comes over. He brings me a ball. Now, at first I smile and check the ball and hand over to him. Then he gets another ball.

Then I don’t  know how it eventually  happened some minutes later I am like all in catching and throwing balls and playing with the kid. The little guy is very happy. And I am all over the floor and playing with him.

Now her mum comes in. I haven’t  looked at her but I think she was confused. Like a guy in his mid 20s she barely knows is sitting on the floor while her son is going mad and running around. 

I felt very ashamed and composed myself and quickly tried to leave. Then the little guy starts to wail while pulling my shirt. I more or less forcefully leave.

This is not a single event. It happens everytime. Every time. Every kid who is under the age of 10 gets super and wildly excited within minutes of meeting me, then starts to cry or try beat me when I try to calm them down or leave.

Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party was very clearly socialist-aligned and ""left-winged"" organization at the time of their founding in 1918; at that time, Hitler spoke, wrote about and embraced were centered around pro-universal health care, pro-free college education, and in favor of government-funded abortions. Hitler and the Nazis were socialists, for the simple reasons that they were staunchly anti-capitalist and believed that the means of production in their society should be controlled by a centralized state power. That is very clear from their writings, their words and their actions. Done and done. 

* That is right-wing extremist philosophy? I don’t think so
* Now one could argue that over time the specific manifestation of Nazi-socialism did drift away from what is today viewed as classical socialism and toward a nationalistic socialism and later during the war, it then morphed further and eventually into a fascist-dictatorship. As socialism always does as evidenced by Germany's Hitler, the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin, China's Mao Zedong, Cuba's Fidel Castro, Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro.

I don't really remember anything leading up to going to the hospital.

Everything checked out okay except a slightly low phosphorus level and a weird heart rhythm [not a heart attack] and I had bit the sides of my tongue off.

Everything has just been kind of a blur of nothing. Like, I have little memory of anything after the seizure. Sometimes I'll walk into a room and know where I am but also not recognise it. No one seems to want to acknowledge it beyond a regular seizure of mine. I'm scared to eat and leave my apartment in case it happens again. But I've been trying to keep myself occupied as best I can, which has been kind of difficult.

Anyways I got incredibly drunk, and she had a bit to drink but not as much as I did.

I’ve been trying to find anything on google that best describes what I’ve been experiencing but can’t find anything remotely helpful. In part because it’s pretty tricky to explain.

Right off the bat I do not believe that I have an STD, testicular cancer, or testicular torsion. The only thing that sounded potentially similar was a retracting testicle. However, I’m not having any issues with my testicle attempting to pull up into my body, rather my left testicle is being pulled backwards into my gooch/bulb area. When relaxed, it’s slightly there but I hardly even notice. But obviously when I’m slapping the hand or having sex is when the issue comes into play. This probably started around a year ago, but was nothing concerning until about a month-month and a half ago. At this point, when erect, my left ball is almost attached to the bulb area and is impossible to move. No pain is involved but has reached a point where it is pretty uncomfortable. Without going into too much detail, during a climax it feels like my left testicle isn’t even working anymore and just strangely spasms locked in place while the right does all the work. For all intents and purposes, it feels dead. But at this point sex isn’t even pleasurable having to endure a strange discomfort at the end of it, but psychologically knowing the situation in the sack very likely doesn’t help much in that situation.

I felt like we were so comfortable with each other, we always shared everything with one another, if we were having a bad day, etc. It was a very loving and compassionate friendship and we always uplifted each other and weren’t afraid to talk about anything. 

Since quarantine began we went from talking almost every day to talking maybe once a week. Then we met twice more with another mutual friend and a bit later I got really depressed and basically didn’t talk to anyone for a couple of weeks, and when I felt better, D was the first one I wrote to. We are both struggling with anxiety and depression and I wasn’t mad at her or anything that she didn’t text me at the time. 

I asked her if she wants to meet up and she said she needs a break from social life (which didn’t seem odd or upset me, cause it wasn’t the first time she told me that). A week later I asked her again and she declined. I asked her if I did something wrong or said something that upset her but she told me it’s something personal. A week later I asked her yet again. She didn’t reply, but later that day she posted on her Instagram story that she was out with friends. 

So I immediately wrote her “you’re telling me it’s nothing to do with me but you ghost me and go out with other people” to which she didn’t reply. I asked her why doesn’t she reply and she told me she doesn’t know what to say.

So we had a short back and forth conversation and she basically told me she misses me but she’s scared and she doesn’t know why or what to do. I asked her if she wants to talk on the phone/meet up or anything she will feel comfortable with, but she said she doesn’t know. I told her I miss her and I love her and how much she is important to me but she didn’t reply back after that. 

My only guess for why she is afraid is maybe she felt like I was deliberately trying to distance myself from her (which is not true) and she was scared I will do it again and hurt her.

The next day I wrote her again (even thought I don’t know the real reason why she’s afraid) that I’m sorry for disappearing and that I was depressed but couldn’t wait to meet her again after I was going to feel better. And I asked her to please not leave me hanging. 

She didn’t reply, and now I’m here. I tossed in my bed thinking about her till 5AM and couldn’t fall asleep, and I just feel so lost and empty. She was that one friend I thought that no matter what happened, she’s not gonna leave me like that. And even if she was gonna cut off contact, she would do it in a much more respectful way that wouldn’t hurt me this way, especially since she knows my history. 

So D is my last “real” friend. I lost all my friends this year and I don’t know what to do. Should I write her something else? What should I do? I feel like I’m ruining everything without even trying.",04Aug2020,1

71,"My fiance is always giving me a hard time for using dollar store headphones when I go on a walk or to the gym. At home I have a very very high end pair of Sennheisers that I work with/audiophile out with, but I have had them for about 10 years and the foam is falling apart (easy to replace, but they work fine and never leave my room so I don't care).

For my birthday my fiance told me she was going to get me some bluetooth headphones, I assumed some airpods or something small like that to replace my daily drivers (lol), but she just video chat me from the store for me to help her pick them out, and the ones she's been looking at are full size over the ear, to replace my high end mastering headphones, rather than my budget EDC's. I felt terrible telling her that I would never use them, as she had just spent 45 minutes narrowing down to those two pairs, her phone died right after I saw the light leave her eyes, so now I have no idea if she is going to try to figure out what I wanted, go with the pair I told her not to, or come home empty handed. 

None of those options make me happy. I feel bad because she is trying, but on the other hand I have explained to her a few times why I still use the Sennheisers and they aren't worth replacing. 

This is like the third time that someone has tried to get me audio gear that I will never use, and I have to weigh telling them that it's not what I want, or letting them spend money on something I never use, just to save face.

I drank a lot of water yesterday will that help?

74,"Never allow fear of failure stop you from going all in on your vision and your goals because if you do, you will never take that bold step toward your dreams. You don't need to be afraid of failure because the good news is that you will fail but remember that failure is only sealed when you quit but if you keep pushing after experiencing some setbacks you will always get back up. Failure is also part of the process to success, if you can't handle failures or you are afraid of failing then you are not ready for success because failing without quitting is a stepping stone to an accomplishment. failure is a test we have to face and the only ways to overcome it is too stare it in the face without fear and never look back.

Maybe I was young back then. I hate conflicts and I just want to do what I love. I'm not craving for position or anything because I know that it will be a big burden for me. You just say that I don't have much **goal in life and just want to live a simple life.**

Then suddenly, it changed 2 years ago. I became permanent and gave many positions and designations. I was not ready back then but I just accept it just because well it's a permanent position. It gave me a lot of pressure and conflicts. I'm always in the constant of panic on whatever decision that I will make because there are now more people that is involved. 

Maybe the problem is I didn't accept it that everything started to change and I need to grow up.  But this past few months I  meditate and trying to embrace changes. It helps a lot, it started to clear my mind about how I decide and accepting that there's always a problem that will occur and just do your best in everything to solve it.

78,"When I was in grade 3 (I think I was around 10) I had an idea about how I could achieve flight on my own. I started to collect a ton of the school newspapers because I thought that if I could lay out all the papers and staple them together to create a giant piece of paper, I could then fold it into a massive paper airplane. My plan was then to take this huge paper airplane to some 2nd story stairs outside and try to jump off while clinging to the plane, hoping to be that cool kid who flew on a huge paper airplane outside. This luckily didn’t happen, as I was stapling all the newspapers together outside, a sudden gust of wind blew away most of all my newspapers, and my day was ruined. I sorta forgot about it shortly after, and I am just now realizing that I was pretty stupid and could have actually seriously injured myself had I gone through with my plan.

79,"So basically, I met up with some school friends and there was a girl there who I knew from school but we never actually spoke, anyways as the night went on it came to my attention that I was incredibly fond of her and she was my ideal type, I don’t think she was fond of me but she enjoyed my company. Anyways I got incredibly drunk, and she had a bit to drink but not as much as I did. I can’t remember how but we ended up cuddling up to each other and because I was drunk I started telling her that I was really into her, but I said nothing sexual and I also started talking about my mental health struggles and saying that I wanted to kill myself sometimes. I then asked her to kiss me on the cheek and she did and right after I asked if we can kiss on the lips, which she said no to, the I said “i won’t kill myself If you kiss me” she then leant in to kiss, but I expected it just to be a peck but it was a full on 10 second snog. When I woke up in the morning I sent her a huge message and apologised for the whole thing, she said the situation made her feel really uncomfortable, but she was actually cool about it she said she was was okay and forgave me, but I’m taking that with a pinch of salt. Idk if she’s telling the truth or she’s actually incredibly traumatised by the whole thing, she’s a really good looking girl but also she’s a really nice person and I still feel for her even now. This happened about 5 months ago and I still feel incredibly guilty about it, even if she forgave me I can’t forgive myself, I was talking so much shit that night and I really can’t understand why I said what I said. I wouldn’t have killed myself if she didn’t do it. Please let me know your thoughts on it and what I should do

Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.

Everything was running kind of smoothly, and I was starting to meet people (I’m on my late 20s, people are starting to build families and it’s not that easy to make friends anymore), but then COVID hit and it’s been almost 6 months now that I’m pretty much isolated regardless there’s not that many restrictions anymore. Since we’re still working from home I don’t have any personal contact with anyone apart from cashiers in the supermarket when I go to buy groceries. Since group activities are still restricted and despite I’ve been coping fine with the situation, this is starting to get frustrating and I feel kinda lonely. 

I thought about adopting a pet but pets are not allowed in the building, I tried dating apps and it seems those are not for me.

90,"I worked at community college where I used to go to school. I left this summer to do an internship. I do not attend this community college anymore, but I attend another university part time. When I got the news I wouldn’t be able to return to my job after my internship, I was really emotional. I was required to fill out a survey about my experience. In this survey, I made a bulleted list of unprofessional/inappropriate behavior by the faculty I worked with (who were teachers) including: 

- a married professor asking me if I wanted to go to lunch on my birthday, saying he would take me shopping afterwards
- a coworker calling me “miss sexypants” 
- a professor asking me if I was retarded after I stuttered in front of her 
- a professor telling me he wished he was my boyfriend 
- one of my professors who worked in this office repeatedly tried to initiate in an inappropriate relationship with me

The last point was the one that seriously bothers me because of the impact of my mental health that this caused. I had become seriously attached to this man only to find out that a) he had a girlfriend and b) he was talking to other girls the same way. He had asked me things like what time my mother comes home, if my bedroom was nice, made a comment about inviting him over etc, and I went with it because I really liked him and wanted his approval. This man would also go around the office calling me “his girl” so it’s not like it wasn’t obvious, and people definitely gossiped. He also gaslighted me when I confronted him about this and how it effected me.

HR just called me yesterday and I discussed with my former boss and decided not to answer any questions. It was mainly to keep my boss, who is one of my best friends, out of the situation because he felt like he’d get in trouble for not reporting these things (even when I asked him not to). This man has fed me more times than my own father and I can’t backstab him like that.

91,"I’ve had a lot of amazing internet friends in the past few years. I silently took pride in having them, but didn’t really tell my real life friends about them due to fear of judgement. 

I had about 4 I was really close to a few years back. One of them lived in the same country as I do, so we’ve met a couple times. The other three were from other continents. I’ve talked to them a lot and for a long time, but we gradually grew apart and eventually stopped talking. That’s the downside of internet friendships, I think. All the friends I’ve made online seem to slowly fade over time, whether after a year or just after a few months. It’s just not the same hanging out irl, and it’s so easy to run out of things to talk about. 

But I still liked making friends online, so I tried again this year. I’ve befriended 5, all from the opposite sex this time and with varying ages (the previous 4 were all female and around the same age as me). All from different countries too. And now they barely talk to me, after just a few months (except one of them who I talk to irregularly). 

And this makes me think... is it pointless to befriend people online? I would really love to, but they all just seem to fade very soon. I love talking to people (through text only though, bc of my anxiety), and I always try starting conversations and asking questions. But sometimes the energy just stops, and I don’t know why. (a bit TMI but 3 of those 5 asked to date me, but I unfortunately had to decline, and I think that was the start of the end)

If all online friendships are like this, I would rather not waste my time getting to know people only to throw it away sooner or later. Especially if they’re a million miles away, it seems very temporary and time-wasting, though they are for sure fun while it’s happening.

If you know who I am, you might know why this is a problem to me — yes, I have been suicidal for years, have some psychological disorders, mentally unstable, etc. I always considered myself as very stupid ugly man with no values, but looks like at least I was smart enough to start studying at university, and this is my first year. I'm trying to get bachelor's degree because I think getting the master or PhD of IT sounds like waste of time to me — I mean, come on, digital technologies change everytime so focusing on only one specific area with use of tonnes of money might not worth that much, and also we have the new technology which has potential possibilities of changing the computer systems but yet still in development. 

Finishing my first term was... Just okay, I guess. Lectures and tutorials were inly on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday afternoon and everything was going okay.

Girlfriend has issue with boyfriend's news feed having random pictures of women barely dressed/naked (r/gonewild). 
Boyfriend sees no problem with it... They are random people (women and men). Pictures are not taken for him personally. There are no interactions between the two (messages or comments). No saving or screenshots. He enjoys the female body, and appreciates the sexy nature of the photos. He can't deny that some of the females are attractive. Has no issues with the situation being flipped. Says if girlfriend wanted to send sexy pictures, he'd rather look at them, and would unsubscribe. Thinks she is the sexiest thing ever. 

Girlfriend says that it's disrespectful and that it's cheating. Says it's ok to find a celebrity attractive, because ""they're not people you can have interactions with"", and if they're not naked. Claims to have not found any other male attractive since being with boyfriend (4 years, 2 kids together (more planned)), that she don't look at people like that.

100,"This may be a bit long so please bear with me. Okay, so it was around 2 years ago that I was at one of the lowest points of my life. I really hated my job and I didn't know what I wanted to do with life. I can say that I was completely lost and realizing that at the time made me super depressed. 

I tried to eat the sadness away, but that just ended up with me gaining weight and becoming even more sad. I was in this vicious cycle that I thought I would never be able to escape from.

That's why today I'm super thankful for my girlfriend. If it weren't for her, I'm pretty sure it would have taken me much longer to get out of my pit of depression. It's possible that I might not have even been able to if she weren't there. 

So what is it that she did to make me wanna get my life back together? Simple. She was there for me.

She believed in me even when I didn't believe in myself. Yes, she was sad knowing that I became the shell of the man that I once was, but she did her best to hide it all while trying to encourage me to get back. I still hate myself for not realizing her pain sooner. If I could, I'd go back in time and whack myself.

What really opened my eyes was when a certain thing happened between me and her during a particular date. I won't go into any details because it's personal between me and her, but let's just say that I was supposed to do something, I wasn't able to do it, and I felt horrible afterwards.

Did she get mad or upset afterwards? No. She tried comforting me instead. She tried to hide her sadness, but that time it was really clear. That look on pained her face made me realize that I couldn't go on like that. That was when she became my motivation for working hard and getting my life back.

After nearly a year's worth of hard work, I can say that I've managed to become the man she first fell in love with again. Took awhile but it was worth it cause I can finally see her genuine smile again.

I made something that could help others find the motivation they need if they're having trouble doing what they want to or need to. I really hope it helps because I know how tough it can get (You don't have to click on it if you don't want to, I just hope the story helped someone.)

106,"So I'm not an international student but due to some personal reasons, I had to go to school while under someone else's care (homestay) in Canada. The first homestay was horrible. My guardian was a man around his 50's who lived with his daughter but not his wife. There also was another guy who was also doing homestay who was in his 20s (it's illegal for host families to host both an adult and a minor at the same time, but I didn't know that). The house was very unclean to the point where it was impossible to walk around barefoot. The food that he gave me was plain rice and ""soup"" which basically was a mixture of potatoes, msg, and water. The ""soup"" was basically inedible and I had to live off of eating plain rice and kimchi for dinner. No breakfast or lunch was provided, so I had to make my own. We got to eat pork once a week but it was mouldy and undercooked (he kept freezing and defrosting them). There were two bathrooms, one for women and one for men. However, I soon realized that the 50-year-old man was also using the girl's washroom. My homestay and I decided to have a chat, which ultimately ended up with him screaming at me and threatening to kick me out of the house. I immediately went to my room, shut the door, and cried. The homestay guy then came into my room without my permission (my door did not have a lock) and began yelling at me, threatening to call the cops on me. I was under my bedsheets during this time because I was so scared, but he tried to forcible pull the bedsheets away from me. I felt like I was having a panic attack during this time. This incident eventually made me leave and find another homestay.

I thought that this would be the end of my hardships but I was so wrong...

My second homestay was okay at first. However, as time went by, she began mentally abusing me. She called me fat (I was 160cm and 50kg at that time) and told me that my parents must have not educated me. Most of the time she did not talk to me. Her food was also very bad, but when I told her that I did not want to eat, she insulted my parents. She later on also screamed and threatened to kick me out of the house when I was crying in my room. She would also get mad at me for locking my room because apparently that meant that I did not ""trust"" her.

I now left the homestays because the 2019\~2020 school year ended, but I am still suffering from mental trauma. I developed many illnesses from the immense amounts of stress caused by the homestays, one of them being PVCs and elevated heartbeat (over 100bpm when resting). I can not stop thinking about what happened to me during those times. Life has deteriorated. I lost confidence, became depressed, got an ED, and sometimes get panic attacks.

Is there any way to make these people get the punishment they deserve? I took photos and recordings as evidence. Please let me know if there are any ways to punish them using the law. I am desperate to forget about the past, but I feel like that would be difficult without seeing them get what they deserve.

P.S. Both homestays cost $2000 per month. There were also many other incidents that I left out to make this post as short as possible.",04Aug2020,1
108,"I've always loved animal, especially cats.  Always had them growing up, my family currently has 3 that we adopted 2 years ago after the last of our 3 old cats died.  We got these kittens from a rescue group and got to know a woman who lives in our neighborhood who is part of the group.  She is very dedicated to helping cats.  She has a number of cats in her main living area which are hers for life, many of them with special needs that would have a hard time being adopted.  In her basement she has about 30 cats which she is fostering for adoption and/or in the process of TNR (Trap, Neuter, Release) for cats that are feral/can't be socialized.  Some are in larger cages and some have free roam of the basement and an outdoor screened in patio area.  I don't know her personal business/situation, she lives alone and has no kids, so this is a major part of her life.  I could never do this sort of thing now with my job and raising a family, right now all I can do is donate money.

But I really am interested in getting involved in this sort of thing once my kids are on their own and I'm done working.  My wife and I are already planning to move out of the big city to another state where we can get a larger house/property.  My (pipe) dream is to build or have a dedicated structure on my property but away from the main house, where I can foster and TNR cats.  Maybe a large shared area with some human and cat furniture, kitchen and bathroom of course.  Then a bunch of smaller rooms I can use to comfortably isolate cats that need extra medical or socializing help, or just don't get along with other cats, but not have to keep them in cages.  Maybe a screened in porch area as well the cats could have access to.  And a larger room with maybe a medical table and supplies.

There is a ton I would need to learn and of course I wouldn't do it alone, I would join a local rescue group and take their guidance.  But I see things as something that would be extremely fulfilling.  I would spend part of each day relaxing in this ""cat house"" and taking care of the cats.  I know that it is a big commitment and I would need some help especially if my wife and I want to travel etc.  I would have to have a service that I could hire to back me up, come feed the animals and clean if I'm not around.

And FOX NEWS is more biased than others as has been supported by numerous studies 

But the point is to read and watch several outlets, even FOX, which will help us identify liberal biases and also learn the other sides' thinking and vice versa so we can start coming to a compromise (which practically will always be uneven and dependent on who's elected by the mood of the majority)

Personally, I accept I was influenced by the media to be rabidly pro-choice and I am still pro-choice but now I also see pro-life's point, and my compromise is that though ultimately the woman should have the choice, every resource (from taxes) should be given to the woman to support and keep the baby",04Aug2020,1

130,"10 months is a long time, time is both the fastest, and slowest moving thing in the universe. 10 months ago I met a woman whom I fell in love with rather fast. She was the first woman I had felt comfortable and confident with in 19 years. After just 5 months I loved her so deeply it hurt, and she loved me, but in a different way.

I met her in second period science class, a upbeat ex drug addict who found a new love for life. She had a hard troubled past, same as I, I felt she could understand me, which was rare. I was a 18 year old virgin who had only thought about the feeling of love before her. I focused on my shortcoming, I focused on my setbacks, and I was so in my head that I was depressed and hopeless it only gave those feelings power. We, two broken individuals with different levels of issues, quickly grew close to one another.

A few months past, and I told her how I felt, “I’m in love with you” I said “I know, but I don’t feel the same, I’m really sorry” she said, “that’s okay” I said. Things progressed, and we kept growing closer and closer, I fell deeper and deeper, and I felt so broken and alone I became angry. First started the belittling of myself, “maybe if I make her know how broken I am she will feel pity” I thought. Then the fights,” maybe if I show her how mean and disgusting I can be she will love me” I pondered. Then the controlling,” don’t do this to me, or I’ll be so hurt I will need to leave” I told her. 

She has some issues, she’s as broken as I, and I knew that. I took advantage of that, one drunk night she kissed me, and we didn’t go to far, but it felt so special to me, I felt wanted, I felt attractive, and sexy,”I want more” I thought. The fighting and the controlling, the manipulation, and the abuse grew more and more. She stayed because she loved me, because I was important to her. 

Then she did something I didn’t like, I was hurt, I was angry, I felt betrayed, I got ugly. “You’re a whore, you don’t even consider others feelings” I said, like shit she felt. I made her hate herself so she could feel what I had. I blocked her, I blocked others, I wanted to move on, but I knew it wasn’t the right way to end things. I unblocked her, I became worse, I blew up again, it got brutal. I don’t remember it, I know it happened and I didn’t deny it. 

A few more days passed, I felt like garbage, I texted her, I apologized endlessly, but for once, to me, it didn’t feel like enough. It wasn’t. I saw it from her point of view, I saw how nasty I was, how disgusting I could be. I let my emotions control me, I let myself get lost in an abyss I had created. And for days, we texted, more apologies, more promises that I could change. And I have, “I want you to tell me everything from your perspective” I asked, and she did. The way she described me and my actions made me disgusted. I wanted to change, nay, I needed to change. “The past couple days was me trying to work through things” I expressed, “I have one question left for you, friends?” I asked. “Of course” she answered. “I love you, as a friend, a good friend” I replied, “and I love you too, a lot” she expressed. 

Some people can change, some can’t, it was meant to happen. I learned a lot, and so did she. From then on, things changed, and they will stay that way. Everything happens for a reason, no man is your teacher, no man is your friend, every man is your teacher.  We all regret things, we all regret actions and words, and sometimes that regret and disgust in yourself is enough to fuel a change.",04Aug2020,1

133,"I never tell this story. It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life. Not to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.

I am a 22 year old geek.

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude.

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know.

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake.

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it.

""Beautiful, simply beautiful.""

It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent.

She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera. And directly taking photos - OF ME!!!

I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds.

Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery.

I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me.

""You can't take those pictures!""

She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit.""

I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!""

She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here.""

That made me blush beat red.

She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting.""

As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger.

I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze.

She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability.""

I said ""I'm no model for a painting.""

She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off.""

I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree.

She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air.""

She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress.

""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you.""

My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!""

She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name.

""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months.""

Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes.""

She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold.""

As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos.

A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was.

A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My small penis and balls prominently displayed right in front.

With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. It was sold for $5,600. It will hang in a 58 year old rich woman's living room forever.

140,"I (F-30) after many heart breaks, decided that romance just isn't for me. My dynamic with men has always been off. My energy too frantic. Carnal needs always taking over.

I think we all know someone in everyone's life that all the girls are crazy about. He (M-48) loves women. He's thoughtfylul, adorable, easy going, frustratingly handsome, funny, intelligent, blah, blah, blah. He's also unattainable. I can feel how he tolerates me. If I interact too much, I feel the conversation strain. I usually wait for him to reach out, as I don't want to bother him. 

We live on opposite sides of the US, but once lived in the same state. Every woman we mutually knew was in love with him. It was terribly obvious. It frustrated me. It still frustrates me. 

Is it just a carnal lust for this man that drives me wild? Am I ever to get over him and not daily 'love in vain, strive against hope'? When he does reach out, it is heaven and heart ache. I compare other men to him. In small doses, I try to show him I am interesting. Like it matters, his mind was made up about me years ago.
 
This isn't 'When Harry Met Sally', and I do believe that once a man doesn't see a woman as a potential love interest, you are doomed to live in the friend zone. I'm in the fuck friend zone with him. It has yet to happen, but we've talked about it. And I'll take it. Anything to be close to him.

141,"A lot of people seem to forget this, so I’m making this post to serve as a reminder that there are some people and things in this world you will just never figure out. Even if you know why they cut you off, unless you know that what you did was a valid reason for them to, you should never beat yourself up for it because, and I cannot stress this enough, they were never worth any of your time in the first place.

If you know you did nothing wrong and still get cut off, they are doing you a favor by taking themselves and whatever other toxicity they had in store for you down the road out of your life.

You deserve way better than that, so don’t let it bring you down. Some people will get jealous of you, some will wake up one day and change their mind about you, some will even use something you did that they didn’t like, of which had absolutely nothing to do with them, against you.

The point is, absolutely none of that is valid. You shouldn’t want people like that in your life in the first place (but sometimes they manage to sneak their way in somehow). Them leaving your life is a blessing, so don’t fester on it when it happens. Accept it, be grateful, move on and stay happy.

Have a great day.",04Aug2020,1
142,"My heart is breaking. My long term boyfriend is the kindest, most caring human being on the planet, and he has a vile and toxic family who have not only disowned him, but now conned him out of money through lies. We’re both in college and he’s in so much debt, and with coronavirus it’s just been a financial and emotional nightmare. Why do some amazing people have such hard lives? It’s so unfair. I love him so. We’ll figure it out, but it’s going to be very hard and stressful. Send us some virtual hugs❤️",04Aug2020,1

144,"I don’t know what to feel anymore besides nothing. My dad showed me something that he found funny(I found it pretty racist) and he told me to laugh more.

I’m watching a sad moment in a move and he asks me why I’m crying. It’s a fucking sad moment!

I’m having some bad pains from not getting pregnant, he tells me to stop laying down and do something when I have already cleaned the house, the dishes, the carpets and floors, taken out the trash and eaten something he didn’t want. He tells me to stop whining and get up when I’m nice and cozy bleeding in my underwear laying down.

I’m not allowed to be upset, I’m not allowed to be pissed, I’m not allowed to cry, I’m not allowed to be happy because what makes me happy is for little kids or ‘the work of the devil’.

Is it no wonder I no longer show any empathy or joy and just get tired and sick of it all?",04Aug2020,1

This past month, my friend has been texting me ALL DAY EVERYDAY asking me to go for bike rides. Whenever I try to turn him down he says stuff like, “cmon man” or “ I was really looking forward to this.” Whenever I do turn him down, he always wants to know when I’ll be available next. And sometime later he starts the same conversation all over again and my response is the same. I’ve told him I’m introverted and that I like my time on my own. I’d also like to spend time with other friends. This has gone to the extent where he has taken all my time away from me and I’m not able to keep up with online school work and I wasn’t able to respect the curfew my parents gave me. Whenever I have school work I tell him that when I’m done I’ll ride over to his house but while I’m doing work he says things like, “when will you come?” “You done yet?” “So you coming?” “Can you leave now please?” “Have you left yet?” Litteraly every 5-10 minutes it drives me crazy. He can’t take any of my hints either so it’s like I need to spell it out for him and be straight up and lowkey rude. He always calls me and texting me 24/7 and it’s really annoying and he’s become a nuisance. At times I enjoy his company and all but he’s so needy and annoying",04Aug2020,1

Whenever we disagree on a topic he’s always criticizing my opinion and my thoughts on a certain topic and constantly trying to persuade me into agreeing with him. Example: He’s vegetarian and I’m not and he constantly reminds me and over exaggerates about how meat is very bad for you and it’s like tobacco and cholesterol etc... 

not to mention he the conversation revolves around him and his lifestyle and he doesn’t shut up at all regardless of what we’re talking about if we’re not even talking. He’s very self centered ex: when i was late to go home he was taking his sweet time but when he was late to his house he kept telling me to hurry up and I did.",04Aug2020,1

I recently launched a music sharing app called Rhythm that bridges the gap between Apple Music and Spotify. You can follow your friends, share songs, albums, and playlists, and save what other people post directly to your music library!

151,"Maybe you disagree with those statements, and that's okay, but I think the more I think about it, the more I realize it is true. Not only is no one perfect, but everyone that I know, including myself, has a least one thing that is really unattractive about their personality. 

Of course then one must go on to the part about change and transformation, how we all have the ability -- and the responsibility -- to not just be aware of our flaws but to work on them, to resist them, or turn them into strengths. (I didn't word that well, partly because I haven't really gotten to this step yet so I don't exactly know how to deal with these things once you have awareness).

I'm thinking about this now because of some recent shame spirals I've been going through. Ultimately I think they were good, and good will come from them, but what never helped me get anywhere were all the people, and self-help articles, reminding me that ""everyone makes mistakes"" and ""no one is perfect."" While these things are true, and might be helpful in a situation in which someone's really has just made a mistake, I found no comfort in those words. I was ashamed of so much more than ""mistakes."" I was ashamed of years and years of behavior, of a rigid pattern of behavior stemming. I was ashamed of my defense mechanisms, my ego, and the way they had started to become my identity. It wasn't that I wasn't perfect. It was that I was, I thought, morally repulsive. But hearing that we all have really big stuff that we dislike about ourselves, and that we spend our lives trying to change, would have helped me significantly.",04Aug2020,1
152,"If you ever deal with a place called Sun Communities, I’m sorry. Here’s two bad experiences I’ve had with them (places mentioned are Mobile home parks under their company). This is all in Michigan btw but Sun Communities has places in other states: 


Academy West-Point denied me back in June for having a low FICO and credit score when both scores are decent enough for at least QUALIFY (almost 700 and only going up). I’ve been working with CreekWood in Burton and I regret it all! We found a home My boyfriend and I wanted to purchase. I’m on furlough, have been since April 3rd. They said they’d accept furlough papers from my job due to COVID, unemployment papers, etc. I literally had EVERY SINGLE PAPER THAT VERIFIED MY INCOME TURNED IN JULY 15th!! Haven’t heard anything sense. 

The sales rep last told us that they’re waiting on paperwork to come back on their side. She also told a family member that the home is essentially ours around the last week or two of July. Fine. It’s now AUGUST 4th. I go around and look on their website just to check out things and the home is unlisted. Do a general search on it AND IT SOLD ON JULY 30th. WAS NOT NOTIFIED AT ALL. They’ve contacted other people regarding my boyfriend  and I but not us DIRECTLY. Sales rep told the family member that she tried to contact me when I haven’t gotten ANYTHING since mid July. I called up there today TWICE. First time, I asked how everything was going. She claimed she needed bank statements and pay stubs. I turned in BOTH IN MID JULY. I called again about an hour later and told her to get rid of my application. I don’t need this. I’m dealing with too much right now! 

Between the denial from another place for bull crap and this shady crap, I’m done with Sun Communities as a whole. Ridiculous standards and TIME WASTERS. Regardless if COVID was a factor or not, COMMUNICATION IS KEY. The picture is the last day of communication! From a professional stand point, you don’t tell others what we have and don’t, especially when we NEVER HAD THIS HOME ANYWAY. Second, you should at least let us know the home sold so we can move on. July 30th wasn’t that long ago. We applied for another place AND THEY CALLED WHEN WE GOT ACCEPTED. CALLED. Again, communication is KEY. Hope none of you have to deal with this crap.

TL;DR: I got screwed over by Sun Communities TWICE and I just want others to be aware before they deny you for stupid reasons and/or tell lies to your family members and don’t communicate with you!!",04Aug2020,1
153,"This very beautiful woman came to my work and I was helping her. She approached with a smile and mentioned how shes been to my work plave before and never saw me before at my job. She mentioned how she wasnt doing anything after work during our brief conversation and asked me what I was doing after work. Everything inside me screamed to ask her for her number but anxiety and fear of rejection prevented me from doing so. Her debit card even failed twice, I felt like the universe was giving it to me. After she left my heart sank.

154,"I don‘t really feel connected to anyone. I have some friends and it‘s fun to hang around with them but I don‘t feel connected to them or to anybody else. I feel like noone really understands me or the way I see things. 
I have actually never met a person in my life that thought the same way like me and I don‘t know if there even is someone. 
I‘m not depressed at all, I‘m actually more happy with myself than I‘ve ever been and know what I want to do with my life. But the more I understand myself the less I feel there‘s someone that can relate to me or understand me. Most of the time I want to be alone and  I enjoy it but at the same time I would also like to have someone I can relate to and have a deeper connection to. I just feel like there is noone (in the way of a friendship or even a relationship).

156,"Every time we go out to eat, he treats the wait staff terribly and tries to justify it by tipping them a lot. He's the kind of customer to blame the waiter when it's the kitchen's fault, send food back multiple times, and claim that he said one thing when he absolutely did not. He is so mean to them that we almost always have to defend the waiter as nicely as we can. 

If my family were to say anything, no matter what we say, he is the kind of person who just says, ""I paid for it. If you don't like it don't come."" We have said things in the past and he has just said that he tips them a lot so it doesn't matter. 

I'm embarrassed when I go out to eat with him, but I can't say no because I would be the only one not there with my family. Today is his birthday and we're eating right now and the way he is talking to our waitress disgusts me. As soon as she served the appetizer, before it hit the table he said, ""Wrong."" How fucking rude can you be? The second time, he complained that they had the Alfredo sauce on the bottom instead of on top, but my mom very cordially convinced him to accept the appetizer. I can't wait for when our entrees come. Updates will be posted.",04Aug2020,1

6 months ago my face got larger looking mainly around the cheeks and middle of face) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. 

Recently I went down to 11.3 again and jogged  but hardly any difference definitely but looks larger too. as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head and my body seems larger overall too. . It’s difficult to get below 11.3 stone even with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

◾️Black pants I wore a few months ago for work seem tighter and my legs look more longitudinal in them around the bottom half of legs. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting mostly too and it’s made me drop on the scale but can’t see a difference) I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it.  I was a few lbs more in 2018 and look thinner and thinner faced and clothes fitted better. 


◾️I’m down to 11.2 now  and my face looks larger than ever and I was a lot thinner faced  when I was last that weight in 2018 so I don’t get why /:
