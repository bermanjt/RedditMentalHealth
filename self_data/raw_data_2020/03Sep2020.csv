21,"I have been alone and soft spoken most of my life. Frequently I have found myself in abusive situations simply because I became to anxious to defend myself. Since losing my family when I was 13 I have not had much of anyone in my life. My foster family treated me so poorly that I overworked myself just so I would never be home. At 18 I graduated and quickly moved out the same week. I let others opinions of me drive my life. I molded myself to who society wanted me to be instead of who I was. 

This cost me dearly. I became less creative over time. My depression and anxiety started to control all of my decisions. I surrounded myself with people so I would feel less alone. Even when those I invited into my life would use and steal from me. I continued to move up in my career despite my declining mental health. Which has brought me to where I am today. In about 24-48 hours I will be changing careers. Taking a step back from leadership so I can focus on myself, and ensure that I can meet my goals.

Allowing yourself to disappear just because those that say they love you want you to change is wrong. Sometimes we are just fundamentally different than those standing right next to us. Let yourself be you. If you don‚Äôt it will eventually destroy every ounce of pride you have in yourself. 

I am 29, and I am tired of being alone. Soon I hope that I will have new friends in my area or even state. I have so many goals and I hope that I can build the support structure I need to meet them. Stay safe... will love to talk to anyone :)",03Sep2020,1

30,"Prior to COVID-19 fucking the the whole world (especially here in the U.S.), I was already on an upward track of making significant improvements to my life after 2 years of bad decisions stemming from extremely poor self esteem and personal setbacks. Last year I graduated college, received full-time employment immediately, began consistently and actively working out, and still had time to immerse myself in all of my hobbies. Once the pandemic hit though, I couldn't help but feel like all of that progress went go down the drain.  During the first month of quarantine, I was upset that I couldn't work out, go out and date, or even buy groceries to save money since people fucking panic bought everything at the stores.  I knew all of this was beyond my control though and that I eventually would have to just adapt to the best of my ability and that things would eventually settle down.  

Fortunately I still had my job as an essential worker in supply chain and logistics management, but COVID made me reevaluate my personal goals and my current situation.  I already knew that I didn't want to remain at my company, but this whole situation solidified that idea. Like the service workers who deal with 'Karens' that throw bitch fits over mask rules and threaten you, I encounter the same with man-child truckers.  I know that while no job will ever be a walk in the park, I can at least choose and control the environment and culture I want to be in. From March until May, I patiently withstood the hostile work conditions from both toxic management and outside parties, as May will have been my one year work anniversary.  Once May hit, I started throwing out job applications while simultaneously learning skills (SQL, Excel, &amp; Tableau)  to further my career advancement after coming home from a full day's worth of work.  In July, I came really close to landing a new and better job, but unfortunately I did not receive an offer. That didn't deter me though, it just encouraged me to dedicate more time to improving myself while others are choosing to remain complacent in their similarly shitty environments.  

I'm still on that grind as of today and I intend to come out on top, even when all of the odds are against me during this time. I am fortunate I still have my physical health and job to support myself. I know finding the motivation is hard right now, but don't stop if you're feeling discouraged or hopeless right now!

31,"I had the idea to overthrow the student council as I called it ""incompetent"" and ""useless"". So what I started to do is gather revolutionaries to be able to attempt the coup d'etat. The first group I tried to revolutianize were cadets of our school that were from CAT (Citizen Army Training, and yes, this was high school, and I was a lieutenant, 2LT to be exact). I ended up having over 40 cadets join the coup.

The second group I attempted to revolutionize were some normal students from different classes, I ended up with 35 revolutionaries. The last group I attempted to revolutionize were the smart students, people with high grades. I ended up with with only 10 revolutionaries.

Overall we were around 85 people, and that's where we started to take control of certain areas.

The first area we took control of was strategically important. It was the cafeteria. By the time we were done, we had control of 75% of the cafeteria. The next area we took was the school field. It was harder considering the size of the field. In the end, we only had 5% of the field's territories. The last area we attempted to seize was the student council's room. Before we attempted it though some guy snitched on us. So when the council found out they immediately crushed our rebellion, but it took 4 days for them to crush us. When the teachers found out, they only let us off with a warning. Surprised? In the end, we controlled our captured territories for over 4 months.

TL;DR I started a coup d'etat, had 85 revolutionaries, got my rebellion crushed in 4 days, and had controlled school territory for 4 months, and only got off with a warning",03Sep2020,1

C - holy shit, when you made the move on me that was incredible, first time that happened to me. yeah you smoked a pack of newports a day, but shit so did I. Sucks that your personality was just kinda garbo. 6.5/10

K - everything you did was super awkward and you were a white supremacist. -999/10

J - lmao I still can't believe we awkwardly made out, we've been friends for over half our lives that's wild lmao. Too short to really get much out of it but uh, ya know. Glad we're still friends. 5/10

T - ngl best kisser I've ever been with hands down. That night we made out for hours in the dj booth was just absolutely amazing. Kinda upset it didn't go farther than that, it always seemed like you were dropping hints at me, but now youre married and do you even live in the area anymore? Totally miss your massages too. 10/10

Ke - definitely mediocre at best. And then you left in the middle, walked out, and left my life without a word after being friends for 4 years. 3/10

Ki - You were great and I did you dirty. I'm glad I got to apologize to you, and thank you for accepting my apology. 7/10

St - You said it yourself, you're just not a good kisser, and unfortunately everything else you do is painfully average, with the exception of your friendship which is top notch. I know you want to date me even tho you said you don't, but I know we aren't going to fare well in the ling run. 4/10

A - welp, you were my wife. That was cool. Until you left me because you were lying. I still love you, my heart aches for the best of times we had. I'm still devastated that you played me, but I know that I sleep soundly while you acknowledge to all of your friends that you had it good while you try and make it seem like you don't care about me. I wish you the best. Your kisses are still forever burned into my memory. 9/10

Al - I appreciate you made the first move even though you were manipulative and extremely toxic. You need to learn how to brush your teeth though, your breath was always terrible and your gums were always coated in plaque. 2/10

43,"Hello everyone,

I thought it was time to vent out a little bit sharing how my life after ending high school has been so far.

I'll explain my story. My name is Hern√°n and I'm from from Buenos Aires (therefore I speak Spanish). In my early years of existence, I had a problem that didn't let me articulate words called dyslalia. The issue was gone when I was five. Back in the day, I used to go to a phoniacrist until I was eight. I annoyed my mother so much to start English that I ended up gaving up the phoniacrist. Wrong mistake and you will learn soon the reason. In high school, people made fun of me because of having a low pitched voice and this changed when I was 16, back in March 2013. When a neighbour heard my new ""manly"" voice, he recommended me to go to a podcaster institute. I ended high school in sour terms as I became a billy no mates, to the point someone telling me I would never had no friends. At first, I didn't take any importance, to the point it became true. Add that, when I went to the Bariloche trip, I was ignored most of the time. People only used me for homework.

Now that I gave some introduction about this whole thing, I'll move forward about how I went with my first attempt to that institute in 2015. A complete and utter fail as I basically jumped into a sea full of sharks. I went to another insitute where they trained me and even though I was a little prepared, I failed again in the second attempt (2016). During that time, I learned that I have issues with combinations with the letter ""r"". For example: if I say ""tractor"", it sounds like ""tlactor"". In 2016, I was also doing the FCE, which I failed by a few points. I think I was about only three points to approve the whole thing. I couldn't believe I have the worst luck. Before the third attempt (2017) would happen, I went to a phoniacrist. I was prepared for a few months and failed again. The fourth time was no different (2018) despite going 99% of the time (I barely skipped a session with the phoniacrist). On June 7th, 2018, I was watching the television and I saw a contestant from a television show that was a student from the place I was trying to enter. I saw him and said ""nah, I will never try there again"". So, I decided to go somewhere near where I live. Fifth attempt (2019) and I failed. The phoniacrist declared herself incompetent so I stopped going to her sessions. In short, I was doomed.

Weeks later, I saw an advertising from a phoniacrist that prepares podcasting, singing and all that stuff, so I went there circa November. I must remark she was specialized in psychology. For the sixth attempt (2020), I had something planned and that was to take me the cultural exam. In the previous institute, it was obligatory in the second instance (I never passed after the first one) and in this institute, it wasn't. So I asked them politely, they told me it won't guarantee nothing. I told them I don't care, I want to pass this exam no matter what. I recall my voice was shaking, no idea why I was confident as I was planning. They told me obviously to chill out and ""promised to take me that exam if I remembered about it. However, Corona changed all the plans and they told me they weren't going to take me the exam. I recall the format for the exam was: they were going to send me the texts (three types of texts: story, ad and news) and record yourself and send them in less than 24 hours. In that day, I recall having problems inside in my mouth (I don't remember exactly well) and being a little tired. I sent those videos to that phoniacrist before sending the finished version to them (the playlist also includes the practices from previous days, it's obviously in Spanish) - [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLefJdUjjggGB6KM1hIorTz28O91n-i514](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLefJdUjjggGB6KM1hIorTz28O91n-i514)

Nothing mattered because I failed for the sixth time in a row. I was dissapointed with myself because no matter what I do, I always fail. How this continued? Well, shortly after that, I went to a podcaster group that the phoniacrist recommended. She told me it didn't matter if I wasn't one of them. I posted them. Some people offered me help in the beginning, some of them passed me their phones and registration. I rejected the number because I'm not a big fan of adding unkown people to my cellphone. Even one of them told me to participate in his radio show but I didn't reply to him because I want to be prepared rather than exposing myself on the radio and being interviewed. He was from another province, so doing it wasn't the best choice. One of them basically told me to give up, which wasn't surprising. Moving forward, I recall back in May, the phoniacrist was there more as a psychologist than nothing else. I was showing her the messages I was getting from people to the point she started complaining she was wrong, she started remarking me that I wasn't following media stuff (this is true but that is because I want to be trained first and then, listening to stuff, it'd be like if they send you to analize a sentence without knowing subject and predicate) and I was never going to enter because of my past dyslalia issue. I went to the point of that session I grabbed my head and was like ""bloody hell, what should I do"". I had the worse idea of all and that was to close session. She called me back and then, sent me a WhatsApp complaining about my actions. I apologised to her immediately because I recognise I was wrong but I have no plans of giving up. She told me I was obsessed and to call other people from that group for help as she was no longer going to give me services. My mother told me she would no longer pay for nothing related with podcasting as she supported that psychologist. Up to that point, I knew I dug my own grave.

Life after that incident, I decided to contact one of the guys via WhatsApp, at first he didn't recognise me, we chatted a little bit and he recommended me an insitute for practices. I messaged that institute for the prices. The days have passed and no response, so I asked the guy if he passed me the correct number. He basically ignored me. Early this month, my mother got assaulted, the robbers hit her in the head and stole her cellphone in her way home. One day later, I got a message from that institute (two weeks later) explaining everything. I was outrageous because they came out at the wrong time, I told them ""thanks for the late response"". I was angry because had they replied in time, I could prepare for these classes. I only had a week to pay about $2000. They apologised and they explained some things that I didn't care. I told them I had no problem in explaining my experience. The conversation went circle on circle, so I went ahead explaining my expierence. They basically ignored me.

Before that, I was talking to a girl that became a podcaster. I recall telling her that, due to my fault, I ended up losing the psychacrist and I mentioned her that I showed her the convo I had with her. She got angry because I showed private conversation between me and her, which is understandable. Once again, I screwed things up. I obviously apologised at the moment and before ending conversation. The funny thing is that she mentioned she never heard any radio program before entering University. I was like ""then why people tell me to listen to radio?!"" Some people are just lucky and I'm not one of them. She ended the conversation telling me that I can always count with people for help and let me tell you this is a big fallacy because in the last paragraph, when I wanted help, I didn't fully get it. I also contacted another guy from that group and he ignored me. I saw in Reddit a guy that was a podcaster and he ignored me. I feel that podcasters have orthopedic arms. I mean, you are about to fall into the abyss and the guy is going to help but the arm he is using to help you out, fell out so did you as well. With that said, when you ask for help, I feel nobody is give you a hand.

Currently, I'm planning to do pre-taped podcast episodes, just for training myself (even though this won't improve my ""r"" issues) but I don't know how. I blame myself for not taking my ""r"" issues seriously when I was a kid. Currently, my English is good to great and I communicate with English people on daily basis but as I said, I regret giving up the phoniacrist when I had the chance to improve. I am willing to change. I am sick and tired of failing these exams over and over again.

Sorry for the long post. I just need to speak my mind. Hope everyone is doing well.",03Sep2020,1
44,"Never used Reddit before, this is my first post here and asking for help/advises. 

So basically, my mother is kicking me out i am an 20 years old male, studying in a university (one of the best in my country and also one of the most expensive ones)  and i have a part time job but with this salary it is impossible to support myself and live alone.  I'm from the second world country so not only youth like me without having a high education diploma are suffering to get a job but also people who even have masters degree. 

Growing up me and my mother had a different kind of relationship, we were more friends then a mother and son, i was raised by a single mother my father left when i was a child (I know where he lives what he does and everything about him that i need to know) but after he left we did not had any contact. 

I used to tell every detail about my life to my mom when i needed advice or support sometimes she understood sometimes not.. but few days ago we got into a really bad argument. On every weekend when she is not at her job she always yells and complains about things every morning if  you ignore that then she acts like nothing has happened but again this weekend like others ones she was yelling at my maid (the one who raised me  and now works as a maid in my house ) i woke up and was on a really bad mood so i asked my mother not to yell and complain at least today she ignored me i asked her twice ignored me again, in a few minutes later i asked her to stop yelling because it always stresses me more then i should stress about she ignored again so i yelled at her to stop it and punched the door this made her really angry and now she was yelling at me and calling me all the terrible stuff that i'm a junkie, an alcoholic she also called me F\*\*\*\*T. 

And all of this because i have some gay friends, some of my friends used to take drugs ( nothing really serious weed and maybe molly from time to time only for having fun ) and some of them liked to hang out and go out more often.  But i have never taken any drug ( only weed and i have tried it few times not like i'm using it, i even took drug tests so i could prove her ). She knows that i'm not an homosexual  because she used to know every girlfriend that i had but because that i dye my hair, dress differently then most of the males in my country ( also not really different i used to have emo phase but not anymore and my style of dressing in not even close to emo,goth, punk or any of the sub cultures ) and have earnings, when she gets angry she calls me the F word, when shes not angry she supports me but as soon as she gets angry she underlines my looks, she underlines that friends i have and telling me that i'm not better then my friends and i'm the same... junkie,alcoholic lowlife and etc. I used to have toxic friends but now i only have few of the friends left and all of them are normal youth trying to achieve their goals. It's just they like to go out more and have more fun. I was always a stay at home guy but sometimes i like to go out and have fun too as soon as i do that ( maybe go out for like 2 or 3 times in one week and usually if i do that i'm staying in after that for more then 2-3 weeks ) shes getting mad at me telling me that i live in a family where i need to respect the family and it's not an hotel just to go in and sleep.

P.S sorry for being all over the place. 

Back to the argument that lead to my problem that i have today...

So basically we got into an argument that i'm waking up every weekend to her yelling and complaining  and i want that to stop and have a normal morning full of love like normal family and after ignored me  for few times i yelled at her and punched the door this made her really angry and started to smash some stuff and yelling, insulting me  and telling me that i have no rights do behave like that in her house then she left the house, i got really nervous because she was mad and nervous and she went out with her car so i did not wanted her to drive in that emotional state. I asked my maid to call her and ask her if she was ok and where she was. That all i needed to know if she was ok. On that she replied to leave her alone and told her that now i had all the peace i needed without her. But she came back the second day she stayed in our second house in a countryside and after that everything went down hill. I tried to have a normal conversation with her i don't want to say sorry because i know how she will react on that. Shes always mad at me and because of that i can't faction well i'm having problems at my job having problems in the university because of that... having problems to concentrate. And this week was terrible for me so i started to drink so i could let my mind loose a bit. I was coming home in the morning drunk ( not hammerd but drunk  ) not saying a word and doing my stuff. Today when i was going in a university i tried to have a normal conversation about my day.. I told her that i was having one of my favorite lectures today then i had this thing to do at my job which she replied that she does not care about my life anymore because that was what i wanted and told me to pack my things and move out from the house, she compared to me to my father and told me that i'm only using her until i achieve my career goals. (That really broke my hurt because every time when i had a conversation with my friend about me.. why i am studying this hard, why i am reading this much the answer was so i could do everything in the future and somehow thank my mother and give her everything that she deserved) so when i heard that my immediate response was that as soon as i get a job which can support me i would leave the house. (I used to study abroad and hated everyday living without her but if that's what she wants i'll try my best to give it) Then again she compared me to my father and told me that she has learned her lesson in life and she won't let herself repeat the same mistakes. And told me again to pack my things at the end of the week and move out from the house.

I don't know what to do my world and my dreams are upside down right know.. I always wanted to have a career i'm in love with my faculty and really wanted to finish bachelors,masters and phd, supporting my self (renting a flat and all the other stuff) is impossible with a part time job salary, I have to move out but that means i need to quit the university and get a full time job and say goodbye to all the dreams i had career wise. 

Any kind of advice will help... or just any comment so i know people have heard and understood me... 

Thank you in advance",03Sep2020,1
45,"For a (very) short period of time, there existed a brand of beer in Australia during the 1990s called ""Duff"". It only was ever sold for a very short time, where it was promptly pulled from all store shelves and destroyed after a lawsuit by 20th Century Fox (copyright holder of The Simpsons, which have a fictional brand of beer called Duff Beer in the show).

Because of this, the beer is *very* rare and hard to get your hands on, and according to Wikipedia a *single* case of it sold for $13,000 US dollars.

A member of my family has about 5 cases of this stuff, all together in a locked wardrobe. I have no idea why. I know where it is. I know where the key is $65,000 worth of super-rare beer. Right there. Sometimes I think about it at night while I'm lying awake in bed. If I wanted to I could easily just take it, sell it, cut off all ties with my family and get the fuck out of there. I would be set for like, a long time.

47,"I (19F) was with my ex boyfriend (18) for almost two years. It was a really great relationship but the last few months things turned to shit as he studied abroad while I was in the US for college. We were 14 time zones apart so that was hard on both of us and our mental health and things were just going straight downhill so we broke up before we could hate each other. We broke up both still loving the other person very much so but realizing that our timing is off. This was nine months ago. Like literally New Year‚Äôs Eve of 2019. I hadn‚Äôt talked to him since then... until a few days ago. 

I was recently able to get my belongings that I had to leave in a friend‚Äôs apartment due to COVID and I moved back home. But I moved back for college again and got my things. So I sent the belongings I still had of his to his family‚Äôs house. I texted his mom for the address because I didn‚Äôt want him to feel like he had to talk to me by asking him for it. 

Anyway, he texts me a few days ago thanking me for the belongings and for the letter I included (it just said that I hope he was doing well and a little bit about what I‚Äôve been up to). And so we‚Äôre catching up and he asks how I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôve genuinely been doing really good. Things were a bit rough after we broke up but I‚Äôve been very healthy mentally and just living a great life. So I had told him that I‚Äôd been well. And I asked how he‚Äôs doing and he told me how shitty he‚Äôs been and how low and depressed he‚Äôs been for months on end. Due to the pandemic, he was abruptly deported back to the states from his study abroad thing, had to move back with his chaotic family in the middle of nowhere, and now has no friends. So I can see how this is hard obviously. He was always the strongest and most resilient person I had known so whenever I thought about him, I just assumed he was doing okay. 

Come to find out... he was briefly addicted to cocaine for a few weeks in July and August. And has been smoking weed every day for weeks on end while drinking heavily. He‚Äôs gotten quite a few facial piercings and given himself multiple tattoos. I think it‚Äôs an important reminder that he‚Äôs 18. I honestly am baffled to learn all of this. He was always a very thoughtful and rational person. He was always on the healthy side and I honestly saw none of this coming. This is FAR from the person I fell in love with and FAR from the person I was with for two years. Completely unrecognizable personality wise. Like night and day. My friend came across his tiktok page and she was showing me some of his videos and he is so strung out on something that he can‚Äôt even formulate a thought in the video and is just wigging our. When I was with him, he was always well put together and funny and so incredibly smart and hard working. To see this, I honestly don‚Äôt even know how to process it. 

While I‚Äôve been taking care of myself to get healthier in all aspects - especially with my mental health - and truly doing better than I‚Äôve been in forever, he‚Äôs going through addiction and a deep, dark depression. I have no idea what to think. I care about him deeply and I always always will. But it isn‚Äôt my responsibility or obligation to be his caretaker anymore. I‚Äôm just at a loss for words to learn all of this about him. 

I wrote this out completely for myself to just think about but if you actually read it let me know what you think about the situation. Because I don‚Äôt even know how to unravel it.",03Sep2020,1

2 weeks into lockdown, I lost my job. I‚Äôve been struggling to find one ever since, and have been desperately trying to find any odd jobs so I can put food on the table for myself. It‚Äôs so strange when you go from being financially comfortable to having to constantly grind daily to eat.

49,"Hello, thanks for giving me your time and reading this. Appreciate any feedback!

I am a 2nd year Doctorate of Physical Therapy Student. I have found myself continuously struggling with anticipated career depression. When in undergrad I studied to get into dental school and did not get accepted my first year of applying, so I took advice from my mentor at the time and applied to a Physical Therapy program because I had the pre-requisites for it. With a high GPA, I was able to get into the program first round and this was my only option after undergrad. With one day in between graduation and the start of my graduate school doctorate program, I had little to reflect on other options. I figured since I liked to exercise and lift, Physical Therapy (PT) would feel accomplishing to me. 

Fast Forwarding... I am now a 2nd year of 3 years. I am on my final didactic (book work) year and am on the border of just dropping out as I can‚Äôt see myself being satisfied with this career. I think there are great PTs out there but the career itself seems too easy for me. The schooling has been challenging at times but I don‚Äôt even care to master the material. I take it slow and never talk to any of my family about my schooling, what I‚Äôve learned, or any skills I have mastered. I just avoid the conversations by saying its okay and prompt them with a different topic. The hand skills such as joint mobilizations, stretching, surgery (sx) protocols and lab components have been too easy for me. I do not even need to practice them to execute them well in a mock testing scenario. I have been continuously let down by the quality of my teachers and am just overall discouraged with where my life will be in 10-20 years. 

On top of all this info, I have a super awesome, supportive girlfriend in my life who is determined to finish the program. We are in the same class. I have already mentioned to her about my thoughts and how I am dreading my possible future. She too feels this isn‚Äôt a field for her but is much older than me and wants to earn a degree and start her career/life. 

My question is reddit...  What would you guys suggest/do? 

TLDR: 23 yr old male not satisfied with career path in doctorate of physical therapy program. Has had a shit 1.5 years in the program so far, dislikes the core classes, thinks the field isn‚Äôt backed by enough evidence based practice, and goes to school with a sub-par cohort. Wants to drop, has a desire to do something with software programming but has no knowledge other than making private servers of video games when a teenager. Doesn‚Äôt know if he should take a leave of absence since its offered with COVID or to stay in the program.

51,"I want it written somewhere that I called it when it happens. 

Over the past few decades, education has been caught in a positive feedback loop: Lower funding means lower test scores, lower test scores means lower funding. Apply a generous helping of defunding education, underpaying educators, and god-awful pandemic response and you're left with our current system which is on the verge of breaking down entirely. 

Soon we're gonna see republicans point to the broken education system (their fault) and say ""Lookie herr, gubmint cayunt ejucate for shiet!"" and propose private schools start running education. 

If that happens:

 * They will argue it will save you tax dollars. The retirees that vote for republicans will save, of course, but the people actually sending their kids to school will start to drown in tuition.

 * Tuition. It will still be illegal to not send your kid to school. This will force many poor people to go into debt. Reinforces poverty and puts money in the pockets of the school owners. The prices will also hike significantly due to a captive audience.

 * No accountability. ""They're private entities"" is going to be repeated all the way up to the supreme court. Some rulings will be against blatant discrimination, but ultimately it will be a net loss in rights.

 * Division of education. Already an issue, but standards of education will not be the same across schools and it will be directly related to their price tags. Don't look for financial literacy classes in the school where poor kids go.

 * Child labor. Private prisons proved labor laws can be circumvented. Sweatshop classes will be opened up and the school will justify it by saying it teaches job skills. 

Here's a list of terms you may need to familiarize yourself woth

 * Right-to-educate: A student can be expelled at any time, for any reason

 * School stocks: They'll go up in value when laws that let the children be exploited are passed

 * Education welfare: Anyone who receives government assistance to pay for their child's tuition will be referred to as lazy.

55,"It seems really tempting the only problem is I lived like that unemployed for 3 years before zi got this job.

I don't remember alot, your brain can block out trauma but that should be reason enough for me to keep my job, no?

I've just never been so tired in all my life, but before I'd never been so hungry, now I can eat whatever I want.

What annoys me is the 1 day off a week, I am going to 2 days off a week soon and I hope it will make a massive difference at the moment I feel as if I'm always at work.

This is what annoys me further though of the 6 days a week I work 3 of those days are mornings so I finish work at 2:30pm. That means I get the rest of the day to do what I want, granted I am too tired to enjoy anything but I have recently found controversial ways to give yourself energy, they are not ideal, but they work.

I've been thinking of giving my job up, I would go from ¬£1700 a month to around ¬£600 maybe less.

I want to know what people think, I would give my job up tomorrow if I knew I had to do this untill I retire, it's strange. Neither options are great, so I tell myself to just keep the job, buy a house, a dog and a motorbike. Fill my house with food and entertainment, why can't I quit my job in 10 years instead?

That's all that keeps me going, there's still things I need to buy that I would never be able to if I left.

I am envious and jealous when you read into it. It annoys me that I have to work 6 days a week wasting my life to afford things someone else barely gad to lift a finger for, I want free time to explore my interests.

But like I said at the start, I've been unemployed for 3 years before this and I was homeless before that I had no idea what true hunger felt like, true hunger is so horrible.

Im just so tired I slept straight after work yesterday then again at night Ive tried literally everything to improve my sleep schedule but since having this job there has been only 1 period of a couple hours where I felt refreshed and awake.

56,"I don't know what to think, this is is eating me up so I'm just sharing it in case writing it somehow helps in some way. 

Basically, my(f/25) mother(48) is anything but discreet about having an affair with one of her colleagues from work. I know for a fact they haven't gone very far, but have been having something going for almost a year now. I don't care about her love life, I just feel very disappointed. She's been working from home and I've been living again in my parents house since the pandemic situation left me jobless and homeless, but also helping her with her job since ""technology"" is really not her forte. Thus, so much information has been coming into my knowledge, not only about her job and networking, but also about her private life! Ugh.

This started a week ago when I happened to overhear a conversation she was having on the phone. The house is very peculiar in that in some rooms you can clearly hear almost everything from another one; everything in the living room can be heard from the room I sleep in (but not other rooms! lucky me?). I was sleeping and her voice woke me up even though I'm used to ignore the noisy mornings from her online meetings and calls, but this time it was quieter and her voice had a different tone.

Not being able to go back to sleep let me overhear everything. It was a very flirtatious conversation with one of her coworkers......... I heard too much. Really too much. The phone was on speaker so I even heard what the other person was saying. Nevertheless I chose to trick my mind into believing it was some lucid dream and forget about it... Until managing her logs the next day and the morbid curiosity leading me to read the interchanges she's been having with this person for over a year now. 

So many stuff clicked in my head. Some time ago she was pestering me and my brother about ""how to take nice pictures"", so we taught her. She started asking me about work-out routines and skincare products, so I thought ""wow, she finally wants to be healthy, good!"" then gifted her a cream I heard was good and every two days I'd teach her some exercise routines (Off-topic, I should monetize on this, I managed to make her fit in clothes two sizes smaller in a month). There was also a time she asked me to explain HOW DO MOTELS WORK and if I knew what would happen to them during the pandemic. I didn't really think too much of it then, it seemed weird but at the time I was indeed working in one.

I really feel angry, disgusted, disappointed, and quite surprised, in a bad way. I see her and I remember all of that again, feeling even more angry and disgusted. My mother has always said how much she hated cheating and how it was such a horrible thing. She always boasted about how she was such a honest and straightforward person, how much she saw marriage as sacred even at the lowest points in a relationship. And now she's planning the sex with... say, a man, but... thing is, I do not know him in person but I \*know\* about him... That man is married and has kids, his spouse got Covid a month ago and is just recovering, he is higher in the job hierarchy than my mother but not exactly her boss, they just work at the same place, I remember once my mother talked about him and suggested I should hook up with one of his younger siblings and how neat their whole family apparently was? (God, the implications of that now seem way worse than back then).

Just yesterday I tried walking in while she was making another of those calls and she just kept going but in another room and then at dinner I happened to suggest some of what I know because she made some sex joke I didn't find funny at all. She brushed it off, and sort of looked amused?? Suggesting ""being bad is not so bad""???? I still can't believe it. From what I've read and heard, the only thing that has been ruining ""her plans"" is the pandemic making it apparently so difficult for them to meet ""in private"". Also, this is making me very sad. If I tell her I already know she'll deny it or won't care, if I say nothing I won't be able to ignore it either way and will keep just feel angry and disgusted; then, also I can't bring myself to talk about this to my father, since he probably doesn't know (he works outside almost all day in construction), it would be too much for him right now, and honestly I don't think it's my place to do so.

Hey guys. Since this pandemic I‚Äôve had it pretty rough, and I know we all have but I‚Äôve had it up to here and just needed somewhere to rant.

2 weeks into lockdown, I lost my job. I‚Äôve been struggling to find one ever since, and have been desperately trying to find any odd jobs so I can put food on the table for myself. It‚Äôs so strange when you go from being financially comfortable to having to constantly grind daily to eat.

Secondly, my girlfriends father, who was like a father figure to me, has recently been diagnosed with Covid-19. He‚Äôs a soldier, but was hospitalized for 12 weeks last year due to unrelated lung issues. I know he‚Äôs strong but I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs gonna make it :/

66,"I broke up with my ex, and him and I had started talking and I was keeping a secret from him...that I had a 3some with one of his best friends included. I told him today because sh*t was going to hit the fan and the outcome was horrible. Not only did he not believe my point of view, but he made me seem like it was all my fault.

Backstory points:
- I was blackout drunk (in/out, hardly remembering anything within the last couple of hours of the night)
- it was supposed to be me and my best friend (his best friends girlfriend) drinking, but she wanted her boyfriend over and I wanted to make her happy, so I said yes he can come (I also wasn‚Äôt really given an option)
- it was thrown up there as a joke, I didn‚Äôt consent to it, it just happened
- his best friend was the only sober one there, he definitely took advantage of me and her

Anyway it doesn‚Äôt matter how anyone feels what the right thing is. I am no longer friends with my ex, as he sided with my best friend who defended the manipulative actions of his best friend, and threw me under the bus. He also said it was my fault, even though we were broken up and I was almost coerced into it. I am also not friends with my ex-best friend, I made sure she knows I want nothing to do with her.

I believe these people are just toxic and narcissistic. Nothing I could‚Äôve said or done could‚Äôve changed the situation. The turmoil from it made me severely depressed and suicidal once again. I never want to associate with these people.",03Sep2020,1
68,"Alright...so I'm 19. I have zero facial hair, and zero body hair. I'm as smooth as a dolphin. Though I still like to shave anyway for a little bit of extra smoothness. I also use lotion to make my skin even more soft. And my hair is shoulder length, and very silky feeling. I look like a guy, but people sometimes have thought I was a girl, or they weren't sure if i was a girl or a guy. I wear glasses. I usually wear pants, but my shorts are really short. 4 inch inseam...which is mid-thigh on me. 

Then my personality...I'm very emotional, and I cry a lot. Usually tears of joy though, or appreciating beauty, or I cry because of nostalgia. I rarely cry due to actually being sad or depressed, so it's not negative. 

I also really like cute things. One of my favorite things is Pokemon, because it just has so many cute fictional animals. And it's a chill game, not too tough to beat or get the hang of. 

Then about my sexuality and gender-identity...I'm bisexual, but I like women WAY more. Like 80% women, and only 20% men. Men are pretty great, but just don't compare to soft, curvy women with thick thighs to me. 

I identify as agender...but I feel WAY closer to female than male. My only real male personality characteristic is sometime fits of rage, where I get so mad and out of control I punch holes in my walls, and smash small objects around. Yes, unhealthy, and I'm seeing a therapist actually. 

But otherwise, I'm chill, sweet, affectionate, touchy feely, and I like warm hugs, and pecks on the cheek, from those I love. 

Also...I find girls super sexy...but I also wanna BE a girl. 

In the end, I'd like to be gender-neutral. But that's tough to pull off. It's much easier to do either super masculine or super feminine. And I choose super feminine.",03Sep2020,1

77,"I think my parents are great: they support me a lot and are always available to help me. But I think they still consider me as a child and want me to be (insanely) close to them as long as possible.

In particular, the problem is with my mother. My feeling is that all her life turns around my sister and me. Even if she has hobbies and friends, we are the most important part of her life and she really values the time spent with us. Until here, there's nothing wrong. But she forces me to spend time with her even when I don't want to. And if I tell her that I want to be on my own or with my friends, she usually gets either explicitly offended or passive-aggressive offended. Let's be honest here: if I'm going to hang out with my friends she would never tell me to spend time with her instead of my friends. She lets me do whatever I want. But she really wants to occupy my free time, and whenever I don't have anything to do she tries to find some boring stuff to do all together with the family. The problem is that I always have to accept to participate in such activities, because saying ""no, I prefer being on my own rather than going to the seaside with my mum and dad"" would just sound offensive to them. And anyway my mother would just suggest other activities until my nerves collapse and I have to accept.

I just want to be clear here: I do want spend time with my parents every now and then. But I would like to be able to decide when. I would like to have my own life and my parents to have their own life. And I think it should be me to say ""hey let's do this \[random thing\] all together for this special event"". 

Moreover, I think my parents **want** me to be dependent on them. But let's say something here: my sister is about 30 and she is financially dependent on my parents. I think she is a great girl. Because of several factors (not because of her) she still doesn't have a job that let her earn enough money to be independent. She hasn't lived in the same house of my parents for years, but the rent is paid by my parents and my mother still goes to visit her almost weekly and brings her food ""so that she can eat well"". Sometimes she also goes to clean the house or to fix damages. My mother always complains that my sister can't cook properly or can't take care of the house but it seems to me that bringing her food and solving problems for her is not really helpful in that sense. 

**The fact is**: I don't want to end up like my sister. I want to keep a good relationship with my parents but at the same time I want to be independent and able to spend my free time in the way I want. But I think I need to act in order to change things. Now I'm going to explain more deeply what is the relation between me and my mother.

I have been studying abroad for one year (was also a good chance to get more independent) and my mother calls me everyday to check up on me. If she knows that I'm not busy she even calls twice. I don't mind, the calls are usually short and I'm happy to talk with her and chat about stuff. 

She expects me to do everything with her. Just quoting what she says: ""*Oh, I'm looking forward to you coming back \[during holidays\] so we can finally go to the seaside together!*"", ""*Oh, looking forward to you coming back so we can finally go to a nice place to eat all together, and you will finally taste some good food!*"". And she usually spreads shit on the country I'm currently living in, probably hoping I will start to hate it and will come back to my parents once and for all: ""*Oh come on you don't have to learn the language they speak there*"", ""*Omg these people living there are so terrible, it's not like the pleasant atmosphere we have here*"", ""*Omg the food that they eat! It's so disgusting!*"" and so on...She also sends me good morning / good night texts on whatsapp, hearts included üòí.

**More facts**: whenever I come back home for holidays she always tries to convince me to stay longer. When I moved to the new country my parents came with me and stayed at my apartment (which is meant for 1 person, max 2 people if you don't breath too much air) for more than a week. The reason was ""*so we can help you move and can visit the city all together*"". They had to go away after one week because they realized I couldn't stand them anymore, otherwise they would have stayed even longer. After like 2 months my mother came back again (in that period I had lectures to attend everyday) for 1 entire week.  She came because in my city there was an event she was interested into. One weekend was enough for such event but she came for one week also to visit other cities with me, even if she knew I was busy. And obviously we went to visit other cities together as she wanted, because she came all alone and I didn't want to behave like a dick and leave her all by herself all day. She hasn't come again only because of the pandemic and because I insisted a lot. 

Moreover, every damn summer my mother tries to convince me to go on holiday with my father and her. I always have to go. It's not that they force me but: 1) even before asking me she would start packing the luggage with all my stuff, and 2) if I say no my mother would become passive-aggressive and would insist with that for days until my nerves collapse. You can imagine that going on holidays for 2 (two!) weeks with your &gt; 60 years old parents is not such a great experience. I really hate that.

Now, I would like to make my mother understand that I don't really like this situation, and that I would like to be more independent. I have already tried several times, but either 1) she doesn't take me seriously and starts mocking me and becomes more clingy than ever, or 2) she says that it is ok and gets passive-aggressive saying things like ""*yeah of course you can do that \[random thing\], you don't want to spend time with us anyway*"" or pushes on the fact that I'm still economically dependent on them. And indeed they let me live in a nice apartment and they give me money whenever I ask. (which is only when money is over because of grocery shopping, just to be clear). But it seems to me that I don't have any other choice. 

Indeed I actually feel that my parents **want** me to be economically dependent on them (although next year I expect to get a job and situation should change, I hope): I wanted to live in a shared flat with other students (would have been way cheaper) but they convinced me not to do that. They said that I could meet bad guys there and that I needed more space for myself. Moreover they  (of course) wanted to visit me whenever they wanted so they convinced me to take a private apartment in which there was space for an additional bed.

I have always behaved nicely with them, and whenever I had complaints like these I explained the problems calmly. But apparently these efforts didn't produce any result, and now I don't know what I can do. Seriously, I don't want to end up like my sister.

I should say that I realized all of this quite recently thanks to my ex-girlfriend (we broke up recently, but that's another story). Indeed it's not easy to realize that things are wrong when you are inside the story.

Do you have any suggestion? I think that listening to external opinions might help. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR My mother wants to occupy my free time and doesn't let me be independent. I want her to understand that I want to spend my time differently, without offending her. And I want her to understand that I'm old enough to be treated as an adult. Any effort of mine was useless, because she either doesn't take me seriously or gets passive-aggressive.",03Sep2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

just curious to see if other people get this ""post movie depression"" i seem to get whenever I watch a film I really enjoyed. Doesn't matter if its a happy or sad film, or the genre particularly, and its not usually with any film where I ""wish i was living in the film and become sad when reality hits after its over"". 

&amp;#x200B;

All i can really describe is being incredibly depressed and empty for days after having watched a film, and obsessing over certain aspects of the film. Generally I find that the only thing that makes me feel better is if I'm looking into the film online//rewatching the film//watching cast interviews//fan theories but as soon as I stop and do something else i get hit with this overwhelming feeling of sadness or emptiness. Im a big cryer so generally feels like I'm on the verge of crying all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently example is with the new Nolan film Tenet, 4 days after watching and I'm so low in mood but i absolutely loved the film, booked to see it again and am loving reading up on it / watching actor interviews etc.

I also need a small /medium size lightweight planner I can easily fit in my purse. Mine is from ""[Ban.Do](https://Ban.Do)"" and it's super cute but also I feel it's a little too big. But I really like the style.

Any advice to help me get through this last school year is so much appreciated!!",03Sep2020,1
120," I visited a sex worker yesterday, and it was incredible. It's not the first time I've used the services of a sex worker, but the sex yesterday was real sex as opposed to a sex worker servicing one's needs. Largely because she's just started sex working as of last week as an on and off thing - she's a student.

It wasn't just the sex that was standout, the conversation in between was what made this experience so great, as there was genuine chemistry and our personalities complemented naturally, which made the subsequent sex even more emotionally charged and we both really enjoyed ourselves. Her warmth and kindness made me feel so good! - yeah, I know, I've fallen for someone I can't have.

But this has just left a great sense of longing in myself today because whilst it's shown me the possibility that people with whom I have genuine chemistry exist and that incredible sex isn't a myth (in my life), my current situation living with my parents as a student (to get my life in order) and the genuine difficulty of meeting people in my 30s (though this was true in my 20s too) has just made me a little sad. In all honesty, what I experienced yesterday (and I think she did too judging by the message she sent me and what she'd said) has also contributed to this and has left a hole in me because I deeply desire to want to be with her and spend more time with her. I hope I find someone that makes me feel the way she made me feel.

She has moved to the UK from France, so hopefully I intend to visit her every so often for her services and for companionship over the coming year or two, before I re-leave the nest.",03Sep2020,1

So in general I am pretty awkward around people especially in school, I struggle to start conversations and in general just feel embarrassed especially while around girls. I find it very hard to just talk or even uphold conversations with people I don't know much as I don't really know what to say and don't have the best conversation skills. I know that one reason I lack confidence is due to my teeth, thankfully soon I am getting Invisalign therefore that will definetely help a bit with my confidence. Besides that I'm working out regularly and am eating a lot healthier and feeling better since I started, but I'm still good bit off where I want to be body wise. One of my friends is super confident and gets on with most girls in our class while I'm super anxious about talking to anyone since I just feel too conscious. I'm just looking for some advice on how I could be more confident around people and more social I guess. Thanks",03Sep2020,1

i have the utmost respect and sincerest admiration for the glorious, uncanny, beautiful, elegant, impeccable, black, fly. truly free and in perfect harmony with the earth, the fly adapts quickly and seamlessly with its environment. satisfied to exist in the foulest, most intolerable conditions imaginable, the wealthy fly is liberated of the burdens of greed, lust, envy, sloth, wrath, gluttony and pride and has no concept of the painful scourge that is time living only in the moment.

the fly doesn't reject the truth based on emotional response. the fly is not hindered by ego, insecurity or jealousy and has no desire to manipulate, deceive, dominate or commit acts of aggression to deprive others of happiness, valuable property or security for personal gain. it is insusceptible to disappointment and uncompelled to prove its worth to itself or others. it does not seek attention or require approval, assurance, attention or validation.

despite the god-like fly's obvious supremacy it never judges decadent, repulsive, pitiful humans for their pitiful inferiority, their endless, hopeless, futile, arbitrary childish efforts or their numerous inadequacies, choices in religion and style, especially the characteristics beyond their control such as birthplace, color, heritage, intelligence or lack thereof. the patience of the methodical, munificent fly is immeasurable. the invincible fly never looks down upon others despite joyfully soaring above them.

the fearless fly is confident and acts decisively without hesitation, malevolence, vengefulness, spite or shame. when i was but an ignorant, ungrateful child, not dissimilar to today, i once mindlessly laid my head on a desk and was mercifully graced by a prescient, majestic fly. bewilderd and incredulous, i trembled in horror and stared on in stunned amazement as it selflessly and generously defecated liberally in my field of vision only to delightfully depart unceremoniously never to be seen again.

i often ponder if flies always land to produce feces. humans never release their waste while mobile unless being pursued by a terror such as a lion. none can challenge the power of the great almighty fly. even the lion doesn't dare oppose the invincible fly who would effortlessly evade him while taunting it with laughter and feast lavishly on the fruit of the it's tireless, relentless labors, its excrement, multiplying by orders of magnitude in the process and tormenting the lion's helpless descendants for generations to come.

perhaps preceding the arrival of mankind, the eternal fly will survive long after our foolish self-destruction. we would all do well to learn from the wise, noble, enlightened fly, unhindered by lofty presumptions,unencumbered by dogma and logical fallacies, whose impregnable perception encompasses virtually all directions granting it immunity to deception. all bow down to the immortal, omnipresent, all knowing fly.

the fly is the undefeatable, unconquerable, undisputed master of all domains including yours. should you by crook manage to outwit the clever, learned, intellectual, fly and best it in battle, shame on you for violently disrespecting your superior. we should beware of arrogantly deluding ourselves that we are capable of anything beyond aspiring to emulate the grandiose piety, splendor and greatness of such an undeniably flawless and perfect being. let us hold the immense illustrious power of the fly in awesome reverence and free our minds so possibly one day we might all fly away together in blissful ecstasy.

129,"I know it's going to take me a while to write this, as my thoughts are scattered and I've always had a hard time explaining myself to any capacity. Maybe I'll end up adding to it later as I remember events... Who knows.

To set the stage, I live in a family of four; this would be myself, my younger sister, mom, and dad. My sister has a mental handicap that I would later be diagnosed with as well, though to a lesser extent. My main ""feature"" is my crippling anxiety disorder.

I am in constant fear of how people perceive me, and it's been ripping me slowly from the inside-out. No matter all the techniques, apps I've downloaded, medication, and doctors I have seen I cannot get it under control. I perceive every little thing that people do around me to be malevolent against me, and so I do everything I can to be a people-pleaser. So much so, that I have anxiety if my sister does not do her chores, I get physically nauseous assuming that the backlash will fall onto me. I go to work feeling nauseous, and feeling as though I am not meant to be there, that there are others that can do my job better, that it is a waste of this business's resources to have me hired. But I put on a cheery personality and fake being energetic, so that I can (hopefully) be likable and not someone to yell at.

Without getting too specific, I used to sell fake items. Well‚Ä¶ The item I would sell was of great quality and had a simplistic purpose originally, but the promises I made on what it could do beyond that were fabricated. I was a part of a community that bought and sold these items, and shared ""experiences"" with them. I easily made over $15,000 in the year I was doing this, alongside my other income. I only stopped because the workload grew to be too much, and the anxiety I was experiencing just thinking about orders or interacting with the community made it not worth it.

I went through a period of about 2 years where I abruptly started having nausea. Nausea that progressed to vomiting, then starving myself so there was nothing to throw up. This was where I began to become suicidal, fearing that I would always have this, and that it was all caused by my anxiety. At least, that's what the doctors insisted.

The nausea went away on its own, trickling out of my life for two years. And now it has returned, forcing me to take time off work in fear that it could be a certain virus. But deep down, I know that it is probably my anxiety flaring up again. Every time supper comes around, I can feel my heart beat faster, fearing having to eat in front of my family and force down enough that they don't ask questions. In the past my father hasn't made a big deal out of what I was going through, until I landed in the hospital from a suicide attempt. But he has forgotten that, forgotten how much I suffered and now he's mainly worried that if word gets out that I'm sick, my mom could lose her job.

I'm so exhausted from pretending to be high-energy in public, I'm tired of being so fatigued that I can hardly do anything. My favorite hobby is something I haven't touched since moving last year, and I'm finding few reasons to stick around. I feel so incredibly disabled, and that I am a waste of resources to keep alive. I cause so much stress for my parents and I can't bear the guilt anymore. I don't see myself progressing, having a future‚Ä¶ I fantasize of what life would be like if I were to disappear.

I'm tired of trying. It feels like I've been swimming in a bottomless pit for ages with no help to keep my afloat. Government aid has failed me, family aid is nonexistent, and all my friends live in another country. I am scared of the day that I will be kicked out of this house, and I won't be able to bear being on my own. I know if I was by myself I would try to end it, and that only slightly terrifies me.",03Sep2020,1
131,"Tldr; I'm using a new account for privacy, but I really just need to document today and capture my feelings in the moment.

When I was told to bring my mom home to be as comfortable as possible it didn't make sense to me what exactly they were saying, because it was in a totally different language. Raw grief and denial was the new language that I had to learn in 87 days. I needed more time to study this language so that I would know what to do on the final test and not be blindsided over it.. 87 days flew by and now it‚Äôs time. Dreading having to go into work when I need more time remembering her. There is no money tree, and the pandemic kicked my bank accounts ass. I wasn't anticipating the ambulance ride home to be so emotional, it's just like a normal ride home, right?.

It's been the same way home for the past 20 years. The way home that once brought familiarity after a long vacation. The way home that if you fell asleep in the car you could just tell when you were turning onto your street. The way home that would instantly bring you peace and comfort because home was your happy and safe place. The same way home that after a really tough or hard day it was your cure all and nothing could hurt you in your home. I begged the driver to just do one more lap around the city, one more time past her favorite restaurant, one more time past the bank that she worked at for almost her whole life.

Its wednesday which is her day that she goes swimming at the YMCA, why is the driver not fu*king stopping? Walking through the door to be greeted by a hospital bed and not her big comfy sectional just about knocked me out. Stalling the emt crew for as long as i could because what if i get the call that they were wrong. That they mixed up information and diagnosis? You can't leave yet because y‚Äôall are going to have to turn right back around after the dr calls and time is of the essence.

Standing in the doorway blocking the door, why are they in such a damn rush. Until I realized it had been an hour and everyone had tears in their eyes. Suddenly feeling guilty for subjecting those nice people to my hell when they are just trying to do their job.

Guilty that I'm making this about me when it‚Äôs her final ride, not mine.",03Sep2020,1
132,"The pandemic had affected me a lot. I was fine when I went out with people and kept myself busy but being alone in home had affected me alot. I came close to having anxiety attacks and asthma attacks several times. I made some small changes which have helped me a lot. I wanna share some of those changes with you.

1. I deactivated my Facebook account.

Trust me, being on 20 groups and discussing with people you dont agree with or people with a hive mind won't do you any good. If you can't deactivate facebook, try to unfriend people you don't know in real life. 

2. I stopped watching instagram stories. 

People share a lot of their thoughts on the political situation sorrounding them on instagram stories. There are only a few people who will share violence or political opinions on their instagram feed. I don't think watching Karens fighting with managers is more important than your mental health. 

3. I stopped browsing the popular tab on reddit. 

Popular tab is filled with subs showing violence. Karens fighting people and people treating people of a particular race inhumanely used to trigger me a lot. I was sad from inside that I couldn't do anything about the situation.That used to affect me a lot. Now, I have just subscribed to wholesome subreddits and they are enough to make me pass my time without getting triggered. 

4. I avoided any argument on social media.

When someone disagreed with what I had posted or when I disagreed with something others had posted I couldn't stop myself from replying in comments but when I felt like the other person isn't going to change their view even a little bit I would stop. There is no point in arguing over anything that doesn't yeild a positive result. 

5. I started sending time with my family more.

6. I started cooking new dishes when I had nothing to do.

7. I started meditating.

8. I tried to get as much sleep as I could.

9. I started doing light excercises. 

10. I started to learn new things from the internet. (i am currently trying to learn to develop minecraft plugins).

I have tried to keep myself busy at all times and I have avoided most, if not all, online arguements. I have avoided any violent content on social media and I have picked up on some new hobbies. My health has improved a lot. I haven't had a single asthma attack or anxiety attack in the past 2 months. I am more happy than I was.

I am sorry for the long post which may not mean anything to anyone.

Also, English isn't my first language so I am sorry for any grammatical errors I have made.",03Sep2020,1
