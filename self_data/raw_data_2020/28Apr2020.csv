0,"I am a bit new to reddit, so I apologize if this isn’t formatted to placed correctly. Please let me know if I need to correct anything. So Today my sister and I got into a fight. I am Gay and single and she is currently dating a convicted child sex offender.... Our argument started when I found out he was a child sex offender... I was obviously not thrilled at the revelation, but things really went a turn for the worse when she tried to compare my attractions (to normal gay men) to his (multiple 15 year old girls). Even if he was 20-22 at the time, that’s still disgusting by our country’s standards. How do I even begin to deconstruct how wrong she is? Having always been self conscious about my sexuality, it was honestly hurtful to be grouped in with a (statutory) rapist. She lives in Chelsea New York City, working in fashion, so she clearly has extensive experience with the lgbt community, so I was a bit more taken aback by comparison. Any advice is welcome",28Apr2020,1
1,"Now looking back at it, I dont really think of my childhood as a childhood, I just was existing.
Nothing was really fun, I was overweight, starting to get into books, but I dont really have any fun memories. I'm still in school, but I honestly dont know who my friends are, I never really felt a sense of belonging that lasted for a long time. Everyone is now creating their friend groups, and locking them in, while though I'm not sure what to do. I dont know what to do really, and quarantine is making me wanna stop talking to anyone on the phone, because I usually enjoy to talk to people in person. Advice anyone?",28Apr2020,1
2,"Hi,

I mean on dating sites for example, what is considered fake pics and what is not. Is [adding some muscles](http://wetest.ovh/body.php?mn=5) for men or [boobs](http://wetest.ovh/body.php?mn=5) for women acceptable?

Nowadays it seems everything is fake, people cheat all the time about everything.

I have parts of my body and other secondary sex characteristics that make me dysphoric. At some point I realized that I could cope with them when I considered them sexy or inherently sexual. I no longer feel as dysphoric about them, because I've accepted them as long as I was fetishizing my own body, in a way. That sounded better in my head. Do other people do the same thing? I know subconsciously fetishizing things you're afraid of or uncomfortable with is a common coping mechanism, but I've never seen anyone talk about it in this context.",28Apr2020,1

8,"It doesn't even have to be Reddit exclusively: I just want resources and a community that can help me to embrace femininity with open arms. I would like to be a women who is able to look and behave in a feminine manner; a woman who is sensual yet modest in appearance, graceful yet assertive in demeanor. I'm just now beginning to appreciate how wonderful womanhood can be after suppressing it for so long, and I want to make up for lost time.

I don't have much in the way of friends, and I think it'll be difficult in making them face-to-face due to social distancing and whatnot. I also didn't really have many positive women to look up to during my upbringing, nor do I have any at this time. It's rather daunting doing this on your own even when doing research. I just wished that I had gal pals to talk to and hang out with, women who could take me under their wing and assist me in this endeavor to be a feminine woman.

Femininity is sometimes thought of as a weakness, though I personally think that it takes strength to wake up every day to tend to the housework and/or children while your boyfriend/husband is earning a living to make ends meet. I find it so amazing that some women are able to make themselves look so well put together, that they can coordinate such fashionable outfits and wear makeup that accentuates their best features.

To give you an idea of what I'm working with to better help you help me: I am a 5'5 woman who is 23 years old. I have tan skin and features typically found in individuals of significant African descent (broad nose, full lips, kinky hair, etc.) My eyes are rather small and beady, and I'd say that my figure is skinny fat. I'd say that I'm rather plain-looking overall, though I would like to look more polished.

If anyone can give me tips on how to become a feminine woman, be it internally or externally, I would greatly appreciate it.",28Apr2020,1

10,"22 year old female college student here.

Today, my parents sat me down and talked to me about how my grandmother’s health is progressively declining.

She lives a few hours away. She was diagnosed with breast cancer a while back. She finished her radiation therapy about a month ago now, and things seemed to be going well, but recently she has been having major balance and fatigue issues. The doctors aren’t sure what it is, if it’s her cancer or something neurological. She’s due for some MRI scans on Friday.

As of now, it’s gotten so bad that she can’t make trips to the grocery store without getting exhausted halfway through. Her laundry room is downstairs, and the stairs are so steep, my mom is terrified she’ll get dizzy, fall and there might be a terrible accident. She’s already fallen once in the bathroom and broken her nose as a result of her issues with dizziness.

Her friends have offered to help care for her, but she refuses. My mom and I are driving down to see her on Friday to spend some time with her and to take her to her doctor’s appointment. Tonight, I suggested the possibility of her coming to live with us for a while, to take care of her and make sure she’s okay, since she lives alone and doesn’t have anyone else. My dad immediately objected and instead said in-home care at her house would be better for her. I understand where he’s coming from, as he took care of his own mom many years ago when she was sick, and it ended up taking a big toll on him. He said that I wasn’t old enough to understand how big of a responsibility it is to care for someone like that.

Like I said, I understand where he’s coming from and know he’s experienced things I haven’t, but I still felt that saying this to me this wasn’t fair - after all, I’m a fully grown adult, I’m 22 years old. I know he has insight and experience that I don’t have, and I know caring for my grandmother and having her here would be very difficult, more than I can even mentally prepare for, I’m sure - but I AM old enough to make my own decisions and accept certain responsibilities and burdens if I want to take them on. I said this to my dad. He responded, “I get it, you’ve been drinking....” he said some things afterwards but it was all just a blur from then on. I couldn’t believe he’d said that to me.

My dad used to have a drinking problem when I was younger. He had to go to a rehab program for a few months because of it. He’s better now, and didn’t drink at all for a long time - but he does drink now, usually a few glasses of whiskey when he gets home. He doesn’t drink what he used to, but the fact is he still does drink, and I believe even now he drinks more than he should. 

I don’t drink hard liquor at home, ever. The only time I drink hard liquor is if I go out at night to some bars with friends, and that’s maybe once a month - I don’t get out much. When I’m home, I usually drink a couple to a few glasses of wine in the evening, and sometimes a beer or two.

Tonight, I’d had a few glasses. And that’s when my dad said that to me - “you’ve been drinking.”

It hurt. It really hurt. I suddenly just went stone cold. I don’t think he even realized the impact of what he’d said to me. As soon as our conversation was over, I went and emptied out the few bottles of wine down the sink that I had in the pantry/fridge. 

Even if wine and beer is all I drink right now, I realize it could go down the path of me turning to hard liquor some day. Just like it did with my dad. And I never, EVER want someone to be able to use that line “you’ve been drinking” against me, to use it as an excuse to invalidate or dismiss what I’m saying, ever again.",28Apr2020,1

26,"I moved to NYC from a small Midwestern town and pursued music after college. I worked my butt off and found my way into a part-time job at a recording/rehearsal studio in midtown as an engineer and was starting to produce for people on my own. I was finally on a great track for a music career at 26 years old! 

Unfortunately with covid, the studio is shutting down and may not reopen. Obviously, at first, I was pretty devastated. Guys, I worked so hard to get there! But I took a couple weeks to grieve and then made a new game plan: I’m moving home.

I’m going back to school for computer sciences and am going to pursue programming (I’ve done a lot of coding and programming and I actually really love it) AND the program I’m looking at is only 6 months.

My parents offered to let me come home and stay in the guest room (it’s almost like a guest house) so I’ll have my own space rent free! 

I’ve lived in NYC for three years but my two best friends live back home and they want to continue working on music while I’m back. My friend sounds like Sara Bareilles and writes the best music I’ve ever heard in my life, so I’ll get to record with her and release music together.

I was also getting exhausted of the city. It’s been amazing and I’ve learned so much, but I’m honestly just TIRED and have been tired for the last 6 months.

If I decide that I’m truly not happy in the Midwest, I can just come back out to NYC next spring?! I did it once, so I know I can do it again :)

I just wanted to share this because, honestly, I’m very proud of myself for finding the positives in this really trying situation we’re all in. My heart feels excited for these new opportunities and this time to relax and regroup. I feel extremely grateful that I have an opportunity like this. I used to battle depression pretty badly, so for me to be able to set goals and follow a passion, I’ve allowed myself to choose happiness again.

28,"Today is my grandfather's birthday, and I'm scared of losing him. He's still relatively sound and able minded, but this entire Covid-19 thing has made me think about how he's gotten older and how if he gets Covid he's not going to make it. I love him. I don't want him to go.

Last time he visited we were watching some shitty western and there was a burial scene. We proceeded to have a conversation and he told me about my great grandfather's death and how he kissed his father's head before he has buried. It's cliche but he went on to tell me how death is a part of life and to not be sad about it. I know he doesn't want me to but if he were to die sometime soon it would break me.

Dammit, he is one of the only family members I have who is honest with me completely. He doesn't sugarcoat things for me, and he's one of the only family members I know who will unashamedly spill the tea for me and let me in on stuff I can't talk about with my parents. 

I haven't done nearly enough with him, heard enough of his stories. I remember back when I was a kid and my parents would ship me and my sister up to the UP (my grandparents live up there) and my grandfather would take me and my sister places throughout the summer. He let us shoot his rifle, and took us to different cricks and golf courses. 

I remember once when he strapped a canoe he had bought for our visit in the back of his pickup and we drove to Lake Superior. The dog got the front seat of the pickup and me and my sister laid in the back of the pickup truck, tasked with keeping the canoe from escaping. When we pushed the canoe out of the truck and the four of us (me, my sister, my grandfather and the dog) paddled to a nearby beach, the water clear and rippling in that way that the water there does, almost flawless, the  stones visible from feet under the surface. We got out, and the water was cold but it was maybe the most bearable Iv'e ever felt it. Me and my sister found a headstone for the late black lab, and in maybe forty or so minutes we headed back the way we came. 

It's memories like that which make me realize I've already hit some sort of peak. No matter what I accomplish, that was a once in a lifetime sort of thing and I can never go back to the happiness and contentedness I had on that day. My grandfather's no longer fit enough to do that sort of thing with me and my sister, and he prefers to lie on the couch and watch golf nowadays anyway.

Will I have to interact with this person professionally? Will this person still show up at random in my life, maybe just bump into each other at a store? Is what the person did really that bad for me? Etc. So when I do pull that trigger, I do so in the full knowledge of what the fallout can be and I'm fine with it.

CW: mention of a suicide attempt

I developed a food allergy. Idk to what. I’ve gotten a reaction from spicy instant noodles and microwave popcorn.

Because I’ve been so worried about it, I’ve been overreacting to everything. I can’t take a full breath? I must be allergic! (I’m trans and I bind my chest, I already impaired my breathing from overuse) My lips tingled for no reason, but they look fine in the mirror? I must be allergic! (When I actually get a reaction, they get red and swollen)

It led me to thinking I must be allergic to corn, even though I didn’t actually get a reaction from other foods with corn...

I realized this, and now I can’t believe myself. I tried to kill myself years ago because I couldn’t believe a single word I said, so it scares me.

I got angry at myself and ate a whole bag of popcorn. I got a reaction. I also felt dizzy, which is a sign that my allergy is *severe* and I’ve been downplaying it. It went away after 10 minutes. But still.

55,"I’d like to start this post by saying that I’m not trying to belittle the experience of actual trans or non-binary people, they have my full support. This is simply my own experience with questioning my identity.

Basically I’ve been questioning my gender on and off since I was 13 (now 20). The main impetus for this was some very overwhelming and frequent fantasies where I would be a girl. I’d always feel tremendous happiness while in these fantasies followed by crushing despair when I snapped back to reality. This had kind of lined up with what I had seen and later heard from trans people. I went through periods where I thought I was certain I was trans and almost immediately after anytime I would decide to seek help for this, I would decide that definitely wasn’t. This has been a cycle for me since then. Uncertainty, followed by certainty, followed by uncertainty. 

I’ve never officially sought out any gender affirming procedures (I hope that’s a correct term) and as of right now do not plan to. I feel like for a long time I would disregard an important piece of the puzzle, which is that I also fantasise about being a different man. 

The common denominator wasn’t actually being a woman it was being someone other than me. Someone with different characteristics both physically and mentally. That’s another aspect I failed to realise, when I was fantasising about being a woman I wasn’t being me. I was someone completely different. Different habits, thoughts, actions, motives... I was basically playing a character. The characters were always sociable, happy, and easy going, whereas I was (and am) anxious, irritable and sad. 

They also had physical traits that matched what I thought people like this would look like. If they were a woman they were pretty, they had delicate features, curves, and wore little to no makeup.

67,Last year I was pregnant with twins and things in the family were great the father was there for me and ended up trusting his toxic mom ( she is narcissistic and abusive to her son ) with how I felt with expresing my fears of being a mom.  My babies were born early im telling this story because I haven't been treated fairly since they have been born. It started when child protective services was called and I had recently found out the hospital called because on top of having my baby girls ripped from me we were in the middle of an eviction and possibly had to get rid of my dog because I was going to be homless and that made me upset and had to cut our visit in the NICU short that day. it felt my fears of being a new low income mom were being confirmed and I dont think that was the only reason given I had been honest about my learning disabilities and mental health. Little did I know when it came time for them to come home things would become worse and my fears of being a mom were becoming too real and I havent even done any thing wrong. There was some drama with our families and the father and my mom and I had been argueing that day so we stayed with his mom only one of our girls was with us at the time because our other daughter had an unknown condition at the time. The baby that was home had an appointment the next day and her father wanted to argue at the appointment in the middle of the hospital about the prior events with my mom and I ended up being tossed in the psych ward and was abused in there. I came out of the psych ward with bruises and blood on the sweater I wore only to find out his mom had convinced him to break up with me and had him file to take the girls away and later found out she convinced him I was cheating and that cps is still involved and put BOTH babies with her because she told cps I was going to kill them. Since then the father realized how toxic his mom is and trying to work things out with me and im trying to trust him again. But I am telling this story because how people with mental illness are being treated differently and diacriminated against. But this isnt even the whole story. I want people to know how unjust this is. Soo the new generation of parents can know what might come if you are a soon to be parent with mental illness.

Moments later my mom dragged me off through the halls of the theater as if we were late to a movie. I was a little kid again with an Ice cream sandwich in one hand and my mom dragging me but another. The sandwich was melting and falling apart and making a mess all over the floors and my mom was yelling at me about making a mess. I remember she then pushed me through doors into a theater then leaving me. I felt so betrayed. She abandoned me. My younger sister than found me and I woke up at 5 am this morning. It's now 10 am and this dream has been on my mind since. I don't know if it's because I got to confront my bully or because my mom betrayed me. Right at this moment I think it's both.

85," Today is my grandfather's birthday, and I'm scared of losing him. He's still relatively sound and able minded, but this entire Covid-19 thing has made me think about how he's gotten older and how if he gets Covid he's not going to make it. I love him. I don't want him to go.

Last time he visited we were watching some shitty western and there was a burial scene. We proceeded to have a conversation and he told me about my great grandfather's death and how he kissed his father's head before he has buried. It's cliche but he went on to tell me how death is a part of life and to not be sad about it. I know he doesn't want me to but if he were to die sometime soon it would break me.

Dammit, he is one of the only family members I have who is honest with me completely. He doesn't sugarcoat things for me, and he's one of the only family members I know who will unashamedly spill the tea for me and let me in on stuff I can't talk about with my parents.

I haven't done nearly enough with him, heard enough of his stories. I remember back when I was a kid and my parents would ship me and my sister up to the UP (my grandparents live up there) and my grandfather would take me and my sister places throughout the summer. He let us shoot his rifle, and took us to different cricks and golf courses.

I remember once when he strapped a canoe he had bought for our visit in the back of his pickup and we drove to Lake Superior. The dog got the front seat of the pickup and me and my sister laid in the back of the pickup truck, tasked with keeping the canoe from escaping. When we pushed the canoe out of the truck and the four of us (me, my sister, my grandfather and the dog) paddled to a nearby beach, the water clear and rippling in that way that the water there does, almost flawless, the stones visible from feet under the surface. We got out, and the water was cold but it was maybe the most bearable Iv'e ever felt it. Me and my sister found a headstone for the late black lab, and in maybe forty or so minutes we headed back the way we came.

It's memories like that which make me realize I've already hit some sort of peak. No matter what I accomplish, that was a once in a lifetime sort of thing and I can never go back to the happiness and contentedness I had on that day. My grandfather's no longer fit enough to do that sort of thing with me and my sister, and he prefers to lie on the couch and watch golf nowadays anyway.

I'm going to miss my grandfather when he's gone.",28Apr2020,1

90,"I'm writing this on a Tuesday in April. I suppose it doesn’t really matter which day it is really, only that it is 2 days after what was my 10,000th day on this Earth. 

I can imagine what you’re thinking. 10,000 days on Earth is a pretty big milestone, I’ve officially added the last zero column to the total days of my life. I must have celebrated with a little party, or at the very least quietly acknowledged this milestone. And I assure you I would have, however I only became aware of the fact yesterday on what was my 10,001st day. 

It was in fact merely hours into my 10,001st day as I sat on my sofa at 4am that I became aware that I had missed the occasion. Though unbeknownst to me, my 10,000th day on Earth would not be accompanied by a well-rested night and so I sat mindlessly plugged into the internet when I stumbled across a website that calculated statistics about your life, the first one being how many days I had been alive.

I gazed into the cold blue glow at the 10,0001 displayed in bold black font, my eyes felt like they were carving the arc of each perfect zero until they reached that bitter “1” at the end. I tried to tell myself that 10,001 was more symmetrical anyway, but inside I knew that it wasn’t nearly as special.

After some refletion I felt my hands almost instinctively creep back to the keys and enter in a particular day. Not just any day of course but the birthday of my Grandma.

33,076. Just a number. Entirely and utterly meaningless to most, but to me that number meant so much more. It meant sleepovers with Eggo Waffles in the morning, it meant walking to the park and talking about our favorite Baseball team. What may be just a number to some is a pillar of my life. 

I didn’t know her for most of the days she was on this Earth, and I often wonder what her first 10,000 days were like. What was she doing on her 10,0002nd day? Maybe she was complaining about missing her 10,000th as well. How differently would I see her if we had grown up together instead of 20,000 days apart? We go through lives never seeing the full picture and only knowing each other through a certain lens. Through my lens she was never anything other than my Grandma, yet in those same 33,076 days she had only ever been a mother to some, a daughter to others. For a woman I can only imagine as my Grandma, there are many who only ever knew her as a little girl. That is the very fabric that is stitched together to create our legacies, the compilation of snapshots in time all from different angles.  

Someday I will be 20,000 days old, and when that day comes I will probably be blissfully unaware yet again. And this time I won’t be bothered, because celebrating the number is meaningless, it is the memories that are priceless.",28Apr2020,2

102,"I love video games. I do. Haven't played them all, or all the greats, but the ones I have played, I love. But then comes Resident Evil 6. I still have nightmares about RE6. I was taking a shower this morning and it randomly popped back into my head, like a traumatic memory I buried. I cannot express how much I despise this game, but I'll try. I bought this game when I was fresh inbetween jobs. I had left this frustrating door-to-door sales job in August 2013 and used my last paycheck to buy this game used at a Gamestop near my workplace. I liked Resident Evil 4 and I also liked 5 despite how many people hated 5. But this game... Ooh boy! 

I have never, in my life, played a game as bad as Resident Evil 6. I know, realistically, worst games exist out there. But this game is like Terminator Dark Fate or The Last Jedi: It COULD'VE been so much better and had the budget to be so, but was everything it shouldn't have been. To make a game THIS bad, with THIS kind of AAA video game budget, in THIS era of gaming, is inexcusable. This game was so bad, I legitimately never finished it. I like bad movies and can enjoy some of the worst films on the planet, like About Last Summer and Ax' Em. But things that have the budget to be good and still end up awful, are the worst kind of bad. This wasn't a lack of resources or inexperience. Just like those movies I mentioned earlier, making a game this bad with the money and talent you have is truly infuriating. It isn't an incompetently made game. It's a game that's bad due to malice. Just like The Last Jedi can be competently shot, edited, filmed, and have CG applied to it, but still infuriate people despite being technically sound. But is RE6 even technically sound?

As stated, I bought this game inbetween jobs. So I had plenty of time to play it. What can I say about the almost sadistic choices made in this game? Why are the health bars so bad? And so few? Why does EVERY zombie require Mario Party levels of controller shaking to get them off you? Why is the game SO DAMN HARD, even on the easiest difficulty? Why doesn't a single enemy flinch whenever I shoot them? They charge at you fully and even a full clip doesn't stop them. Then, when they grab you, it takes an insane amount of effort to get them off of you. Why is the story SO BAD? And FILLED WITH SO MUCH CRAP?

This is one of the only games in my life i've changed the difficulty early on while playing. And even on Easy mode, the game is still too hard. The ammo is also too limited. And yeah, I get it. The original RE games were like this; limited resources. But after Resident Evil 4 (my first RE game, to be honest) and RE5, why would they then go back to the ""limited resources"" survival horror thing from the first few games? While also not being scary at all? I had so much damn trouble in that damn sewer/lab level with Leon. I changed the difficulty to the easiest setting and still nearly broke my controller with shaking zombies off me and constantly not having enough ammo to make it through. I am sure not a single person actually playtested this game. At least not for quality. Maybe a quick bug check (though I encountered those, too) but not for if the game is actually fun or not.

This is the only video game in my entire life I never finished. I couldn't do it. I don't hate myself enough to keep playing Resident Evil 6. I've finished Ride to Hell: Retribution because my then-boyfriend dared me too and I had more fun with that than I did RE6. (It wasn't even that bad of a game.) But RE6... This is one of only two games in my entire life I have tried to return back to Gamestop. The other was Dragon Ball GT Transformation on the Game Boy Advance and I was young when that was a thing. I think they offered me 75 cents at Gamestop to buy RE6 back. Literally 75 cents. I couldn't accept that. I wanted to literally trash the game, but because I spent part of my last paycheck on it, I couldn't bare to do so. I eventually just left it on a park bench, with the case halfway open so people couldn't assume it was an empty box, and hoped maybe some poor kid would get more joy out of it than I would. I then later returned, hoping to take it back and not pass along such a curse to another innocent human being, but the game case (and game) was already gone. Someone took it. Whoever you are, I am SO SORRY I accidentally exposed you to Resident Evil 6. I hope you can forgive me!

Resident Evil 6, is without a doubt, in my top three list for worst pieces of media EVER. Not even video games, but any form of entertainment. It's probably number two of ""worst works of fiction ever"" on my list, if we're being honest. Only the 2009 ""we're totally not a porn movie"" movie, [Warriors of the Apocalypse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1279329/), ranks as something worse than Resident Evil 6. And at least that movie has the excuse of inexperience and lack of budget. 

For all the mess people give video games like Anthem or Fallout 76, which were merely incompetent games, Resident Evil 6 was actually - supposedly - playtested and checked for quality. And it still released like this. Even The Last Jedi, Terminator Dark Fate, and The Killing Joke animated film (a movie I hate almost as equally), rank higher on the list than Resident Evil 6. That is how much I hate this f--king game. This absolute nightmare of an experience I wasted my money on while between jobs. This game I bought instead of something like Dark Souls 2 or Street Fighter 4. I will never forget the absolute agony and torture that it was playing Resident Evil 6. I wanted to play RE2 Remake, but keep having PTSD flashbacks to RE6. This is, the worst game I've ever played in my life. And I say that with absolute zero hyperbole.",28Apr2020,1
106,"Hi, the gender that I was born with is female. And I’ve always identified as cis female. But lately I’ve been confused. I started dating a trans female about five months ago and I love her very much. She definitely made me think more about gender and I’ve discovered I like they/them pronouns, but I also like she/her pronouns. I haven’t told anyone and honestly I don’t even know if she/they is valid but I feel very comfortable with both those pronouns and honestly if I were told to drop one I wouldn’t be able to choose. I haven’t told anyone about how I feel because I’m scared that it’s not valid. And if it is valid, I have no interest in coming out to my family. Because I still like she/her pronouns and don’t mind also being called those I dont want to put myself through the stress of coming out. Even though my mom and dad have been quite accepting when I came out as lesbian I’m still nervous that they wouldn’t understand or make fun of me, especially my mom. So basically my questions are: 1. Is she/they valid even if I don’t come out to my family and only to my friends and my girlfriend? 2: what term is used for she/they individuals? 3: If I like women and identify as she/they, am I still a lesbian?

I oppose the idea that some voices are more valuable than others, as value is a subjective measure. I dream of a world where all voices are heard, and all voices are equal. I am using my voice to share my thoughts on the state of the world, and I would love to hear your thoughts too.",28Apr2020,1

119,"I just want to go to my GF's place, and I keep telling myself that next week I'll be in a place where I can do so without feeling like I'm a bad person for contributing to the pandemic but that hasn't happened yet. She's less worried than I am, and has invited me over a couple of times and it kills me saying no. We're both young and healthy and live alone, and I'm really not worried about getting it so much as I am about spreading it. It's more guilt than concern for myself. 

I work from home and do a decent but not great job staying inside, though I do go to the store more than I probably should. She doesn't get to work from home, and interacts with plenty of people at her job. If I visited her I know it would make me happy, but I'd also be racked with guilt thinking that I might be asymptomatic and give it to her, and she goes to work and spreads it to the coworkers/customers. I know I'm doing the 'right thing', but at a certain point I'm going to say 'fuck it' and go see her. Neither of us live/interact with any family members who are at significant risk, neither of us are likely to have any serious issues if we do get it, and our city is not one of the hardest hit. I tell myself all that and start to feel like I could go see her, but than I feel selfish and change my mind because even though neither of us are at significant risk or live with anybody who is, I have no idea if that's the case for her coworkers/customers. 

This was mostly just a rant to get my feelings out. Is anybody else going through a similar thing? At what point are you gonna give up and go visit your friends/partners?",28Apr2020,1

128,"Dear diary,

Today was an emotional day as I miss my friends and just messaging and calling them isn’t enough.

Also to the comment on my last entry I realised that I would actually need to stop talking to her but the thing is I am scared of the backlash it would cause so I’m going to do it in little steps instead of all at once.

So I will start by not even messaging her as I’m sick of putting in all the effort.",28Apr2020,1
129,"For months I ate lots of healthy food because my dietician told me to. I didn’t touch Mc Donald’s, chips, soda etc at all for months. I felt pretty good, I was very positive. So last week my mom bought a lot of chips and nutella and coca cola and stuff, so I thought “okay why not just eat that, I’m not going to feel any different right?” Well I was wrong. In only 7 days I’ve been eating chips, cola and Mc Donald’s almost every day and I feel absolutely horrible. I’ve never been this short tempered before, I get aggressive so easily, I was so positive just 2 weeks ago and now I can’t stop thinking about how messed up as a person I am and don’t deserve to feel happy. Please stay eating healthy guys, don’t eat too much junk food",28Apr2020,1
130,"I'm 23F, but I live with my family, as I'm a recent uni graduate currently looking for a job. Being stuck with family during this pandemic period presents positives and negatives. One negative is that my mom discourages me from job searching. She doesn't get why I'm job searching during this time and why I won't stay ""content"" with the way things are at this moment. 

Literally, with every interview or job offer, my mom acts skeptically. I will write one example of this below. 

I recently got hired by a tutoring company. They send me possible tutoring opportunities regarding various students, and if I'm interested in a particular student and subject area, I just have to let them know to get the student. Commitment to each student is 1 year. Tutoring is done online right now, but it will switch over to in-person when the quarantine is over. I've been working as a private tutor for a self employment gig for a long time, so tutoring is nothing new. I took this position to get the momentum going and have something different than self-employment on my resume while looking for a ft job during this very difficult time. 

My mom is blaming me for taking this position. She says that this job will do nothing to boost my profile and that it will become a huge burden when the quarantine measures relax. I said I can use this still to get extra income during ft job working after the end of quarantine (will just have to work around scheduling and commuting. I was thinking of doing this tutoring during the weekend or after the business hours like after 5pm),  but she says that it will make me more tired and increase the tax amount I would have to pay. She asked why I just didn't get more students through self-employment when it makes no difference whether I do it through tutoring company or not. There's no job profile boost because according to her, this job is a low-tier, useless job that is similar to my previous jobs.

It's creating me anxiety, and I am wondering now if I did make a stupid decision. Is there really no difference between self-employment tutoring and tutoring company in the eyes of an employer? Am I really shooting myself in the foot by committing to at least one year for this tutoring company?

I don't know when economy will become better. I don't know if I will be able to get a ft job after quarantine measures are gone. I thought it's good to get any opportunity at this point, whether it's a gig pt or not. 

With every interview or job offer, I want to hear motivating statements like ""Good luck!"" or ""Congratulations!"" Instead, I am chastitised for having too many plates on the table. I am scolded for applying to various opportunities that she thinks I won't be able to handle if I get several offers. I am met with questions like ""Is that company real?"" or ""What are you going to do when they ask you to sign a contract? Providing social insurance number is dangerous."" I am also in an employment program that helps with job search. She says the folks in the program are just helping me because they will get $ once I get hired and that they will push me to get any job regardless of whether it's safe or not. 

Basically, she doesn't understand why I'm anxiously job searching when I have food on my table and roof over my head. I feel so demotivated and unsupported as she doesn't understand why I'm ""trying"" right now.",28Apr2020,1
132,"All the focus is on getting the most yield per dollar spent. There is very little to zero care about what materials are used. 

Using PVC pipes to do hydroponics and ignoring the fact that UV light disintegrates the plastic.

Why is plastic used in everything even though it disintegrates and poisons the water? Because it is cheap and easy; and that is how you make real money. Making sure people don't get cancer after ingesting 30 years worth of this crap isn't profitable. Oh and ""organic"" farming doesn't guarantee a plastic-free environment.
