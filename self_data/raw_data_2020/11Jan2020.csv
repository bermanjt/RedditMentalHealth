0,"About a year ago, I uploaded a post about making suicide plan on this subreddit. The moderator of this subreddit soon deleted my post, highly suggesting me to get some help from r/SuicideWatch or some national call centres. 

You know what? The country I was born is very famous with very high suicide rate and the government is so stupid so it doesn't know how to help suicidal people rather than just leaving them to suffer in psychological pain and just kill themselves anyway (for those who might wanna figure out what country that might be, I'll give you some hints: Samsung, Kimchi and Hangul). So instead of listening to what pseudo-anti-suicide service provided by powerless association, I decided to share my stories on SuicideWatch subreddit. 

Wanna know what happened? Not many people cared about my story. I know that my story may come quite unrelatable to others as I am a man with Autism Spectrum Disorder II with depression and have experiences with child abuse (as a victim), school bullying, family breakdown and so on (I really hate my life going this bad and nobody thinks that I am being real). 

I gave up trying to get any mental support from others. Instead, until I totally lose my sanity, I am going to squeeze out my ability of sharing emotions with others to help them getting out of suicidal thoughts. I am the only one that deserves pain. I am not going to let pure souls be in mental issues caused by terrible situations they have been into (sexual assaults, suicide of beloved person, etc. These stories are quite easy to find). 

What a funny man I am. I have no power to save myself but I try to save others.",11Jan2020,1

2,"I woke up in a nightmare, having serious headaches and dehydration that felt real. Even though what happened in nightmare is not real in this real world, what I felt in the nightmare felt ""real"". I was locked in a small room made out of concrete, having one small window and a CRT television in front of me and a door made out of steel. Two small kids were playing with bricks (not like Lego bricks, the bricks that people use for building a house), injuring themselves and bleeding but never cried. A chair made out of steel that I was sitting on had some spikes. I could not move. I couldn't speak. All I could do was watching that TV which displays nothing but radio noise, letting the kids to keep losing their blood and keep their creepy smile. 

Nothing tried to harm me directly, but I hate what I saw in that nightmare world.",11Jan2020,1

So when he walked into my office and I jovially told him Neil Peart had died today I thought we were going to do our comic exchange.

And it sort of started off that way but he steered the joke to ""what a ridiculous and cruel way to break the news of somebody's favorite musician"" and my efforted replies werent really landing.

I have contacted the FCC,Syfy channel, and cox cable and they do mot know what it is. They cannot access archived records that far back. I have tried searching online in different forums, reddit, quora, and facebook. I have contacted many people and different organizations about the television scenes that I saw. In one scene there is a woman in a red dress with blond hair sitting alone in a pitch black room that resembles Marilyn Monroe. She disappears in a semi dark room into thin air. I think there is a green light and she is sitting next to it in a brown chair. She is wearing a skin tight red dress and she is a Caucasian woman. The character might be Tricia Helfer the actress from Battlestar Galactica. I saw the scene in 2013 along with other scenes that day possibly on August 16 or maybe February 15.It was around 2:00 pm that day that I saw the scenes. In another scene a man uses keys or lockpicks to unlock a door while standing next to another woman that is panicking. The door was brown and both people were Caucasian. The man was struggling to use whatever was against the doorknob to unlock the door. It seemed like it was keys on a keychain or small lockpicks to get the door open with the correct device. The two actors were unknown in the scene. In another scene a man and a woman encounter a room with racks of weapons in a semi dark room. The room had a light green hue to it next to the weapons. The two actors are unknown. In the end credits a woman is speaking while the credits are rolling and the area looks like a military base and she says whoever is watching us must know what is going on and is definitely testing us.

Also, just recently I beat cancer (which wasn‚Äôt fun) and this is like the only gift I want for going through all that disgusting crap this past summer.

There's this girl(17F) in my biology class I sit next to that I think is cute. She's intelligent, well-spoken and we have a lot of the same interests. I want to ask her, but she's unpopular and bullied a lot. I told my friend I liked her; they said:‚Äù she's so gross and weird.‚Äù why would you ever want her? She's a loser.‚Äù

She doesn't party or drinks at all, but she's bullied and rumored to be a sl\*t. Honestly, because she's unpopular, I lost a lot of respect for her and told her I don't want to be seen talking to her because of my reputation. Would you date an unpopular girl? Are my friends right that sl\*ts are weird and gross? Should I have no respect for this girl?",11Jan2020,1
19,"I hate expectations. Everyone has them, whether it be low or high expectations. Ever since a kid, I‚Äôve been labeled gifted or whatever, brilliant or whatever, way ahead of my grade level. Able to grasp concepts so quickly and think so differently. Everyone expects me to go off to college and be some engineer or some mathematician or something of that sort. I hate it. Why does everyone expect me to follow that path. I hate to disappoint, and when everyone expects so much of me, it‚Äôs really a burden that I didn‚Äôt ask for. My issue is, I‚Äôm not motivated in terms of my education, I love to learn and I find mathematics such a beautiful thing, yet I do not want me life to revolve around my education until  I get some bullshit degree just to spend most of my life working. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Math is fun, the feeling of solving problems and what not. But in the long run. I‚Äôd rather not. I want to become a investor. Investing in real estate and paper assets, investing in and starting my own businesses. That‚Äôs what I would like to do. Why? Because it‚Äôs a tool or a way for me to achieve what I, and I alone want, which is a way for me to just truly enjoy this one life I‚Äôve been blessed with. To travel the world, to not stress, to not have to wake up at 9 and come home at 5. I don‚Äôt want to conform. Life is truly short, really short, and definitely not long enough for me to be going to college and get a degree that will be useless to me inevitably, because that‚Äôs not what I want. The same thing I want can be achieved without a degree. Yet everyone want‚Äôs to have a say in my life and future. I don‚Äôt want to do it, yet I also don‚Äôt want to disappoint. Will be doing what I want be a waste of a gift because I didn‚Äôt want to pursue what others wanted me to? Am I in the wrong for wanting a say in my life?

I cant accept someone fixing me for me, because I know its something only I can do myself, but I dont want to have to do it.

21,"This is a long read, there's a lot to the issues that I'm having.  

My senior year of high school, I started dating this girl that I'd had a crush on for a while.  We had a lot in common, and it was my first relationship in my life that I felt was actually serious.  The relationship was honestly intoxicating, we had great sexual chemistry, we hung out almost every single day, and texted or facetimed whenever we weren't together.  We dated for essentially the whole year and part of the summer, and we ended up breaking up near the end of the summer, because we were going to different universities in different states.  I was incredibly sad, but we ended on okay terms at the time.  

The first event that occurred between us after the breakup really fucked me up.  We saw each other about a month after the breakup at a performance (we're both musicians and played together a lot), and we met up at 2am in my car after the gig after a text exchange.  We hooked up in my back seat and afterward, I confessed that I was still very much in love with her and wanted her, and she told me about how she began hooking up with and dating a childhood friend of hers that she'd known all of her life, very shortly(within a week) after we broke up.  This event was a mindfuck.  From my perspective, she'd just cheated on him with me, and then told me about their relationship and sex life(really unnecessary and fucked me up).  

A couple small events happened after this.  I got super drunk at a party and called her late at night, and vaguely remember calling her a sex addict.  I was wasted, and definitely regret this.  We didn't talk or meet for a while, both went to college, and then began exchanging a few texts every once in a while.  We had a few drunk encounters where I would text her and confess my love while I was drunk, and she once texted me and told me about how badly she regretted hurting me in the aftermath of our relationship.  

We fell out of contact for several months, and I texted her out of the blue one day telling her that I was over her(I really wasn't) and I was happy that she was a part of my life.  We had a short and amicable conversation, and didn't speak for a while after this.  I felt somewhat more at peace.  

Things started happening very quickly around this time.  I got a very angry text from her one day.  Very shortly after our breakup, I'd shared a few of her nudes in a discord chat with some friends (very much regret this) and one of them had saved the pictures.  Later, he got drunk and told her current boyfriend that he had these nudes, and they'd obviously come from me.  She was very angry at me, and demanded that both he and I delete anything of her, and told me to leave her alone.  

The fact that she cheated on her boyfriend with me was really bugging me for all of that year.  After a period of no contact, I texted her and told her that her boyfriend deserved to know about her infidelity and that if she didn't tell him, I would.  She got very angry at this, and told me that he already knew, and to leave her alone.  I did, we haven't spoken since this event.  

My headspace right now is just really weird.  I've had a few purely sexual flings in college, but I haven't dated anyone seriously since her, and that was 4 years ago at this point.  I both miss her, and I also miss the emotional connection of having a girlfriend in general.  We talked every day and I loved that.  I crave someones affection.  I'll go weeks or sometimes even months without thinking about her, and then I'll have a really vivid dream about her and spiral back into feelings of longing for her and a relationship.  I also have a lot of regrets about the way I treated her.  I want to talk to her and at least explain that I'm sorry and regret the way I acted after our relationship, but I'm almost positive that she dislikes me and has no interest in hearing from me.  She's also dated two people since me, and one for almost two years, so I'm sure she probably doesn't even think about me at all anymore, I'm most likely just a distant bad memory of a high school boyfriend.  How can I reach closure? Should I try to talk to her? I'd really like to but I'm worried that I would just be shot down and make myself look worse. I'm very concerned that I've been dealing with these feelings of missing her and affection for almost 4x the length of our actual relationship, and how weird this looks to an outsider.",11Jan2020,1

25,"So, this is a long story, but for some context, I'm an 8th grader and used to be very anti-social. I've gotten way better but still not that great at talking to people face to face. Anyway, here's the story. In November, I had recently become single again (it was a long relationship and it wasn't anything big.) I had liked this other girl for a while but always knew I didn't have a chance. So anyway, in November she posted something on her snap chat story where you can send anonymous messages. the prompt was boyfriend applications (She didn't want a boyfriend, just wanted to know who was interested) So I submitted one. When she posted her response, she said to text her. So of course, I did. She asked me if I was still dating the other girl and then left me on read. That was it for a week other than streaks. A while later I posted an anonymous message thing on my story, and she said I was pretty cute. a couple of days later, we were talking a little. We talked for a while but in the end, she basically rejected me. Cut to the first December break: She posted that she wanted to play I message games. I said I would, and we had a good convo and played some games. I genuinely felt good about it. For the rest of the break, we talked all day every day. On that Friday, she asked if she could wear my sweatshirt at school. I was hyped. Best thing to happen my entire vacation. So come to Monday, I gave it to her. Then the next day the same thing happened. On that Thursday, I asked her if she would rather be asked out at school or a football game. She said a football game, so I was gonna ask her out the next day at the game. The entire night was composed of basically three sections: Me being super nervous, Us talking and people pressuring me to ask her out, and then the aftermath of when I asked her out. 1. When I got there, I saw where she was and sat next to her. It was kinda boring since we were both on our phones, so when she went with her friends, I didn't follow. When my friend (Who had been giving me advice for this entire thing from the start.) showed up, I hung out with him and he finally leads it to: 2. I was hanging out with her and some of her friends, and it was pretty fun. There were a lot of people that came over to us and pressured me to make the move. One kid even pushed me into her. Halftime, though, was a different story. She had no idea how many people were at the game, so when halftime came, she had a panic attack. This wasn't just an over-reaction. She had a full panic attack. I offered to buy her a water but she declined. I felt really bad about that. Eventually, we kept talking, and we got in a small group with some people. 3. While we were in that group, people kept bringing up that I was gonna ask her out. Apparently, a TON of people knew already that I was gonna do it. She kept nudging me to do it, which was strange considering that at first, she didn't wanna give me a chance. So I did it. I asked her out, and almost immediately she went to go do something in the stands. It was way too full, so I stood away with the kid giving me advice. Shen she came back down, we kinda hung out, but nothing really exciting happened. When she was about to leave, I went for a high-five but she hugged me. The rest of the night was just me talking to people I've never talked to before because now I was dating the most popular girl. Over the weekend, we talked for a bit, but again, nothing really important happened. On Monday, though, when we walked out to the busses together, she broke up with me. The exact quote is, ""You seem like a nice guy, but I just don't think I'm ready for a relationship right now."" I Didn't feel any emotion at the moment. When I got on the bus I told people and posted on my story that we had broken up. I then made probably the worst decision I could have. I sent her streaks as a joke. This might not seem like a big deal, and it feels stupid typing it out now, but I really regret it. After a couple of weeks of us having a streak, we started having conversations again. I really liked talking to her because I still thought I had a chance.  We kept talking while my friend was giving me advice. Then, she just stopped talking to me. She didn't answer anything I sent her. I was kinda worried that I did something wrong, so I asked my friend about it. I don't remember what he said, but it wasn't that important. Nothing really happened for a couple of days. Then my friend said she had said something to him. He told me this: ""She doesn't wanna date you because your styles don't match."" Keep in mind, he wrote this on a note, so i had no idea what he was talking about. After class, he explained, ""She likes you, but she doesn't think that your styles would match, which is a mature decision by her because she didn't want to hurt you by saying no just because you don't match her."" He also said some other stuff which I'll summarize. She liked me a lot, but she just couldn't date me because no matter what, some part of her brain just said that our styles don't match. Before she stopped answering me, I thought we were gonna get closer again.  now, I'm just stuck thinking about all the things I did wrong. I can't confront her about it because I'm too scared that she's just gonna make me seem like a creep for wanting to get back together. I've been trying to get over her for a while and I just can't. I'm not gonna date her, even if I have the chance because it's just been too much confusion so far. At the same time, I want to have a meaningful relationship with her. This isn't a call for advice or anything, I just wanted to know what the opinions are on this. Also: \*I know a lot of this seems dumb, but it's middle school stuff and I don't understand it either, but it's what I did because it felt nice.\*",11Jan2020,1

30,"Because this was immediately downvoted elsewhere.

A few nights ago, I went to a hangout at a friends' house. A ton of people went, but it was totally relaxed: eating, playing games, singing songs. Totally safe fun. On the way out, I told one of the hosts bye, and he gave me a hug. It left my ears ringing.

He's married, ya'll.

When we first became friends, everyone in our little clique would make comments about how similar we were. If there was a movie I liked, someone pointed out that it was his favorite, too. If I made a joke, someone pointed out that it was the kind of humor he liked. A mutual friend tried to link us up to talk about a certain show that apparently no one else knew about/liked aside from the both of us. One friend went so far as to say that we were virtually the same person (which, for his own sake, I hope is false). He was smart, kind, clever, loving. I couldn't run from the fact that I was developing a crush on him.

When I worked up the nerve to at least tell him, he started to date. About two years later, he got married.

Before the engagement (before he was dating openly), I told a mutual friend that I had a crush on him. She looked at me so sweetly and told me that it's natural, and that it meant I had an attraction for good men. So well intended. But she was talking to me like I was a five year old with a crush on their teacher. It was the nicest way she could tell me I didn't have a chance, which I knew. But it made me feel so small and stupid.

A few months before the wedding, I told my therapist that for some reason, it really hurt to see him get married. I wasn't sure why I couldn't move on, and it made me nauseous to see the news about their impending wedding all over my feed. She asked me if I thought he had feelings for me, and I had to admit that I didn't. She condescendingly said ""*Thank you*,"" and told me that I just wanted what he and his soon-to-be wife had.

I'm so tired of being spoken to like I'm a child with a puppy crush. I'm not deluded - I know he doesn't like me back, I know it wasn't meant to be, I know that it can't and shouldn't happen, I know that everything I feel is irrational and stupid. It hurt so much to bite my tongue and smile as friends talked about their relationship without being able to admit that I was jealous, but didn't want to be. I was scared of being looked at like a party pooper, or an idiot, but I also knew that it wasn't about me or some stupid feelings. As if that didn't hurt, someone mistakenly assumed that I was his fiance a few weeks later, and I had to explain that that guess was way off and point them to the lucky lady.

**I don't want to like him.** I want to be able to give him a hug and tell him how happy I am for both of them, and actually mean it completely. Because they are truly wonderful together.

TL;DR: I have a crush on a friend who is now married. I am tired of it.

34,"We went out for my birthday, my mom, 2 best friends and sister. My dad couldn't go cause his stoke had affected him 10xs more than he expected. That's ok. My mom kept asking me what I wanted in the last week. Every time I asked her she would say, ""But is that REALLY what you want?"" Like she had to make me feel guilty for saying something. So I came up with something. I thought of a booster box of the current Pokemon TCG set. I would love that. It's so much fun. I love the game. I'm 28, yes I enjoy the game.   


After we get home, my mom tells me that I'm not allowed to drive the car after tonight because I crashed her car last Friday. A week before my birthday. As if I did it on purpose. That's how he sees it. Yes, totaled as fuck. I almost hit a deer and the road was slick and I slid off the road and between 2 trees. I was lucky I got out alive but with a seat belt bruise. At this point, I wish that the accident took my life. Not in a suicidal way, but because all I'm doing is causing problems or no one wants me around. The fuck else am I suppose to do? What the fuck am I suppose to prove? I can't do anything right my stepdad.

Everyone acts as if I went out of my way to fuck up her car. That means, I'm out of a car, I'm out of a ""job"" (door dash) and I can't go anywhere. I am in the MIDDLE of nowhere.

I have no way of anything with it. It needs new everything. I fucking hate my car.   


I am trying to save up what money I have to buy a new car or to give to my mom, whatever comes first. She is making me feel like shit about her car. Non-stop. He makes me want to jump off a roof.

36,"I‚Äôm 23 and used to bake growing up. I started off just sitting on the kitchen counter watching my mom bake. I was maybe three; very early and faint memories. Eventually I started helping and by the time I got to fifth grade I was allowed to bake by myself, oven and all. I got really interesting in cake decorating so in middle school I took cake decorating classes and in high school I sold cookies a few times and made cakes and cupcakes for friends and family. I even saved up and bought my own KitchenAid stand mixer. I wanted to own a bakery. 

In college I stopped baking almost entirely. I made macarons once. I had moved away for school and didn‚Äôt have any equipment with me. In my last year of college, it somehow slipped out that I used to bake and friends were shocked because I never talked about it. Ever. Since then I‚Äôve been encouraged to start baking and make it a business but didn‚Äôt have it in me to start again. I baked royal icing sugar cookies once when I moved back home, which was a year ago, and didn‚Äôt bother to keep practicing. 

I made cupcakes a few weeks ago (can be found on my profile) and felt my love for baking spark up again. This time, with a lot more passion.  I think in has to do with not having a job; I get bored and need something to keep me busy. Baking certainly does. After I made my second round of holiday cupcakes I got an order to make macarons for my brother‚Äôs friend‚Äôs baby shower. I‚Äôve been practicing since it‚Äôs been a while. They‚Äôre not perfect but just from my practice bake from today I have two more potential orders. 

Idk, there‚Äôs a sense of relief because I‚Äôll have some bit of income (yes I know I need to get a job, it‚Äôs rough out here; was looking into administration stuff but now looking into cake decorating positions in grocery stores and small shops. I‚Äôm also in the process of applying to graduate school for higher education leadership/administration). Owning a bakery, which seemed impossible a year and a half ago now seems totally feasible. I just wanna keep practicing and not give up this time. I feel more inspired and creative than I ever have. All I wanna do throughout the day is have my mixer on and pop stuff in the oven. It just feels good to rediscover my passion.",11Jan2020,1

It was nice while it lasted. I had really good times. I want to especially say thanks to my family, mom, dad, S, B, and N. My friends, ML, RV, LJ, NJ, BB, IR, JR, RI, JB, PC, DS, PP, MM, CC, EJ, KF, RG, AB, CG, I F, GM, MM, CM, SO, and JD. Thank you all for the best times of my life. You all impacted me in a positive way. I‚Äôm sorry that I pushed all of you away. I just wanted it to be less painful when I went through with it.  

To some, this decision may seem brash, but I‚Äôve thought about it a lot. I‚Äôm happy with what i‚Äôve accomplished. I‚Äôm happy with the friends I‚Äôve made. It sucks that I won‚Äôt be able to go to prom, graduation,  college, church, school and all that. It sucks that I won‚Äôt be able to experience a lot of things like falling in love, pursuing my dreams, and plenty of other things that I can think of off the top of my head. As much as it sucks it doesn‚Äôt mean anything. None of it means anything.  I am insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Everything will move on and continue as it did before I was gone.This decision was no one‚Äôs fault. I just would rather die than continue to live such an insignificant and frankly mediocre life. I could put in effort to make it less how I describe, but what‚Äôs the point in that.

Personal notes:

Dear JD,
I love you. There were other people that I thought I was in love with, but after being with you I realized I never loved any of them. Every second with you was paradise. The time we spent together never feel like enough, and every second part felt longer than the last. Someone told me how can love a person if you don‚Äôt love yourself. I loved you so much that I forgot what hating myself was. You made me so happy. You were the only thing that has ever made me cry tears of joy. What we had was short-lived, but it meant the world to me. All I want is for you to be happy, even if that means that I‚Äôm not in your life. You were my best friend. I probably sound insane but that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm sorry for whatever I did to make you leave me. I hope your life is filled with love and joy.
Love, J

Dear Mom,
No one knew me like you. The worst part about this is that I have to leave you. You were my rock. You made me feel safe. You gave me a heart that I am so thankful for. You showed me how to love and how to be compassionate. You taught me so much and I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful. I love you so much.
 Love, E

Dear Dad,
You were a perfect teacher. You gave me my moral compass. You taught me right from wrong and how to be a good man. I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt put it into practice as an adult. I‚Äôm so thankful for you. There couldn‚Äôt have been a better man to be my father. I love you so much.
Love, E

To my lovely siblings,
You guys were my first friends. Those moments of our childhood are some of the most cherished memories I have. I love you all so much, and I‚Äôm so sorry to leave you. 
Love, J

To my friends,
Everyone I listed in there is family. For the longest time I never felt like I fit in in school. I always felt like an outcast. You guys changed that. You made me feel like I belong. You made me feel like I matter. Thank you so much. I love you all.

46,"So this is kind of a long story but to sum things up as briefly as possible:

I (20) have had my dog since he was 10 weeks old. He will be turning 8 this year, and as a large dog (boxer/shepard/lab mix) his life is already gonna be probably 11-12 years at most. Well i still live at home after dropping college to pursue mechanic school which will be starting up this summer, and my dad got a puppy because im hardly around anymore between work and friends, and my birth was an instrumental part in his recovery from alcoholism (he's 18 years sober now and i dont doubt that he will stay sober for the rest of his life). Well my dog has been pushed aside by my dad and mom in favor of the new puppy and my dog absolutely dispises the new puppy, especially because its so high energy and he very much isnt.

Now that the backstory is out of the, heres why i think he might have to be put down. Over the holidays i house sat for my brother while him and his family went out of town. I was there for about a week and a half, coming home every other day or so to shower/get ready for work, and i noticed that he started losing hair on his hip. Immediately after i was done house sitting and was sleeping at home, it started growing back and hes been fine. Now rewind to how im going to mechanic school this summer and the problem becomes pretty self explanitory. I am his sole reprise from the chaos that this new puppy (who is actually almost a year old now) and im pretty sure that me being gone for a year and a half will be devastating to him. Im literally crying rn because there is no way i can take him with me and im almost certain this is exactly how things will pan out and im not sure this is the right place to post this but i really just needed to vent so thanks for reading. 

Tl;dr: my dog had an anxiety attack when i house sat for a week and im going off to school for a year and a half and i think itll be the death of him

Note: I did a lot of research into the losing hair thing and he has no symptoms of anything else and is healthy for his age otherwise so im 100% certain it was anxiety, especially because hes always been prone to anxiety (lots of whining and whatnot). Id also like to say im certain it wasnt anything to do with my parents as they both are good people and they dont mistreat him, just dont give him a lot of attention.

Another note: im just gonna go to bed so if i dont respond until morning im sorry &lt;3",11Jan2020,1

I usually like being home alone, but not at night, and that's why I don't know if I will ever be able to move out and live on my own. The past couple nights have been okay and I've slept without too much fear, but I don't know, I'm extra creeped out tonight for some reason. Every little sound I hear I start wondering if a killer has broken in or if the furnace is about to explode. I have multiple lights on upstairs and downstairs, and make a beeline to the bathroom when absolutely needed, keeping my eyes far away from the dark areas of the hall. 

I feel kind of pathetic for being this way, but I've always been terrified of the dark and being home alone at night. But when other people are here it sort of grounds me and brings me back down to earth. My imagination is kept in check and things feel more ""real,"" if that makes sense, as opposed to the start of some horror movie. Ugh, I don't even know what I'd do if there was an emergency. If a killer broke in I would obviously try to run and call 911, but who's to say I'd even be fast enough to get away? And what if it happened in the night while I was sleeping? Would I be kidnapped before I even had the chance to fight back? At least my dad has a gun, but I have no clue how to use it, and worry I'd just end up making things worse if I even tried. 

Idk, I'm just freaking out about all possibilities, including intruders, demons, fire, gas explosions, etc. The worst part is I can't really calm myself down, even though my logical mind knows these fears are largely irrational and unlikely to materialize.",11Jan2020,1

56,"My apartment neighbors are great. They consider us (all four of us) friends. But the group dynamic feels off when I‚Äôm with them. In reality, the instigator in the group (roomie 1) is noticeably more comfortable talking to the other two (roomie 2 &amp; 3), roomie 2 usually hangs out with roomie 1 and actively initiates hang outs with roomie 1 and 3.

The reasons I feel off are based on our interactions with each other socially. Roomie 1 is an open and friendly person who is a social butterfly. They‚Äôre the most inviting towards me and we occasionally hang out to do yoga or just talk. He mainly talks to me about his language stuff because he‚Äôs an Arabic teacher (non native) and I‚Äôm Lebanese. Lots of questions and interest on his part. He‚Äôs also gay. All around an incredibly smart and generous person I enjoy being around.

Roomie 2 is a guy who has had me over a couple times but it‚Äôs because I recently lost my aunt and he was there to comfort me. Lots of hugging and stuff when it happened but he backed off a little afterwards. That‚Äôs the only time he was really vulnerable and openly inviting to me in his dimeanor. He‚Äôs an attractive guy, has girls over to fuck mainly. He‚Äôs hung out in the last semester with roomie 1 and 3 with his friends and family. Never really tries to initiate hanging with me or inviting me along even if it‚Äôs in his apartment. The night before Christmas Day, when we were hanging (comforting me about my aunt) he finally invited me to hang out with his fam and friends (where he‚Äôs taken roomie 1 &amp;3) for a Christmas party the following evening. I was spending Xmas alone and looking forward to it. He said he‚Äôd pick me up and we‚Äôd go together. Following day turned into night and I waited for him, fixed myself up, hours passed and I texted him I‚Äôd take a little nap before he‚Äôd pick me up.  lol and behold he was already at the party and told me he entirely forgot about taking me with. He apologized and said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt be mad at me‚Äù, but I was really put off by it and too hurt. Things have kind of smoothed over but we didn‚Äôt really talk about it. He‚Äôs not as interactive with me around roomie 1 and 3. Doesn‚Äôt even try to make eye contact when I‚Äôm around.

Roomie 3 is a girl who‚Äôs nice. But always around roomie 1 and occasionally is invited/goes over to roomie 2‚Äôs apartment to play fortnight. She‚Äôs straight and has a boyfriend. I‚Äôve been trying to hang with her but things never quite align. She‚Äôs nice to me but that‚Äôs it. Mostly tries to gear times when I try to hang with her into group hang outs instead. Doesn‚Äôt really initiate anything even in conversation. She‚Äôs noticeably more comfortable taking to roomie 1 and 2. I went out with her and roomie 1 to visit roomie 2 at work (he works at a bar) last night. The dynamic made me feel really insignificant. Roomie 2 wouldn‚Äôt really talk to me or look me on the eye. He did with the others while he was working his shift. Roomie 1 was off socializing with a group of random people. I sat with roomie 3 the whole time. The entire time, not once did she really look at me, try to talk, try to keep conversation flowing. I tried several times to start something but she just sat there the whole time watching roomie 1.

I‚Äôm supposed to be making a cake for roomie 3 for her birthday today and apparently we are gonna hang and open the presents roomie 2 got for us, but I‚Äôm honestly just not feeling it. I feel anxious and not *really* wanted in the group. I feel like I‚Äôm super nice and try to be open but the more I give it doesn‚Äôt really make a dent. I‚Äôd really like to be a part of this group. There are other friends I have in my degree program but they‚Äôre more competitive and we don‚Äôt get too close with each other because of that. 

All these things I‚Äôve experienced with the roomies and our dynamic together is why I can‚Äôt sleep tonight. I hate it. I wish I was more socially confident. I wish people wanted me around and initiated stuff with me. I wish people frickin made eye contact with with me in social settings. I‚Äôm always the last person people turn to talk to, people look at, people consider. I‚Äôm tired of trying to be open and inviting all the time.

57,"My name is Chris. I'm 45 and I posted about a couple weeks ago about celebrating 18 years sober. After my diagnosis of schizoaffective bipolar type in 07 I became extremely self-conscious and very judgemental of me. I basically stigmatized myself the way I used to stigmatize others with mental illness. I flipped that shit right around on myself. I don't know if I felt unworthy of others or what but I didn't socialize outside of my weekly AA meetings for nearly 10 years. I have this one friend named Josh that has a mental illness too but he is very social and he never let me down. He asked me all the time to go out and do stuff but I just wouldn't. I needed my safe place. My room. Once about three or four years ago I did go play pool with Josh and seemed to remember doing ok but that was the last time until tonight. 

About a month or two ago I got absolutely sick and tired of not keeping in touch with people I like because my friend Laura got married and I had no clue. That was the catalyst. I have been so horrible about being such a flake that I didn't even get an invite. It was not her fault. I created the perception in others that I wouldn't have come anyway. I was so mad at myself for not keeping in touch with her or anyone else for that matter I decided to make a change and start to socialize. For the last few weeks, I've been talking to people every day. One guy in particular and I try to text with others along the way. Well, tonight, as usual, my friend Josh from my AA meetings asked me if I wanted to play pool and I was in just do it mode and I did it. Now right after Christmas, I had some hallucinations due to the stress from all the activities and my greater attempts at socializing. Apparently that is supposed to lessen the greater I climb out of the hole.

But today, first time, I used a mirror to clearly see my genital. And I saw how it looks like. And as an asian, I feel like mine is ugly because it looks unlike of the other women genitals I see on the porn or magazines.

I started to be anxious of whether I will give my first time to my boyfriend. If he is going to laugh at it or not. I'm concern of how he will react on my puss*. So everytime he is asking me around, if I'm ready to have sex with him, I'm just being silent and look at his eyes. I don't know what to answer.

But then, I saw a post on my friend's newsfeed. The post is encouraging women to love their genitals despite of how it looks. It gives me confident and boost my self esteem. But right now, I'm still building up on it.

I hope, you all women, love your body. No matter what the people say, IT IS YOUR BODY. Black or White, your puss* is still beautiful!

im 17. i was pretty much forced to drop out of high school after sophomore year. i have no real friends and i havent in over two years. when i was 15 my mom kept promising we would travel the country in an rv. we never did. instead when she sold our home the rv broke. everything always breaks. instead we ended up living in a different state with her mother. ive been in this house, without friends, no school, nothing for two years. i leave the house for 15 minutes each day to take the dog out. thats it. my life is a shitty routine of waking up at 2 pm, taking care of the dog, and sitting in bed the whole day and falling asleep at 3 or 4 am. i do nothing. i never got a license and my learners permit is expired. i cant get a job. everywhere here either wants previous experience, to be 18, or some highschool equivalent which i need to be 18 to get. i do nothing. i have barely anything i call mine. i sit in bed and play on my phone. all day everyday. i want anything to change. and i dont know how. my mom works all the time. we cant afford to move. i have no way to go anywhere and even if i did the dog has nowhere to go if im not home. i hate this. i hate everything about it. i do nothing. im fucking worthless. i cant talk about serious shit to people because i never learned how to ‚Äúopen up‚Äù because everytime i did everyone turned on me. ‚Äúnobody asked‚Äù when i try to add to conversations. step brothers who constantly made fun of me for anything i said. i dont know what to do. i talk to three people. all family. im fucking numb all the time. i have nothing. i am nothing. now im here. crying in bed at 3am. posting this on reddit.

66,"This is my first post. I hope I can get the hang of this. Sorry if this question is suited to another thread. 

I suppose I'm late to the party. But I feel lost. 

Ever since I was 12 I had been living in the same town. I moved away for a year but I ultimately returned to be near family. I didn't realize I would spend most of those years trying to get my own life together while there's fell apart. My dad cheated on my mom. Mom divorced him and went on a 20 year tirade of booze, drugs and child neglect. My brother was older but he was a brat who was more interested in his ego. He and his ex expected me to stay out of school and raise their kids. His ex was the same. I helped her out with my nephews when they were babies but she thought I should be a 24/7 babysitter. The last straw was when I was blamed for his drug problems and shitty life. I had given up my time, my health and finances for these people. They had always been preachy about how family is important but half the time they were in bars or doing drugs.

If I had to compare my upbringing to anything it would be 19 kids and counting with only 2 kids. Think Josh Duggar and how he treated his family. 

I left for the first time 4 years ago. I'm 36 and trying to go to college. My dad moved to my city and apologized for his behavior. He had a stroke and he realized my family wouldn't be there for him when the chips were down. I'm starting to make friends but I would like to expand my social life. I realize ill have to make compromises but where do I start? its hard to get the voices of my family out of my head. They would call people assholes or crazy if they didn't act like any of us. I regret putting my life on hold.",11Jan2020,1
67,"**I apologize for the fact that this is poorly written. I‚Äôm tired and in pain, and I can‚Äôt really think about what I want to say. So forgive me if I screw up, haha.**

Okay, I‚Äôm under 18, and the last time I‚Äôd been drawn from was when I was MAYBE 2-years-old? So ig they wanted to do a couple tests, and it involved drawing some blood.

Well, I‚Äôve got an extreme fear of needles, I cannot stand them, and I‚Äôve never been able to handle being injected very well. I‚Äôve stuck them out and dealt with them, but that‚Äôs only because they were in my arms for maybe 3 seconds at a time.

My parentals had informed me that I wouldn‚Äôt feel a thing, and there was nothing to worry about. So, I (foolishly) believed them.

Now here‚Äôs why it went so sour for me.

I went in for the big draw, and the nurse let me listen to Alec Benjamin for a couple minutes to kind of calm my anxieties a bit. Maybe halfway through ‚ÄúThe Wolf and the Sheep‚Äù, I saw her reach for the needle, and I was immediately terrified. I felt like puking, but I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything since the day before.

She injected it, and *holy shit*. It hurt so fucking bad. I thought that the pain would only last for a couple seconds, but no. I could feel everything she was doing, and it took everything in my power to not scream out in pain. I remember she asked me something during the draw, but I couldn‚Äôt hear her over the white static in my mind. I felt so lightheaded and oh-so nauseous, and I guess I quit breathing without realizing it because everyone kept yelling at me to ‚Äújust breathe‚Äù.

Even after it was all over, my arm throbbed and I could hardly move it without wincing. I felt like such a dumbass in that moment, clutching onto a box of orange juice with my good hand like my life depended on it and glaring down my mother as best as I could manage because she had mislead me (I got a pretty big apology after that, and my mother took me to get Starbucks, so ig that‚Äôs great lol).

But yeah, I will never agree to doing this ever again. =_=

68,"Good morning, and thank you for clicking, it is appreciated. Here is the deal:

I began seeing this guy in around June, and we spoke everyday for four months, constant texting, and calls. We would get together on the weekends and mess around, and he was my first. I trusted him, and still do, because he is different. I mean that, he pursued me, and we waited just until last month to have penetration. But this has made things difficult, I have fallen in love with him, when he told me I can not expect too much from him. That relationships make him nervous, and he cannot be in one. He is thirty, and I am twenty-two. He said that he feels ""weird about this situation because he is used to hook ups and they usually end"" but I am someone he would not cut out of his life. Yet, a week goes by and he ignores my kind texts. I know he is putting distance between us, yet I persevere because of my blind love. So I confronted him, and he called me, and complimented me, we goofed around and joked, a bit serious, perfectly carrying on a dialogue. Then he drops off for another three days. I texted him again, and said that this whole cycle of not communicating is really obnoxious, because all I ask for is a text every couple of days, literally basic communication. He insists that he speaks to me more than anybody nearly. What is this guys deal? I should mention, I told him I loved HIM, and he said he HAS A LOVE for me, but he is ""glad we have this connection and I care very deeply for you and your well being"". God, this man has really made me fall for him.

I don't know how to live without this fool. I am caught here between a rock, and a hard place. I do not, have not, and will not, feel this way about anyone. He is very special to me. I reject every guy because they do not have what I like. It has taken me this long to find someone capable. 

I should mention, I texted him last, ""Are you still thinking?"", (I had asked if he wanted to see one another this weekend on Tuesday but he did not answer and it was already friday at 8 P.M. -,- WTF) and he said ""Hey! I would like to see you, but I can't this weekend, maybe next week"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you kindly for reading..... what would you reply with to that? Or would you just ignore it? Would you just block the first love of your life? I care about him, is there any way of helping him overcome his fear of attachment?",11Jan2020,1

76,"So to get the full idea of what I'm in the middle of this friend (lets call him Tod) and I used to be best friends during middle school. When we both moved up to high school I had to move to another country because of family reasons. So for me high school was extremely stressful going the whole 4 years without having a single friend in school, eating lunch in the restroom. Meanwhile Tod was doing spectacular in his high school made new friends, girlfriend,  etc. We were still in touch playing video games and what not. After I graduated Tod and I start making plans (not really a plan) for me to move back alone. This is where I was a fucking moron, for me the high school years made me hate this country and wanted to leave the place asap even though it was where I had the most education in. Now I moved back and meeting him and hanging out together I've realized he's just an asshat that only does stuff he only wants to do. I text him if he could take me somewhere he never reads the message. Tod asks me for my opinion, I share my opinion but I'm wrong and retarded for having a different viewpoint then him. Tod tries hard to make me drink alcohol I deny since I just don't like the taste I'm the one who ruined the mood of everyone. On top of all this apparently he's moving to different state in a few month. Now I'm stuck alone don't know what to do. Move back to my parents after I stormed out saying I'm leaving for good? Stay here and probably work a shitty part time job at some retail store. I'm regretting everything I've done that lead me up to this point. Should have never listened to Tod. Should have went to school where I had the most education. I just feel so tired of everything happening around me. Never thought the real world will suck this bad.

82,"I (M19) know I'm a big asshole. I just needed a place to vent and talk about my issue or try to find a resolve .

So a couple of months ago a friend and I made two meme accounts in Instagram . We didn't get a lot of followers at first so we decided to just DM and follow some of the people we know .

I being the idiot , DMed my crush (F19) and after a couple of weeks of no reply , she texted back . We had a back and forth conversation and she seemed generally interested and was even flirting with the account . I should've stopped right there but I was in over my head and even texted her one friend .Now we aren't complete strangers as we hang out quite a lot and know each other from uni. 

The texting continued for a bit and I didn't want to escalate it further so I was reaching for a conclusion and end to everything . At this point I was certain that she knew I ran the account yet she was still replying.

Yesterday she invited me out to join both her and her friend at a restaurant quite far from where I stay . Today I went to meet up with them and as soon as I got in , they confronted me about the account. I tried to say my say but they were right , I shouldn't have done that . 

After they were done , they both got up and left me in the restaurant alone . I tried to explain to them that I didn't want to ruin our friendship but they seemed quite pissed and walked away . The girl I was really interested in just tossed me aside because if a stupid mistake I did . She told me I broke her trust and that friends wouldn't do that 

I'm going to send them a text tomorrow to apologize further but I understand if they don't want to be friends with me anymore because of this

I did a very bad thing to them and I would like them to know I'm sorry or try to resolve this , what do you think I can do ? 

TL;DR : I screwed up big time by getting carried away with a meme account . I DMed some of my close friends including a girl I like and now her trust and friendship has blown up in my face . I want to apologize to her and let her know that I am truely sorry for what I have done",11Jan2020,1

89,"Feels good man.

I‚Äôve been extraordinarily fortunate. 

I did a brief stint in the Air Force, but that didn‚Äôt last long enough to get a GI bill, which would‚Äôve helped pay for my college. 

So for my first year of college, I had no scholarships, very little financial aid, and a decently-sized savings account from not buying a mustang in the military. Guess what was nearly wiped out in the process.

I‚Äôve been extremely fortunate because I was able to live with my parents most of my time in college. Fortunate because my financial aid and scholarships grew that I only had pay for books and a small portion of my tuition. 

I had a part time job at a gas station which I got before I started college, but I held onto it up until my last semester, when I got a couple jobs on campus. None of it paid all too much, but it was enough.

Three and a half years, thousands of dollars spent, a changed major, and numerous personal issues later, I graduated. 

Thanks to a good word from one of my professors, I got a job working where he used to. 

I‚Äôm debt free, living with my parents until my partner graduates, and saving money until then. 

Of course, it‚Äôs not perfect. It‚Äôs not quite a dream job, but I really do enjoy the work. The pay isn‚Äôt much to brag about, but as a single person living with their parents, it‚Äôs way more than I‚Äôve ever earned before.

Life doesn‚Äôt get easier, especially when I‚Äôm at the point of leaning further away from young adulthood every year. It‚Äôs kinda crazy to think that in less than 5 years, I‚Äôll be 30. 

I still got a lot of life to live. Hopefully, of course. Anyways, I‚Äôm kind of rambling, but I just wanted to share to anyone scrolling through this subreddit.

And when I come on here to the ask women page just looking for info it gets deleted because apparently people have asked that before and honestly fuck the ask women page and it‚Äôs moderators why can‚Äôt I just ask something again and get fresh perspectives, who came up with that rule. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get ALLLL the typical Reddit devils advocates though, ‚Äúummm actually that‚Äôs very important bc this and that and YOU need to blah blah blah‚Äù because that‚Äôs literally all that ever happens when I say anything on this app.

I‚Äôm not an irritable person at all, but everything has been happening at once and I have no support and even people on the internet are no help. Last night one of my friends asked if I was going to the hockey game and when I asked when it was but said I probably won‚Äôt because I‚Äôm tired she said ‚Äúoh they said you were going!‚Äù Which I thought was so weird because none of my friends even told me about it so i definitely didn‚Äôt tell anyone I was going, I had no idea there was a hockey game. So I started feeling all conspiracyish like why would anyone in my group tell someone I was gonna be there when they knew they never talked to me about it? And it couldn‚Äôt have been a mistake because they said my name as well as my boyfriends name.

Then this morning my sister texts me with the weirdest bs ever essentially saying that my mom was gossiping abt me saying ‚Äúdid you know _____ curses? She doesn‚Äôt give off the vibe that she curses I thought that was odd‚Äù YO get this. I am TWENTY FOUR LMAO. My mom... scrolled through my venmo... and saw curse words.. and then talked about it with my little sister. Not to mention how weird is it that she acts like I‚Äôm some kind of specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person that has some kind of ‚Äúvibe‚Äù because I curse? Any type of personality trait or action I have ever done has made her question it and judge me and comment on it she has found a way to critique me for it and it‚Äôs been an ongoing thing. But like acting like I‚Äôm some kind of nun or goodygood or whatever picture she‚Äôs tried to paint of me when I‚Äôve never told her or given off any kind of impression of whatever she‚Äôs trying to make me out to be pisses me off. She has always tried to make me feel bad / embarrassed / etc about absolutely everything and I have no way of telling her how annoying it is because if I do she makes fun of me and calls me sensitive or a baby and laughs in my face. All because I try to tell her something she does is annoying. My sister was no help because she tries to act completely unemotional and ‚Äúhard‚Äù because my mom has basically brainwashed her. My mom would also make fun of her and call her sensitive any time my sister showed emotion so now she tries to change herself into being a certain way bc my mom made it seem like it‚Äôs a bad thing to have emotion or care about anything. When I was responding to her texts irritated about my mom she acted like she was trying to drive me crazy on purpose by telling me it was no big deal like okay then why did you go out of your way to text me and tell me this? It‚Äôs like psycho woman mind games telling me something she knows was meant to be negative and then treating me like I‚Äôm less than for perceiving it that way. It‚Äôs how they both operate. They both enjoy making other people feel inferior to them.

I was also supposed to go to a baby shower today but this depression or funk or whatever has made me back out bc I don‚Äôt feel okay enough to socialize. I don‚Äôt know if I trust some of the girls that will be there and I feel so hideous today and some of them are pretty judgy. The girl whose shower it is is very nice tho so I wanted to make myself go but I just know I‚Äôll overthink any interaction that happens. 

I just hit my knee on the coffee table and it‚Äôs bleeding bc I was trying to stop my puppy from eating everything she sees and it‚Äôs not like stuff that I should normally pick up it‚Äôs like she tries to eat paint from the wall border and tiny pieces of leaves or pieces of paper that you don‚Äôt even notice until she eats them. Her baby teeth are falling out and she‚Äôs even eating those. Little pieces of fuzz or carpet she tries to eat. She just goes around licking the kitchen floor. It‚Äôs insane and my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt seem to give a shit sometimes he just puts her in her crate instead of watching her because he‚Äôll be in the living room playing his game like he can‚Äôt bother to deal with his puppy. Like a 15 year old. And when I‚Äôm anxious like this I just get quiet and don‚Äôt want to be touched or hear a lot of noises and I‚Äôve told him several times today to stop touching me and he doesn‚Äôt listen and keeps grabbing my leg or poking me and playing loud videos on his phone and just being inconsiderate. If I were to remind him tho he would act like I was a bitch for expecting him to respect my wishes.

So yeah thanks for coming to my ted talk sorry I sound like a raging psycho I just don‚Äôt have any family or friends that respect me enough to help me feel better or talk me down and when I get on accutane next month I‚Äôll probably get extremely depressed and just like right now I won‚Äôt have anyone who will try to help me they‚Äôll just ignore me or treat me like I‚Äôm irrational",11Jan2020,1

idk where i‚Äôm going with this but i guess i just need to chuck out some stuff that‚Äôs been bottled up. 

I‚Äôm currently struggling mentally and physically, have been for the past few months but I think what‚Äôs finally pushed me over into this depressive pit was my boyfriend having a depressive episode. It‚Äôs hard watching someone you love struggle and want to help but not being able to. I feel so useless but i‚Äôm trying to help by still sending the good morning messages and a lot of love memes and just trying to give him the last of the positivity I have. 

A few months ago I started to care more about my body weight and I wanted to desperately lose weight, so I started to count calories, which led to cutting down on my calorie intake. I‚Äôm at the moment only eating about 500-800 calories a day. I also started to throw up food when I can, usually when i‚Äôm just at college as my parents would hear me at home. I‚Äôm starting to feel dizzy when stretching just the smallest amount, and I have to regain my balance after standing up. It feels horrible but I just can‚Äôt stop :/

i‚Äôm also at the stage where i‚Äôm applying to universities which i‚Äôm really struggling with. I‚Äôve lost my passion for the course i‚Äôm currently doing and don‚Äôt even know if I can handle university but I guess there‚Äôs always next year to apply. It‚Äôs still causing major anxiety, I have to leave class to hide in the bathrooms and have panic attacks or crying episodes. 

kinda feel like i‚Äôm at my breaking point rn, i‚Äôm thinking of coming clean to my parents and getting help but I just don‚Äôt have the guts to. I came to them last year about depression so we went to the doctors where I got sent to a mental health clinic but they just sent me away and nothing happened, I feel the same will happen and like I said I just don‚Äôt have the guts to go to them right now.

96,"Most people who have been hospitalized for mental health issues talk as if it was the worst thing in the world and as if they never wanna go back there again. And to an extent, I can see why most people would think that. But to me personally...it wasn't even that bad. And it was actually the place where I felt most at home and that changed me for the better.

I've been depressed since I was 3 years old, and it began to get really bad in my middle school years when I was about 13 or so, and I tried to commit suicide several times when I was 17 and 18 (I'm still 18 now), till one day my therapist baker acted me (Florida) for about a month, because I told her really in-depth stories of my suicide attempts.

And while I was hospitalized...I'm not gonna say it was necessarily the best thing in the world, because it was very monotonous. Basically, you had three meals throughout the day, three snacks between the meals, two hygiene times a day, two times a day where you took meds, two times a day where they let you out on the patio, and the TV was on except for during the meals and snacks, and when they made you go to bed at 10PM.

But it was the first time in my life where people actually took me and my problems seriously, and where I found people I could relate to. Most of the people in there weren't even that crazy. They were mostly like me. Relatively normal people for the most part, but with emotional problems, trauma, or tragic pasts. Then you had some bipolar and schizophrenic people...who though were a bit strange to the eye at first, some of them were pretty cool once you looked past their disorder. And then you had people who...couldn't talk and only babble, and would shit themselves and smear shit on the walls. But those were the minority of people there. And they were punished any time they were mischievous with the shit and stuff.

And during my time there...I learned to appreciate the more simple things in life. All this time being materialistic and being obsessed with technology and shit made me forget the joys of the simplicity of eating a meal. I learned to truly enjoy the flavors of even simple food. I learned how important human relations and interactions are. I learned how important it is to widen your horizons. I learned to not be so quick to judge people. I learned the joys of getting good sleep.

However, almost everyone else who has been hospitalized has only negative things to say about it...so if everyone else sees something as so bad, and only I see it as good, am I sane at all?",11Jan2020,1
98,"I was sleeping for only 3hours and I am feeling better and more awake than when I was sleeping for 12 hours. When I sleep a lot, I feel like my body isn't tired, but mentally I am tired. When I sleep less, I feel like my body is tired a bit more, but mentally I am more awake.",11Jan2020,1
99,"Damn that shit was way harder than I expected. I tried to keep it casual and I prepared like a fucking essay but the only thing I could get out of my mouth was ""I'm not here for what we discussed"" \*pressure kicks in, error brain not found\* ""Would you maybe like to go out for drinks later?"". Well, she still responded kinda comfortingly with ""if I didn't have a boyfriend..."" which was quite convincing actually and ""you're really brave"" which also succeeded in making me feel like a kid who gave his first presentation but peed his pants during it. But ye after leaving while drowning in shame I'm actually quite happy I did it. My new years resolution of starting dating again is up to a great start :)

Now that I think about it, this is probably my first time asking a girl out hard mode, no alcohol/drugs, 1 on 1, quiet room, in person.

I tried to paint, which I wouldn't normally do because I don't consider myself capable, and the result was not bad at all. Also the psychotherapist who runs the course is very kind and helpful.

Hello Reddit ! I'm RAD. 

 I've heard of Reddit before but I've never considered it because i thought it's a ''smart/tough guys behind a screen'' community. Like full of kids that share memes with each others and that's it. But i asked some friends about it and i found out is like an open library i dunno, you can ask people for advice. share different opinions on different subjects and things, anyways whatever. i don't wanna make you guys bored. 

\-

I'm 18 years old, soon about to be 19 in February. And i always live in the future. I keep myself so, so focused on my goals and my future plans that i forget to live the present and it happened to be pushed away from some friends. 

I'm so preoccupied trying to make a business, achieving financial freedom, making multiple sources of income.

I think of how can i start a business using European funds, idk invest in real-estate, buy a studio apartment and rent it or idk. 

I got so so so many things written down. I don't know what to do, or what to focus on. and this is all i think about, 24/7. 

When i'm out together with my friends, idk they talk about other people, talk about what they look like, what they dress with, they talk about what's going on at the moment, football, idk stuff like that, and i obviously just sit and listen :))) because that doesn't interest me, you know. i also don't know what to say.  

I don't know if i'm wrong or something is wrong with me. I just feel like i'm alike people my age. I'm assuming they think i'm a weirdo. I mean most of them are waiting for the weekend to go and fuck up the monkey of their parents in clubs. 

Things like that, they all live for the moment. and is cool you know? i wish i wasn't so aware sometimes about life or what's happening around me, so i can also have fun like they have. 

The question is, how can i find myself a circle of people with the same interests as me? or how can i ''integrate'' myself better in my friends circle?

106,"Basically my city and the city next to us have decided to make this rule that homeless people aren't allowed to be set up anywhere. I understand businesses don't want homeless people hanging around. I understand that when they gather is a group it makes things unsafe and dirty. But at night, if they can't set up their tents, sleeping bags or other little shelters, how are they supposed to stay warm and get any sleep? Why can't they just make their rule no camping during the day or something. Now these homeless people have their stuff in carts just standing around with no way to even slightly be comfortable or get a rest in because they can't lay out their sleeping bags or anyting.

telling these people they can't set up their tents is just telling them they have to stay cold. This is a cruel thing to do in the winter. The law should be no camping during the day so they can actually set up a warm place to relax at night.",11Jan2020,1

109,"Like the title says, I'm OCD. Not with everything. Just with some things.
With cleaning in particular. 
I have to fold all my clothes in a particular way. Including my underwear. Yes, even thongs. I found a little drawer organizer that allows small items(ties, socks, panties etc) to be placed neatly away in it.
Now when I was younger it was so bad, that I hung all my shirts, even tees up, and sorted them by sleeve length and then in that category by colour, in alphabetical order.
Now as an adult. All tshirts are folded and put away by style. Graphic tees, dressy, etc.
Now when it comes to cleaning,  I go all out. Scrubbing every surface. Disinfecting it all. Cleaning even the crevices, or the places like baseboards that collect a lot of dust. 
I want to buy all sorts of organizational items to help me, because it does help me stay tidy. But I cant really do it, because I cant afford much. So I only get a couple small  things at a time if my budget allows it. So irony there. Hahaha.

Now, your probably asking, where's the irony in all of this?
Well here it is.
I have chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, depression, as well as A.D.D. . IBS. oh and let's add the anxiety to this list. Itll make sense in a bit

So not only does fibromyalgia have fatigue but obviously the chronic fatigue adds to this as well.
Then the depression makes me ""too tired"" 
When depressed, all I ever want to do is sleep. Sleep away the days and nights. And hope I'll feel better when I wake. Which I dont. And I get messy when depressed because I dont want to pick up after myself. Or ""I'll do it next time I'm up"" or I'll do it later.
Then the anxiety plays into this. 
I get anxious looking at the mess. 
And I know what i need to do. I need to clean. But I'm too tired too. And dont have the will power to do it.
Then i have IBS. And mine is also triggered from stress. Which this causes me stress. And let's add, getting up and moving around and cleaning my house, all that movement and bending/squatting to pick things up, squeezes my tummy making it more and more likely that I'll have a flair up episode. Which then, If I do have an episode, means typically that from all the pain and cramps I get, my body gets exhausted from the pain. Then I have no physical energy to continue cleaning.
Let's also talk about the A.D.D.
why add this? Well try being me for a day and try focusing on one area to clean. It gets boring for me. IF I manage to stay in that one area, I'll more than likely end up distracted and finding myself doing something totally not related. But if I do focus of cleaning, I end up cleaning a bunch of places, running back and forth through my house. And sometimes don't get one area finished but a bunch of places ""tidied-ish""

And to add to this info, I am on antidepressants now. I'm not suicidal anymore so that's good. I just need to find the will power to do stuff again.
Because it does get really overwhelming and I wanna quit or don't attempt to do it and try to ignore it. 
I should also clarify, it's not dirty, just messy. Clothes and things need to be put away and such.
It's all just a vicious cycle. 
And I really fucking hate it. 
My brain says ""LETS GO!"" 
But my body says ""HELL NO!""
then my brain says ""okay....I guess? But shouldn't we cle..."" 
""Nahhhh we'd rather not. Let's just do it later.""
And repeat that. 

So thanks for taking the time to read this. I just needed to get this off my chest. 
But also was curious, if anyone else suffers like this? And if anyone has overcome something of this nature?",11Jan2020,1

I've spent most of my life focusing on what I want, countless hours of thinking about my dreams and my future plans, but in the end, my only triumph: me brooding over my failure, my prize mistake: me brooding over my failure.

They say if you want success as bad as you want to breath, only then you'd be successful.

These past few months I've been seriously considering dropping everyone and becoming a loner. I'm not sure why but I feel as though it would be better for everyone. I don't know why I'm like this and I've never talked about it before.

114,"I'll start off by saying I have no immediate plans to off myself. 

More and more recently, I have just struggled with thinking what the point of being alive is?

I don't think I'm depressed, I think I'm just aware of the reality of how meaningless our existence really is.

I have a job, all my basic necessities, good health, friends, family but still find myself being irritated and agitated at having to go through the motions of being alive. 

Work is boring and irritating

Showing is boring and irritating

I enjoy going out with my friends but even then there is still the little whisper at the back of my mind annoyed that I have to make the effort to interact

I hate that I have to do stuff. 

The only think I really actually enjoy is eating 

I have long term goals that I'm working towards, but even when I do; I will have a good stable job, I will go to work 5 days a week and come home to my (future) husband and do what?

***What even is the point***

Literally everything is fucking boring and meaningless. 

Everything I try to do to better myself and my mindset is futile.

I feel like I may as well just hang around and see what happens but even breathing is becoming a major fucking drag. 

I know some people suffer with ill health and would do anything to be in the position I'm in, but I dont ***want*** to feel like this, I want to actually wake up in the morning and feel like maybe life is worth living. 

Most people seem to be in a stable ok-ish mood and then it fluctuates up or down depending on whatever happens throughout the day.
