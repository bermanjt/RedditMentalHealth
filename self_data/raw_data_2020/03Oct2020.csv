3,"I come from Serbia, a country that I feel like is being really misunderstood. We are not who you think we are. We are not bandits, we are not troublemakers, we are not disrespectful, we were overlooked in ww1,  nobody knows that our cities and hospitals were bombed by nato who is 10 times stronger than us, nobody cares about us. One day my country might extinct. Whenever I see any of these comments a lot of rage bursts through me, rightfully so. I get sad when I remember that almost everybody outside of our country hates us and wants us gone. We are one of the most hospitable people out there, everybody is happy when they see a foreigner in such a small country and remembers that at least a small percentage doesn't hate us.",03Oct2020,1
4,"A while ago, something happened that stressed me out and ever since then I've always felt the need to do certain actions to prevent anything bad stemming from the thing that happened.

For example, I might be holding a door handle and I'll think ""Move your hand a certain way or (irrational thing) will happen."" I know it's unlikely but I think, ""It's such a small task, it doesn't hurt to do it if it actually prevents something bad from happening.""

 Or, I walk past my mirror with my eyes closed for three steps. 

Or if I use a lightswitch, I have to wipe it with my sleeve to remove any trace I touched it even though I've just touched a bunch of other stuff. 

I know it's irrational but I sometimes fear something bad is going to happen if I dont.

What's weird is, if I'm with another person and I get the urge to do something like that, the need to not look weird overcomes the need to prevent a hypothetical disaster from occuring which proves it's irrational yet I still do these things. 

Anyway, not really looking for advice, this was just a vent post lol. 

Probably going to delete this.",03Oct2020,1
5,"I now regret every decision I’ve ever made because *what was I thinking asking my teacher of one month if I can write about the sad shitshow that was my childhood?* She probably either thinks I’m an attention seeker or the result of the absolute worst upbringing, of which I am neither. I just had it kind of bad and complain about it a lot.

I already have a few drafts that I was going to revise and delete the depressing parts of, which include having to break up fights between my parents at less than 10 years old before one of them got physical and/or called the cops, praying before bed every day for things to get better, and the emotional neglect and high expectations that are normalized in Asian culture. This is the *first* writing project of the year.

Goddammit. I’m gonna know this teacher for 4 years and my very first email to her is asking “yo, how depressing can I make my writing before you start wondering if I need therapy?”",03Oct2020,1

At first I was being picky wanting to stay in the Midwest (being from the South I love that cold). I soon found that I can’t be picky if I want to start a career. I had to move back home cause I couldn’t pay my rent. And have applied to just over 150 jobs. I’ve only heard back from about 15 to 20 of my application.

My childhood neighbor died. His funeral was today. I found out from my dad when I asked where my 2 siblings were. He said they were at the neighbors funeral.

I said ""Omg, he died?""

My dad said ""Yea, I told you yesterday.""

I said ""No, you didn't.""

He said ""Are you sure?""

I said ""Yes, I would have remembered hearing about a death.""

He said oh, he meant to tell me about it.

I sent a text telling my siblings how hurt I was that they didn't even think about me when something major happens.

One of my siblings said they didn't say anything because they knew I wouldn't be able to go. I could have absolutely gone, because I had the day off of work.

It reminded me of a similar instance about 10 years ago. My friend from high schools mom died. My siblings went to the funeral. When my high school friend asked where I was, they told him I was too busy to come to his moms funeral. They never actually told me about his mom dying or them going to the funeral. They hadn't thought about me at all. I found out about it a year later.

About 12 years ago, our grandpa died. They told me about it 2 weeks after the funeral.

17,"1) if Trump gets bad sick, who becomes second in command after pence and who is after him etc.? Does anyone ""assume"" a VP role?

2) if he dies and the R wins the election, does the VP just become the president? who is the VP now? is the line of authority still the same?

3) if he dies, and pence becomes president and they win, that counts as first term out of two, right?

Obviously if Biden wins, we know what happens. 

If you can get what I am saying and where I am going with this, can you lay out all of the before, during, and after scenarios? I am sure there are laws that cover all this.

What is scary to me as a republican and christian, but not a trump or pence supporter, is that pence low key would win against Biden and he is religious nut scary.

Thanks for any insight into how things work. again, cite if you can.",03Oct2020,1

22,"I got into a real bad situation.  This happened almost 20+ yrs ago. 
I was in a chat room.  I can't even remember how it started- but I was talking to a boy.  A 15
Yr old boy and I p4etended to be a 15 yr old girl.  I was actually 40. 
We continued to talk and I ended up acting as if I was my daughter.  I was in a bad marriage and I think that's what started this.  He was nice.  We seemed to get along great.  We talked constantly for over 3 yrs.  I was in love.  And so was he. 
I continued to act as if I was my daughter.  We went on like this for a long time- it was like 3 years at least.  
Then I decided I was going to go to Kentucky and see him.  Set him free from me. I flew from Washington to Kentucky.  I drove 7 hrs from the airport to his town. 
I told him I (me being my daughter) was coming. I drove all the way and ended up seeing him by chance at a Walmart.  I knew it was him from pics he had sent me. I froze.  He went to check out.andbi got in line right behind him.  My heart was beating so fast.  I couldn't do it.  I felt the best thing to do was just to stop talking to him- blocking him. 
I was successful for about a month. But somehow I ended up talking to him again. I was clear and I messed up by talking to him.  
So this went on for a while, and I decided to fly back there and to bring my daughter.  I didn't tell her anything until we got to Kentucky.  I had 7 hours to tell her what I had done.  She agreed to meet him.  So I told her everything on that car ride. 

The trip was a success! At least in Kentucky. A lot of their conversations led to her not knowing what he was talking about.  But she pulled it off.  We stayed there for 4 days. It got weird cause I was jealous!!  

After that, in a few weeks he flew out to Washington and that went horribly!!!  My daughter had a boyfriend and she really didn't want him there.  It was a disaster. She ignored him and he ended up going back home early.  That last day I was trying to console him as he was crying.  I felt awful for what I had done. 

The relationship lasted only a few more weeks. My daughter just wanted him to go away.  So she didn't talk to him anymore.  It was done.

I still feel so guilty that I took away 5 years of his life-. From 15 to almost 21 years old.

They didn't talk again.  I was happy to see he moved on with his life- and in a few yrs I found out he got married and had a child.  But he and his wife separated.  I'm thinking cause of me and what I had done had made him suspicious of anyone that c as me close to his wife.  I don't know that for as ure. But I do know that they're back together. 

For the last couple of weeks I have been thinking about him a lot. I won't contact him- but it's just gnawing at me. 

I've wanted to tell domeone- anyone as ND now I have. 
I'm 61 yrs old now.  I think he is 38 or 39. 
I can't get him out of my head.

Stop listening to idiots on internet message boards for your ""research"" on the safety of hallucinogenic drugs. No doctor will recommend that you take them.  The fact of the matter is, hallucinogens such as LSD and ""magic mushrooms"" can be very dangerous. They can lower your seizure threshold, make you do dangerous things, cause trauma, and severely scramble your perception of reality. They're really no fun. Your buddies might pressure you to take them, they'll say stuff like ""dude you'll see cool shit man, you gotta try this stuff man it's called acid!"" but you'll sorely regret taking it when you're running around naked, seeing demons, and have to be restrained by police.",03Oct2020,1

I´m afraid of not loving her enough. I´m afraid of leaving her, but it being a mistake. I´m afraid of it being a mistake from my part. I´m afraid of never being loved like this ever again. I´m afraid that it may just be a phase, and I´m making a huge deal of it. There are moments where I love to be around her, I wouldn´t choose any other place, but other moments I do not. I feel I can trust her 100%, but I´m also afraid of what she would say about my problems. I loved when my little details made her smile, now it´s just, I don´t feel like doing them, and I don´t know if it´s because I´m that selfish and have to change; maybe it is.

I feel like I´d never love anyone like this ever again, but I´m also not sure if it is enough. I´m not sure of anything, or maybe I´m just too afraid to accept that it was actually over since it started. She says I was alone, and anyone that came at that time I´d have loved the same ammount as I love her, and that sticked with me. I don´t think that´s true, but I´m also not sure; I´ve never thought I could feel as happy as I was a few days ago, before we had this fight. I wanted to do everything I liked, pursue my dreams, everything, I felt happy, now I don´t know what I want yet again. I feel like I´m not enough, I feel people will judge everything of me, the way I am, or the way I speak or the way I look.

&amp;#x200B;

 I´m unssure of everything, and I don´t like it, I don´t know what my path is, I don´t know what would be better for me, and I´m afraid of making all of the wrong choices.

32,"First post, so I'm pretty sure this will get lost in the threads. 

Raise your hands if you've ever been told that you were quiet? Yes, myself included. And quite frankly, it's quite, tiring. \*Rolls eyes.\* I'm an introvert, but a terribly awkward and shy one at that. And still in my thirties (I guess I'm a late bloomer). When it comes to conversing, I try relating to people, but am never able to hold conversations for long. And, perhaps the fact that I'm quiet probably turns people off. An example, I was told by the interviewee that they were worried how I would interact in the office since I seemed quiet. 

So, my question is: Is this all negative self-talk? And does it ever get any better for awkward and anxious adults still finding their way out of the woods? What do you do to overcome the social challenges in life?",03Oct2020,1

43,"I'm posting this here because I'm banned from r/offmychest for once posting in a certain auto-ban sub, even though I was posting in that sub, *against* that sub. I'm sorry if this story doesn't quite fit this sub, but I need somewhere to put it, one way or another. Obviously, trigger warning for sexual assault and pedophilia. 

I was friends with this guy for a long time. I met him through my oldest and best friend, a guy who is my brother, when we were kids. Like 11 or some shit. Really young. So the three of us, we've known each other for a long time. Now, the guy this story is about (who I'm going to call K from now on) and I did not get along with one another at first. 

I just didn't like him. I felt like he was honestly taking my best friend away from me. I was a kid, and I felt threatened that he'd take away the only person who was like a real brother to me. This is besides the point, I'll move on now.

Through the years K and I did overcome our differences and we became pretty good friends. When my best friend moved to another state to start his own life, we grew even closer. We would often talk to each other more than either of us talked to him. But, of course, the second we were all three united? The three musketeers, man. Here's an important piece of information: none of us ever lived close to one another. My mother and my best friend's mother were best friends, and he met K through school at a young age. At young adults, we were all about an hour away from each other, when we lived in the same state. So we met up only very rarely, and mostly kept in touch daily via things skype.

As we got over it became pretty apparent that K was the most... sexual, out of all of us. He made the jokes, he talked about it the most openly. It was just a part of who he was. Also, in our teenage years he came out as gay. We were all really supportive. 

Fastforward a bit, it was somewhere in our late teens, early twenties. K had come over to my place and we were pretty close so we shared a bed, head to feet. As we were laying there I could tell he was jacking off. It was a little awkward but at that time everyone was always horny so I honestly didn't think much of it. Then he placed a hand on my thigh. The first time it happened I just pretended to be asleep. I was nervous, but I was totally against it. I just didn't know how to approach it. 

The second time it happened, I returned the action. I'm not trying to tell a porn story here, so I'll keep it brief. We did some stuff. He blew me, I blew him. I figured hey, we're both horny, we're both friends, and we're both single. No biggie. This was before I knew was what going on.

Before I go on, I'll remind you that we lived a bit apart, and talked mostly through the internet. Seeing each other was a rare occasion. If I had been around him more, I might have been able to see the signs. Put a stop to it, you know? I might have been able to help someone.

A month or two ago I found out that for the past several years, at least 5, he's been sexually assaulting people. His step-brother (who I'm still great friends with, and who I'm so proud of for not letting this destroy him), his step-sister (who is 15 now, and he had been doing it the whole time so, you know, do the math), hell even his co-workers came out about things he had done, too. I also found out that he had touched my ex-girlfriend a bit after we broke up (they remained friends for a while) and he also touched *her* best friend during a convention that we all went to. Neither of them reported him. I don't blame them, it's an emotionally taxing situation. 

I have so much anger in me now. I feel betrayed, I feel hurt. I hate him for everything he's done and for being my friend like it was totally okay for all those years. I hate thinking that someone I trusted with my life was, behind my back, sexually assaulting minors on seemingly a daily basis. I hate that I did things with him, was touched by him, that I touched him. I hate it so fucking much.

I loved him like a brother, and he was a fucking monster the whole time. I fucking hate him so much and I don't know how to channel that. I can't do anything with it. I just fucking hate it.",03Oct2020,1
44,"Gonna make this first part quick. My parents were drunk, we got into an argument, they sent me to the hospital suicide prevention center. It was 1 am, after talking with the doctors, they sent me to suicide prevention. It was a room with 4 walls, no tv, no window, just a bed and a bathroom with a shower. I lay down, eventually I wave at the camera in the room because I can’t sleep, to my surprise somebody actually comes! I’m like “I can’t sleep” so they gave me some medicine, it barely worked, and I sit there for a few hours in my tiny bed before I finally go to sleep. I wake up to some nurse guy asking me if I want breakfast, I say no and go to sleep. Then I wake up to a guy asking me if I want lunch, I say sure and go, it’s all female teens, not a single guy. They had roommates but they were too afraid to give me a female roommate because I guess they think we will have sex? So me and another female are alone. Everyone’s asking me questing and what not, then after we eat lunch they come in there and give us coloring sheets for some reason, nobody does them we just sit there and talk for like 10 minutes, then make us go outside to which there is a basketball goal and a few benches, we get no basketball but some chalk. I’m kinda sad I got sent there even though I wasn’t depressed and it was over an argument so I go to a bench and lay my head down and sleep. Some girl comes and talks to me and I’m not gonna get into huge detail about it but she’s she only reason I didn’t go absolutely insane in this place because someone actually liked me for the first time in my life. We go inside, go to our rooms for hours, then eat dinner. After dinner (which, all the food was terrible, worse then school food and THAT is saying something, but the doctors were funny about it telling us “oh we buy the cheapest food possible cause it’s a hospital sorry”). We go back to our rooms and sit in our bed for hours doing nothing until they let us watch a movie. We were just watching random Pixar movies like “sing”(trash) or “ratatouille”(great movie.), it was the only time we got any entertainment the entire day and it was a roll of the dice, any other time we sat in our beds doing nothing. The girl I was talking to gave me a Harry Potter book that she was allowed to bring which honestly kept me sane  I never read books but if I hadn’t had this book, I really would have been depressed. 

Part 2 of this story is kinda boring, it’s basically everything i just told you, we woke up, ate breakfast, sat in our room for a few hours (keep in mind, it’s a room with 4 walls, a bathroom with a shower, and absolutely nothing but a bed, they gave us nothing to keep ourselves busy.), went back to the room for a few hours, ate lunch (remember how I said we went outside that day I got there? Didn’t happen again once.). It was breakfast, room for hours, lunch, room for hours, dinner, movie for. 1-2 hours, then bed, where we would lie awake for hours bored. It was absolute torture, the closest feeling I have ever felt to prison, the only thing that made it bearable was meeting a girl who made it all better and there was this cool nurse who understood what we were going through. I was there for like 6 days, some of the girls there told us then bad been there 2 weeks, I can not imagine the torture they endured.

Not sure if every suicide prevention center is like this, but what i went through, I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy.",03Oct2020,1

I had social anxiety as it was growing up, I was always shy and didn't really like talking to anyone except those people I became close to. When we were kids I wouldn't talk to the adults. I would ignore them when they talked to me.

Then during my teens, my friends started chasing girls or boys, and my best friend growing up became a woman in adulthood.

I felt betrayed, and manipulated, lied to. It made me feel sick to my stomach to look at him, and how he acted, it wasn't the same person anymore, it especially made me uncomfortable when he talked about sex.

I got a job as an Uber Driver and often times id pick up couples, many times it would be two men, or two women, and sometimes they would kiss each other in my car, it just felt so gross to me to hear the sound, or know that's what was going on, I often felt like they did it because they knew it bothered me or made me uncomfortable. I am glad I didn't have to hear when I dropped them at home.

Finally The girl I loved ended up marrying a woman, she used to be so beautiful to me, she had long hair and wore dresses and had nice outfits, and then she started wearing jeans, and cut hear hair short, and started talking weird, then I found out and she said, she only likes women, and it broke my heart and just made me feel like the world itself cheated me out of something I love, that it had perverted itself, and took away the woman I wanted to have children with and a future, like the companionship I wanted, I felt like "" I am here"" why do you need a woman that pretends to be a man, when I am here a real man. It just seems like everything became delusional and inconvenient.

I will never understand it, and many times I can't even watch tv shows or movies because many people enjoy those themes of gay or lesbian or transgender and it just reminds me of all the hurt that I've felt in my life.

I don't know how I will ever accept it or move on. I couldn't even play the new Star Wars video game, because EA has gone out of their way to include transgender themes in the games, and it forces you to communicate with them during the story.

I haven't had many friends in my life, and I've had friends that were gay but ""I guess I didn't know"" or I just wouldn't think about it, and I wouldn't talk about sex with them I would just treat them like people. But it's like I turn off apart of my brain where it's like I don't see things for what they really are, and then I woke up and I was like eww, you actually do gross things with each other and say you love each other, and when I think about it I feel sick enough to throw-up, but a lot of people do gross things behind closed doors with each other.

I don't know what to say or who to talk to, nobody in society seems to understand and whenever I try to talk about these subjects I usually get muted and pushed away and told I have something wrong with me, that I'm the problem.",03Oct2020,1
47,"First of all, I think it’s quite safe to say that my family is VERY different to others (Family: Mum, Dad, an older sister that has moved out to another state and myself - almost 15 yo male)

I’ll give a bit of info about myself so if anyone is like this they can understand where I’m coming from:
. I’m a bit of a perfectionist
. Likes things to be straightforward and done quickly
. Sometimes can be irrational but 75% of the time I treat all sides of something fairly
. Because of the annoying things my parents do on a daily basis I get irritated and easily snap at them but I still try my best to hold back

Background information of my parents (personalities, habits, etc):

(And I know one of you’s who read this would be laughing your *sses off while reading this but it’s what actually happens)

Mum-
. Condescending (always says that she can look at things differently and find potential ways to make things better but no one else can, says she has a good sense of smell every time she smells hair spray or perfume but we aren’t bothered by it, says “that’s what your generation does” after one person does something wrong in a younger age group, always believes she is right and won’t ever back down until she wins)
. Weird (makes high pitched annoying voices all the time and even in front of my friends, laughs like she’s a possessed witch over something that isn’t even funny, waddles over to me with her arms out like a monster from a budget horror film every time she wants to hug me)
. Annoying habits/things she does:
- every time we sit down for a meal she says “love-le” (lovely) in a croaky voice and sounds like she’s dying for breath
- every time she chews her food, it squelches obnoxiously loud
- every time she moves onto a new task or finishes something she says “ALRIGHTTTT” in an extended, loud and high-pitched voice
- always naps next to me in the living room while I’m playing with my friends and talking to them even though she has her bedroom to sleep in
- stares at my food whenever I’m eating something good and occasionally stealing food without asking and saying “I’m just gonna nick a bit of this” when taking it
- every time I ask a short yes/no question or a 3 second answer question, she gives a 30 minute long answer so I just have to walk away
-  every time I’m upset she either yells at me or is interrogating me into saying what’s bothering me and then is insensitive and inconsiderate by listing every single thing that I’m insecure about and not understanding how that makes me feel worse
- always does small things to annoy me like saying things the wrong way so I end up misinterpreting what she said then she ends up getting mad at me for it and doing things the wrong way
- always does everything the wrong way and since I’m a perfectionist it annoys the living hell out of me
- always thinks she’s right and then involves anyone close by to try to win the argument. 

Dad-
. Isn’t the most intelligent but is caring in his own way
. Always finds something to complain about even if it’s something small and a lot of the time somehow finds something bad when we’re having a good time during family time or a vacation
. Annoying habits/things he does (aren’t too many)
- clicks his tongue extremely loudly after each meal when trying to pick the food from his teeth
- drags his feet across the tile floor loudly in the house
- keeps staring at me each time he walks past my door
- forgets things all the time

My parents usually fight a lot and get on each other’s nerves basically everyday. It’s usually my Mum getting mad at my Dad for doing something pretty stupid or after he brings up something and then resenting him for a while. I know that parents arguing sometimes is normal but this happens so much for the stupidest reasons. For example, they once were yelling at each other because of salad. But, when they argue for a valid reason, my it slowly escalates into my Mum screaming so loud that literally the whole neighbourhood can hear and her slamming everything if she’s doing housework while arguing. But once they were arguing about literally not being able to buy a sausage roll and my Mum threw a chair across the yard because of it.

Since I have to go through this everyday, it’s affected how easily I snap at things and treat some situations and other people.

The only person that I don’t find annoying in my family is my sister and I look up to her the most as she was always there for me when I needed it and was fun to hang around with. Unfortunately, I can barely see her anymore since she moved away. Ever since she moved, living with only my parents has been extremely draining and annoying to put up with. On the good side, there are rarely some times that I appreciate when times are really fun and enjoyable when I’m with my family when we go out on vacations.

Could anyone give a few tips about how to deal this and if there’s anything I can discuss with my parents or change about myself?",03Oct2020,1

53,"I shop on Taobao (equivalent of Amazon for US) and I realized I spend at least a thousand over the past year. The things I have spent on are

1) Stick on bathroom shelves. My house toilet is very basic so this was the cheapest way to upgrade and improve my toilet. Now I have places other than the sink to put my toothpaste, toothbrush, and phone, which I use it to set a 2 min timer for toothbrushing. Spend probably a hundred on this?

2) Fitted sheets. My mattress is from IKEA and for the dimensions, they are wayyyy cheaper on TB.

3) Clothes. I own quite a lot of bra and underwear now, can afford to change into a fresh bra everyday even if I forget to do the laundry for the week. I have new shirts and pants too which I wear for work. I have 3 shoes from TB, one of which is my favourite that I wear everyday. I have 2 jeans....1 black formal work pants...one long skirt...5 formal/causal shirts....7 tee shirts?

4) Bags...i recently brought a ""crazy horse leather"" bag because it looks good, I like leather and it last long. 

5) LED mirror. Makes my morning routine easier...I wake up before the sun is up and I don't want to disturb other people who are still sleeping. I don't need to go to the toilet anymore to put on make-up and brush my hair, I can sit down to do it.

6) Ultrasonic cleaner. This is probably a waste of money. I use it to clean my spectacles, and a ring(so far, was a gift from my friend). But mostly for cleaning spectacles.

7) Milanese stainless steep strap and a ""nike look alike"" strap for my Fitbit Charge 4. It is cheaper on TB.

8) Reusable mask. I own like 6 of these now. I wash after every use. I have mask of different material, like silk, silk-cotton hybrid... Etc.

9) Socks. I like winter socks because they're very soft and comfortable. I wear a fresh pair everyday because hygiene. 

10) Stick on light curtains. The curtain in my house fell apart so it was a cheap and easy solution.

11) Trolley because I buy too much things on TB and have to lug them back to my house from the collection point.

12) Prescription spectacles. I paid for a prescription from a optician for my Dad and I got him new spectacles. The quality is good....and cheap when compared to local shops. I brought it from a reputable TB shop.

13) A chair. One of my folding chair plastic cover tore and I use tape to cover it. I was sick of it since tape don't last long, bought a new chair. 

14) Kitchen gadgets? I brought a ""de-corner"" to make eating steamed sweet corn easier. I also brought plates, bowls, which my family are using now....they prefer my new aesthetically pleasing plates. I also brought knifes (because the cheap dollar store knife is getting too dull), a new chopping board (the old one is disgusting), a bowl with holes to wash vegetables. Also silicon ice cube tray.

15)  A desk stand for my laptop, and an external keyboard. For ergonomics purposes.

16) Nail filers. To keep my nails looking good. Also the sole thingy to scrape dead cells from my feet.

17) Aprons. 2 aprons.

18) Electric toothbrush bristle head replacement. Because Oral B is too expensive.

19) Disposable shavers. My dad keeps using the nasty shavers because the store brought ones are expensive af and for hygiene reasons I brought him a box of 100 disposable shavers. He has no excuses to be frugal.


I noticed my spending habits increased dramatically once I begin having an income. I am not very comfortable this though because I grew up in a very frugal environment...i can probably live without the things above, right? I don't drink or have any expensive hobbies...just realised I spent nearly a thousand and it is kinda shocking to me. I can afford to spent them but I feel uneasy.",03Oct2020,1

55,"Hey guys! 
Basically I’m on this growth journey where I try to confront my anxieties that stop me from being who I could. A big pitfall I have is that although I am a smart student (ACT 33/36, IB 40/45 and it was hard work I don’t think I’m naturally gifted) I don’t believe in myself for shit. I always think very pessimistically about my future and I’ve been told I’m not as confident as I should be. I think it’s largely because of my past because I used to be a people pleaser. It has kind of been stuck in my mindset that I’m afraid to be confident, because I’ll end up stepping on people’s toes.

65,"Hi this is probably going to be a little long, hope you guys dont mind. 
So back to topic at hand, I'm an 18 year old from india and recently I've been having these recurring thoughts of not belonging anywhere. This sounds cconfusing so let me explain. India is a large country and not everybody is the stereotypical ""baljeet"" we have different cultures and one person from the north looks really different from someone who's from the south of the country. So basically I'm from the northeast and well my mom is naga no not the snake creature, it's a tribe which has their own state. They're what we call tribals(yes there are more tribal states) . They basically have a Mongolian heritage which means that they have east asian features. To make it clearer. They can pass of as japanese, Korean etc. So that means they have a very different  style of living, food habits etc. My dad's the typical northeasterner. But looks like what you'd call an indian. I've never lived in my moms state so I've never been very exposed to that lifestyle, I do visit my grandparents tho. You see I dont look like my mom or ""them"", so I'm basically an exotic mixed kid who people cant really point out where I'm from. So that means I've never really felt like I was part pf or am one of them. It always felt like yes I have a tribal mom but that doesn't make me part of their community. 
My mom never really taught me her language because she thought it would annoy my dad and inlaws. Fuck patriarchy btw 
I grew up in a middle class home environment which is really influenced by the west. So what you see on television of what an indian household looks could not be more wrong for my family. My parents dont listen to Indian music. Dont watch Bollywood movies or have anything to do with indian pop culture . So yes I might have seen only 3 or 4 indian movies in my lifetime . I dont dance any folk dances so that whole "" learning how to dance in shiny clothes while making intricate hand movements "" nope never done that. 
This is before the whole Tiktok americanizes indian kids thing. I dont dress the way I do to emulate their culture.  I do because that's all me and my brother have ever been exposed to. 
My mom has 3 sisters and 2 married a white american and white Australian and we're very close as a family so that may have further influenced our style of living. 
Now comes my dad's side.  
His dad is Muslim and mom hindu. My mom's Christian and dad atheist.  
Now my cousins are mixed too so why aren't they going through any problems? You see even though they might have a difference in culture their parents have the same religion. So they're on the same page. My dad's the odd one out. Hes never liked the idea of religion and basically worships science. Now I respect that. Nothing wrong with it but that means him and my mom have always clashed with the idea of what their children would believe in. I used to go to church when I was younger but soon my mom stopped taking me cause she didnt want to upset my dad. Its always like that. walking on eggshells when it came to whose culture or religion to emulate. I'm grateful for all the religious exposure I got as a child but as you grow up if you're not disciplined with you start to lose touch. Now I dont know what to believe.  I want to believe but it's gotten so hard.  
When I was younger and my friends had not gotten access to social media yet, the internet was my only  refuge. It was the only thing I could relate to. Aa to go back to those days~ 
I've always loved christmas. It's my favourite holiday. The only place we put up a christmas tree is my grans house.  
I have been telling my mom to put up a Christmas tree for years now and she keeps putting up the same excuse of ywah we will this year and but your dad will get mad. Now my dad is not like those indian dads you see in indian soap operas. He works in an Ingo and hes pretty modern but the base issues between my parents will probably never be solved. It's kinda sad cause I'm graduating school this year and most likely will be my last year of christmas at home. This was my last wish, to put decorations as a family . But it's okay. I just keep telling myself that once I have my own place I'll be able to put up that tree I've always wanted. Even if its alone. 
I'll forever be grateful for being part of so many cultures and even saying yes I've done that yes I'm part of that . Met so many different people. They've given me so much.
But at the end of the day. You kind of feel like a half cooked cookie. Its mixed with different flavors so you cant really taste anything in particular. You know a little bit of everything but at the same time it feels wrong to call it your own.  
I cant say I like this place. I cant say I belong anywhere really . It feels weird to go to my extended families' houses and interact with them. I know I'm family but why do I feel like a fraud. Why do I feel like I'm looking through a glass pane. 
I don't think that longing to belong somewhere and call your own will ever go away for me. I'll probably be a vagabond for life

Thank you for letting me vent. If you've read this far than I hope my story interested you. If you haven't then it's okay :). this post will probably be buried and lost in the internet anyway",03Oct2020,1
66,"I am a high school senior and I am graduating next week. I had a math teacher for two years and he has helped me through basically everything this year. Due to my great interest in math, I became very close to him from the beginning of last year and ever since he became my favorite teacher. During my final year of high school (which is this year), I had many personal things going on and he always asked me if I was okay and he basically helped me through depression. He has a reputation of being strict and not having any personal conversations with his students but I realised that we have a lot of conversations about our personal life so I guess he thinks of me as one of his favourite?

I’m a 30 years old, highway engineer. I have good experience in this sector, and made decent money with it.

My last job contract ended and I decided to try new things, and started studying technology, which is my passion. I got a job in a INCREDIBLE office, in the technology department, which is the first time in 30 years I don’t feel like “I have to work”. Going there for me is like a hanging out with friends. I’m having 150% job satisfaction, already made great friends there, I love what I do, and I know as long the company exists, my job there is guaranteed. And the company keeps growing. Although, the pay is not great. It’s good, let’s say, mediocre. In the long run it may become good enough, but not sure when.

Yesterday, the director of a an engineering company contacted me, heard about my skills as a highway engineer. And made me a job offer. To be clear, I didn’t apply for this, he got my contact with a former coworker of mine. And to put it simply, the money he offered is bigger than any offer I had so far. Basically double of what I’m making right now, with benefits, like a place to live and transportation. I would need to move to another city. It’s a bigger and more developed city. Most of my friends already moved away, I don’t have children and my woman broke up with me recently, which is still an open wound.

I know most of you will think I should go for the higher paying job in a better city (it’s about 5hours drive from here).

But, Im really torn about the job satisfaction. I love my job, love my coworkers, even my bosses are great guys. And pretty sure I won’t have that in the engineering sector. To put it bluntly, I don’t like engineering. Only reason to consider is the money, and status.

81,"On September 3rd, 2020, I made the mistake of a lifetime. After over a year of abuse, harassment, and exploitation, I (23M) snapped on my cousin (40+F) and assaulted her in the Second Degree. She left the scene with twenty stitches and a missing tooth. I believe I succumbed to the mental ailment that plagues a majority of my family: PTSD. I also believe I share in two other ailments of the victim, although not as strongly as I believe the first, namely Psychotic Tendencies and Chronic Impulsiveness. I am currently out on $2500 bond, and awaiting the grand jury's decision to mark the charge down to 4th degree. In the event of an official court case, I plan to plea insanity. The victim's injuries were paid out of pocket by us 3 days after the incident.

I'm here today because I intend on making this right. What I did, even out of insanity, is still a terrible, awful act, and I am ashamed at myself at the harm and distrust its sown in my loved ones. But I also know that the events leading up to what I did were perpetuated and ignited by substance abuse. These events include, but are not limited to:

* Being ran over by my mother after sabotaging her suicide attempt while she had 20+ Xanax in her system
* Having thousands browbeaten and extorted from my girlfriend and me knowing we had nowhere else to go while living with the victim months before
* Being violently evicted and framed by the victim for domestic violence with no eviction period and needing a police escort to properly get our stuff out

There are also many, many other events I can point to I am purposely keeping quiet about. With my main message being peace and a reunification of my family, I will not add more hearsay to further anger all parties involved. I am sticking to what is officially on police records because it is public domain and gives a glimpse into the nightmare I've lived through that brought me to where I am today. The video below is my official synopsis and explanation of events; While it goes over a lot of the points listed in this post, it also helps provide a clearer and more digestible rundown of all the information surrounding this situation.

My main goal in all of this is to get a pardon from Governor Beshear so that I may rejoin society and help mend together my family in a healthy, proper fashion. The victim would not be approached by me or any other third party unless she personally expressed a willingness to do so. I would become an advocate of mental health and substance abuse awareness for those too afraid and too isolated to speak for themselves. I would share my story of growing up in poverty, and let people know that just because they're neglected, that doesn't mean they will always be unwanted. I simply wish to prevent this in anyone else I possibly could. Thank you for reading all the way through, have a wonderful day.

82,"hello, i see lately lots of posts if not almost every post gets tons of awards, whats going on?",03Oct2020,1
83,"2 years ago, I tried to force myself stop doing some house ocd compulsions. I tried to make a promise to God in order to force myself stop doing them. One of the compulsions was rechecking my boiler heater switch to see if it is off and I think, turning off/on the switch in a certain way. Perhaps, the promise was something like about not acting compulsively about my boiler heater (obeying my ocd compulsions)

Some minutes ago, I was in the living room and heard a noise similar to the noise of the heating water when boiler heater is on. I started wondering if my brother left it open (my brother has ocd too so he would never forget it) The noise was similar but I was not sure if the boiler heater was off or not.

Due to the rushed promise, ocd suggested me to avoid checking the switch and I randomly, started investigating the noise. I started wondering why I avoided checking the switch? thats what a normal person would do. Perhaps avoiding checking is like obeying an ocd compulsion and that maybe breaks the promise.

I was near the bathroom and was thinking to go to check the switch in order to act like a normal person and not break the promise. I decided again to investigate the sound and avoid checking the boiler heater switch because I thought by going back will make it more possible to break the promise. Maybe it was ocd who was telling me to go and check the switch. Since I was more near to the sound, I decided that I will find out faster. I started hearing the sound better. the sound kept going for some seconds and stopped. That meant that the boiler heater was off.

All these thoughts lasted almost, about 5 seconds. After analyzing it, I started thinking that the most easier and faster way to understand if the boiler heater was on or off, was to check the switch. But ocd was trying to protect me from breaking accidentally, the promise. So, by trying so hard not to break the promise, I ended up obeying my ocd which means that I broke the promise? Perhaps, the promise was not to act compulsively with my boiler heater. Was the promise valid specifically for certain compulsions like must stop rechecking my boiler heater and turning it on/off in a certain way or for every compulsion that I did not imagine.

Maybe If we consider my today's actions as a compulsion, then, I avoided compulsively to check like a normal person the boiler heater switch because I accidentaly, thought that this will make me act compulsively and break the promise. So, by trying not to act compulsively, I ended up acting compulsively? So, did I broke the promise?

I could not control myself my ocd was like;

ocd: a noise? maybe boiler heater is on! do not understand from the sound! go check the switch! no! do not go and check the switch. stay there you will understand faster and avoid acting compulsively. Since ocd tells you to go check it then, you better avoid checking the switch and understand by the sound. go to the bathroom to understand. no! do not go to the bathroom! go to find out by checking the switch! a normal person would check the switch! its faster and easier! no! do not go! not now that ocd tells you to check the switch! you are more near the bathroom so, find out by the noise!

all these thoughts lasted about 5 seconds. did i broke the promise? I was trying my best not to break the promise and now, I worry that perhaps, I broke it???",03Oct2020,1

87,"I'm confused rn. My father got angry with me that he beat me up. He gave me punches. Then he eventually did this thing that they do in karate or taekwando were someone uses their legs to knock their opponent of balance. And yes, I fell and hit   the back of my head really hard. And he kept beating me. This happened an hour ago. There was a huge swelling at the spot but I've massaged it and it has reduced. My main concern is the head ache I'm having rn. It's 10pm and I'm the only one taking this seriously. I might be bleeding internally and I don't know what to do about it. I called my cousin and told her about it but all she said was I shouldn't be rude and that I should go lock myself up in my room. She said she'd call me in the morning.",03Oct2020,1

And probably well never be in the future  

Most likely i won't do something remarkable and i won't be happy 
I know I'll struggle alot  

I know for sure that my life well keep getting harder 


Is it really worth living it 

I'm not depressed or anything  i love myself  i don't have mental problems  

I believe there's some people are not suited for life, like me I'm just not meant for this life 


I'm seriously logically speaking that maybe death is a relief 

But i don't want to sucide  

I want to be able to tell my family and loved ones that I'm leaving,   plan my funeral with them and die in peace

I'm not sure what I believe in right now, I always seem to find my way back to spirituality of some sort though. 

Our current place has ended up in such a disaster and it was supposed to be permanent for a while. The last few years have been terrible and while everything else is finally calming down a bit, and some things are even turning around for my family, the flat is only getting worse. I won't go into detail, I'm just hoping some kind souls out there could give me a helping hand, send some positive vibes my way, idk.

98,"I (23M) a resident of Virginia (VA), and am trying to move out of my mother's house; however, the major issue is finding an apartment complex that doesn't explicitly ban American Pit-Bull Terriers.

NO I am not like Howard from The Big Bang Theory; my mom is just fiercely overprotective of me due the fact I have Autism, and that I've had a short temper in my youth. In-spite of the simple fact that I:

1. Am working a full time job
2. Am juggling multiple late-night college course (7pm to 10pm, twice a week)
3. Actively Pay for our Wifi
4. Have never once missed a Rent Payment since I started paying rent.I have a 3 year old, male, un-neutered (As of writing this post), Pitbull. He has no history of aggression towards other dogs, people, or domesticated animals and is up-to-date for his shots. But in all my looking around for an apartment, I've found none in my area that explicitly state that they'll allow  a pit bull onto their property. 

Does anyone have any advice and/or devices that would be of some help to me? I desperately want to be independent of my nagging mother; but don't want to have to get rid of my dog. And obviously due to the current *issues* of 2020, I can't just travel around to multiple apartment complexes.",03Oct2020,1

102,"Today, almost 20 years of my life has passed, but never have I ever felt as I did today. Ofcourse I've had my happiness as a child until I reached grade 9 that is. Since then to now, my second year of university, I've just felt lost and empty. Grateful for everything I have and had. I frankly believe that I have more than enough and I am more than grateful for that, to most who would see it may not think of it as a lot but to me it is. I never experienced real sadness or rather I did but i just don't remember it at all. I tend to just bottle up all my struggles and end up forgetting them or I just sleep it away. However, in these COVID days, all of the problems that I had came tumbling down along with my current issues. I didnt know how to handle them, It just broke me. My dad is the sole provider of our family, and hes also the provider of all his brothers and sisters families, and he got really sick. He was diagnosed with COVID two weeks ago and yesterday with pneumonia. I don't know how I was feeling or how to even deal with all these emotions.  I just got out of everything. I just quit everything and lie there in the bed. Everything seemed so lost to me. I couldn't bother my mother, as I could clearly see how pained she is, I just couldn't be there for her nor help myself. But today, I read the messages of a friend who tried reaching me to see what was wrong with me, why I wasn't talking; I also saw the messages from 2 other friends that I hadn't opened because of deleting all my social media. I had seen how much care all these 3 people had for me. This meant the world to me, i couldnt  vent out my problems to them, I just don't know why but the care and love they 3 showered me with was just enough. It started lifting my spirits, and I can proudly say I am feeling the tip of happiness. And I hope I will grow to be a better son, a better friend, a better student and all in all a better human being, and i hope to be happy. If there is someone you know that seems out of place or you think he is down, trust me, you showing just an ounce of care is what will make the difference for them.

Ive gone the longest ever up until now, a year and 7 months, with the people ive been friends with. But I stopped seeing them and feel like i cant trust them/they cant trust me or they dont like me.

I know I probably sound crazy, but it bugs me because I dont want to be someone with no friends because i push everyone away. Even when i try not to, it happens in some way or another :(",03Oct2020,1
104,My life has gone to shit. Boyfriend broke up with me and I moved back into my grandmas. Lost my job due to Covid and got another one and lost that too .

I found a job as a caregiver but doesn’t pay much and haven’t gotten my first check yet which will be two weeks from now. I try to earn money anyway as possible. I wish i didn’t have this life.
