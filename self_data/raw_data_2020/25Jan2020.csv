2,"I often put jam/jelly (preferably like blackberry, cherry or other red fruit) on my toast, bread, crackers, etc. I usually do this in combination with a dash of black pepper to offset the sweet with a bit of sharpness.

3,"I‚Äôm mainly just posting this to make myself feel better I guess, but I‚Äôve been in a funk lately as I turned 19 last month but I still live with my parents. I just secured my first full time job (I used to work part time only) and I want to be excited about it but I can‚Äôt stop myself from thinking that I‚Äôm a failure for still living with my parents. I try to ease the thoughts by making myself useful- cleaning, making dinner, etc. but I still feel so guilty and I have no idea why.

4,"I hate being alive.   I hate being attracted to people that don't reciprocate.   I hate being the person everyone ignores.   I hate being the fat one.   The person no one talks to.   

I have to watch people on Youtube in order to not feel lonely.   And not even that works all the time.  And only a few specific people. 

Girls are supposed to have it so easy.   Everyone gives up thier seat for you!  Multiple people ask you out!  You get to have tons of friends!  Everyone makes it sound so easy you just need to get yourself out there!  Well,  I am out there.   And nothing ever happens.   Nothing.   No friends,  no partners,  just work and spending time with ""family"" that tear each other apart.",25Jan2020,1

I would love her to be near me. I know that she feels the same. I know that we both would feel complete.

17,"This is a relatively vague memory, but one of the earliest I have in my life.

I was on my way home from school one day, just old enough to not need to walk home with my parents, when I looked for some unknown reason behind a secluded tree near the school exit - with a grey metal thing sticking out of it.

So naturally I pull it out of the ground and I am old enough to know it's a bomb, and immediately I wanted to throw it against the concrete wall of the school to see if it would explode or not, but thankfully I was more eager to show it to my more intelligent friend, who yanks it from my hands and runs off with it... from what I recall he told me a few days later than he put it inside a storm drain.... so I guess it is either in a lake or the ocean.

I also assume it is from WW2, maybe even WW1, although much more unlikely.

21,"Just came here to type out my thoughts to anybody who reads it, if anybody even wants to. 

I live in MN you can pretty much see that just by looking at my comment and post history. Anyways, I make okay money.. enough to comfortably support myself with responsible decision making anyways. 

About 1.5 yrs ago I financed a car and I hate myself for that, so therefore I am working on paying extra towards it as much as possible. I've also been saving a ton of my extra money so that towards the end I can just throw a chunk of cash down and have it paid off. 

With that being said, I hate it. I'd like to be irresponsible and make minimum payments and go shopping and stop saving. 

I've been wanting/needing a haircut, wanting highlights, I want some new clothes because I haven't really gone shopping in awhile, like I'm currently wearing a nearly 10 year old t-shirt.. I buy stuff from Walmart and thrift stores sometimes but honestly it would be nice to feel good in new clothes that fit how I want to look instead of just settling. I also want a new couch, everything I own is second hand as far as furniture goes. 

On top of all my wants, I have to cover my needs first. My cat needs a dentist appointment and minimum that'll be $500... More if they find any issues with my 9 year old cats mouth. Could go to a couple thousand dollars for all I know. I need new tires on my car, because these regular tires don't handle well in snow. My union contract is up for a vote soon and many people think we will be on strike, *if* I get any pay during that period it'll be only 60% of my actual hourly pay so obviously I need to save money to pay bills for however long that lasts. 

I also want to save up an emergency fund and a down payment for a house so I can responsibly buy instead of essentially digging my own grave. I'm 23 years old and I am really blessed and I can't bring myself to waste my money and be broke due to bad choices. Things are just tight right now (due to my own choices in saving and paying down debt) and I really just want to ""treat myself"" in February because it's my birthday month. 

Sometimes being responsible just kind of sucks and it would be seriously uncalled for to be so impulsive. Saying no is getting old.",25Jan2020,1
22,"I want to talk about an incident from my childhood that I know I've brought up before and referenced plenty, but don't know that I've dug out all there is to say about it. I've found myself thinking about it a lot recently, I don't know if goaded by my slurry of thoughts while sick, or just because I'm starting to play my psychological life a little fast and loose with my presumed future financial security.

I'm watching A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood. It opens panning in on a picture of a main character which Mr. Rogers says is having a hard time forgiving someone who hurt him. The physical mark on the main character's face not the source of inflicted pain.

If you don't know, because it's one of my favorite stories, when I was a child my mom made me pick out one of my stuffed animals for her to gut and cut up. I believe I had accidentally broken something of hers, and it was retaliation. I remember being filled with dread, thinking it unbelievable. I remember genuinely loving each of them, piling them on to sleep with every night. I remember them as friends, from the oldest given to me by my grandma, to the new ones we might've won in a game.

I remember picking up and putting down my friends, trying to weigh what they meant to me. I settled on my most recent bear won from the claw machine at Fudruckers. We had the least history. Through heaving hollowed-out pleas, screams, and tears I begged her not to. I fell to my knees. She chopped off a paw. I beat the floor. She shoved scissors into its stomach. 

I literally can't genuinely put myself back there without getting misted, every single time. It's the kind of ‚Äúgo there‚Äù place an actor might pick to sell a sad scene. It works. She regularly hit us with different things, manifesting as my flinch response until college. She'd scream and yell and pile on chores. But having me pick out a friend switched something off in me. It made me a murderer. It made me preside over life and death, and then to be forced to carry on like it was just desserts, eye for an eye, her thing therefore my ‚Äúthing.‚Äù

In my adult life I've watched this ‚Äúoffness‚Äù manifest as a contradictory set of behaviors. I hated being touched, when it's all I want to do to be cuddled up or hugging. Comforting touch was so often betrayed, and besides, the things you're snuggled against can get torn to shreds. My relationships seemed rooted in that ‚Äúuseful thing‚Äù place. If you weren't good for something, you didn't exist. If I felt something for you, it was an irrational inability to cope with a flood of anger or otherwise. I was nowhere near in control. It's not that every good feeling or sense of care and belonging I experienced was overturned, but they could never settle into the same place. There was always the very real sense that it meant absolutely nothing.

This may sound unfair to the people who genuinely love me, but the thing about trauma is you can't really help it. You can work your trauma into a new scheme. You can teach your trauma to follow a different habit pattern. You can't *make* your trauma alter your feeling of it. I'm not going to regard the memory joyously one day. I'm not going to get back the years of feeling off and broken.

Today, thankfully after many years of writing, I incorporate my worst and most problematic senses about myself into a kind of instruction manual. (Arguably the only manual I bother to read.) I know you can read dozens of books on psychology and piece together the different slices of your mother's narcissistic and own poorly endured traumatic childhood. I can know which parts of the brain degrade so you become a batshit ideologue and the infinite ignorance that is being human which contributes to far greater tragedies than a lost bear. None of it contributes to my impulse to ‚Äúforgive.‚Äù

I'm still a murderer. I didn't learn that through deep consideration in my freshman psychology class talking about the brain differences between personality types or those with psychopathic tendencies. I learned it like a child given a gun and told to point it at his family. It speaks to why I confidently say I'm likely the craziest, meanest, or some other extreme-est kind of character in a room. I know what's underneath as I'm telling a fun story, being hilarious, or otherwise mimicking all of the human things that make me get along in the world. I still feel, it's just ‚Äúnow,‚Äù when I think it can be trusted, before it flows over the generally cold indifference I hold for nearly everything and everyone when the circumstances call for it.

It's why when I designated ‚Äúreal friends‚Äù it was worth the navigating if that was a wise thing to do. The purpose was to help thrust me away from that, designate the examples I'd want any future friends to live by. I didn't take it for granted that everything was superficiality and incidental time spent in close proximity. It was significantly more idealism than naivety, as I already knew the cold and distance, I just thought if given the choice people would choose what I was after. I suppose when they get disgusted or complacent enough, they do.

It's why I'm steadfast in my posture regarding ‚ÄúI don't really change‚Äù as the world finds its reasons to be pissed off at me and keeps its distance. You know who else doesn't really change? My dad. He's there for me like I want to be there for people. I always refer to the ‚Äúfriends that stick around‚Äù who continue to keep an eye on me or like a post from time to time. Something there hasn't changed between us. Whatever that is, it's the pulse that I ride into all my future dreams about who I'm surrounded by or why I'd bother to create. You don't reduce yourselves to so many ‚Äúthings‚Äù as interchangeable space and time fillers. The murderer in you, I suspect, sees the murderer in me, and doesn't give me shit about it.

Forgiveness, as I've said in the past, seemed always about forgiving yourself. A self-serving piety for placating over obsessive thoughts that are causing you harm. Do I forgive my traumatized brain? Do I look every insincere instance from my past with some wizened sense about not knowing any better? No, not really. I learned that I could make that choice, and thus all choices, and never let the lesson take root. I abused my shitty relationship with my mom to drum up a lot of other antagonistic and shitty relationships with other people. I'm still a genuinely mean and shitty person just begging for the proper circumstances and excuses to be anything besides the soft-spoken mumbler walking you through your trash-person drama.

My push for wanting ‚Äúthe world‚Äù is about hopefully shaping it into something that doesn't produce the underlying pathology that is me. I want there to be ‚Äúpeople with a temper‚Äù doing like Mr. Rogers and practicing patience and understanding, not ‚Äúpeople waiting for a reason to kill you‚Äù barely hanging on but for blessed exhaustion and endless distractions. I want people who see the best in everyone, not just their little selfish cohort, after being empowered to recognize their place in concert instead of opposition. I want to subvert the naked animal that tears each other apart. Unrealistic? Probably. But I wish I could carry on without always thinking I have some atrocity to account for, some endeavor that needs to transcend me.

I've always been a draw to the depressed kids. I've always played therapist. I've maintained a kind of fervent or manic optimism fueled by the overwhelming darkness of my jokes and perspective. I've been lucky to have my brain motivated more to dig than destroy. I've been lucky to catch glances and good genes. To consider the world a swirling ball of people like me in worse circumstances is to not have to imagine much beyond what we're currently doing to ourselves. To be able to inspire in spite of that, to be able to create something that lasts longer, yells louder, and beats to death that which actually deserves it is an ultimate game. It's one I don't think you can play in the confines of what's seemingly normal or stable. I still play therapist. I still hold the candle for those who've couched their depression in memes and #lifegoals check boxes.

Maybe I've been too hard on my kid self. Maybe the only reason I have who I have in my life right now is the result of doing the best with the tools I had at the time. Maybe my construct-o-house, collapsing pool hole, and boundless puppy-esc enthusiasm are a testament to the method I've deigned as the madness required for moving forward.",25Jan2020,1
23,"I‚Äôm 35. A mom of two. Raising two little girls by myself with no help from their biological father. Financially or otherwise. I left my abusive ex-husband almost 7 years ago. We live a nice, comfortable life now. In a cute 2 bedroom apartment. I have a good job close to work. I drive a nice car. I adopted a dog whom I love like one of my kids. I hope to buy a home soon. And plan on taking the kids to Disneyland for the first time ever this summer. I am survivor. A fighter. A go getter. I am a strong woman.

He‚Äôs 34. We met almost 4 years ago on a dating app. He‚Äôs never been married. Doesn‚Äôt have kids. He still lives at home with his mom and her husband. He doesn‚Äôt own a car. He relies on his mom‚Äôs car to get him to and from his night shift job. So for this reason, he would always have to spend weekends at my place. It was up to me to drive us around whenever we needed to go somewhere. I cooked. I cleaned. I catered to him. 

We were together off and on for four years. His home life and work schedule were the main reasons for our fights. I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic. A dreamer. I had big plans for our lives. I wanted a big house with the white picket fence. I would‚Äôve liked to have had his first child. I wanted to adopt 2 more dogs. I wanted to get married and grow old with him. I wanted it all.

But what I wanted most of all was for him to love me, appreciate me, grow with me. I wanted to build a life with him. Together. But sadly I couldn‚Äôt even get him to communicate with me. Time and time again it seemed he would become angry over little things I said. He asked me a serious question last week via text and I made a light hearted joke which he became angry about. He said ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt looking for a humorous response.‚Äù I apologized for upsetting him but it was too late. He had already become irritated and non responsive. I caught myself doing this a lot towards the end. Apologizing for upsetting him.

Until this past Wednesday, when I realized enough was enough. I thought to myself 4 years in and we‚Äôre still fighting over the same stupid things. I realized not much progress has been made in the relationship so I decided to give him an ultimatum. I said to him ‚ÄúLook we‚Äôve been doing this for awhile something‚Äôs gotta give. I‚Äôm willing to look past your home situation until you figure that out but in the meantime I will not allow you to mistreat me or disrespect me when you throw your little tantrums. I need to know if this relationship is going somewhere. I need you to be straight up with me and tell me if you‚Äôre able to man up and become the man my kids and I need in our life.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI think you need to take some time and really think whether or not you can do this the right way. If not let me know so I won‚Äôt waste anymore of my time and for the sake of my mental health.‚Äù Well he agreed to think it over.

And today. Sigh. Today he made the decision to walk away. He said he loved me and he could no longer hurt me so he needed to walk away. And that he was truly sorry he couldn‚Äôt be the man my kids and I deserved. 

And I know this is for the best. But I can‚Äôt help but to feel so stupid, rejected, angry, disappointed, sad. He chose the life he has right now living with his mother than to build a life with me. He chose the easy route because God forbid he becomes a man at 34 years old. And yes all the red flags were there for years. But so was my hope...that he would love me enough to change, to grow. Silly me.  And I know this too shall pass and I know that with time I will see this was for the best. But damn. This shit sucks. He. Chose. To. Live. A. Life. With. His. Mother. Than. With. Me. Fuck.....

TL;DR I gave my off and on boyfriend of almost 4 years an ultimatum and he basically chose to continue living a dead end life living at home with his mother than to become the man my kids and I deserve.",25Jan2020,1
24,"When I (25F) moved back to Pennsylvania from living in a small New England town for 3.5 years (in the middle of 6th grade) school was really tough for me. The size of the public middle school was entirely too overwhelming. I ended up going to an alternative, therapy-based school with much, much smaller class sizes. I was accustomed to that type of environment. 

Enter the new girl Jill (25F) (not her real name) in 7th grade. She was super cute and owned a pair of purple and black zebra print skinny jeans. Zebras are my absolute favorite animal so I knew we were gonna get along well. At first I was worried she and my other female classmate were gonna get along better but it turns out Jill didn‚Äôt like her either (she was really snobby). 

We ended up bonding over our similar taste in music. We both were really into Panic! At the Disco (debut album era), Fall Out Boy, and the like. We both loved the ‚Äúscene/emo‚Äù style. Those were the days haha. 

Turns out she recognized me from the brief amount of time I spent at the local middle school. I vaguely recognized her face and I realized that was why. 

We spent so many days after school together. We started making music on our guitars, going to the local mall, journaling, making YouTube videos. We did so much together. We both ended up back in public school and spent senior prom together (since I really wasn‚Äôt into dating while I was in school). Technically she had gotten her GED a couple years prior and was going to college in another state. Her boyfriend (turned fianc√© turned ex much later) attended the same college she was. 

Even though it felt like there was nothing that could tear us apart, any time she had a boyfriend she would prioritize him over me through almost the whole relationship. I would be blatantly jealous. I really could not hide it. Our classmates would joke about me being a closeted lesbian behind my back. 

There were also several instances I realized she wasn‚Äôt entirely loyal. She wouldn‚Äôt stand up for me when I was being trash-talked by our classmates. A female acquaintance told me. 

I was mildly obsessed with keeping in touch with her but she was always the worst at returning texts. Between 2015 and 2017 I moved away to live with an older boyfriend (34M) (who I left because he cheated). The breakup was abrupt and I reached out to her about it, trying to reconnect with old friends I lost touch with while I was away. At this point I hadn‚Äôt seen her in several years. It was a time I truly needed a friend. We had made plans so many times just for her to cancel at the last minute and I had a strong feeling this time wouldn‚Äôt be any different. I was right, but somehow it still hurt even more than the other times. More than likely it was thanks to the already depressing circumstances. And that‚Äôs how I finally came to terms with the fact that we didn‚Äôt have the friendship we used to. It took years of grieving the loss of our friendship before I felt fully capable of living without her. 

The last time I saw her was over 6 months ago. I spontaneously pulled into her driveway driving home from a long-ish drive with my boyfriend (26M) and she and her father just so happened to be working on their pickup truck in front of the house. She had lost quite a bit of weight which was weird. I said hi to her family and caught up with her mom and sister. She ended up coming with me to visit my home to hang and admitted to trying meth once recently. This was after I expressed to her the horrors I‚Äôd witnessed with another friend (24F) who became super addicted to it earlier last year. She said it was a guy she‚Äôs been seeing who had offered her some to try, a guy almost twice her age.

My boyfriend is a recovered drug addict and said to me, ‚ÄúShe said ‚Äòonce‚Äô but I doubt it was just once...‚Äù and I felt, due to the weight she‚Äôd lost, that he was probably right....

It‚Äôs hard growing up and realizing friendships just aren‚Äôt the same as when you‚Äôre a kid in school. Nowadays I spend a decent amount of time with someone (25F) who is much more down-to-earth, even though she might not be the best influence sometimes (she gets into drama in her friend group). But it is so easy to open up to her and over time I‚Äôve gained her trust as well. It‚Äôs nice to just have someone who accepts you no matter what and spend time with you just because they enjoy your presence and support. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest.

I used to have this ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù Instagram and worked my way up to hundreds of likes on pictures. I wasn‚Äôt happy but I thought it was what the world wanted to see. No one would have guessed the pain behind the scenes, physical and mental. 

I became overly obsessed with impressing people and protecting a perfect image. It fueled my ego. Every like was a dopamine boost. 

I‚Äôm a lot more open on my new social media about my illness and that not everything in life is all roses. It‚Äôs not all fun and pretty and shiny.

30,"On mobile rn so punctuation will suck.

I dont know how to start this so ill just go ahead with the biggest thing that comes to mind. Last month me and my girlfriend of a year and 5 months (both our first relationship and our first everything) broke up and it starter out ok because we decided to do a thing for like 2 weeks where we say we arent dating but did all the same stuff as before, then it wasnt working out so we stopped seeing eachother completely. We both hated it and we loved eachother so much but she just said she wasnt happy and i still cant wrap my head around why exactly she broke up with me. After that i went back to being depressed and started cutting but decided to cut the shit (pun intended) and went straight to vertical cutting. Ive not been doing it much but every time i do it is with the intent of cutting a vein and bleeding out until i die. Not worked yet though. Ive been very emotionless since we broke up and when i do show emotion its when its something about her. Ive cried a few times and i dont really cry much usually but it has been a lot of crying for hours because i cant get her out of my head all i can think of is her and our memories together and how much i love her and wish things were the way they were. I want to die because if there is a heaven then it would be with her and thats all i want and if i cant get that then i dont want to live at all. She left because she isnt happy but ever since she left me she has only gotten worse. She is not being herself. We talk sometimes to check up on eachother and she has told me whats been going on with her and she said she sent a nude of her ass to someone thats shes only friends with and she also told me she had sex with a guy that ive known about for a few months and she said she regrets all of it and realises that it isnt helping. She was never the type to do any of this, it took us 9 months to have sex and over a year for us to send nudes to eachother so i dont get why she would do these things. She is also very stressed with work and college and she said she has given up and doesnt know what to do anymore. I thought breaking up was supposed to help her not make her worse. She said she was thinking about it for a long time before she even told me about breaking up and i think its because i failed all my exams and havent been able to get a job since but i cant get a straight answer from her. All i can do is blame myself for not trying hard enough in school. I did everything for her my world revolved around her she is all that i care about. I wish the past month never happened. My birthday was november so i guess that makes this worse too. My previous relationship ( i know i said this was my first but the previous one my actual first one doesnt really count as it didnt go anywhere) also ended around my birthday which is a coincidence that i hate. I have no friends left because i ditched everyone after school finished  and im trying my hardest to make new relationships but nothing is working i just wish none of this ever happened. We even thought of plans for the future, where we were gonna live, baby names and pets. We also shared a lot of the same thoughts and we would often say the same thing at the same time like our minds were connected.

32,"in may 2018 my business went to shit.. i was making a really good living for a 25 year old. i didn't go to university so all i can do really is build myself up.

i got depressed cause me and my girlfriend had just broken up too so i started drinking and spending a ton of money and before i knew it everything was gone.

then i had to move back home to the suburbs and i'm still here. don't get me wrong, being home is great. i can't complain about my lifestyle really, but i just wanna get back out there and live my own life and living in the suburbs and living with my parents is not allowing me to do that.

new york is expensive no matter how you look at it. i'm going on 27 and i'm really not trying to live with roommates ESPECIALLY when they're going to be strangers. if it was a good friend of mine then it could be a possibility but a random person .. no way.

my brother is really successful and i work for him and he's training me to do just what he does so that i can be his number two pretty much. it's a promising future but i just feel like i'm wasting my life. i make money but it's nowhere near enough money to move out on my own. if i stick with this i will eventually earn some good money but when that will be is a mystery.

i don't spend a lot but i do spend because saving is pointless because even if i save every single dollar i make and then move out, it'll only be a matter of time before living expenses catch up.

i'm getting older and my life's just not going anywhere and i'm losing hope because i want to get back out there and live and i feel like i just can't do this anymore.",25Jan2020,1

So my girlfriend and I are new to having sex. She uses birth control and I always use a condom she has been using birth control for about only a year, she usually has two very light periods throughout the month. About 4 weeks ago we had sex once again she is on birth control and I use a condom and try my best to pull out ( sometimes u get carried away) 3 days after sex she had her period. But she never had her second period that she usually gets during the month. 

She hasn‚Äôt gotten her period but last Sunday she also changed birth control ( got a higher dose) so she would hopefully stop having 2 periods. Do u guys think my girlfriend is pregnant?",25Jan2020,1

 Now though, all I have left to do is ‚Äústart from scratch‚Äù. I will just have to build it back up bit by bit. I believe in myself but it sucks that this has happened to me.

It took the encouragement from her and my friends to move on with my life and focus on the things. It was a good relationship while it lasted for me because I felt things that I didn't in my past relationships.

39,"I can't even remember the first time I was in on a fake account (I always share them with friends who also troll people with it), I Think it was around christmas 2013, I was 12 years old and two friends invited me to a fake Facebook account in which we messaged Girls at our school saying things to them such as making fun of their acne, their boobs or how fat they were(I don't Think this one is funny anymore, but Everything after this is).

My next fake account was around 2015, it was on kik(lets call him L), I, and a friend(not the same as the ones before) started talking to a girl (lets call her B), we started charming her and she fell for our non-existant character, after that we started doing weird shit like sending cow emojis or sending her profile Picture to her randomly. We got bored of her several times so when we didnt feel like talking to her for months we would just come back saying ""oh my friend threw my phone into the lake"" or ""i was in a car accident and my phone got crushed"" as an excuse. Then when we got tired of her for real we told her something like ""hey this is L's mom, L was repairing his car and his skull got crushed beneath the car""(paraphrasing). I was 14 during this time.

This next account was on instagram, this was in 2018 around february, i was 16 and my friend(not the same as any of the above) told me he started talking to B again with a new account (lets call him E). This was basically the same as with L but we would randomly say shit like ""you're starting to annoy me, shut the fuck up"" in the middle of a conversation or we would say ""i want you to lick my ass"" or ""im going to stick my dick so far down your throat that you cant breathe"". She believed all of this was real and even wanted to meet up(I guess because she doesnt get to talk to a lot of boys). But every time we said we would meet up we would come up with a funny excuse like for example saying that E vomited on the bus and had to go home. This one ended with E getting a lung infection and dying. Also, in the downtime when B wasn't answering we would talk to other Girls from school or anyone we saw on IG, Calling them whores for not answering and generally just pissing people off

Later in 2018, dont remember exactly when but probably in the spring. I got the itch to mess with B again and I made a new account called K, the chatting between K and B was basically the same as it was between E and B, except worse. And the chatting with random Girls also got worse, one time we made fun of someone whose friend has just died, dont remember what exactly we said but i do remember it included lots of laughing emojis. One day we found one particular girl with aspergers, she would do things like rip her own hair out randomly, lets call her D, this was around the summer. D fell of K IMMEDIATELY, she was crazy in love after the first day, we messed with her so much, we even tricked her to go to the Town Square, and we almost sent pictures of her to her on snapchat just saying ""you"", but one friend thought it was too much and stopped us ( we were 6 at this Point). She never saw us. I even called her one day using my real voice just for fun, and the same day we had a livestream on instagram in which we almost showed our faces(she was watching). And when we got bored of D we told her K was a fake account. But, in june of 2018 one guy told us he knows what school we go to and threatened our lives(we had got Death threats tons of times but never from someone who actually knew our school) so we deleted K.

Immediately after the deletion of K, I created a new account called AD, this account got banned after only a week because we went on feminist's pages and told them to stay in the kitchen and such, also said a bunch of nazi stuff. All phones that were logged in to AD were system banned, we could no longer log in to accounts but the accounts we were already logged into stayed.

At the start of 2019 we noticed the ban was gone and we made a new account called M, this one was a girl. We started talking to a BUNCH of guys but one there was one called N, we made him send videos of him jerking off and moaning like a girl, and we made him send us a small amount of Money. And Another we made Another guy called AB send videos of him twerking. And then there was Another guy called V that we facetimed with, he thought that his new girlfriend was Calling him but then he picks up and sees 4 masked guys all saying ""Hi V!"". This was the last account

Yesterday, I was called mean by a friend when I showed some of the chats between E and B. He's the type of guy that is nice to everyone, has lots of friends and everyone likes. And he called me mean, I lied and told him it was a joke and B was in on it, he believed me, but it still hurt. The entire day yesterday I self-reflected and realized that yes, i am mean. I never even realized it until he said that, and it's what made me write this post, I still Think the chats are hilarious(I have them saved on my computer) But I won't make any more, and I won't let anyone know this side of me(except for the people that already know)

TL;DR: Used a lot of fake accounts since 2013 and messed with people that were easily tricked and/or had mental disabilities",25Jan2020,1

41,"Throwaway account, and a very long text - sorry about that. I tried to include every little detail that might be relevant to the outcome of this story. English also isn't my first language, so sorry about that, as well. I wanted to post this on AITA or r/relationship at first, but it doesn't quite fit in either, so there. I am looking forward to your insights and inputs - thanks in advance for reading my wall of text. 

I (36F) am a bit of a late bloomer. I started attending college in 2018 in order to fulfill my life-long dream. Learning new things, and meeting people I can exchange knowledge with and learn from, were my primary goals in that regard. Because of my professional background I soon became student body representant, which I stayed until now (currently 3rd semester; this part is relevant for the story).

During the 1st semester, I started coaching a young colleague (26M, let's call him Abe) in programming. I also brought together the different groups of our class, so that study groups could be formed. It came to light that Abe is a physics whiz, and he started teaching all of our class on Saturdays. Very soon, people started to exploit him a bit, and I stopped attending his ""classes"" because of that. I also tried telling him that he needed to look after himself as well, because he started struggling with his other courses due to the amount of time he invested in his physics class preparations. 

During the second semester, he stopped giving those lectures. By this time, we had formed what I regarded as a friendship. I'm usually a very private person (so this post is actually a really hard thing for me to do), but I started sharing personal things about my life with him, and I worried about him a lot when he was struggling with events from his life. He kind of became my work husband and my confidante, at least from my perspective. I also tried to be there for him whenever he needed anything, from small nervous breakdowns, to self doubts, and more serious things like the death of his aunt. During the longer text sessions, I often tried to empower him. He tended to ghost me a lot right from the start when he did not need anything from me, but I always gave him the benefit of a doubt and told myself that he was just a different kind of person than I am, and younger, and tried not to make much of that. I tried talking to him about my own self doubts sometimes, but kind of stopped early on because there never was a real effort from his side to reassure me. When he talked to me about something that I needed to talk about, he tended to be overly critical and strict, and said this was due to my being older than most of the others, that I should know better, that I had the most experience. 

At the end of the second semester, he invited me to a private study group, there were four of us. In the beginning, we just did physics, but we started studying for other courses, as well. Abe and I used to go for walks during study breaks and talk a bit, or drive around a bit and talk. I never knew why. He was always the one who initiated that. I kept waiting for him to talk about something specific, because I felt like he might need to talk about his family situation, or his relationship. I just had the feeling he was unhappy. But he is a very tight-lipped person when it comes to a deeper level, and so I just walked and chatted with him, trying to be there if he needed me. 

At the same time, Abe started to become kind of mean to me when we were with the others. I once jokingly mentioned this when we were texting, and he reacted in a very strange manner. He seemed to have had a sleepless night because of my minor comment, told me he was mean to people that he liked, and that I should please just leave it at that. I guess from that point on, there always were two completely different Abes for me, depending on whether we were alone or with others. His behaviour was often very confusing to me. For instance, he hugged me on a few occasions, one time even giving me a massage, which kind of freaked me out; in contrast, he went distant and cold for days or weeks, only to open up again and be warm and friendly once more. During the summer break, I decided to keep my distance, because he had started to become mostly dismissive towards me at that point, and I was figuring he just didn't want or need this friendship.

After the summer break, there were three of us left in our study group (the third one being 32M, let's call him Joe), and we made a pact that we would go through the rest of our college semesters together, like the Musketeers or something. We sat together every Saturday, every Sunday, and I helped Joe on many of the other days with a course he was struggling with at the time. Because I had the feeling I couldn't contribute much, I started preparing slides for this very extensive course of ours, and talked the others through them, Joe especially, in order to help them with it.   
Also after the summer break (immediately after), Abe asked me whether everything was okay between us, because he had the feeling I kept my distance. I was confused once again and didn't say much to this. He said he just found it odd that we hadn't been texting during the summer, which I in turn found odd, because he had never texted me or showed interest in staying in contact. We started talking a bit, and Abe finally opened up to me about something that was a burden to him, but only once, only briefly, and I tried not to pressure the subject, but rather be there in case he needed to talk about it again. At the same time, I had some personal stuff to deal with (issues in my relationship, hormonal issues), which Abe knew about. Not every detail about it, but he knew the outlines.

The study group went very well, we always had a bunch of fun, talked a lot inbetween, etc. And we worked together exceptionally well; although we had a lot of fun, we were also very productive. Still, it actually started to feel like a family rather than a study group. I used to try to soothe Joe when he was afraid to go to the dentist or something like that, because first of all, he has no partner, second of all, I felt kind of like the big sister of the group. At one point, we even took Joe to the hospital at night for a checkup on what could have been an emergency, waited with him, tried to comfort and calm him (in the end, it turned out to be nothing, Joe is fine now. I just added this in an attempt to try to draw the right picture about the situation).

But then, somehow, some day, the dynamics turned. One day, Abe insulted me behind my back and got caught by me. That day, I had asked whether the two of them could wait for me with doing physics, because it was the one day in all that time that I had an appointment Saturday morning and would be a bit late, to which Abe wrote to Joe that ""I am an intense snowflake"" (which I accidentally saw later that day when Joe shared his screen). I felt hurt, not only by the talking-behind-my-back-part, but also because I really hate the term ""snowflake"" and everything it stands for. I also did not understand why my asking to wait for me (for an hour, one time) in a study group of three would justify my being insulted behind my back.

I confronted Abe, we talked about it, he apologized, said he was very impulsive, but assured me that our friendship was valuable to him and that he would work on regaining my trust. This did not take long, as I make an effort of not being resentful and really liked him a lot. After a week or so, I thought this episode was over and done with and attributed it to stress. 

But then things started to happen. Joe, who had always been on my side until then, started attacking me all of a sudden. At first it was in a playful manner, but he kept saying things like ""I was not like them"", I was ""being too dramatic"", started criticising that I was ""always worrying about others"", told me not to share my documents with others of our class/year, became angry when I helped new colleagues etc. 

One evening, he also used the exact insult that Abe had used. To this, I admittedly did not react well. I was furious, so very mad that I walked away from them for 20 minutes in order to calm down. The two of them kind of ganged up on me afterwards, so I ended up having a very long talk with Joe alone, where I explained why I need to walk away when I'm mad like this (I never talk to anyone in a state this agitated, because I need to be able to control what I'm saying and don't want to hurt others when I can't). He did not understand this and said this is childish behaviour and that he does not know whether he can overlook this. I also explained why I hate the term snowflake and prejudice like that, to which he told me that I *am* a snowflake. And he also told me that this is ""just like how they are"" (meaning Abe and himself), that I am constantly worrying about others, too dramatic, would always take offense in something they said, and that it takes too much of an effort being with me, basically. Which I did not understand at all, because up to that point, I had never felt as comfortable in a group as I had with them, and honestly, I accepted them for who they were, liked both of them. All through my life, I have always been a bit of an outsider, always the odd one out, and it felt so good to be a part of a group for a change. 

In retrospect, they very often asked me whether everything was okay, but I never understood why. I think I have ""resting sad face"" when I'm focussing on something. I also have a silent and shy natural, am a bit on the day-dreaming side, but I am also very outspoken in discussions when I feel strongly about something. They also very often mistook my sarcasm as me being offended (which I never was, except for the snowflake-thing). But to be fair, each time I told them that I was not offended by something (which started to become a thing I had to repeat more and more often), they never believed me.   
Nevertheless, in all actuality, the study group had felt like a safe space for me. So on said evening, Joe and I talked for a long time afterwards and made up eventually. He even apologized for what he said and we both asked if everything was truly okay between us. I went home feeling happy and relieved, and we even each texted each other some reassurance afterwards. I was feeling glad that we could fight, argue and make up like that, and continue with focussing on our studies.

But starting the following day, Joe had completely changed. He became distant and silent whenever I was around him, took things I said the wrong way. There was this ice wall around him all of a sudden, and I decided to just leave him be at the moment and tried to give him some space. We still did our study sessions, but the criticism and attacks grew in frequency and seriousness.

He also started criticising my work as student body rep, but not in a constructive manner. We had always had discussions before, and by far not always agreed. I used to like discussions with Joe, because as heated as they could become, neither one of us had ever taken it seriously or personal. This is something I really like, and at one point I had even talked to Abe about how much I enjoy discussions with Joe. But now it became... different. Now, whenever I disagreed with something, I was told (by both of them) that I took things personal and should not be offended so easily. I always try to discuss facts and opinions, consider arguments and give counter-arguments and stay factual, so this was really very confusing to me.

Joe literally told me that he did not think I was up to the student rep job because I was too weak and could not fight for our interests among the other student body reps. He also told me that everyone else also sees it this way. As the other student body reps are not only very young, but also very respectful towards me and always follow my lead, I was deeply disturbed by this... ""feedback"".  
And since this was pretty much the only feedback about my job as student body rep that I had ever gotten at this point, I became insecure and asked around among my other colleagues. Fortunately, Joe's point of view was not one I heard repeated even once.

I tried talking to Abe about it at that point, but he started telling me very early on that much of this new dynamic was just because of me and the way I was, because of my behaviour. He unfortunately never was more specific than that. Basically, that I was taking things too personal, and that ""this is just how Joe was"". 

The last time our group was together - as usual in Joe's apt and after the extensive course with the slides was nearly over and we all had earned our necessary points for that course - we were doing our C# homework, which Joe usually was struggling with a bit. At that point, I already found it very hard to talk to Joe. I became more and more careful, tried to give him his space etc, but also tried to stop engaging in discussions because of the reasons I stated earlier. So in this situation, I tried helping him with C#, but noticed that he became aggravated. I got the strong feeling he did not want to be helped by me. Still, I tried to, very cautiosly, show him where the errors in his code might be and why, but he did not listen and scrolled around in his code very furiously. So I said to him, silently: ""Well, try by yourself"", thinking that maybe he would calm down and we could try looking at it together again later. But, no. 5 minutes later he threw us out of his apt, and, as I soon learned, also threw me out of our study group for good. It was very clear to me, right at that moment, that the two of them would keep on studying together without me. Since I had never, ever, been thrown out by someone before in my whole life, I was very, very distraught and did not know what to make of it. The way I am wired is, I need to talk about things, explain my point of view and try to understand the other's, until a mutual understanding has been reached. I get that this is not everyone's cup of tea, though.

Abe at first did not believe that Joe had primarily thrown *me* out (as Abe usually disagrees with almost everything I say), but claimed that I misread the situation and it had nothing to do with me. After a short phone call between the two of them that same day, Abe told me that it would be best if we gave Joe some space and that it indeed had to do with me *only*. Around this time, Abe also started to tell me that it was my behaviour which caused this, again without giving me specifics I could understand or work with. After I repeated to him how I had perceived the situation, he immediately told me that it's no wonder Joe had thrown me out, because ""Well, try by yourself"" was really very insulting. Quick side note: the two of them are the kind of people who ""insult in jest"", for instance, it was very common for Abe to tell Joe and me that we were stupid during physics sessions. I was constantly jokingly bullied about being ""so old"" etc. So, when Abe told me that what I had said was an insult that justified Joe's reaction - which turned out to become a complete shut-down -, I was baffled. I need to add that, to this day, Joe has never talked to me (or Abe) about why he has thrown me out, so I can only assume that it really was this one thing I have said that tipped him over.

Two days later, I posted in our group chat whether it might be a good idea to do our next session at the Uni (because I really did not want to go where I am not wanted, meaning Joe's apt, and I thought maybe we could talk about everything in a neutral space). We had previously planned to study every day that week, which kind of fell through after the whole throwing-out episode. Joe just replied ""ok"". The day before our scheduled meeting I asked in the group chat at which time they would like to meet. But Joe never replied. When I talked about this with Abe, Abe told me that ""this is how Joe was, when he was done with someone, he was done for good, there's nothing I could do about it"". I asked Abe whether he really thinks this behaviour was less dramatic than mine, to which Abe replied that I had taught him not to judge, which is usually what he says about anything Joe does now.

Besides my personal feelings and all sorts of emotions about this, I also worried deeply about my courses, because there were two courses I knew I would struggle with a lot when having to do them all on my own. Unfortunately, I am prone to depression (which Abe knows), and this is what happened to me soon after (ironically, much like it would to a ""snowflake""). I even went to therapy because of it, but simultaneously tried to focus the little energy I had on finding new study partners, which I never succeeded in to this day, despite my best efforts.

As to Abe. Since Joe threw me out of his apt at the end of October, Abe and I had 3 or 4 talks in person, 2 of them by my request and longer than 5 minutes. Almost every time Joe saw me talking to Abe, he became furious, red in his face, obviously very, very angry. Abe never left his side again, and Abe also very soon never approached me again when Joe was present. Abe and I texted a lot, and those text sessions soon started to become more and more hurtful and resentful from both sides. At one point I asked him to mediate between Joe and I, but had the strong feeling that he was too much on Joe's side to do that - and it never came to that, anyway, because Joe had no interest in talking. 

Another colleague noticed that I wasn't feeling well and asked me what was wrong, and it sort of all burst out of me, the whole story. This colleague asked Abe for his side of the story afterwards, and Abe told me the next day that it was not at all okay of me to talk about this to people who have no business in it just so that I ""can get approval from them"". And that he would not tolerate being asked to choose between friends (which I had never, ever done. I had always said explicitly that it would be fine with me if he stayed friends with Joe, just that I for my part would not want to have anything to do with Joe anymore at that point).

I asked him why it was taken for granted that the two of them went on studying without me when we had agreed to do everything together, and he told me that Joe and him had made a previous pact that I did not know about. He added that we could still do our C# project together, that I could do my part remotely and without meeting them, because Joe would not tolerate me being in his apt. I declined, and I openly admit that I did not decline in a tactful or constructive or even nice manner. Side note: I had the most C# experience in our group and felt used at that point. Knowing that Abe would not go for this, I provoked him and told him that I would do the C# thing with them only if I could join physics again. I also told him that I had always been there for him and that I did not deserve being treated this way. To this, he told me that I was showing a ""very ugly side"" and that he, Abe, did not deserve any of that. We stopped contact, except for student rep business, after that.

In our class, there is kind of a loose ritual to have lunch together after lectures. It was usually Joe who invited everyone, and around that time, he of course stopped inviting me. At one point, he asked every single person around me, and because noone knew about our falling out, everyone just assumed that I had been invited as well. This snowballed, and since November, I have not been invited anymore, which caused my being isolated within my own group and losing touch with my colleagues. I tried talking to Abe about this in late November. At that time, my grandmother was dying, and it kept becoming too hard for me to endure the growing isolation, the inability to find study partners, the situation with my grandmother, and the loss of the friendship I thought I once had had with Abe. So I told Abe that I would try to switch to another class for the rest of the year (where we hardly knew anyone). Abe told me that, if I would do that, I would be dead to him, that others are struggling as well (he knew about my grandmother) and that this would be cowardly of me. I must admit that I changed my behaviour towards him from that day on, did not sugarcoat things anymore when we texted about student body rep stuff, and stopped being friendly altogether. 

Something that additionally broke my heart was that another colleague of ours, who is friends with Joe but whom I also liked very much right from the beginning and who always used to like me a lot as well, completely changed his behaviour towards me. He can't look me in the eyes anymore on those rare occasions we talk to each other nowadays, and if we do talk, he keeps glancing in Joe's direction. Needless to say, I have never talked to this person about any part of the story.

During all of this, I of course fell behind in the two courses I have mentioned earlier. One of them I could have done on my own, but there was no chance of that for the other one.

The fact that I went from being fully integrated, 7 days a week among colleagues, to being completely and utterly alone, with minimal contact to my group and only minor opportunities for exchange, took a strain on me that made it impossible to stay focussed. My education is kind of an ""you will not be able to do this alone""-one, which even the head of the department had told us very urgently on our very first day.

About two weeks ago and because of all of the above, I finally decided to end things and to drop out from the current year, planning on continuing with my study next year in order to make a fresh and healthier start. I told Abe this, and I also told him that I do not like how things went between the two of us, that I accept that I played my part in it as well, and that I would like for us to decide together how we would shape our dynamic for the rest of my time there. 

We are now civil towards each other, and he is even trying to be nice and was at one point even giving me positive feedback, which is weird, because he had never said anything positive about anything I've done before, like, ever. The other day I asked him whether it would be possible that we go for a walk next week in order to say goodbye. The part I did not tell him: It is perfectly clear to me that I cannot keep him in my life and that our acquaintanceship keeps making me miserable. I cannot help but feel I am to be at his disposal whenever he needs something, but am in turn treated in a way that is plain cold and borderlining on brutality. The way his sudden niceness weirded me out helped opening my eyes a bit in that regard. I have started to collect the small things that are missing, which is never good in any kind of relationship, but I can't help finding new ones. Plus, I really don't like my own behaviour in reaction to all that. The way I talked to Abe in the end - this is not a person I want to be. Respect and kindness are key values in my life, and I feel like I've dishonoured them both, and with that, myself and everything I would like to stand for.

But I also know how it feels to be thrown out of someone's life, and even if he does not care (I really don't know at this point), I feel the need to end things with a talk, so that everyone gets the chance to say their peace if they need to, and walk away from each other for good peacefully, out of respect for the good parts of our friendship.

Anyway, Abe reacted surprised and wrote something like ""there's no need to say goodbye, it's not like one of us vanishes from this earth"". I only replied that I needed closure, which I think he understood the way it was meant, because he is now ghosting me once more.

I know that I have explained myself a lot in this post. I didn't want to justify myself or bias or influence your opinion with this, but tried to explain the situation like I felt and perceived it. This story really disrupted my life in a way that was very shocking to my boyfriend, my family, and my friends - and, last but not least, to myself. There are still so many parts of it that I cannot make sense of - first and foremost, why I am still struggling so hard to just leave it all behind. I really need to know: am I the asshole here? Because from Abe and Joe's perspective, I clearly am. And if I am: Why and how? If you have any input on how I could have prevented or evaded any of that, I would be so thankful, because I feel that I need to learn something from this. Further: Do you think this thing with Abe was even a friendship to begin with?

Thank you so much for reading, reddit, I know this has been a \_lot\_ of text.

TL;DR: I became part of a group that felt like a family to me, got thrown out of that group, lost a friendship that might never have been one and needed to change my whole life drastically in order to get over all this. Why do you think this happened, and how could I have prevented this?",25Jan2020,1

I've been taking antidepressants for about three months now and am starting to get better! Last night I organized an outing with two of my closest friends, their s/o, and a new friend I recently made a work. We started at a brewery and then walked to a nearby board game library. It took an hour to learn the rules of this ridiculously complicated board game, but we had a great time collaborating on trying to figure it out. It was a great group of people --many strangers to one another -- but after the first drink we all hit it off!

61,"The next time you find yourself in a conflict with your partner, a friend, a family member, a coworker etc. try this technique.

When we find ourselves in conflict, one of the hardest things to accept‚Äî and arguably the most important thing to accept ‚Äî is that our perception of the situation could be wrong. No one can read minds, we don‚Äôt always have all the information, and we don‚Äôt always understand others‚Äô intentions. 

This technique is one way to ‚Äòcheck‚Äô your perception. 

Step 1: Describe the behavior.

Example: ‚ÄúI noticed that when you walked in to the apartment this afternoon you slammed the bedroom door really hard‚Äù

Clear, concise, with zero judgment. Just describe exactly what you observed.

Step 2: Offer two possible explanations.

Example: ‚ÄúI noticed that when you walked in to the apartment this afternoon you slammed the bedroom door really hard. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because you had a tough day at work or maybe it was just an accident...‚Äù

Again, no judgments, just two explanations. Offering two possible explanations gives the other person the opportunity to clarify. It‚Äôs also quite vulnerable for you. What you are doing is asking the other person to be vulnerable in explaining their behavior. In order for them to open up, you‚Äôre going to have to be vulnerable first. Offering these two explanations shows the other person that you‚Äôre being open and honest about your perception. You‚Äôre not holding any hidden assumptions or judgments because everything is out in the table. This creates space for them to be open, honest, and vulnerable as well. 

Step 3: Ask for clarification.

Example: ‚ÄúI noticed that when you walked in to the apartment this afternoon you didn‚Äôt say anything to me and then you slammed the bedroom door really hard. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because you had a tough day at work or maybe it was just an accident. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù

Short, simple and, most importantly, open ended ‚Äî‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù. And again, *no judgement*, i.e. ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù. In my opinion, you should never under any circumstances say, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù That phrase is loaded with assumptions, perception, and judgment. Just avoid it. 

And that‚Äôs it! You have successfully checked your perception at the door. Now your only job is to LISTEN and UNDERSTAND. Ask open ended questions. Do NOT try to fix anything unless you are explicitly asked to do a specific thing. People just want to be heard and understood. 

People just want a witness.",25Jan2020,1

75,"I became a Catholic precisely because I am a bitter and vicious asshole. It was the religion where everyone got to be miserable, not just gay people. Nope, no abortion or birth control. Nope, can't even pull out. Nope, no swinging, friends with benefits, BDSM, fucking your hot secretary, not even masturbation, nothing. When I was growing up Protestant, it got my nerves how people said gay people can't marry ""because they can't have kids"" but then they go on to have birth control (and even abortion) in their own marriages (more like transactional arrangements). Even better is when they try to justify BDSM with the ""wives submitting to husband"" thing, meanwhile saying being gay hurt your dignity. Being gay isn't inherently violent, unlike BDSM. Violence and degradation is the whole point of why people find BDSM appealing, there's no reason why a person who is mentally healthy would like that. You think I am kink shaming? Fight me. My own family was viciously homophobic, it's the main part of why they shamed me publically and I don't talk to them anymore. Their own child. Yet, they were supportive of birth control and even abortion (but only for married people, because unmarried people should be ""punished"" with pregnancy). 

And let's not get into the fuckbuddies, masturbating, fucking your hot coworker... straight people do it all the time and nobody thinks being straight is inherently promiscuous and disordered.  Even the pastor, who also just happens to be one of the wealthiest dudes in town, gets to snag the hot choir lady or pianist at church, while he tells gays that something is wrong with us and suggests celibacy in a community where there celibacy is seen as a failure or a punishment.

Also, Catholics are honest about being assholes. You know that there were only male Dalai Lamas, even though on paper they ""could be"" female? They're full of shit. There's more chance of a woman becoming the president of United States than becoming a Dalai Lama. You think I am being intolerant? Fuck you, try to tell me why I am wrong.

78,"If the end justifies the means, then the life we have all been givin is a cruel weapon of torture, capable of summoning infinite suffering.

We are slaves to misery. If you cease trying to improve your life, then you are punished with more pain. Therefore, pain is our master, and we are required to fulfil its wishes or be purged of joy.

The only quantifiable evidence of your life improving are all things that can be lost. Health, emotional satisfaction, wealth and relationships all must be grown, cultured, and maintained or otherwise be lost. These things do not inherently bring you happiness; they just make the world a little more inhabitable. You cannot escape the suffering that is the natural state of being. Rather, you can only find materials that help move you a little further from its grasp. Life is not better with these things; but without them, it is worse. That is our only comfort, ""It could always be worse"".

What's the point of tomorrow? And the next day? And the next day? If at the end of this road is the end of my life, then what am I seeking to do? Why should I relax tomorrow? Why should I go to work? Why should I do anything at all, if at the the end of existence it doesn't add up to anything?

It's all just a terrible, cruel chore, maintaining all these bits and pieces of my life just to make sure I can live in momentary comfort. It's all so fleeting. I'm always struggling with money, I have very little friends, and I cannot afford health insurance. I wonder why I even bother. Why put in the effort to fix any of these things if the outcome is a fixed constant? I will die, and it will all end, whether I am happy or not. Why bother?

What is the difference between ending my life now or prematurely? If the end is the same, then who gives a shit about the means that make up the middle?

I won't kill myself. It would cause too much suffering, or at the very least a small inconvenience, to the people around me. It hurts my heart imagining ever hurting someone so permanently due to my own selfish wish to escape. I could never bring myself to go that far.

So I'm 22 and introverted to a certain degree. I like talking to new people as long as they approach me first. But I don't know how to sustain conversations above the superficial small talk apart from when the other person(people)  takes it up. I have about 5-6 friends with whom I can be very open. That's owed to humour (it's darker than your phone's lock screen), limited common interests, and being around each other for a few years. However, even with them, I struggle to have deep, meaningful talks. If people turn to me for advice, it's always involves my work or a TV show or something. It's never about any serious stuff. Because of all this, I've never had a proper relationship though I crave one.

The last 2 trips I've been on - 1 with a group of 15 childhood friends and 1 with a couple of friends I don't know so well - have not been fun. We've done fun stuff, but I've felt like I'm being left out, like I'm just a lurking presence that's barely noticed and I can see why to be honest!

But even then no one ever wants to hangout with me or do anything. No one EVER hits me up. And I mean EVER. The only person I have is my fiance, but he never wants to do anything. All he ever does is sit on his ass playing video games or watching stupid shit on youtube. If we ever end up doing shit, it's just running errands or going out to eat + drink for the millionth time. I'm sick of all the places we go and I don't even like drinking. But unfortunately we live in a boring ass place and that's the only thing we really have to do. And he doesn't have any friends either, so we really don't have anyone to go out and do shit with. My life is fucking boring and stupid and I'm fucking tired of it.

I'm horrible around people so I feel like it's damn near impossible to make any friends. I'm sick of just sitting around watching him do nothing and smoking weed all day everyday. We get up, go to work and then come home to do nothing. If there's ever anything I want to do, he usually shuts it down or we'll make plans and then cancel. Usually because he ""doesn't like to be around a lot of people"" And I have no friends to go out and do the thing with. So again, I end up sitting around doing nothing, wishing I was out doing stupid shit with friends. I feel myself getting more and more depressed and boring and it drives me insane. I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind in this rut. I try to go out by myself, but there's nothing to do except go out to eat or walk around the dying, desolate, sad excuse of a mall.

I'm not suicidal but sometimes I just want to fucking die. It's Saturday night and for the 100,000,000th time, I'm doing NOTHING. Fucking NOTHING. I could say ""I'm bored"" but that'll be followed up by a ""that sucks"" or a ""let's watch a movie/play video games, etc.."" I don't want to do that AGAIN. I'm TIRED OF IT. I'm FUCKING BORED. God I hate my fucking life so much some times. 

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this, just kind of felt like I needed to get it out.",25Jan2020,1
86,"How to Stay Happy When You Shit the Bed that is Your Life.

WARNING: The post you are about to read has no foundation in psychology and would likely be considered useless drivel by the useless-drivel-soaked #self-help ‚Äúindustry‚Äù.
 
Without further ado, I bequeath to you toppi‚Äôs Three Pillars of Happiness.

‚Ä¢	At age 30, I threw caution to the wind. It turned out like pissing in-to the wind.

‚Ä¢	The plunge required careful rationalization (because lying to yourself is KEY).

‚Ä¢	As a result, I came away with some possibly #self-help-y knowledge.

‚Ä¢	With this knowledge, you can totally shit on one pillar at a time and be less likely to want to ‚Äúoff‚Äù yourself‚Ä¶ you know, for a while at least.

‚Ä¢	What the fuck are the Three Pillars of Happiness you ask? These are your Intimate Relationship(s), Family &amp; Friends, and ‚ÄúJob‚Äù.

If you read the preceding bullets, then you are probably thinking‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhmmm, that‚Äôs actually quite insightful‚Äù or you aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ and to that I say, you can fuck right off.  Now that we‚Äôve eliminated every reader but you, whoever you are, let me expand upon these Three Pillars and why understanding them will arm you with a simple yet powerful risk-diversification strategy. But first, I digress‚Ä¶

My god-mother (is that still a thing?) once told me that ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs a bitch and then you die‚Äù. Wise words, I thought, if not quite of the Glass Half Full variety. I choose to embrace that little nugget of wisdom and use it to strengthen my Glass Half Full view on life and interpret it to mean: Don‚Äôt Worry, Be Happy (like my favorite song). For reals though, enjoy the positive aspects of life, because for most of us, the shitty parts are gonna get shittier. 

NOTE: An exception to the rule applies for those who are physically attractive, tall, well-endowed, intelligent, driven, and wealthy‚Ä¶ and to you I say, you can fuck right off.

Anywho‚Ä¶ the point I was trying to make is that lame things happen in life and you need to be prepared to weather the storm of impending misery. Some of the crappy things that happen, like, all the fucking time:

ÔÇß	A cheating, condescending, or otherwise selfish significant other dumps you

ÔÇß	Losing, hating, scraping by, or just plain sucking, at your job/career/money-making scheme

ÔÇß	Deaths, disagreements, and political arguments in your pool of family and friends

If you have not had these or similar problems in life, then buckle down and get ready, because if you haven‚Äôt fucked right off per my note above, then the universe is saving up for a big time fuck you.

This brings me to my main point ‚Äì avoid purposefully stepping in shit if you don‚Äôt have at least TWO strong Pillars of Happiness.

Look, this isn‚Äôt rocket science. Shiiit, you probably understood the instant you read the bullet points. That said, I thought this was an interesting topic, so I‚Äôm gonna finish it damnit.

Have you ever had an enjoyable and financially satisfactory career? Have you simultaneously had family and/or friends that you can depend on? Have you been in an intimate and usually romantic relationship during these periods? 

If you had all three, congrats dawg/dawg-ess, you won the fucking lottery. What more do you want, you greedy dingle-berry? Don‚Äôt fuck it up!

Unfortunately, if you‚Äôre like me, maybe you don‚Äôt (or didn‚Äôt) have a choice. To keep that intimate relationship, maybe you have to move across the country, away from all of your friends and family and take on a new career. Well, if you decide that this must be done, for God‚Äôs sake, be logical about it. Yes, be logical, I said. You‚Äôre already making an emotional decision that comes with the risk of stepping in shit. Don‚Äôt put all your happiness eggs into one basket.

You already stepped in shit didn‚Äôt you?

Okay, I get it‚Ä¶ I step in shit all the time and it pisses me off to no end. Like, pick up after your fucking dog, you inconsiderate fucks. I love dogs, but I don‚Äôt like to step in their shit.

What can you do besides attempting to rinse off your shoe (the shoe is a metaphor for your happiness, duh)? You can make damn sure that you have logically assessed your situation and you have TWO other Pillars of Happiness to rely on!!

If you‚Äôre gonna take a risk on a relationship or just have a mean-spirited ex-significant other dump you, then make sure you‚Äôre gonna have friends, family, and a money-making outlet that will keep you from finding the nearest 4+ story roof-top access door.

If you‚Äôre gonna quit or massively shake up your career, then make sure you got a loving partner on hand, as well as some friends and family you can depend on!

If you don‚Äôt have much family and you‚Äôre planning to cut off your friends because of some bullshit political disagreement or other totally dumbass reason, then at least make sure you got that loving partner and an enjoyable career to dive into!!

Become the Master of the Three Pillars of Happiness.

Find a Glass Half Full perspective on life, shore up your intimate relationships, family, friends and career and become the master of your own domain, mother fucker. That or just resign yourself to the fact that Life‚Äôs a bitch and then you die, cause that‚Äôs a fact.",25Jan2020,1
87,A friendly reminder to love those with you now. Tell them and show them however you know. I say this as my girlfriend leaves to her own country and we don't know if or when we'll see each other again. Be bold and love strong.,25Jan2020,1
88,"I told myself this year that I would put more of an effort into external activities (things outside work, home and uni). 

I am one of those people who have no trouble ‚Äúfaking‚Äù confidence, but deep down my anxiety is almost crippling. And when I come home sometimes after putting on said facade, all I want to do is cry.

Last year was my worst year, I was in a car accident and refused to travel anywhere (more than 10 minutes away from home) in a car for about 6 months. 

This year I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt let my anxiety stop me. I‚Äôve joined a basketball team and started doing dance classes weekly.

But it‚Äôs still January and the thought of being locked into something gives me major bad vibes. 

I DO want to get out more, but on days where I just want to stay home with my fianc√©, I feel pressured into these extra curricular events because I literally signed up for them. I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúflake‚Äù, but I seriously want to bail.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.",25Jan2020,1

90,"My (23F) boyfriend (24M) told me he loves me for the first time ever last night. 

This is a pretty big deal for him since we've been together for a year, and we've talked about it and he didn't want to say it unless he really 100% meant it and could see a future with me, which I understood. I've known I love him for a while and had told him once last year but he didn't say it back.

Last night we were lying in bed cuddling and talking about anything and everything when he just suddenly says it. I wasn't expecting it at all and it made me so happy. Somehow I managed to say it back and then we just held each other for a long time. Lying in his arms I felt so content and loved and happy.

I've had a few relationships but this is the first one where I have actually been in love. Why did no one tell me that being loved by the person you love would feel this good!?",25Jan2020,1

93,"So I work at a billing call center for a telecommunications company in the US that also owns several news outlets across the country. At the beginning of the week I got a very frantic caller asking for a phone number to a local news station (not sure why he would call the company directly but he was an older gentleman man who admittedly doesn't use the internet) because he ""had some breaking news"". He then told me to gather enough nonperishable food and prepare for the worst. Apparently he was a former military official who had been called and warned that the coronavirus spreading in China has the potential to kill millions of people in the US. Naturally I brushed it off as a crazy old man crying wolf but after some of the news stories breaking these past few days about the number of people infected by this in several Chinese cities and now across the world I'm starting to wonder if I was actually being warned of imminent dager...",25Jan2020,1
