1,"Strength. You may think you have an idea of what that means, I want to share what i think strength means. I've seen it alot of examples of strength through my life, and consistently through my rather short life, thus far, I've never really saw any particular strengths in my self. Sure I may have been skillful and resourceful at times, but there were always people who could do what I did and better around, and alot of my struggles in life stem from that, I constant created issues and obstacles,in my life cause I rarely felt confident in my actions, I was a bumbling fool who faked confidence. But through my struggles with depression and anxiety, when i felt nothing but weak and strengthless, i learned to see a  type of strength growing in myself. If your struggling with anything in life right now, no little how big or small that struggle is, and if you can turn to face that stuggle and deal with it, cope with the burden and outfall it causes all the way to the end, that is a strength, if you can face all your struggles, and accept the turnouts, no matter what people tell, know that you are strong, cause you can take what life dishes out. As long as we persevere, we can survive anything.",11Jul2020,1
2,"A year ago, I thought I was constipated, because I was hardly passing any stool.  I went to the clinic.  They gave me laxatives, which kind of worked for a bit, but then I was stopped up again.  They had me change my diet up to try to get things regular.

A couple of weeks later, I had a stomach pain so bad that I left work to go to the clinic - but on the way realized that I just needed to go to the ER, which I did.

After some scans, the ER found a mass on my colon wall, and admitted me.  After a few days on a liquid diet, they gave me a colonoscopy.  The doctor that did it said that they couldn't complete the colonoscopy, because they couldn't get the scope past a tumor that was blocking my entire colon (and thus causing what I had thought was constipation).

Because the tumor was blocking my colon, they couldn't discharge me until my digestive system was functional again, so they performed a partial colectomy - they took out about 8"" of my colon - and routed my intestines to a bag that collected my poop.  

The tumor itself was a Stage 4 tumor.  The colon cancer was Stage 3.  It had started out on my colon wall and grew in one direction through the colon.  Growing in the other direction, it had left my colon wall, but had not yet penetrated the stomach lining.  During the surgery, they also removed a bunch of lymphnodes to test, and the cancer was found there as well.  Once cancer gets to the lymphnodes, that is frequently the method it takes to travel rapidly to other parts of the body.

Four weeks after the surgery, I was recovered enough to start IV chemotherapy, which lasted from October through April.  During that time, I was hospitalized several times for low oxygen counts.  I was also diagnosed at different times during chemo with sepsis and pneumonia.  

My wife was 27 when I was diagnosed.  We have a 1 yr old daughter.  Over the past month, two of my close childhood friends passed away - one from cancer.  The other, I'm not sure what the cause was, we had fallen out of touch.

Chemotherapy ended for me at the end of April.  At the end of May, I underwent another surgery to have the ostomy bag (the poop bag) removed, and my colon reattached.

This week was my first week ""back"" at work.  I work at a video game studio, and we are all working remotely right now, so ""going back to work"" really just meant that I was logging onto my computer for a different reason, and that I had to start thinking about work things again.

I feel 100% lucky to be alive right now.  I will get scanned again in August to make sure there are no new tumors forming anywhere (cross everything).  I feel lucky to have a supportive wife, a supportive employer and a great team of doctors.  I'm in the US, so I'm not happy about the insurance system (nobody is here).  

Work was exhausting this week.  I only worked mornings, but I had to take a 3-4 hour nap afterward each day, and still slept 8-10 hours at night!  

But it's a good kind of exhaustion.  It's not from chemo, it's not from surgery and it's not from medication.  It's from being alive and from being productive and from healing and from improving.

There's no better feeling in the world - thanks for reading!",11Jul2020,1

I hear all the time about people having annoying young siblings, but growing up I had an annoying older one.

My sister is 13 years older than me, and she was an adult by the time I was 5. Therefore she often played a part in raising me.

The countless times that she would intentionally bully me just to get a rise out of me and then claim that I was the annoying little brother when I reacted...

She acted cool whenever she talked to her friends and treated me like I was a nuisance.

Then when it was just her, I couldnt get her to stop messing with me.

These days, I dont even talk to her anymore. She never matured past it.

It's something that I dont have the energy to deal with anymore.

9,"I need to gush, and also let my fellow flat footers know it’s possible. I (27F) had flat feet ever since I can remember and it affected so many aspects of my life. I had/have flexible flat feet meaning they had arches when there was no weight on them, so they would sort of splay out when I walked. This made it impossible to find shoes that fit and didn’t cause blisters. My toes would squish into the shoe box and by the time I was 23 my toes were crooked and folding into each other. I was duck footed and my feet and knees would kill me if I stood or walked for too long and I had no balance. Orthopaedic inserts “helped” but not very much.

I got into lifting and this is when I really realized how messed up my feet, ankles, and legs were. I literally could not perform a squat without my heels raising and my knees and hips hurting. I did some research and low and behold, my flat feet were the problem. My Achilles’ tendons were so tight they were incapable of doing a proper squat motion. My body was over compensating causing my knees to turn inward which affected my hips and I was basically grinding in to the cartilage.

Flat feet runs in my family, and so do hip and knee replacements. I put the pieces together that that would be in my future if I didn’t do anything. 

I found a [website](fixflatfeet.com) which was made by a physiotherapist who also had flexible flat feet and was able to fix them. If you have “fixed” flat feet unfortunately your only option is surgery because it’s a bone issues. There are a ton of exercises to strengthen the muscles in your arches as well as calf stretches that he successfully used. I started doing the exercises, not even all the time, maybe just a few times a week but the main part that stuck with me is he said to just hold your arches up all the time and be constantly aware of it, and eventually it will be automatic. That’s a lot harder than one would assume, it’s like holding your arm above your head for extended periods. The muscles aren’t used to it so they get tired and extremely sore. I almost stopped because the outside of my calves really started to hurt and I was getting weird pains in my feet and I though I was causing myself harm. But, if a physiotherapist did this to himself, there had to be something to it. I did a google search and the muscles in my calves that were killing me are attached to the tendons that hold your arches, they hurt because I’ve never used those muscles properly.

After the pain subsided and my muscles and tendons started to act as they are supposed to (still consciously holding the arches up), my shoes stopped fitting. They were so big. So. So big, and broken in wrong. I had to throw out all of my shoes. One of the recommendations for fixing flat feet is to get zero drop shoes, so absolutely flat, no heel shoes. A heel creates a false arch so if you’re trying to fix them it’s counter productive. In December I went into the shoe store and left with a pair of size 8.5 vans, I was wearing size 10 before. I thought they would be way too small, but because they were shorter, it actually helped me remember to hold my arches up.

My knees stopped hurting, my hips stopped hurting. I was able to do well formed, deep squats! Squats actually helped too because I had to consciously hold the arches and drive my heels down while having extra weight on me. My toes are straightening out now because they sit properly within the shoe box.

I just left the store with a pair of size 8 vans today. My feet have gone down by two full shoe sizes. Holding my arches up still isn’t 100% automatic and I’ve been doing it for 8 months or so now, but I don’t think about it as much as I used to. My feet point forward, I have balance and I can walk/stand for extended periods without any pain. 

My uncle who has flat feet was just scheduled for a knee and hip replacement. I now know this won’t be in my cards. I made the conscious effort to fix something many people don’t know is fixable and I am just so happy and needed to share it with the world!

TL;DR - it’s 100% possible to fix flexible (not fixed) flat feet without surgery if you make the conscious effort to do exercises and stretches and not give up! It could save you from a lifetime of pain and inevitable knee and hip replacements.",11Jul2020,1

I'm 35, I've been alive through half of the Reagan administration, none of which I remember, the first Bush years, the Clinton scandals, the Bush wars, the Obama reforms, and the Trumpster fire that is our current administration.  I've been paying attention for a little while, and I can say this with utter conviction: I do not trust Republican politicians.  I do not trust them to be honest either with others or in the privacy of their own minds, I do not trust them to heed evidence, I do not trust them to do what is in the best interests of their constituents, I do not trust them to do what is in the best interests of our nation as a whole, in most regards they are incompetent, but in many regards they are *malicious.*  I do not trust these people.

I've watched [Republicans pass trap laws that shut down abortion clinics, and instate medically unnecessary regulations for things like forced transvaginal ultrasounds, requiring physicians to read dishonest information sheets to their patients, forcing days long waiting periods for a medical procedure, and prioritize funding for religious anti-abortion ""clinics.""](https://www.aclu.org/news/reproductive-freedom/trap-laws-are-the-threat-to-abortion-rights-you-dont-know-about/)  
  
And I watched when the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a fairly milquetoast bill, result in a massive electoral defeat for the Democratic party, a [""shellacking"" to borrow President Obama's term](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131046118), and the biggest Congressional red wave in many of our lifetimes.  What was the price paid by Republicans for opposing the ACA, the biggest expansion of health care since the creation of Medicaid?  None, instead they won the House, then the Senate, and eventually the White House.      
  
People talk about Medicare for All like it's a panacea, but M4A *depends* on good faith actors making evidence based decisions that are in the best interest of not just some, but *all,* of their constituents, and I don't trust Republicans to make those decisions.  What happens to M4A when the next Donald Trump rolls around and decrees that vaccines are too risky to federally subsidize, what happens when Louis Gohmert Jr. decides that women on food stamps shouldn't have their birth control covered, or a Steve King type concludes that the only gender related medical expenses covered by M4A should be conversion therapy, or future Mitch McConnell chooses to cut taxes, blow a hole in the debt and deficit, then gut M4A to close the budget gap?  Are these really the people we want making 100% of the health insurance choices for 100% of our citizens?  This sounds radical to us, but it sounds *reasonable to them.*  I know Republicans, some guy is going to get a recreational colonoscopy and ruin things for the rest of us, just like the story of the woman who ""bought lobster with her food stamps"" and Republicans use that to this day to justify [cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/politics/trump-food-stamp-cuts.html)  

We'd *hope* that these politicians would pay an electoral price for their bad behavior, for taking away American citizen's access to health care, but at the same time we're talking about an electorate that cheers things like ""BAN NARCAN,"" an electorate that throws tantrums about wearing a mask at Walmart, an electorate that thinks nothing of children in cages at our border, an electorate that voted for Donald Trump just to ""stick it to the libs.""  What sort of price would Republicans pay for interfering with Medicare for All?  Well, if the Affordable Care Act is anything to go by, then little to none.  
  
M4A depends on Democrats staying in power for the foreseeable future, and that's just not the country that I know, our political pendulum swings faster than other's, we're a people who vote for mixed government no matter how many times it doesn't work.  I just don't like the idea of Donald Trump choosing whether or not I should get a lung transplant or a bottle of complimentary Trump brand bleach.  
  
We always like to think about the things that our side supports in the context of ""best case scenarios,"" but let's also consider the *worst case scenario* for a moment.

39,"John knew the precise moment in which his youth came to an end.  It was the evening of his 20th birthday, and he and Sarah planned to spend the entire night watching a marathon of death match highlights.  As was their usual arrangement, Sarah told her mother that she would spend the night with another friend, a girl, and then joined john in the basement of his parents' home after they had gone to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes Sarah suggested that they spend the night in her apartment when her parents were out of town, or that they get a rented room together.  John did not see the point in that.  They had a working system, a complicit friend to lie on sarah's behalf if parents did call to verify her story, and plenty of room for Sarah to hide if his parents decided to visit the basement.  Still, after some time had passed Sarah would bring it up again as if they had not reached consensus the last time the issue was discussed.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly before she was due to arrive, john heard it begin to rain outside.  He thought about going upstairs to get a towel to give Sarah when she arrived, but recalled the hand towels under the basements bathroom sink and grabbed some of them instead.  Then he settled on the couch and passively listened to the talking heads which were on before the highlights marathon began.

&amp;#x200B;

She and her bike were soaked by rain when she knocked on the door.  John realized the mud on her shoes and bike tires would mark the carpet, which he would have to explain to his parents, so he asked her to wait outside for him to run upstairs to get a towel big enough to put down on the floor over the carpet.

&amp;#x200B;

The sound of the rain held his attention as Sarah told him about a podcast she had listened to on the ride over.  It was about Dr. Seattle.  John did not need to pay much attention because Sarah had already told him enough about Dr. Seattle that he could always invent a question which appeared to be the product of attentive listening.

&amp;#x200B;

Like most people, Sarah was prone to gawk at the concept of Dr. Seattle.  Though john could reason out on paper that Dr. Seattle's existence, a man become god, was cause for awe and existential terror, he was inclined to swallow the idea whole.  It was not because John had any particularly strong opinions on the matter, but instead because he had a comfortable contempt for fascination with things with which he had yet to acquaint himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually, john probably had just as many nights as anyone else in which he was comforted by the knowledge that Dr. Seattle was flying above him through the skies, protecting humanity from threats natural and self inflicted.  More than once he appreciated to himself that the man who became god was like him, at least in some important ways.  Dr. Seattle spoke English, was American, and though Dr. Seattle's politics differed from his, he had no fears of unaccountable persecution as some people in the world did.

&amp;#x200B;

One fact he had learned from Sarah concerned him above all others: the heritability of Dr. Seattle's power.  Though he could conjure matter and energy from nothing, fly, read minds, and who knows what else, he was still mortal somehow.  He gained his powers when the previous wielder died, and when he died himself but powers would move into some other random living thing.  This other living thing would most likely be human but not necessarily, for reasons Dr. Seattle struggled to explain.

&amp;#x200B;

While the powers would most likely be lost, and the wielder would never notice, john was hyper aware of the possibility, however faint, that the powers would find themselves in the hands of someone whose interests mutually excluded his own.  This fear took different shapes.  Sometimes in his mind he saw Middle Eastern theocrats, other times capitalists, but those fears were matter of fact.  The idea that bothered him most was certainly not the worst.  It was that the power would fall into the hands of someone he simply found strange, such as women who shaved parts of their head or men with fewer friends who held his own opinions but with more fervor that he could endorse.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah noticed the conspicuous absence of snacks.  "" snacks are conspicuously absent,"" she said, "" how will we watch a marathon without snacks?""

&amp;#x200B;

John's parents had just recently purchased more packs of ramen, the beef and shrimp combo flavor which Sarah inexplicably preferred.  But he knew all of the ramen bowls were dirty and he did not want to clean any.  "" we have some peanut butter bars.""

&amp;#x200B;

Armed with a family size box of peanut butter bars john and Sarah settled into the couch to enjoy a night full of death match highlights.  Both of them had spent the prior night reviewing past players, some of whom would be offering commentary during the marathon.  Due to the nature of the sport, where the loser usually died, few professionals were available for such a thing.  Providing commentary were the current champion, Texas, and some contestants who passed qualifiers for the national tournament but abandoned at some point during the bracket instead of dying in the ring.

&amp;#x200B;

But just when the marathon would have begun, a different broadcast appeared on the screen.  There were a graphic images of a man's chest torn apart by a quartz like crystal which looked like it exploded from his heart.  The lower third title read ""Dr. Seattle is dead.""

&amp;#x200B;

John felt walls crashing down around him.  He had never noticed these walls before, but as they fell he realized what they had kept at bay.  Like a child whose parents died too young, he now realized the world itself was not warm and safe but rather there was something between himself and the world which was warm and safe, and it was now gone.  The cold could reach him now. The danger could reach him now.

&amp;#x200B;

In the days that followed john had little interest in the mourning activities.  Sarah invited him to the march and even found some black clothes of her brother's that he could borrow.  These things could wait in john's opinion.  What mattered now above all else was ensuring the safety and continuity of their way of life, which could only be achieved by finding the inheritor of Dr. Seattle's power and securing their sympathy for American interests.  Dr. Seattle had written very little about how the inheritor might be identified, but after john had exhausted this reading material he continued to read the speculations of journalists, and after these were exhausted the continued to read the speculations of really anyone on any forum.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point the inheritor would notice that the laws of nature deferred to his will.  Dr. Seattle had offered no more specificity than this, except to say that impositions of will on nature vary in complexity.  It was not enough.    After days of compulsive reading and very little gained, it finally occurred to john to wonder how Dr. Seattle died in the first place.  What could possibly have killed a god?

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah and the officials who worked with Dr. Seattle told the same story: that Dr. Seattle tried to create a new source of energy, and died in the attempt.  They always held the details close to their hearts, because they were afraid of what they might imply, though they always excused their sparse description by saying the mechanisms were very complicated.  These mechanisms were available in their papers of course, but they wrote their papers in an impenetrable dialect intentionally designed to say nothing to the uninitiated.  This narrative did not satisfy john, or any of the new friends he made online while discussing the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

It seemed far more likely that an anti American actor, perhaps an enemy nation state, had sabotaged the efforts.  John knew his country well – he had spent his entire life in it.  He could not be so easily persuaded that the most competent and powerful government on earth had simply killed their own god by accident.  

&amp;#x200B;

In his god's untimely death john found the mortal fear which marks the beginning of the end of youth.  No longer invincible, he spent the penultimate years of his youth wary and suspicious.  

\---

With a referral given to him by sarah's father, john had found a position as a technician assistant at a disease research lab in the city.  People understood the kind of position that it was, and few of them made a generous assumption he hoped they would make, that the position was somehow complex, required education, or at least not utterly replaceable.  So when at parties as he was now, and he was asked what he did as he had just been by a woman named Jane, he said that he was a student of the city's prestigious university.

&amp;#x200B;

Because the research lab had a deal with the university, technicians were permitted to take one class per semester there, so john had not necessarily lied.  Should reality follow as unlikely a course as Jane taking an interest in him, he could easily dismiss such a small fib with a short soliloquy expressing resentment of america's work focused culture.  John refused to be defined by his job until he found a job which would define him suitably.

Between her accent and the consistency with which she wore an accessory covered in stars and stripes, such as on her scarf now or the lapel pin he had seen her wear at another of sarah's parties, john was sure that she had grown up in the East Asian Territories.  He was not eager to betray how modest a position he, a homelander, had earned, knowing already through gossip that Jane was a vice president of – it didn't really matter what—at a company he learned the name of in middle school.  He preferred to talk about literally anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

"" what do you think of the homeland?""

&amp;#x200B;

"" you think I'm not from the homeland?""

&amp;#x200B;

"" that's not what I said.""

&amp;#x200B;

"" well if you want my opinion on the homeland clearly you think I have some frame of reference.  Which territory do you think I'm from?  Korea?  Shanghai?""

&amp;#x200B;

"" I don't know.""

&amp;#x200B;

She was from Tonkin.  After a few shared drinks Jane told him at length about how she became fascinated with the intricacies of supply lines.  Her father got one of the confiscated Japanese machines at auction, and she would spend hours on hours of her free time just reading e-mail between departments of international retail companies.  After a few years they got smart and the public could no longer find them by simple URL, but she had already downloaded so many that she never ran out of reading material.

&amp;#x200B;

Jane resolved that she must be involved in the shipping industry, but by the time she graduated from university, president Diem had cut the funding for the wire project to Tonkin.  There were no network connections, and Jane had no access to what few phone lines were available.  So after securing a tourist visa to the homeland, she visited the office of every person whose name she read in her archive of shipping emails.  Finally one of them gave her a moment to talk and, impressed with her deep knowledge of shipping history and logistics, offered her a job and the accompanying work visa.

&amp;#x200B;

"" that's a very impressive story.""

&amp;#x200B;

"" do you want to know the human part?""

&amp;#x200B;

"" the human part?""

&amp;#x200B;

"" I'll stop bragging, and tell you the real story, but you have to be honest with me about what you do.""

&amp;#x200B;

"" I told you I was a student.""

&amp;#x200B;

"" is that so?  You take how many classes per semester?""

&amp;#x200B;

John shuddered at the specificity of her challenge.  Maybe she had heard from Sarah or another mutual friend.  He had assumed that he was not worth mentioning, that he was safely exempt from gossip as a privilege of being unsuccessful but also not overtly a failure.  Yet she asked this question as if she knew that the answer was one.  One class per semester did not make much of a student.

&amp;#x200B;

"" Tell me the real story,"" he said.

&amp;#x200B;

"" OK john here's the truth: I don't care that much about shipping logistics.  I know that may surprise you, because they deeply interest most people, but I am immune to their seductive power.

&amp;#x200B;

"" No, the real reason I read those shipping logs was just because I was bored and there's not much to do in Tonkin.  I just read shipping logs and spent time with my boy.  He was a cute boy and I loved him a lot, as much as a teenage girl can love.

&amp;#x200B;

"" but during university the boy gets proud.  All of Tonkin is watching Texas Nhanh conquer death match, and it puts ideas and many boy's heads, including my own boy.  If Texas can leave Tonkin and dominate the homeland, maybe he could too.  He starts getting these visions of his fabulous career and fame and riches in the homeland.  He told his friends about this, even some of our mutual friends, but never mentioned his intent to leave me behind directly to me.

&amp;#x200B;

"" one night I walk over to his dorm room unannounced, and I end up crashing his celebration.  He had secured a work visa to the homeland.  He even had the nerve to invite some of our mutual friends which were more mine than his.  So here I am, speechless, looking around the room at my own friends celebrating my partner's plan to abandon me an entire ocean away.""

&amp;#x200B;

"" so you came here to get him back?""

&amp;#x200B;

"" what?  Do I look like a little bitch to you?  No.  It just gave me an idea.  I had never considered going to the homeland before, leaving my family and friends behind for some money or a title or whatever.  But I had all this hurt, and I knew exactly who's suffering would make me feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

"" you see, I knew that he loved me.  I knew that it hurt him to leave me behind.  That left only one conclusion: he simply didn't believe that I would be capable of coming to the homeland with him.  I came here to show him that his betrayal was pointless, that his pain was self inflicted, and I suppose to prove that to myself as well.  Shipping logistics was just my in.  I would know that I had succeeded once he asked for me back and I said no and watched him cry.""

&amp;#x200B;

"" did that happen?""

&amp;#x200B;

"" No.  He met a woman in New York City and persuaded her to move back with him to Tonkin.  On their homeland savings they live like royalty, and our friends envy him.""

&amp;#x200B;

John nodded and, not knowing what to say, took a swig from his cup at a high angle to get the last few drops of the drink he finished 20 minutes ago.

&amp;#x200B;

"" you have to tell me what you do now, john.""

&amp;#x200B;

"" I'm a technician assistant.  I do secretarial work basically.  I take care of rat colonies that researchers use.""

&amp;#x200B;

"" you have to start somewhere, john.""

&amp;#x200B;

Her reassurance did not reassure him.    He was already acutely aware of the vast distance in time and chance between himself and his pride.  An indignant anger, that of a child when told something he already knew, quickened his heart.  Phantom needles made tingling sensations in his hands and face, and his tongue became loose.  What had been the point of this conversation?

&amp;#x200B;

\----

&amp;#x200B;

John wandered off to find Sarah and found her on the porch. A few guests gathered around her to hear her story in which she and her close friend from her freshman year of university, Hussein, climbed to the top of the dormitory building and smoked weed while looking at the night sky and cityscape. It was one of John's least favorite stories because he was not in it and while Sarah left him to experience adventure in the city after high school, John stayed behind and studied at a community college with mostly parents and other high school barely graduates who were pretending to themselves that they would transfer to University after two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Hussein himself wobbled unsteadily beside Sarah, deep in who knows how many drinks. Where John might've looked that way after four or five, anyone could tell that Hussein was deeper than that by his uniform: khaki shorts, a colored blue shirt with three buttons at the top, boat shoes with low ankle socks. John could not understand why Sarah tolerated, let alone felt fond of the fraternal culture of alcoholism from which this man was plucked straight off the assembly line. Years ago he hoped it was just the rush of something new, that she would grow out of it, but now it seemed that she was no longer just its victim but its advocate.

&amp;#x200B;

When John greeted Sarah she curtly said ""hello John"", and continued on with her story. It occurred less to John that he had interrupted her than it did that she had slighted him. To her audience he may as well have been an acquaintance greeting the party's host. In their faces as he assessed them he saw contempt. He saw how they saw an old friend left behind, clinging on even when self-respect lay in the past. They saw poison, an unlabeled bottle of oxycodone they wished they could throw away to protect their friend, an abusive boyfriend banging on the door that they could only pray their friend would leave once and for all. Sarah as she was now was what they wanted and he was only pollution.

&amp;#x200B;

Consumed in these thoughts, John was caught off guard when Hussein fell into him. The smell, a composition of the sweats of large men and the colognes of insecure men, was not at all unpleasant to him and that made him hate it. And following the smell came the mass. Reflexively he pushed.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah was yelling at him. She knelt beside Hussein on the ground, and her hands had turned red from the blood coming out of his scalp. He had not caught himself after the push and fell into the brick wall of the front of the house.

&amp;#x200B;

There was no longer any subtlety in the faces of her new friends. John looked around for something though he couldn't say what, and found only suspicious looks or curiosity from afar about the commotion. He saw Jane walk out of the house. She looked down at Sarah and then up at John.

&amp;#x200B;

Only a few conclusions would be available to Jane after she heard an explanation. Jane was sincere, he knew very little about her but he did know that she did not posture. If she were to judge him it would not be a matter of class or territory. Her judgment would be his own judgment.

&amp;#x200B;

He must escape. There were no allies here.

&amp;#x200B;

Hussein was not responding. Sarah was still yelling.

&amp;#x200B;

People learn to walk in their first year. If he didn't drink so much he might still have been bipedal. How much alcohol does it take to regress past the first year? And yet John was on trial.

&amp;#x200B;

""This man is an alcoholic and he needs help,"" John said assertively.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah stopped yelling and looked at him silently. He could tell she was struggling to communicate her hatred with the limited capacity of only a human face.

&amp;#x200B;

From another of her friends, though he didn't recognize who, he heard ""what the fuck is that guy on about?""

&amp;#x200B;

And so John was angry.

&amp;#x200B;

And then John was somewhere else, at the other end of a gap in the continuity of his consciousness. He was at home and in bed. He was wearing the same close he was at the party, and had to take a piss.

&amp;#x200B;

He took some deep breaths and tried in futility to remember how he had gotten home that night. When he came up empty of any memory, he realized the shame of what he did remember in the further shame of asking about what he didn't was simply more bother than it would be worth. Just like the result of arithmetic, impersonal and matter-of-fact, he decided his friendship with Sarah had come to an end.

&amp;#x200B;

Depression via break ups... It's certainly a familiar place, but a place that I forget exists only until I'm back in it. When it does eventually pass, I find that life is pretty okay. I do well. I make people happy. People make me happy. I enjoy the little things and smell the flowers. But then, every few years or so, I'll meet someone spectacular. We'll talk and become quickly intimate and fill our time with lots of laughter and surprises. The mystery of what could be is all too alluring. The pushing and pulling of both of us each making valiant efforts to see eachother more and more. Soon she's staying over consecutive nights and tell me things that she hardly tells anyone. The continuous exchange of texts and internet gold we share between us is endering and lighthearted. The stories we tell about our pasts are riveting and emotional. And the sex... absolutely divine. Eventually, I am introduced as her partner, and it the most euphoric thing. Eventually, they say ""I love you"". And then... I finally realize that I am totally free to be fully vulnerable. To put all the care and passion into a relationship that I would want back. After about a month or so. It's all over. They leave. They feel awful. They cry. They move on. And I'm left shattered. Thinking that I always am going to have to hold back how much want to care. 

You see... when I love, I love hard. I'm able to maintain my own self respect while also taking pride in my capacity to put the other person first when they're in need. To put it simply, I treat the person I'm dating how I wish to be treated. 

Isn't that the key? You take a problem, find a solution and work through hard times. For me, giving up on someone is the last option. Of course, that explains that out of my several romantic relationships, I have always been the one who receives the ""Hey can I come so we can talk?"" text.

Now I'm back in the place where I wake up, and am reminded of reality that I was left again. That this person is gone. And it's so hard to get out of bed and feel good. Each breakup is tougher then the last. I wonder when itll all just be too much.",11Jul2020,1

45,"I especially loved the scene where 5 lucky people get involved to test out Plonker's new collagen extraction machines. I remember how gory that one scene was where the fat guy falls into a river full of collagen-extracting mechanical piranhas! Freaked me out as a tot! Plonker was such a sadist when he just stood there and laughed about how he was going to have ''*lots of fucking collagen tonight!*''. 

Then there was one with that weird gum chewing woman, I remember she tried one of those collagen gummies and she ended up inflating to levels beyond what the human body could withstand - bursting with collagen that went in everyone's faces.

But it was heartwarming in the end when Willy Plonker got to become a human by extracting their collagen (four of them ended up as deflated husks of themselves due to the lacking of collagen tissue - this was visible towards the end of the movie where Plonker has the bodies folded on a line) and Charlie in return got turned into a mutant and he then had to suffer joint dislocations and joint pain for the rest of his stupid life, and the only job he could get was as a shapeshifter at a local circus.

I really want to experience it, especially with someone I love so much. I want to know what's so good or bad about it. I want to know if I end up liking it or hating it.

My mindset is still the same and my body still freaks out. I dont have the privacy atm to try some type of sex toy, so I'll have to wait for that.

I get so frustrated and upset that it's so easy for EVERYone else except me. I feel messed up. Like something's wrong with me. My body freezes up, I panic, and try to stop the situation from continuing.

Just to be clear, I dont want to do it because everyone else does it, I want to do it because I want to experience it for myself. No one is pressuring me. I'd like to experience it for my own benefit.

I'm only 20 myself but I've ALWAYS been like this. I'm not saying there's nothing from this day and age I enjoy, I do, but it always feels like trying to find a needle in a haystack when I'm looking for good new music or TV or movies, and god today's fashion and home trends are awful.

I did it to be with her son, who I see as my own. And to give in to my depression I come to understand. My family never forgave me. I lost several of my closest people with that decision. My partner and I stayed rocky, despite my return. I cheated on her a year later. Something I never thought I’d do. It was disgusting of me. Especially because I was too cowardly to leave her. All this increased my depression.

My partner got pregnant out of the blue. We thought we couldn’t have children. Our beautiful daughter was born a year ago.

After daughter’s birth we moved into a house. It was nice between us for a couple months. Before slowly getting sour again. She yelled and threw things, and I drank and avoided her. Communication was non existent after a while. We became roommates who fucked each other. Sex being the only thing in common between us.

My partner’s friend Susan came into our lives at the start of COVID-19. After several visits my partner asked if we could sex with her. However intriguing the idea was, I said no. She pushed and pushed, while promising it wouldn’t hurt our relationship, so I eventually said yes. My partner quickly fell in love with Susan. She told me she wanted to leave me. Week later she took it back. Week after that she wanted out again. This happened three times. I finally said no take backs and moved out. That’s when my relationship of 10 years ended. Four weeks ago. Susan and Sara now spend everyday together. 

I have no one. I lost my closest people by returning to my ex after she cheated on me. I still haven’t told them of our separation. I’m frankly embarrassed.

I weirdly chose this moment to inform my job that I need a raise. They said returning to school is the only way I can receive a promotion. I am living alone, seeing my partner happy with someone else, getting fatter, in dead end job, without a close community of people, and then something happened to me. I said FUCK THIS! 

Fuck this life. Fuck this anxiety, and fuck my finances, and especially fuck my past relationship. I am making a change.

I started lifting weights a month ago. I got on testosterone  intravenously through my doctor. I started seeing a counselor. I put 6 grand into savings. And I refuse to give in to a shitty life. 

Scariest thing of all, I am returning to school for the 8th time and final time. I am Done being defeated, depressed and worthless. 

I intend to conquer instead of hide. I choose to thrive instead of languish. Today at this moment; I am happy. This is my confession. Thank you.",11Jul2020,1
79,"Okay, so here we go. Since I'm 13 yo I am an entrepreneur but I keep failing at it. It's a very very painful journey and I don't know how to continue in life...

Summary:

\- Upper-class background  
\- Super dominant father, soft mother (masseuse), divorced when i was 3  
\- Grew up with mom until age 13 then forced to move to dad to ""become someone""  
\- Founded company with 14 and got screwed over once and sexually harassed by biz partner  
\- Developed anxiety disorder and depression and cannabis habit  
\- Kept working, fighting and smoking  
\- Started university (economics b.s., 40% done) dropped out to start another company  
\- Burned out 1st  
\- Continued working, because I was looking for success and the feeling of independence I felt with the first company

\- Was flying very high in Stanford with top-notch researchers and investors  
\- Got screwed over again  
\- took LSD (last November) and had a horror trip with panic attacks, stopped smoking weed afterward  
\- realized I'm reliving my past traumas + I have serious mental health problems  
\- put myself into a psychiatric ward 2 months ago, did 2 months of therapy, feeling better but know healing will take a few year min.

Question: how do I deal with my high self standards? I still want to have the feeling of my first company, meaning want to earn money and be independent. Should i finish my uni first? any other thoughts on my life so far. The pressure is still on... 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time magic internet people. I appreciate it.

Longer story:

I'm aware that I'm a very privileged white guy but my feelings and needs are the same as anyone else's so I'd appreciate it if you can listen to me anyway. I'm coming from an upper-class family, living in Germany. My dad is the CEO of a 300 people tech company. My mom is... let's say very loving and hypersensitive and also pretty anxious and a bit depressed she's been working as a masseuse most of the time. My mom got so anxious (she feared my father) after my birth that she decided to get divorced to ""save her own dignity"" when I was 3 y.o. .

My first experience as an entrepreneur was with 14 by founding a website to sell silicone wristbands with a friend of my mom. The idea grew into a small business, we sold wristbands every day and made a few thousand € every month revenues. I felt like the king back then tbh. This project provided me with a feeling of independence from school (where I got mobbed at first as ginger) and my dictator like father at home. 

  
One day my partner sent me an email after he kind of sexually harassed me a couple of times and basically kicked me out of the company. I sued him with 16 (my dad supported me) and got away with $30k and a cannabis habit which I know now was a way to deal with the pain.

My dad decided that I'd be better off growing up with him so he decided against my will and my mom's will that I had to grow up with him from age 14 or so onwards. After some though years of brutal discipline, though by my dominant father I managed to become good in school and became part of the school's representative team.

During the last year of high school, ripped away from my mother's love, at age 17 I developed a chronic derealisation. This feels like hell. It's a natural defense mechanism that stops yourself from *feeling.*  My psychologist said it's the mechanism that kicks in to protect yourself from the pain that otherwise would have killed you (me). 

Then after my highschool degree, I went off to San Francisco to travel and work and basically blast the money I had earned earlier over the course of 2 years. I smoked a lot of weed and was young wild and free learning to code and work on some apps and volunteering projects pretending to be on to the next billion-dollar idea.

Then cannabis got legalized and I started a cannabis home growing hardware company in Germany. We were semi-successful. Hardware is hard and raising funds became difficult. Also, did I become high on my own supply which made life adventures and fun but probably I was living in an illusion of being on the right track. I burned out with 23. I was so stubborn to become successful that I went on founding a new project in Stanford, ca.

I got to know a Stanford director of biology and started another company with. He screwed me over $150k  and threw me under the bus of investors. I took LSD and had a mental meltdown realizing I'm reliving traumas from the past and ended in a psychiatric ward where I now did a 6-week therapy.

During my second company, I started studying economics in berlin (got about 40% done) and am wondering if I should continue with the studies, even though now after all these crazy experiences my standards are so high, I feel like a loser sitting in these classes in berlin and not in Stanford or some ivy league. Jesus this sounds rediculous but honestly reflects my feelings. I feel like a loser and just want to be successful and accepted and appreciated for my work. Any ideas on how to continue?",11Jul2020,1

Could there be a tomorrow? The one where I could breathe freely. Could there be hope? The hope of the light in me. Is there something serene, in the nightskies to fill me? But I'm alone to feel it all. Sometimes the pain of this loneliness gets too hard that I feel like I should join the Police force or the Army because I don't have anybody who loves me but atleast I can save lives of the ones who do for them to be happy. And sometimes I wonder what if I someday I become wealthy and give away all my wealth to those  people in the world who would need it the most for their regular expenditure which they are not able to afford and have a happy life for their kids out there. I wanna make my life useful if I don't find you and I don't wanna die without having a purpose in life for nothing. But I haven't given up on Finding you already.

I know wherever you are, you do exist, even when this world has turned upside down breaking apart on me with the evil monsters who wanna destroy me but it has still not managed to end and ruin me despite of cracking me apart but I'm healing because I believe in a tomorrow with you. Yeah the one I see when I close my eyes. Yeah the one I wanna stand with under the sky feeling the cold breeze and the scent of the air atmosphere touching me looking in the beautiful sky at night. The one I could tell everything. The one I could make laugh, smile looking at her smile. Lose myself in the beautiful feeling called love and be happy forever. The one I could go on beautiful adventures, vacations and dates with. The one I see as my hope, my love, my everything. The one I could come to in the end and call my family. 

Yeah, I know it's gonna take a while until I find you but I haven't given up on finding you. Until then, wherever you are my love, I want you to be strong even if you are down, and if you are happy I want you to be happy for a lifetime and know that someday I will find you. And when we will meet, it will be like the laws of nature have finally been in our stars. 

Until then, know that I will survive to find you and see you someday.

Two birds, brothers by blood,

One grows and one is crushed,

And while they may be brothers,

One will always break the other.

&amp;#x200B;

One grows to be an eagle

One grows to be a vulture

Depending on the choices made in life

One will always break the other

&amp;#x200B;

The eagle subdues the vulture,

And looks out for the people,

The world says he’s a hero, 

Because he stops at nothing for the ones he loves.

&amp;#x200B;

The vulture kills the eagle,

And only looks out for himself,

The world looks at him as a monster,

And he scales buildings, looking for his next victim.

&amp;#x200B;

Two birds, a battle of good and evil,

Through one person’s choices, one will rule over,

The eagle will rule the skies if he becomes a True Hero,

The vulture will roam the streets if he becomes Infamous.

- Rice
- Broccoli
- Green beans 
- Squash
- Tomatoes
- Mushrooms
- Zucchini
- Feta cheese
- Sourdough bread
- Avocado
- Greek yogurt

There are plenty more. Now I can’t even think of a single food - other than meat, since I am a vegetarian by choice - that I dislike enough to remove completely from my diet. There’s probably something, but everyone has something. 

Sometimes they confuse having food routines with being picky. I like repeating the same meals a lot. That doesn’t mean I’m picky though, it means I have some favorites that I put in rotation. If we go to a restaurant, I’ll be willing to try any vegetarian option on the menu. If someone cooks a random meal for me, chances are I’ll love it. That’s not picky.

I want nothing more than to be there but unfortunately in the wake of COVID-19 the government of Canada has advised against all unnecessary international travel—let alone travel to Florida.  As my father’s trial bears no impact on my livelihood it is therefor not necessary travel and, to engage in such travel, in the current social climate, would be detrimental not only to my health and safety but my reputation as well; as if a COVID outbreak did happen here in Nova Scotia as a result of my travel I would be looked at as a patient zero—if you will.  My appearance in the flesh in the court on the day of the trial is naught but a measurement of my value of my father’s freedom.

As to my father.  He made his decision.  He waited until July 3rd to ask me for help when he knows personally how much I am worth.  He has decided to go with a public defender for his defense and not employ my help in finding him a lawyer.  He shall learn the consequences of his actions.

Because here is the truth your honor.  My mother and I left Florida and moved to Canada in 2005.  My father knew where we were and knew that we were ready to sponsor him for immigration purposes so he could move here and be with us.

108,"Individualism often gets a bad reputation and it's not unjustified. It's often associated, rightfully so, with selfishness and a lack of caring for those around you. I think we can all agree that individualism is not the answer to everything. 

But to assume that individualism is always bad and therefore must be actively avoided is also going too far. There are some things that make individualism more powerful under various circumstances. Considering individuals according to their own value, beliefs, and actions allows arguably fairer judgement. In other words, instead of judging someone based on the group they are a part of, judging them based on their own choices, actions, and words (to be fair, that could also include someone's choice to be part of a group). A common circumstance we see in social affairs is when someone wrongs you or does something to harm you – would you necessarily assume that all other family members are therefore bad? Perhaps, but not always. What if it wasn't a family but rather an ethnic group or an intellectually-motivated group (like hobbyists)? 

The point here is that considering each individual based on their own behaviors, choices, and statements is fairer than judging someone based on the actions of someone who is ostensibly like them. Of course, there are times when being part of such a group may warrant such presumptuous judgement, but it should be used very sparingly. 

This is an often overlooked part of individualism but it's probably one of the most important. It's one of the basic concepts behind keeping an open mind towards other people.",11Jul2020,1

112,"Last year was not my year at all, and on a recent lsd trip I came to the realization that after getting played by 3 girls last year I have developed trust issues. It hit me really hard, especially when I applied to this to the times I asked two other girls out, and just flopped right after. I asked a girl out in January, she said yes, but then we slowly stopped talking right after that. Asked a girl out in March, she said yes, and I just slowly distant myself again. I now realize I acted that way because of my trust issues. 

I guess I never realized it before, but I really do have trust issues. I can’t trust anything someone says to me anymore(especially when it’s a compliment) and it fucking sucks. Having trust issues onto of anxiety just makes things so much worse. Because when I don’t trust something someone says i begin to think non stop and think about what the truth really is. It fucking sucks

I’m 16 and teens now a days love to say they have trust issues(not saying no one else has it) it’s just moving like a trend. People posting quotes about their trust issues, and all that just makes it all sound cringy. That is why I don’t tell anyone about this part of me, because they’ll think I’m just another teen with “trust issues”. Only one of my friends knows and he helped me realize the deeper route of the trust issues.

It sucks a lot, but I’m trying to work harder in making things better. I’ve stopped drinking to cope with my anxiety so that’s great, I smoke weed for my anxiety though and it helps a fuck ton.

I wish my brother had not abandoned me. I wish my friends had not turned my back on me when I needed them the most. I wish my parents had listened to me and not make me feel like an alien. I’m not accepted anywhere. I don’t feel a sense of lost anymore because I never feel belong anywhere anyway.

114,"Dear Future Wife,

Could there be a tomorrow? The one where I could breathe freely. Could there be hope? The hope of the light in me. Is there something serene, in the nightskies to fill me? But I'm alone to feel it all. Sometimes the pain of this loneliness gets too hard that I feel like I should join the Police force or the Army because I don't have anybody who loves me but atleast I can save lives of the ones who do for them to be happy. And sometimes I wonder what if I someday I become wealthy and give away all my wealth to those  people in the world who would need it the most for their regular expenditure which they are not able to afford and have a happy life for their kids out there. I wanna make my life useful if I don't find you and I don't wanna die without having a purpose in life for nothing. But I haven't given up on Finding you already.

I know wherever you are, you do exist, even when this world has turned upside down breaking apart on me with the evil monsters who wanna destroy me but it has still not managed to end and ruin me despite of cracking me apart but I'm healing because I believe in a tomorrow with you. Yeah the one I see when I close my eyes. Yeah the one I wanna stand with under the sky feeling the cold breeze and the scent of the air atmosphere touching me looking in the beautiful sky at night. The one I could tell everything. The one I could make laugh, smile looking at her smile. Lose myself in the beautiful feeling called love and be happy forever. The one I could go on beautiful adventures, vacations and dates with. The one I see as my hope, my love, my everything. The one I could come to in the end and call my family. 

Yeah, I know it's gonna take a while until I find you but I haven't given up on finding you. Until then, wherever you are my love, I want you to be strong even if you are down, and if you are happy I want you to be happy for a lifetime and know that someday I will find you. And when we will meet, it will be like the laws of nature have finally been in our stars. 

Until then, know that I will survive to find you and see you someday.


With love,
Faraz",11Jul2020,1

116,"So I've posted here about my girlfriend before and this is loosely related.

On Wednesday I drove out with my mom to a state park a few hours away (Starved Rock) and we hiked for a few hours and it was great. But in those few hours I had a very profound experience in how I want to handle my future.

Previously, my plan was to go to college and get a degree in cyber security or IT and become a pentester. Eventually open up my own auditing firm. This has been my plan for the past few years and I'm passionate about tech and cyber security, but in that moment hiking I felt such an overwhelming sense of self. I consider myself an atheist and [absurdist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism) and this just completely out me with that sense of awe in the moment. The drive for something great.

I realized that I've always said that I want to live my life to the fullest but I constantly catch myself saying, ""Oh no I could never do that"" and putting down thoughts and ideas. But if I'm going to live my life to the fullest I can't keep doing that. So what I've ultimately decided was that I'll continue to go onto college as planned, but during the summers I'm going to just explore the world. With some backpacking gear, an Ultrabook, and a camera, I'll take a one way plane ticket to somewhere random and just backpack and explore. Meet people and hear their stories and explore the world. I'll use my camera to show life through my eyes. If I end up enjoying this and do it every summer, and have a good portfolio, then I'll go full photojournalism and just leave after college to find out what the world has to offer. But at the very least that first summer I plan on getting on a plane and seeing where life takes me.

Obviously going from expecting a quiet office life to just exploring the world and taking risks (which I want to do, death is something I don't fear thanks to my beliefs) is quite a drastic change and I'm still adjusting and planning. I know that I need to at least try it, I can't keep telling myself no and I need to give this a shot at least once. 

But this has also had a big impact on my girlfriend. I told her that I wasn't sure what I wanted to do but that there's a real chance I'll be trying this. And this puts all the plans I had out the window, including my plans with her. Maybe I'm selfish, but I told her that I wouldn't want her to sit at home wondering where I am or if I'm even alive, and likewise if I'm out in the world and I need to make a dangerous decision, I don't want to hesitate because I have to worry about my decision affecting someone at home. I know, selfish, but for something like this I want my decisions to be mine and mine alone. And if I'm going on the way of just exploring life, I told her I don't think we should try long distance for college either, that either way if I get on a plane to do this I don't want to be in a relationship. And so she told me then she'd just prefer to end it now, presumably so she can have this next year to figure it out for herself and not have to deal with it during college, which I fully understand.

It's just been a lot on my mind and I told her I still wasn't sure and so we're taking some space and time apart on a break to each think alone. And I'll be honest I'm scared and anxious about doing such a thing. But I need to try it and find out for myself. And so I guess I already have an answer, but I wanna keep sitting on it and make sure that I want this. I know I sound selfish but I feel like this is something I need to do, but I just don't want to hurt her. So I've been talking a lot about this with friends but sometimes you just need to out it out into the void and reddit is kinda perfect for that. If you read this rant thank you so much I appreciate it. I just needed to keep thinking out loud.",11Jul2020,1

136,"(A bit of a trigger warning for eating disorders)

I need to preface this with two things:

First, I believe that everyone deserves to love themselves for who they are. Self-compassion is important for a healthy mind and even a healthy body.

Second, I need to give you a personal backstory. I just finished a recovery program after losing 65 pounds and putting my health at risk. When I started trying to lose weight I was overweight and constantly eating to avoid my feelings, and I made the decision to be healthier, and to me, losing weight was (not, I later discovered) synonymous with good health. I didn't know what I was doing, and when I was told to gain some weight back I tried, but ultimately failed. I was never taught how to eat intuitively, and had only my old habits of constantly eating to point of almost getting sick. So, when I was told that my heart, a very important muscle responsible for keeping me alive, was damaged and that I had bradycardia and postural tachycardia, I decided to enter a recovery program. After changing what I eat, gaining some weight back and learning about proper nutrition, I'm happy to say that my heart is very close to what is considered normal, and I'm now healthier. 

That said, after going through this program (it was a mental health program) and sitting through a countless number of therapy groups, I decided I needed to make some other changes in my life, and that I wanted to start actively pursuing my goals, which align with my values of education, fitness, self-development, and happiness. I've started reading a book a week and documenting my takeaways from it. I've started meditating. Once I get back home for good I'm going to continue learning how to play the piano and chess, and figuring out how to learn the languages I want to learn. I'm going to focus on my studies and do well so that I can have a better chance for a successful future.

The problem lies, though, with one of my goals. Fitness. While going through this program, there's a lot of mistrust with people with eating disorders, and I understand why. It's necessary to keep an eye on certain things so that everyone stays healthy and can get the support they need. I myself honestly never really needed support with eating and weight restoration, as I just wanted to be healthy with a proper functioning heart, which again, is a step toward a lively and successful future. I'm grateful that I have that mindset, as I've witnessed what happens when you don't. 

Anyway, I did everything I'm supposed to, and I'll be finished with the program in just a few days. I want to continue to make decisions that lead to a healthier and fulfilling life, and I have a good opportunity to do that. Along with what I listed above, I want to start weight training. I want to gain muscle and strength for several reasons, which I'll get into more later. After expressing this to a family member, they immediately said no. They said I shouldn't focus on my body, and that people with anorexia often turn to bodybuilding to distract them from the fact that they have to eat. I disagree, at least with my case. 

I've always wanted to be strong, and even more so after learning that I was malnourished and weak. I want to be strong for myself, and not because I hate myself. I love myself, I'm a badass motherfucker, and I'll still be worth the same no matter my appearance or the amount of muscle on my body. I want to become stronger, faster, and healthier, and I want to see what I'm capable of. In the words of Socrates, ""...It is a shame for a man to go through life without seeing the true strength of which his body is capable."" Exercise, regardless of what it is, is important to maintain and improve a healthy heart, body, and mind. I want a strong and healthy heart, and I want to be as far away from what my heart used to be, when the mere act of standing upright would make me dizzy. I also want to learn a form of martial arts. All these things are decisions I'm making out of self love. I want to improve because I deserve it, and I'm worth the improvement. 

[This](http://wholethenticity.com/can-you-love-yourself-and-want-to-change-yourself-at-the-same-time/) article does a pretty good job at explaining it. 

So, all that to say, what is your opinion? Can you love yourself while wanting to change at the same time?",11Jul2020,1
137,"So... Covid-19 happened and for the past couple of months, I’ve been cooped up at home trying my best to make myself useful (or at least just to feel an ounce of worth). In the beginning, I did some crafts just to post on social media. It became a routine until my mind starts wandering elsewhere. Cloudy yet dark. Every morning now, I would get up and sweep and mop the floor. Clean my cats’ litter boxes and feed them their food. Then, I would make food for myself while I watch some shows on Netflix. Cigarettes always comes after every meal or every time I start or end a task. 

Comes night time, I would do my workout using dumbbells. Other days, I would go skipping as cardio. However, here comes the thing.

I would go and hunt for guys to hook up with (I’m a 25 year old brown Asian cisgendered, pansexual) on Grindr. It has become a part of my routine and I may or may not be addicted to the idea. When I analyse deeper of my actions, I realised that I’ve been doing these just to feel wanted and to feel worthy. I don’t think its healthy when I hook up with 3-4 guys per week right? 

Along the way, I kinda unlocked some stuff through those hookups like I’m actually am able to top someone and make them enjoy the sex (don’t worry, I always use protection) But that’s besides the point. The point is, I love the whole providing and making someone feel better. That makes me feel worthy. 

Through hooking up, I met a bunch of guys that I could vibe really well. I think I might be crushing on one of them. But I know its too soon to say so. Imma just see how that turns out cuz I’ve never been in a relationship with a guy. My exes were all girls. 

During these period too, I shut myself off from the world (social medias). Idk... I feel like people don’t give a shit if im around or not. I thought my disappearance would at least make people question my whereabouts. If I’m worthy, people would find me right? But I do have a couple of them that check on me from time to time and I appreciate that a lot definitely.

2 days ago, I just put up an ad looking for a sugar daddy and mummy. I have all these plans of going back to school and basically just improving myself and my livelihood. I had to resort to this because I feel helpless. With the mental state that I’m in, it feels almost impossible. I feel lost, like my soul is just suspended in the air waiting for some sort of gravity to pull me down. 

I’m just sharing my thoughts on here with hopes that maybe someone could idk perhaps breathe some encouragement or positive energy into me. Am I toxic? Is my anxiety, BPD and depression acting up again? I’m way past self-harming. I’m lost.",11Jul2020,1

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head .

Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? When i do eat i are fried eggs and bacon on toast is that bad?

I suffered Postnatal Depression after having DD a couple of years ago and it took me a long time to get myself sorted. 

I finally got to a point in my life where I could leave the house and actually not have a panic attack. Where I could fall asleep without spending hours depressed or anxious first. 
  
And then, COVID happened. I tried so hard to keep my spirits up and for a while it worked. I suffered vitamin deficiency so was on supplements which helped my mood tremendously. 
  
And then, my nan passed away. And I just couldn't keep going anymore. I can feel myself falling back in to my depression more and more each day. 

As well as my PND and vitamin deficiency, I've been having a lot of problems with my legs. I was prescribed something for a trapped nerve in my back as well as a strong painkiller and an anti inflammatory. 2 out of the 3 of those prescriptions cause drowsiness. 
  
I'm supposed to take the medication for my trapped nerve every night, however the painkiller I was prescribed is kind of a 'use only when you have to' sort of thing but lately, with everything that's been going on I've been taking it more often and if truth be told, in some cases I've taken it purely just so I can get some sleep. 

I know I shouldnt do this. I'm on so much medication for a variety of different things, but I've just really been struggling with the passing of my nan. The more I feel my depression coming back, the more I feel like a failure for relapsing and the harder it is for me to sleep. 

I'm not really sure why I'm writing this....I think I just needed to get it out. I've been trying to limit myself with the painkillers which means I havent been getting much sleep at all.

146,"Twelve days ago I went with my partner for our first ultrasound. I was 12 and half weeks pregnant. During the ultrasound, we were told that we'd had a 'blighted ovum' or 'missed miscarriage — basically my body was still acting as if I was pregnant but there was no baby.

After a few days I started writing about what was happening — the appointments, conversations and what we were doing each day. Before doing this, every thought, conversation and interaction was going round and round my head. I felt like I was going crazy.

During the first week, I searched on Reddit a lot looking for stories from other people that had gone through the same thing as me. By posting this, I'm hoping that someone  may be helped the same way I was.

(Please know that this is a long post as I wrote every day for seven days, plus one additional day a week later)

&amp;#x200B;

We were lucky. I know that it takes many couples months, and sometimes years, to get pregnant. But we were lucky, we got pregnant straight away. And not only in the first month, we got pregnant on the first go.

Then I was lucky again in that I didn’t vomit through my first trimester like most women. Although instead, I seemed to have had every other symptoms listed throughout the first page of Google — nausea, dry heaving, round ligament pain, rhinitis, exhaustion, sore boobs, collarbone pain, bloating.

And while pregnancy wrecked havoc on my body, I was managing a major project at work and doing 60-hour weeks. It was really hard — made harder by the fact that no one tells you that being pregnant can be so hard that you retrospectively reconsider your decision to go down this path in the first place. Sure, the websites tell you that you may experience ‘some nausea’ and ‘be more tired than usual’. But they don’t tell you that you could be dry heaving so violently that you have to crawl across the floor to get to the bathroom, or that you may breakdown from the exhaustion, and that despite all of that, you have to get over it and work through it because you’re not supposed to tell anyone until you hit that 12-week mark.

We tried to keep it a secret but word slowly got out because we were so excited — our parents, our neighbours, a few people at work. We knew we weren’t meant to tell anyone but it’s hard to keep something so major and life-changing, something that you can’t stop thinking about and planning, a secret.

At 11 and half weeks, I had the Harmony blood test to check the baby for any genetic abnormalities and to find out if it was a boy or girl. The results were going to take around a week to come back.

&amp;#x200B;

**Monday**

Exactly one week later, on Monday at 11:00am, we wait in the waiting room of the imaging place for our ultrasound appointment, where we’d see our baby for the first time, hear its heartbeat, see it moving around.

In the waiting room another couple is also waiting. The man is laid back against the couch, playing a game on his phone. The woman is leaning forward staring at the TV but not really watching it. They looked agitated and stressed. I think to myself how nice it is that my partner, Paul, and I are so relaxed and connected, we laugh and chat, talk about how we’re going to announce to our friends and family once that scan is over that we’re going to have a baby.

The night before I’d been worrying to Paul that something would be wrong. That they wouldn’t find a baby and that this had all been a dream. My exact words were ‘what if it’s a ghost baby?’ — whatever that meant. He assured me that of course it would be fine. I’d been so sick the entire time, that was a good sign. Everybody said so.

When the technician finally calls me, I go in alone and she tells me she’ll call Paul in once we’d started. I go in, lay down and pull my top up and the waist of my pants down. She starts moving the wand over my stomach, pressing harder after a while and asking me questions about my symptoms and dates, then asks if she can do a transvaginal exam. I say sure, but does that mean something is wrong? She replies that what she’s seeing isn’t normal.

I leave the room to empty my bladder. Paul’s sitting on a bench, waiting, and he looks up at me expectedly and I shake my head at him. Even though I still believe everything will be fine, because of course it will be, I want to give him some kind of warning.

When I go back into the room I un-change, put a gown on and Paul is called in as I lay back down. A second wand is inserted into me. Normally something like this would bother me and make me uncomfortable. But in that moment, it’s like time is standing still and I know before the technician says anything that my baby is gone.

What she finds is a gestational sac but no baby. In other words, my pregnancy is progressing but there isn’t an embryo — there’s no baby left to be pregnant for.

She leaves the room. I get changed in silence. Paul tries not to cry. She comes back in and says she won’t charge us and that the results would be urgently sent to my doctor so we could talk about the next steps. I don’t know what those steps could be, no one explains this part before you’re in this situation.

The walk home in the sun and stopping by the cafe we had planned turns into a quiet Uber drive.

As soon as we get into our apartment, we break down. The baby we’d dreamed of, planned for and spoken about every day for the past three months is gone.

After an hour of crying and disbelief, I call my mum to tell her. She offers a few minutes of comfort and concern, as expected, and then says ‘they’ll have to scrape the uterus’. But it’s too soon, too much to hear and those three words, ‘scrape the uterus’, carve themselves into my mind. Because it’s *my* uterus. Because it was my baby and dreams and plans. To hear, not two hours after I’d found out the baby I thought was inside me wasn't, that it was going to be scraped out of my body….

That evening, when it feels like we’re taking a momentary hiatus from the grief, my doctor calls. She’s so happy, ecstatic even. She has my Harmony blood test results back. “You’ll guess why I’m calling!? I have your Harmony blood test results back!”. I let her down. She’s flustered, unaware. She tells me this would be the most traumatic thing I’d probably ever go through and then books me in for the next day to see her so we could talk about what to do next.

**Tuesday**

And what are the next steps? Wait for my body to finally realise there was no baby and miscarry on its own. Take medication to induce a miscarriage. Have a surgical procedure to remove the tissue in my uterus.

As I’m technically still 12 and half weeks pregnant, option one isn’t really an option. Who knows how long it could take for my body to click that there isn’t a baby, and in the meantime, I’d have to wait for the blood and tissue to be expelled from my body. Option two was also tricky because I’m further along than most who go down this route which meant it could take weeks for my body to process and expel all of the tissue. It could also lead to infection and from what I read online, be incredibly painful. So option three it is — I’d go to the hospital, be put under general anaesthesia, and then they’ll dilate my cervix to remove all of the tissue… In other words, they’ll “scrape the uterus”.

Even now, it’s like a record player in my head. Over and over, ‘scrape the uterus, scrape the uterus, scrape the uterus’’. I feel my body twitching if I think about those words when I’m not expecting to.

Before we leave the doctors, she asks if we want to know if it was a boy or girl so we can name it. We decline. How could that make this any easier?

We head to the Royal Women's Hospital, where I was originally booked to have my baby. We can’t find a carpark for what feels like forever. There are new dads waiting at the elevator with body pillows and car seats. We wait in line to be let in because the people at the front can’t figure out the COVID-19 sign-in procedure. And when we finally get through, we’re ignored for three minutes by the nurse at the desk in the empty emergency department.

I speak with the Nurse Administrator who takes my forms, gives me an armband and then refers me to the nurse sitting next to her. We take one step to the left and the nurse there asks me why I’m here. I can’t speak, can’t say that I was here to organise my miscarriage. Paul shows her the referral letter again.

We wait for the doctor. She comes out and gets us, leads us to an office. She recommends the surgical option because of how far along I am and how obviously distressed I am. But because the hospital needs their own ultrasounds to be done, we have to go home and wait for a phone call to make another appointment for the scans to be redone and then make a third appointment for the third procedure. Hopefully all to be done by the end of the week.

As we drive home, our neighbour messages to say she’d dropped off freshly baked cookies. But when we get to our door, there’s also a huge vase of flowers from my boss and his wife. Seeing those flowers, knowing that they were because we lost our baby… I start bawling in the hallway. Paul brings me inside and leaves the flowers on the floor in the kitchen. I scream into the couch while Paul sits next to me silently. All I can think is that I’d have to stare at those flowers and be constantly reminded of why they were sent.

So, with tears and snot running down my face, I pick the vase up, walk into the hallway, into the garbage room and throw them, as hard as I can, down the garbage shoot. I wait to hear the glass smashing at the bottom. It’s the first time I felt okay in two days.

**Wednesday**

Every morning now I wake up at 4:30am. I go through Reddit until I’ve read everything new. Then I cry and scream into my pillow until Paul wakes up.

The rest of each day, we leave the TV on to fill the silence. If the TV isn’t on, it's like my brain’s a record player and over and over I revisit the past few days. Scrape the uterus, scrape the uterus, scrape the uterus. Then I cry and end up screaming. So we leave it on all day, until I fall asleep and then turn it back on when I wake up.

At 12:00pm, two full days after we found out that the baby was gone, a nurse calls me to book my scan appointment. She hasn’t read my notes and needs me to re-explain everything. I need to go into the hospital again the next day for a booking appointment and more ultrasounds, she says. She also says that the surgery will likely happen Friday and that tomorrow they’ll find out ‘how much product there is to remove’. And just like that, my baby and months of my life becomes a ‘product’.

So, we wait. It’s been two days of crying, screaming, headaches, eating takeaways and sugar, crying more, avoiding people. Two days of trying to accept that my baby’s gone. Two days of, what I know is sick and twisted, trying to convince myself and Paul that maybe in the scan tomorrow, they’ll see the baby. The lady that did our first scan hadn’t brushed her hair at the back, maybe she was having a bad day and didn’t read the scan correctly. But I know that’s not true, and Paul’s telling me to prepare for the worst.

Despite everything, I see that today is a beautiful day. Not too cold, not too hot. The sun is shining and there are no clouds. We go for a walk, we don’t speak. It’s nice to be outside, but crushing too because everywhere I look, I remember conversations from the past where we’d planned our new life. But I’m lying on the couch now, wrapped in a duvet with one of our cats against my legs. I’m typing our story and a breeze is drifting through the open balcony door. I can hear the cars from the road and people talking in their gardens. I haven’t cried for two hours, I think I’ll be okay for a little while longer but I miss Paul, I miss our old-new life and I already miss who I used to be.

We’ve eaten dinner and I think I feel something. Like when you first get your period and you ‘know’ it’s started. I avoid checking for 40-minutes — I do the dishes, play with the cats, shut the windows. I’m scared to check because if the miscarriage had started naturally, I don’t think I can have the surgery. What’s wrong with me? I’ve been screaming into the couch because I’ve lost my baby but I can’t wait for them to cut out what’s left from inside me.

I still feel nauseous at times. My boobs still hurt. But all of the other symptoms are gone. But that was meant to happen at 12-weeks anyway. Am I still pregnant? Nobody has explained this to me yet.

These questions are killing me and I feel like my soul is breaking.

**Thursday**

This morning we have another appointment at the hospital so they can do more ultrasounds and talk to us about the procedure.

We get to the hospital and park. I feel numb, almost catatonic. We’re directed to an abandoned looking area of the hospital until a man, who’s far too enthusiastic, comes to collect us and take us to the Early Pregnancy Assessment Service unit. After being questioned about Medicare, which I can barely register or answer, we wait for another 15-minutes while the nurse who’s to see us makes coffee and catches up with her colleagues. We can hear them talking about COVID-19, the traffic, the footy, all while it feels like my world was shattering.

With a mug of coffee in hand, the nurse brings us into her office, asks the same questions I’ve been asked four times already. I answer and cry, answer and cry. She goes out, talks to someone else and comes back to tell me that we don’t need to do another ultrasound if it will be too traumatic for me. I insist and tell her I need to know that they’re correct, that there definitely is no baby. She looks at me slightly baffled but agrees.

Another ultrasound happens and the new technician confirms that there is no baby. It’s gone. He wants to book in the surgery for as soon as possible, is this okay? Yes, of course it’s okay, there is no other option.

We wait around in the waiting room again. We go back to see the nurse. She hands me more tissues because I’m, of course, crying. We go back to the waiting room. We see a doctor who makes me sign forms about the risks, agreements to blood transfusions and for further operation if anything goes wrong. I don’t read it and sign, because I don’t care at this point. She has nice shoes, her hair slides are falling out. She’s young and looks like she wants to be a comfort but really has no idea — this is just another patient, another appointment. She then gives me medication to take 10-minutes before I arrive the next day. This is the same medication that they give for terminations or if you decide to miscarry at home but it’s one third of the normal dose. I’m instructed not to eat or drink water past midnight. Normally I’d complain that I couldn’t do this because I’m pregnant, I need to drink 4L a day otherwise I become dehydrated and eat my crackers in the morning so I don’t feel nauseous. But I don’t know if I’m pregnant anymore and in the morning, that will be taken care of.

After the hospital, we go to the markets. Trying to stay distracted all of the time is hard and time-consuming. I spend all of my budgeted spending money for the week on bagels, pastries, babka and chocolates. Then we go to the pet store and I spend unbudgeted money on my cats because I’ve neglected them all week. I buy bags of treats and toys I know they’ll never use.

We come home and watch Everybody Loves Raymond until I fall asleep on the couch. When I wake up, it’s 4:00pm. I get into bed and watch Netflix with Paul.

At 6:00pm I return our neighbours' container that the cookies were in. Then we go for a drive in the dark around the park. I feel like I’m talking constantly about things that don’t matter, when I lived in Queenstown, gossip about people I don’t care about. Then we go to the supermarket to buy pads. Apparently after the surgery, there could be a lot of bleeding that lasts two weeks. I buy every kind of Libra pad available.

**Friday**

Like every night this week, last night, I woke up every couple of hours. Each time I wake up, I’m scared and nervous and sad. At 5:45am, I get up and shower. We have to leave in an hour.

When we arrive in the car park we sit in the car in silence for 10-minutes until I need to take the medication. Instead of swallowing it with water, I have to lodge the two tablets between my cheeks and bottom gums and wait for them to dissolve. It takes 45-minutes and is chalky and sticks to my teeth.

Paul drops me at the Day Surgery Clinic. He’s not allowed in. They tell me to take a seat and then they’ll check me in.

I wait for 50-minutes while all of the other women are checked in. Ones that were here before me and news ones. They’ve forgotten about me. When I go to the desk the manager is shocked they’ve forgotten and checks me in quickly.

I realise not everyone here is here for the same procedure I am like I’d thought they would be. Women are laughing and chatting. Some are here for PCOS, urinary problems and a couple are even here for a c-section. One other woman is crying. I think she’s here for the same reason I am.

Eventually they take me through to another nurses station where I’m asked the same questions for the fifth or sixth time. She asks me to go through the supplements I’m currently taking. They’re all prenatal supplements or things my GP has me taking to deal with the side effects of pregnancy. It hurts to recall this because I forgot I could stop taking those now.

After more forms, heart rate checks and blood pressure checks, she takes me to a changing room where I’m to remove all of my clothes and put on the gown, dressing gown, cap and booties. Anywhere else I’d be embarrassed but I’ve realised no one will care and there are other women out there looking exactly the same.

I come out and give her the clothes I came in wearing. She tells me to keep my phone and leads me to an armchair at the back of the clinic next to another woman. Everyone else is in a different waiting area on plastic chairs. After an hour, I hear that me and the other woman are the ones here for miscarriages. Maybe that’s why we’re separated.

Another hour goes by and a woman and her husband are being prepped for their c-section. The wifi is shit and there’s nothing to do. Only a little while later, I hear crying. Their baby’s been born.

The other woman and I look at each other and smile. We start talking. She’s here for this procedure for the third time for the same miscarriage. The surgeons keep missing some each time but she assures me there’s only a one in a thousand chance of this happening. She’s 40 and this was her second round of IVF, the last one ending in miscarriage too. I think it’s heart-breaking how many operations she’d had, she thinks it’s heart-breaking how late my miscarriage is. It’s easy to compare your grief against someone elses to make yourself feel better.

Five hours of waiting and it’s 12:30pm and I’m the second to last woman waiting. I’ve had cramping and back pain but no bleeding so I figure the medication must be doing something. Another couple were just taken through before me for a c-section. Their English wasn’t very good and they weren’t sure what to name their baby.

The Anaethesiologist comes in and tells me that they’re ready. They ask me the same questions for the seventh time, check who I am again and what my birthdate is and then lead me into the surgery.

The Surgeon comes over. She’s tiny and lovely and has kind eyes. She checks I’m the right person and asks me the same questions for the eighth time. Then they take my dressing gown, undo my gown and lead me to the table to lie down.

They put the calendula in and put a blanket over me. They make fun of my New Zealand accent to try and lift the mood. It works for a minute but then I start silently tearing up. It’s going to all be over and while I’m glad that this will be the end of my hospital visits, it hits me again that this is the end of this pregnancy and I don’t have a baby. There was less than a 1% chance of miscarriage at this late stage and what I’m going through now is apparently even rarer. The Anaesthesiologist assistant, another Kiwi, wipes my tears away with her gloved fingertips and holds my hand. The Anaesthesiologist tells me he’s going to make me more comfortable and assures me they’ll look after me. They both apologise for what’s happened.

I wake up to a baby crying next to me. For a split second I think it’s mine. But of course, it’s not. It’s the woman who went before me. She’s had her baby and they’re getting to know each other next to me.

I spend the next two hours drifting in and out of catatonia, crying and being given Fentanyl and a shot for my negative blood type. The nurses are kind. They move me to a different waiting area once I’m stable.

Paul’s arrived and I ask to leave. They explain again about the bleeding and pain I’m going to have over the next two weeks and then help me get up and they leave so I can change. When I stand up, there’s blood on my gown and the sheet below me. I can feel gravity doing it’s thing and quickly get changed and put a pad in my underwear. I’m too slow and have to change to a third pad.

Paul’s in the waiting room. He looks worried and scared. When he looks up and sees me, he rushes through the patients-only area and grabs my bag and jacket from my hands and we leave.

After getting home, I shower and eat in silence for half an hour. I’m starving and exhausted. It’s only 6:00pm but I ask Paul to get me an energy drink otherwise I’ll fall asleep and be awake at 2:00am. The rhinitis is gone and I feel lighter — both in terms of weight and like something’s been lifted off my shoulders. This makes me sad because I feel guilty for being relieved I’m no longer pregnant.

**Saturday**

It took me a long time to go to sleep last night because it was quiet and dark and Paul was sleeping already. People say that you shouldn’t distract yourself, that you should allow yourself to think. I understand that in theory but for every second between episodes, for every minute I’m in the shower and for every microsecond I blink or tune out, I’m thinking about my loss and grief. Being distracted and keeping busy feels like the only thing that will stop me from going crazy.

I feel exhausted and like I’ve been hit by a truck. My legs are swollen and sore from the lack of movement and procedure yesterday. My vagina hurts a little bit and I feel like my insides have been manhandled, which I suppose they have been. My head is congested with thoughts and feelings like sadness, grief, joy, guilt. The bleeding hasn’t been as bad as I thought it would be but I’m wondering if that’s because I’ve been lying down since the operation. And the cramping is there but only slightly.

My plan for the day is to watch Harry Potter movies, online shop, and eat chocolate and pizza. I feel like I’m playing into a stereotype perfectly but I don’t know what else to do.

I speak to my mum properly for the first time this week. It’s brief. She asks a few questions about how I’m doing and then tells me she’s told my sister about the miscarriage. When I ask why, she makes excuses about how it was awkward for me to not have told her and that she could find out from someone else.

I’m so angry and disappointed in her. How dare she tell people that I specifically said I didn’t want telling one of the most intimate and devastating events of my life. She’s used my grief as gossip. And instead of apologising, she’s made excuses and tried to put it back on me.

How can I trust someone who has so little respect for my privacy and dignity? Does she think I can trust her again with this kind of information in the future?

After the phone call, I message her saying how disappointed I am, especially given how important her own privacy is to her. No apology, just ‘I understand’.

Not only does my sister now know but everyone else mum told about me being pregnant, tens of people, when I told her not to tell anyone, will now have to be told that I’ve lost my baby. And on top of that my sister, being a gossip and attention-seeker, will have told tens of people herself. People that know me and are siblings and friends of people that know me.

I’m disgusted in mum. I’m pissed off and disgusted and disappointed and feel violated.

Right now, I should be allowing myself space to grieve and look after myself. Look after the feelings, physical pain and hormone changes that I’m experiencing. Instead, I’ve had to tear a part of myself away from that and spend it being angry at my own mother, someone that should have been my number one support during this time and has instead become my number one enemy.

**Sunday**

Today I feel numb. Numb from the grief and pain and anger. I’m still disappointed in her but I’m also so tired that I can’t work up the energy to do or say anything more about it.

I lay in bed until 2pm. I shower while Paul was at the gym. He asks me to have lunch while he’s out. After the shower, I sit on the balcony in my towel on the ground. It’s 10 degrees but I can’t feel it. Paul comes home and bursts onto the balcony, out of breath. He couldn’t find me inside and panicked, I suppose thinking something else terrible had happened.

Now it’s 5pm and I’m starting to regain feeling again. Paul called my boss and said he didn’t know when I’d come back to work. It’s fine and there are no expectations for me to return to work right now but I’m sure there’s an expiry date on that.

I miss who I was one week ago. I miss when I had my whole soul. Paul and I are closer than ever and that I’m grateful for. But I wish I could go back in time and be myself again for even one minute.

**One week later**

It’s been one week since the procedure and 12 days since we found out. I’ve accepted it but I’m scared I’ve had a vision of my future — a future of miscarriages, hospital visits and heartbreak. Maybe it will be okay, that’s what everyone keeps saying. But it’s hard to believe that after having a miscarriage that had a less than 1% chance of happening in the first place.

I have okay days where I feel relatively normal — I laugh, talk, do things around the house. I’m normally someone who runs at 150% and on these days I feel like I’m running at 75%, but that’s okay. Then there are other days where I can’t speak, I’m exhausted but I can’t sleep, I stare into space for minutes and can’t hear or see anything around me, I cry on and off all day.

The only way I know how to explain it to Paul is that I feel like a Kinder Surprise. I feel like a shell of a person who could break at any moment, and deep down the old-me is packed away and untouchable. It’s good to know that she’s still there but I wonder how and when I’ll reach her again.

Paul went back to work this week and he’s had a hard few days. He said it’s because life goes on and that’s difficult to reconcile when you’re grieving. I’m trying to support him and give him space but all I can think about is my own grief and how this is so much harder for me — I know that’s selfish and wrong, I’m trying to do better.

I’ve never been great at conclusions but this chapter is slowly coming to a close. The days will get easier and in a few months we’ll try again. Paul and I are closer than ever and I know we’ll enter next time excited and positive but wary. I miss who I was 13 days ago but I hold out hope that she’ll come back to me soon.",11Jul2020,1

Sure. I have characteristics. I’m vegan. I want to be a neonatal nurse or a lawyer. I danced growing up but wasn’t great. I do bad in school and feel like I could do better. I finally got on adderall and I’m hoping it helps me do better in school or find myself. I have a good group of friends. I’ve had jobs growing up. But I don’t feel like I know who I am or my personality. Everyone says I seem really shy and sweet when they meet me. I feel like I’m socially awkward. I don’t know if I’m still nice when people get to know me honestly. I think my moms a narcissist and emotionally abused me growing up but I don’t know if I’m just being dramatic.
