1,"I just love doing it, i started doing it whilst i was skipping school ( I know it's bad and i shouldn't do it but sometimes i just want to run away from everything) just to kill off some time and it slowly became one of my favorite things to do. I can observe the scenery and how people act and look like, i can read and read book peacefully and most of all it allows me to think in my own bubble wich i fine is very important for my own well being. I guess that those random bus adventure offer me a safe space from the busy life outside.

Anyway that was all, I wish you all a nice day",20Aug2020,1
2,"I miss when you didn’t try so hard. If i never have to see another selfie taken by you with you smiling without showing your teeth I’d be fine. I miss when you didn’t care so much about what people think. I miss the days when I thought you were the best honest person in the whole entire world. I miss when you had morals. I miss when it was just us before you involved other people and ruined everything. I miss being proud of you. Your still my love and my person but it’s not the same and it never will be. I wish I knew at the time that 2018 would be the last good year as I know it, the last year before you changed so dramatically. I see pictures from before and I want to just jump into them.

Hi I’m writing this post to ask for some quick help I’m 21 years old &amp; moved to Vegas from California about 2 months ago I stay in a weekly hotel &amp; due to Covid I’m on unemployment. My payments have been pending for almost 3 weeks now &amp; that was my only income. I applied for Nevada food stamps &amp; currently waiting for that to process &amp; will be donating plasma/blood to make extra money. I have no more food, I used the change I had left to wash some clothes that are now air drying because I didn’t have enough for the dryer &amp; I really needed clean clothes to wear. My rent is about $250 a week but I’m only asking for around $100 or whatever you can honestly just to pay for a few days because my hotel manger has been being lenient but I still need to pay something. If anyone could help me out, I know I will have the money by the end of the month to pay back as I’m actively looking for work &amp; quick jobs to get by thank you !",20Aug2020,1

16,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",20Aug2020,1

All these things just make me either feel unhappy or dull but I still found myself craving social media. Why? Why? I don’t get it. So I deleted the apps. Not my accounts, bc that seems rash. Just the apps. It’s been six hours. I feel weird about it.  Honestly I’m still connected to my friends through other apps like snap and messenger, so I’m still connected to my far away pals- the weirdness isn’t from social isolation or disconnect.

19,"This happened about 5 years ago. I was in an all girls high school and had 3 best friend at school(Mili, Daisy and Tammy). We were all 16 in this story.

I had a few guy friends and one of them, Mike , was my best friend. I had known him since I was 13 online and we met when I was 14/15 in tuition. and I had tuition together and we'd meet every week. He would walk me to the bus stop afterwards. We often had bets that would win me chocolate, like the first one to pinch the other's cheek wins type of bets.

Needless to say, I developed a crush on him. Now, I'm not a very pretty girl and he was a tall, buff, handsome guy.

When we were 15 in 2014, during the school holidays, we had a row and we stopped talking. It actually crushed me and I confided in my best friend Milli.

After the school holidays, we went back to school at the start of 2015 and Milli said she had a surprise for me. Her exact words. She said she'd been talking to Mike over the holidays and she felt we had a chance. It struck me as weird, my best friend talking to my crush. I did not voice my apprehension.

Mike and I started talking again. Mike would often send me pictures of girls that he found online. Some were our mutual acquaintances, others were girls who went to different high schools. He'd tell me he found them cute and if I approved or not. Sometimes, he'd ask me to approach a girl on his behalf. 

Looking back, it was just plain creepy that he'd spend so much time online looking up profiles of girls, and seeing if he found them cute. I did not see that however. I was just very hurt. I had no reason to be hurt given he did not even knew my feelings, but I still was. I guess despite my crush, I realised it's not a nice sign for someone to find girls online every week.

Anyway, my 16th birthday came up and he called me, saying he had feelings for me and would like to propose to me to be his girlfriend. I felt like it was a dream come true, but at the same time a few days before I was still getting pictures of potential girlfriends.

I said no. He pleaded. I maintained my ground. 

At the time, I had another guy friend, Sam. Sam and I had a mutual cousin and we met when we were 10 at her engagement, then her wedding. Sam knew Mike from their mutual high school friends and offered to act as my boyfriend when he met Mike so that to stop Mike from contacting me. His messages and calls were getting too much to the point of him harassing me.

I was 16, stupid and confused and I agreed. Sam and I were friends, but then in his messages he started saying he had feelings for me. My dumbass went along with it. About 1 month after that, I realised it was weird of me and Sam to act lovey dovey in messages. We met once for 5 minutes during our 'dating period' and we were both so very awkward.

He agreed because he realised it was super weird for us to pretend to love each other.

Back at school, I told Mili, Daisy and Tammy that I had feelings for Mike still, but would never act on them due to his past behaviour.

They were a bit weird about it, but never said anything.

In the meantime, Milli started dating someone. I asked about it and she reluctantly gave me details, a name, age, school etc. Tammy and Daisy would tease her about the guy too.

I'm not a nosy person. I would never go out of my way to ask questions or probe. If we're having a conversation and something strikes me, I might ask, but I don't go around interrogating people.

At the end of  2015, we had super important exams. We finished those and I started using my social media again.

There was a message from Mike. Joy, I guess.

We started talking. I was making plans to meet Milli during the holidays when I visited my cousin.

I don't remember the details of the conversation at the time, but Mike then sent me pictures. Pictures of him and Milli, holding hands, cuddling together. My first thought was this was photoshop. Milli would never do that to me. She knew I had liked Mike for a while, even though I refused to date him due to his actions.

I looked at the pictures. Milli would talk about her bf would always wear green to meet her because she loved green. Green shirts in most of the pictures.

I messaged Milli. She confessed. She said she did not want to tell me due to us having important exams. She was apparently trying to convince Mike to give me another chance as well as change his behaviour. She was doing that by meeting him, kissing him and more.

She never apologised. She's a proud and arrogant girl. 

I was hurt beyond belief. I cried my heart out that night. God the first thought I had was the block of knives in the kitchen, the knives with the green handle. I hated green at that time, me who loves all colours. 

Of course I didn't too anything. I'm too sensible to hurt myself for another person, much less a boy.

Anyway, I cut contact with them all, even Tammy and Daisy, because they knew and didn't tell me.

2016 and we go back to high school. Tammy and Daisy talk to me saying they urged Milli to come clean so many times, it never happened.

At the start Milli told Mike I'm not talking to her. I replied that conversation is two way, if she's not making an effort don't blame it on me. We started talking again, though I maintained my distance.

Mike would call Milli several times during the day. I kept away as much as I could. 

I started getting over my feelings for Mike and letting go of my resentment for Milli.

End of July of that year, I started dating another guy. We were very happy for a while, but then broke up at the end of the year. That's a story for another time. 

2017 comes along and I'm stressed due to personal problems.

Milli started being less and less on the phone. When we asked her, she said Mike did not text or call her as often.

We told her it might be because she never initiated contact. It was true. She would never text or call first until Mike did so. 

She started trying her best. She also discovered that he might be talking to other girls online.

End of 2017, important exams again.

I was struggling from my end due to stuff at home. Mike ghosted Milli in a way, he stopped responding. Milli blocked him everywhere to heal from everything. She told us she realised the relationship was over ages ago.

2020, Milli, Daisy and I are now best friends and super close. Tammy has drifted a bit apart but we still talk. I have never ever brought up what she did to me again and she has not done so either. She has never apologised for it, neither am I looking for an apology.

I just had to type this here. I'm not sure what I'm looking for. It was just a very hurtful and confusing experience of my life.",20Aug2020,1

22,"I’ve known my friend for about 4 years now and we have lived together for 2-3 years now (in seperate rooms of course). We have absolutely no romantic feelings for each other and treat each other like siblings. A year ago, he met this girl and started dating. At first she seemed normal but after having her move in, I got to know her better and I think she’s crazy.

I’m not one to usually dislike someone this much but she really knows how to get on my nerves. She doesn’t clean or do her own dishes and expects me or her bf (a.k.a. My friend) to do it for her while she sits and watch TV. She’s controlling and abusive. She hits him and it left bruises sometimes. She’s rude and has no manners. Usually when you live with someone don’t you greet each other in the morning? I did a few times and she just ignored me. We have 3 cats at home and that bitch of a gf is quite fond of one of them. Cats usually are quite temperamental and doesn’t like to be carried but she doesn’t care and forces the cat to be carried for few hours a day. Yesterday as the cat was trying to hid from her under the recliner sofa, in order to get the cat, she reclined the sofa while the cat was there and it got injured. I told my friend and when he confronted her she acted all guilty and shit. 

My friend asked me about his gf a couple of times but whenever I tried to point out her crazy selfish personality, he finds an excuse or tries to justify her behaviour. He’s thinking of marrying her in 1-2 years time. I am just so frustrated. This is only the tip of the ice berg and she’s way worse. Do guys like to be tortured in a relationship? Do they like girls who have no manners and controlling? Girls who always throw a tantrum? Should I have an honest talk with him? What if he gets mad at me and ask me to move out? I don’t have the funds to move just yet. I’m sorry for this long post, I am just really frustrated.",20Aug2020,1
23,"I have come to realize that a fatal flaw in myself is I don't like/am not attracted to people with similar interests as me and it's in direct competition with my desire to make meaningful connections with people.

I used to think it's bc when I was little, adults would randomly take my things away without cause and I'd not react/pretend I didn't care so I could get it back faster. So wherever someone's like ""Oh I like that thing too!"" My initial reaction of being like ""Nvm"" was because I was scared they could somehow take it away? Taint it? That I'd mentally associate this person with that thing and they wouldn't be in my life forever and I didn't to think about them wherever I interacted with the thing?

Now I have,  ""personal"" interests that are for me only that I don't tell people about and ""public"" interests that aren't super personal and I'm okay talking all day about

I don't like this about myself and have to actively force myself not to dip away from people. But I also don't want to be only associated with my interests? Yes I like video games, but being a ""Gamer"" isn't a part of my identity. I like baking and staying in, but I also love going out and being in the world. 

I guess I'm just scared of coming off as something I'm not to people and so I come off as nothing.

Half of my immediate family will be traveling a few hundred miles to go to the funeral. I understand why they want to go and would never try to dissuade them from going. But what scares me is that a couple of those people live here with me and a baby. I don’t want to say their relationship to me because so many of us have reddit accounts but they’re close enough in relation to make it next to impossible to distance myself from them for two weeks when they return. I’m scared because I know at funerals people are emotional, they let their guards down and I’m worried Covid will be spread around to people and brought back here to me and the baby. I’ve thought about this and I can’t stop thinking about how people if they’re feeling ill may not go to a wedding or a birthday party, but most people won’t want to miss a funeral and there’s no restrictions on how many people can attend. I’ve been assured everyone will be careful and safe but what does that even mean at a funeral when people will be hugging and crying and noses will be running? 
I can’t just go and stay with a relative here for two weeks when they return because any one of them who I could stay with all have at least one person from their household also attending this funeral. I even considered getting a hotel room and moving into it for two weeks upon their return just to make sure no one gets sick when they get back but it’s just too expensive. 
Am I overreacting? Being too paranoid? Throughout this entire thing I’ve been of the mindset that I’d rather be overly cautious than under cautious. I don’t want to be insensitive to what’s going on and I 100% understand why they want to go, why they need to go. I’m just...scared.",20Aug2020,1

She searches my room while I’m gone to see if there’s anything new. (Searched my room and saw I had a credit card, got mad because he didn’t put her daughter on his credit line and they argued). She’s a hoarder, will have shoes from 12 years ago she never wore and when my dad throws it out she has the most child like temper tantrum I’ve ever seen. She can’t manage money at all. (“Lost” 5000$ and got us kicked out of an apartment). I feel like she just is leeching off my dad, and because he has 2 kids with her he doesn’t want to leave. I wanna help and say something to him about how he should leave, but at the same time sometimes they really seem in love until it all goes bad.

48,"I know by the title, it doesn’t seem the most interesting, but I just wanted to put my good news out there.

For the last year or two, I had been wanting to go out with someone and I really wanted a girlfriend, because I kept associating having a girlfriend with having happiness. But in the last few month I realised I have to find happiness within my self, and I know that if I can’t love myself how would I expect anyone to love me. So I made the big decision to work on myself, and when I made that decision, not even 3 weeks later I got asked out by a girl, unfortunately I did have to decline as I wasn’t really in a good head space.

But this past week I had been seeing amazing improvements with myself and my mental health, and this other girl practically fell into my lap. I had ordered food last night, and found a note asking “how you been?” It had a name and number, so I decided to message it. Turns out it was meant for a different person because we shared the same first name and had the same last letter initial. I had explained to her I was the wrong person, but would be happy to be friends with her, which she agreed to. And we had been talking all day, and she had asked me if I would like to go out sometime. I was nervous, but I really wanna push myself out of my comfort zone, so I agreed. 

And now I guess now I’m going on a date? Or I’m just hanging out as friends with her, but I don’t even know. Still happy, but nervous",20Aug2020,1

I had to delete so many things from my phone and the “Others” kept stealing the storage all back, I could’ve freed a good 4gbs and less than an hour later it would all be gone &gt;:(

And today I finally found peace, I got an update notification for my phone. It was gonna update tonight but the storage didn’t let it, and after searching for options to free my storage, I found on the actual Apple website saying to update the phone to this current version and I was like “Why not, I have nothing to lose, maybe just a little more storage”

And I did it, and then I stayed 20-30 minutes just watching my storage finally having more space, I’ve never felt more satisfied.

60,"The pandemic has changed a lot in all our lives. One thing it's done for me is really made me reflect on where I am in life, what I want from it, and largely how I'm not that happy with it.

On the face of things I should be happy, and I know some of my friends and acquaintances look at me in some form of envy. I'm in my early 30s, married to a beautiful and caring woman, have a well-paid job with a good level of disposable income, I have a nice car and a nice house and generally I should be happy. I'm not though, really. I spend far too much time looking back and thinking about what could have been. I have so many regrets about chances I didn't take that I'm left stuck with this heavy feeling in my heart that I've wasted so many opportunities in my life.

On the job front, I'm considered an expert in my field. I'm invited to speak at conferences, I've mentored a few people and helped them achieve what they need. My boss described my knowledge and expertise as ""unparalleled"" the other week. I'm paid pretty well for it too. The problem is I've essentially been doing the same job for the last 7-8 years, albeit it in 3 different organisations, but the crux of the job remains the same - it's just different people I'm dealing with. I've been thinking I need to find a new career, however I have no idea what I want that career to be. My plan since I started working after leaving uni has basically been to earn as much money as I can and ensure a comfortable life for me and my family. I'm at a level as well where if I was to start a new career I'd probably have to take a bit of a pay-cut to get it as my job is very niche, and other jobs at a similar level need specific experience in the role. I've applied to a few things in the last few months, but no luck so far. I'm jealous of my wife as her job is her vocation. She's constantly learning and improving and trying to be the best she can be, which sometimes I think is unhealthy because she never really switches off from it, but I'm jealous because she loves it and she's committed to it where as for me, I do my job but if I'm not working I don't want to think about it. 

I've thought about writing a book. I've had an idea for a novel in my head for a long time, so I started writing it in the early stages of lockdown but I just don't think I'm a good enough writer for it to be anything more than just a private hobby. I've written a chapter, or most of a chapter, and it feels cliche'd and poorly written. I know that if I practice writing more it should improve, but I'm so critical of my own work that I don't feel I can get past that, never mind daring to show it to anybody else to rip it apart.

There's the other issue that I'm not sure what my future holds now. Before getting married, my now-wife and I used to talk about having kids and we tried for a while with no success. She's now feels that she doesn't want any now, and I still do. Naturally, things can change and I'm going to see about getting tested to check I actually can have kids but if she doesn't change her mind I'm not sure what I'll do. I've always wanted a child and the thought of not experiencing that in my lifetime scares me as there's a pretty limited time-span on doing that.

I also feel that during lockdown my wife and I have actually drifted apart a bit, despite spending so much more time together. I know we love each other, but it feels like we're more like best friends now rather than husband and wife, and she said the same thing to me recently.

I feel like I'm in a mid-life crisis despite, hopefully, not being at mid-life yet. I look back at 30+ years gone by that I could have spent better and look to the future with no idea of what it entails, and it feels more and more like life is just passing me by. I don't know what my purpose is, I don't think there's any meaning to it, I'm just a passenger. Honestly, my mortality is now beginning to scare me. I'm very much an atheist and strongly believe that when I die that's it, but I wish I believed - or that there is, something more afterwards. Maybe a chance to live my life again, or live another life in another body.

TLDR; not sure where my life is heading nor what I want from it, but feel like I've wasted a lot of it and I'm running out of time to figure it out.",20Aug2020,1

63,"So, basically, I'm 15 and I've been having generalized anxiety for a few months now. This was probably caused by the Covid suddenly coming here in Italy giving me anxiety. Since I realized that I had anxiety, I immediately went to a therapist, because I knew that was the best thing to do. And therapy actually helped! My anxiety gradually got better and I was happier than before. But a week ago something changed. At first I started feeling less and less emphatic and generous, and lately I've started to lose interest in music, humor and video games. I wasn't an avid gamer before, but games were a great passion and distraction from my anxiety. The same thing with music. I think I lost the ""feel"" for music. I dunno how to describe it, but it just doesn't exite me anymore. This has also kind of happened with memes on the internet. I don't laugh at them anymore. No matter what the image/text is, I don't laugh at the anymore.

Now, if any of that happened separately, I would've thought that it was just my anxiety acting up, like it happened before. But all of these happening one after the other, it seems pretty weird.

I'm pretty scared about having severe depression. I always calmed myself by saying that my anxiety was pretty mild and that I wasn't like all of those people on the internet who had depression for years, but I'm scared that I'm becoming just like them. Like, my mild anxiety was pretty though to deal with for a few months, imagine me dealing with severe depression for years! I'm scared that I will become just like those depressed people who don't find enjoyment in anything anymore and want to kill themself.

It's also weird because my life hasn't gotten any worse lately. Quite the opposite really! I've started to get better with anxiety, the virus in Italy just started to go away, I started to see my friends again and I went on vacation a few times. And my friends and family are as healthy as they can be! So it's pretty irritating that just because my mind said so, I will now live a sad life and I wont be able to live happily like before all of this mess.

Other than depression though, I think I have some other reasons to all of this. Lately I've started to dream in my sleep more and I was also starting to rest more. I also started to always wake up with a dry mouth and a bit of a sore throat. I searched my symptoms online and I might have Sleep Apnea, which sometimes causes mood changes. Also, and I know this is embarassing and that's the reason I made a separate account for this, my libido is pretty down lately, and I read that this could be caused by this.

Also, talking with my family about this, they all said that this could be just caused by the hormones in my body acting a bit up. My cousin said for example that this is all Norman and she also went trough this during her teen years, and it all went back to normal after some weeks. They also said that this could be due to a lack of vitamins or minerals in my body.

This could also be my anxiety making me belive that I have severe depression to scare me. This could also be because I hit the back of my head slightly on the roof at my friend's house! I really don't know. Also, the reason I'm not going to therapy for this is because my therapist is on vacation until September 9, so I can't really talk about this to her.

I'm pretty desperate about this. I'm scared that this will also affect my relationships with my friends. I want those interests to come back. Is there any chance this will happen?",20Aug2020,1
64,"Warning: this is long. Just need to write it out and remind myself when I have to read this again later. Or maybe someone else is in a similar position and needs to hear this.

I went through some things over the past few years including the sudden death of my father, then I was diagnosed with a chronic illness while trying to balance my home life with 2 small children. They were stressful events but I never considered them as something that crippled me. I’m pretty strong and resilient so I dealt with these issues and moved on with life. Just when I thought I was starting to heal and feeling happy again, my life slowly fell apart.

It all started when I thought a change in career would be good for my personal and professional development. I wasn’t unhappy with my job, just thought I wanted more. So I took the plunge and took a management position in the same company. It started out as a great challenge and exciting, but slowly fell into a trap of a poisoned work environment where I longed everyday to go back to my old job when I was happy. And when I expressed this to my employer I was guilt tripped into staying. I know I’m a good and valued worker so they don’t want me to leave. I felt a sense of responsibility, didn’t want to leave my boss hanging and didn’t want to admit I was a failure who couldn’t handle it. So I agreed to stay.

Then a few months later, without going into details my marriage was falling apart. So bad that it warranted a divorce but I agreed to stay due to financial reasons and for the children. And this was just before the pandemic and then covid happened. With the added stress from my toxic workplace, I’ve never felt more lonely and isolated.

I initiated individual counselling, trying to not allow work stress bother me, trying to keep telling myself to pull my big girl pants up, stop feeling sorry for myself and just deal with life. But the final straw was when I found out by chance, I am actually making less money than what I was making at my old job (hard to explain my pay scale so won’t get into it) So here I am, stressed, depressed, losing sleep, drinking daily to escape, working longer hours, and making less money. My marriage is suffering and I’m not spending quality time with my children. I’ve even missed my routines doctors appts for my medical condition. My friends tell me they’ve never seen me this unhappy. So I keep asking WHY AM I DOING THIS TO MYSELF? Why? Because I don’t want to burn bridges at work with my boss? I don’t want to appear weak? A failure in my colleagues eyes? Worried about gossips and what people will say? Then I realize, no one gives a shit. I can work myself to death tomorrow and I’ll get replaced and people will move on and forget about me in a few months. 

I have decided, I am taking some time off work to focus on bettering my physical and mental health before it gets worse. To mend my relationships with my family and friends and most importantly with myself. I need to stop putting on that act pretending everything is great and to stop internalizing everything. It’s okay to admit I need help. It’s okay to say no when you’ve had enough. It’s okay to admit this job is bit for me. 

When I return from my leave, I am requesting a transfer back to my old position so I can feel like myself again.",20Aug2020,1
65,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do.

69,"I am a 28yo man who needs some help to, like, open up. I am perceived as a robot, as someone out of this world, with almost no sense of humor, apparently no feelings whatsoever. And I know that it is somewhat the truth. How? Because when I was 21yo I wasn't like this. I would always emphatize with people, always show my feelings and I could interact with people so easily that I had many friends despite me being very shy. Now I have just those friends left from that time, and very few connections. Why? I know why. Because I couldn't take it any longer. Sometimes feelings were just too hurtful. Like when I hurt a person who was in love with me but I didn't really like and had to leave on the week of his birthday; when my mother threatened suicide through the phone; when my father was diagnosed brain cancer and after the surgery lost his mobility forever; and other events. Many things together that made me think it was easier just to bury my feelings in order to go on, as I had done for many years before my adulthood to face many challenges to difficult for a teenager. I just couldn't see any other way out, because before I would do my best to help people around me, but at that time it wasn't always up to me, there wasn't a real solution.

Now my life isn't happy nor the worst: it just is. But I don't want it this way. I want to live my life as a normal person, to make new friends and feel something real again. The problem is I don't know how, nor I have any real reason to do so to prefer feelings over this detachment, other than a desire to be a better person. Sometimes I'm even scared to get close to people, because I know how easily I might get hurt, especially lately considering my mother and sister decided to cut their bond and the same happened between two of my best friends.

I have a contact in my phone named Crazy Dude and here’s why. 

Starting about 2 years ago I would get a phone call from this guy maybe once a month or so. At first it was this:

Me: hello?

CD: Aaaayyyyyyy!

Me: who’s this?

CD: ........huh?

Me: you’ve got the wrong number.

The guys sounds like he’s on hard drugs or severely mentally disabled. I’m sure it’s the former. After maybe the 3rd time I had to put his number in my phone and started playing along to try to get something else out of him. 

Me: hello?

CD: Aayyyy

Me: WUT UP BRUH???

CD: (gibberish)

Me: Fuck yeah, where at?

CD: uhhhh (gibberish) ..... (click)

Every. Time. 

Once I was able to talk to I’m guessing his friend and it went like this:

Me: hello?

CD: Aaaayyyy!

Me: YOOOOO!
CD: ... ... ...

(Unknown): who’s this?

Me: No, who the fuck is this?

(Unknown): uhhh... My buddy called you. 

Me: Alright, well tell your friend he’s got the wrong number. 

(Unknown): haha aight...(click)

It’s didn’t stop though. 

Anyways, Crazy Dude hadn’t called in months and I was thinking he’s either dead or in jail. 

Today he called me, and even though he gave me 4 seconds of slurred gibberish before hanging up, it made me smile to know he’s not dead or locked up. 

Even after dozens of calls I’ve never actually had a conversation with this guy, but he’s become somewhat of a friend of mine.

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I’m very shy and quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing.

78,"Not just any meat - one of my chickens.

I generally eat a vegetarian diet, mostly because meat is expensive and I don't like it enough to justify the cost. But yesterday one of my flock died and I feel like it's my responsibility to consume her as a way to respect her life.

If anyone wanted to place blame for her death, it's my fault. I let the chickens out of their hutch to free-range after breakfast with the dog outside to protect them from the hawks that live in our area. I went back upstairs and at some point heard some distressed chicken noises, so I looked out the window and saw the dog and chickens in the yard - nothing seemed amiss. I figured a bird or cat had approached them and the dog chased it away. I went back to bed.

Maybe 45 minutes later, I went outside and saw my favorite chicken, drowned in the kiddie pool my roommate got for her kid. The pool is under an awning so I couldn't see it when I looked out the window. 

My roommate attempted CPR on the chicken, god bless, but she was clearly gone. So she got to work prepping her as meat, drained the blood, plucked, and processed her. We're saving her wings and preserving them for a shadowbox. 

We let the meat cure for a day in the fridge, but today or tomorrow we need to eat her. I'm honestly not looking forward to it. I feel so guilty that I didn't go outside to check when I heard the chickens acting up. I know they're just chickens, and we'll need to cull them once they stop laying, but this is my first flock and the first time I'll be eating meat I raised myself. As their caretaker, I feel strongly obligated to take responsibility by eating the chicken that died in my care.

I hope we do her justice.",20Aug2020,1

Every day is filled with anger at myself and a lack of enjoyment in anything. I get up at 7am, try to exercise bit but end up quitting after 10 minutes because I hate it, i do a bit of freelancing work that I don't even enjoy, then I mind my 18-month-old for three to six hours while my partner works at her part time job.

Sometimes I have a couple of beers in the evening but I end up feeling anxious or more depressed the next day so I try not to do it too much. But alcohol is the only thing that provides a somewhat pleasant holiday from my normal waking consciousness and its relentless dark, negative thinking.

Backstory: I got food poisoning from a meal I had when I was working at a restaurant on lunch break (1 free meal a day kinda thing).It gave me food poisoning, along with acidic vomit and reflux. This acidic vomit ended up ruining my bottom gums over night. Ruined as in, they looked like what a 50 year old smokers gums would look like. It was bizarre and not a normal thing to happen over night according to the dentists. (I’m a very healthy person btw)

Anyway, today I went in for surgery. I had gum reconstruction, all 4 wisdom teeth taken out AND a deep clean. After sitting in the chair for 2 hours, I was put into recovery. My dentist asked if I wanna see how I look - and I cried immediately. My teeth, my gums, oh man, they were brand NEW. I cried and thanked them so much. My teeth have always been my biggest insecurity since the incident. I can finally SMILE AGAIN. I can be HAPPY. 

I know this might seem so minuscule and common sense to some - But please, go get your teeth checked and cleaned. Treat those bad boys like royalty. I regret being so so scared but after years I finally had the courage and I am so excited for my next appointment! Eeeek.",20Aug2020,1

111,"I apologize in advance for the novel.

BACKGROUND: I’m 28/F and my ex-friend who I’ll call Mitch is 28/M. We’re technically cousins (our moms are related) and had been very close friends from the age of 10 (with a couple year gap that I’ll explain). I think it’s because we’re related that I’m having a hard time knowing how to process this situation; Mitch is never going to be out of my life fully because he’s still extremely close with my parents, and my parents keep expressing that they wish we would be friends again. I don’t feel like they’re ever going to drop it, based on the past: in high school I stopped speaking to Mitch for about 2 years because he said something extremely hurtful about my life choices, and my parents just kept inviting him over all the time. I eventually just let it go because I was tired of being made uncomfortable in my own home and the only solution seemed to be letting go of those feelings.

So anyway. A few years back, Mitch and I started disagreeing over politics because he supports Donald Trump and I hate Donald Trump. Our solution was to just not discuss politics with one another, save for a couple of civil conversations where one of us asked “Hey, why does your party think X or Y?” It was honestly pretty infuriating for me to see a lot of the stuff that Mitch was posting on social media, but I just ignored it because I didn’t want to rock the boat and/or start another fight within the family.

But then back at the beginning of June, Mitch posted an anti-BLM meme. It’s now relevant to mention that he is white and I am Black. So I commented telling him that I was really disappointed to see him expressing that opinion, and that sparked a long and angry conversation about BLM, white supremacy, and current politics. 

I was already incredibly fed-up with Mitch’s political opinions, but his attitude during this conversation really pushed me over the line. He was just so callous and dismissive of my feelings, and basically used the “I can’t be a racist, I’m friends with you” defense to ignore me saying that his words/actions were making me feel unsafe and unloved. So at the end of the conversation I just told him that I can’t be his friend anymore after the way he’d treated me. 

Mitch replied that I was lying if I said this was just about politics, and that the real problem is that I’m a bad friend, and then listed a bunch of ways that he feels I’ve wronged him since high school. That’s pretty much where we left off, but I’ve been hearing from mutual friends/family that Mitch has been talking shit about how I’m intolerant and small-minded and threw away a decade of friendship about politics.

I feel like I threw away the friendship over a difference of morals and a lack of respect or compassion (which I did tell Mitch). I think I was right to do so, and I don’t want someone in my life who makes me feel the way he did. I’m especially hurt by all the shots he took at me saying that I was the bad friend- most of what he said was just made up, and although I defended myself against some of it, I had to let the rest go because I was done giving Mitch my emotional energy and now I feel bad about not standing up for myself more.

But even though I think I was right to end the friendship, I’m not feeling okay about not being friends. It feels like a dark cloud hanging over my head all the time. I’m worried that my family is going to make this awkward for the rest of my life. I keep thinking about the how the conversation went and just feeling terrible that this is what Mitch thinks of me.

Maybe I just needed to get this off my chest, I dunno. If anyone made it this far, thanks for reading.",20Aug2020,1

typed on my phone, sorry for any grammar.

i remember my first time buying condoms like it was just yesterday. it was a couple years ago, when i was 16. i walked into my local pharmacy, and made sure to blend in, acting natural, and browsing around looking to spot those bad boys out. after some aimless wandering, i stumble upon what i had been looking for; dick wraps. 

trembling, i pick out a box of XL magnums. (lmao cause y’know how everyone online has a huge dick?) and walk to the register. i also wanted to be sure the lady at the desk wasnt onto me, so i grab a birthday card, as to not rise any suspicion. she rings me up, i’m avoiding eye contact. at this point of the interaction for some reason i felt the need to bring up the fact that this card and box of condoms are all part of this elaborate joke, and even went as far as to ask if i could borrow a pen,to write ‘HBD’ on the card, for buddy who doesn’t exist. she gave me a pen, and i despondently wrote “happy birthday john” reading my words aloud.

she goes “that’ll be $20”, i pay and swiftly leave. there’s no goddamned way she didn’t know they were mine, and i wasted $5 on a birthday card plan that didn’t work. looking back i hate myself lol

TLDR: went to the store for the first time to buy condoms as a teenager, bought a birthday card and played it all out as if they weren’t mine, and looking back the cashier must’ve been like “what a dumbass”",20Aug2020,1

122,"So, our landlord decided he should raise the rent by $200 a month. He claims the house is worth far more in rental fees, not that his expenses have gone up. He clearly does not put any money into the place if he doesn't have to, and it takes him months of nagging to do minimal fixes when something is broken.

We've all lost wages and have had to tighten our belts already. A couple of us have had to lose lots of work hours due to covid precautions (run a 1 degree temperature, or have sniffles from allergies? Off the schedule for two weeks! That on top of when we all caught the damn bug for real a couple months ago).

We managed to be really careful with expenses and food shopping to tighten our budget, and this will neatly eat that savings plus more. And if someone loses a job, or we have any unforeseen emergency, it will be awful.

The last thing we need is to try and find somewhere new in the middle of all this. We've only been here a year. It's horrific finding a place in our city to rent to begin with. Rents are sky high, and rental properties limited for a family of five, especially with one retired and one disabled.

So thanks, landlord. Good job. Way to show how awesome a person you are. I hope you end up in a similar position someday, so you know how it feels.

It isn't even the money that is the worst part, though that is bad - it is the callousness that someone would do this during a time when everyone should be looking out for one another.",20Aug2020,1

136,"Basically the title.

I started my freshman year of college this past year (2019) and I ended up running into this girl every so often on campus. I'll call her Sally. Sally was clearly socially awkward and would get waaaay too excited to see me (like I was a celebrity or something), which made me kind of uncomfortable but I was nice to her because I had no reason not to be. To be clear, though--I was nice to her and that was it. I didn't feel like I had a serious connection with her and I had no intentions of being friends with Sally. I just sympathized with being socially awkward and not having many friends, because I've been in that position.

My university sent us home after Spring Break and I pretty much forgot about her. To me, Sally was someone I barely knew so she wasn't someone I thought about much. It sounds rude but it's just reality.

Then, after the school year wrapped up, Sally emailed me through my school email. This was alarming to me because *I never gave her any of my contact information*. It wasn't a purposeful choice--it just wasn't something that ever occurred to me. Regardless, it was creepy and I felt like an implied boundary had been violated.

I tried to be nice and engage in high-level conversation with her, hoping that eventually the conversation would trail off, but I noticed fairly early on that Sally was making references to her financial situation in such a way that seriously made me feel like she was either a) building up to asking me for money, or b) hoping to hint to me enough that I would offer and she wouldn't have to ask. Among other things, she point-blank asked me if I ""have enough money"" and followed up by making a very conspicuous reference to not having enough money to make a tuition payment. Don't get me wrong, I felt bad and sympathized, but she's not my friend, I didn't know her too well, and I was *not* about to give her money.

I also noticed that she did not seem to be emotionally/mentally stable. I was getting a bad feeling about talking to Sally to the point where every time my phone buzzed, I'd feel dread because I worried it was an email notification from her. There were a number of things that weirded me out beyond the money comments and I was starting to feel trapped.

Eventually I tried to politely excuse myself from the email thread by saying that it's been nice talking with her and that maybe I'd see her on campus later after summer. Sally clearly got upset and said that she was hoping we'd be friends ""if it's okay with you"" (even though I was getting the impression that how I felt about this whole situation was irrelevant to her) and that she wanted to text me.

I had to shut it down then. There was no way I could continue being nice to her without giving her my phone number and that was a boundary I wasn't willing to compromise. If I gave this girl my phone number, I wasn't going to be able to get rid of her. I knew this with certainty. Anyone who has dealt with a mentally unstable individual and has gotten ""vibes"" knows what I'm talking about.

I sent her an email--firm but not mean or hostile--basically telling Sally the things she had been doing that had made me uncomfortable, why they made me uncomfortable, and that I'm sorry things had gone as far as they had. I said I would be completely in the wrong if I let this go on any further (which is true--I don't want to make her think that we're going to be besties when that's simply not the case), and that even if she hadn't made me uncomfortable, there's simply not that connection between us that's necessary to be friends. I told Sally that I was sorry, and I wished her well.

No response.

I later on mentioned Sally to a few of my friends during a Zoom call, venting my frustration about people who don't respect boundaries and won't take a hint, and I complained about the fact that I didn't know anything about Sally but she was hinting that I should give her money. I learned immediately afterwards from my friends that she was well-known for harassing other students in a particular group. This group is a merit-based program that myself and the friends I was Zoom calling are part of. Apparently she harassed one of my friends on that call in particular about getting her into that group, even though he was just a student like her and obviously had no way to get her in even if he wanted to. You have to apply and be approved by the faculty, not another student. There had been a few things during my email thread with her that told me that she wasn't quite connected to reality, but hearing this from my friends really confirmed my suspicions.

So now I had evidence that she had a pattern of behavior of harassing students, particularly those in this merit-based group. At this point, I definitely felt like I'd made the right decision in telling her to leave me alone, and the last vestiges of guilt vanished. That was back in early July.

Then, last night... I'm one of two Vice Presidents of a particular club and I was on a Zoom call with the other members of the executive board of that club. I had long ago decided to let the Sally stuff go unless/until something with her came up again, but someone else on the call mentioned someone wanting to join the club. This person had the same first name as Sally. I asked for the person's last name, and it thankfully was different from Sally's so it wasn't her. But the other officers could sense that there was something up and they asked me what the problem was. I explained briefly and they immediately knew who I was talking about. Sally went by a different name back then so they didn't realize initially the person I was concerned about.

Apparently Sally is the only person who had ever been kicked out of that club. The other board members couldn't get into specifics but apparently there was a member of the club during the 2018-2019 school year--Sally is a year ahead of me--whom Sally targeted (who was part of the merit-based group as well). Sally harassed this member and followed them to our club meetings because this was their safe space, and evidently made sexually explicit comments to this member. Sally also followed this member to other places around campus. It escalated to the point where the board members that year, three of whom are still on the board, had to make the decision to kick someone out of the club permanently for the first time. She even needed to be moved to another dorm building because of incidents like that with people. (One of the other officers also confirmed that she had harassed him about getting her into that merit-based program, like what happened to my other friend.)

I'm still kind of in shock. Clearly I need to learn to distinguish ""socially awkward"" from ""unstable and giving off bad vibes"". I dodged a fucking bullet. What the fuck is wrong with people?!

TL;DR: ""socially awkward"" girl thinks she's friends with me, hunts down my email, and has an email conversation with me. I feel uncomfortable because she's doing stuff like hinting that she wants me to give her money. Try to end the conversation and she gets upset and says she wants to text me. I tell her firmly that she needs to leave me alone. Later find out from two separate groups of friends that she's clearly unbalanced and has a history of stalking and harassing people.",20Aug2020,1
137,"After 8 years of playing you, I'm out of time and simply can't anymore, so it appears being a professional gamer was not in my future, but before I go I want to tell the world the secrets of the oh-so-mysterious mmr ladder.

It's true people can climb solo, but it doesn't represent anything more than a level of selfishness because they just cap out somewhere higher. This is because when you get to the level where you're trying to solo 5 people as good as you, you'll never win, because it's truly 1v5, not 1v5 of tacky tricks and cheap thrills: It's 5 PLAYERS against your selfish being. So, sure you can climb exploiting low bracket holes, but you're not actually playing professional dota2, which is why you'll never be pros either and you're stuck in ancient or some other tier.

This is also why there are great players in the low brackets, because these great players in the lower brackets are not trying to solo win from the beginning, they're trying to play a team game, so they cap low because in their low bracket they get players that they can't rely on because they get people who are totally new, have no ambitions to play professionally and throw because they just want to do what they want to do, or are on personal vendetta sprees after being contaminated by the toxic environment and will throw for almost any reason. These people actually trying to play also cap low because the middle bracket is filled with these selfish people who just want to exploit the holes trying to solo climb and are not actually playing dota2, and total noobs who simply averaged high because they calibrated with a high level friend.

So these are the brackets: Immortal and Divine: Actual team players

Ancient, Legend: Selfish Exploiters who will never break the gap because they aren't team players

Archon, Crusader, High Guardian: Exploiters or noobs calibrated high

G3-H3: Team players not interested in exploiting holes to climb the ladder hoping the mm will be fixed eventually so that they can get consistently real games of dota2 not filled with crying throwers.

H1&amp;2: Noobs

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an electrical engineer—My analytics and logic are of the Immortal Tier. My dota2 experience was to be calibrated at archon as a noob from my high bracket friend, descend to herald 1 over an eternity of dealing with the selfish jerks who cap at a higher bracket but will never break it because they're toxic and it just catches up with them there, climb to guardian 4 when I decided I should just play carry since I was clearly the best in the low brackets because I played so long and real winners want the ball, fall to herald 4 when I got tired of playing the same heroes and watching my higher ranked teammates getting worse in skill and getting disheartened and not wanting to try so hard to win because it's not even a real game of dota2, because once again, when you're in the pro bracket, you're not winning solo, so why are you going to try and climb by doing something (practicing something) that's not going to work later on? Perfect practice makes perfect. Playing this little game with yourself is practicing imperfectly, so that's why you can't break the higher brackets even when you get there. Everybody knows your cheap tricks, and your only way out is to become a true team player, but you're selfish and toxic and so you never will, unless you read this post and it becomes your breakthrough, but because you're selfish and toxic and you can't give credit to anybody else, it would be a paradox that you listen to me. I would like to have a team from beginning I suppose and learn expensive tricks in the immortal bracket where real teams are trying expensive tricks on each other playing real dota2.

&amp;#x200B;

So, that's what 8 years of dota2 was like, but it's time to move on. Ice Frog I recommend you stop letting people calibrate with their higher bracket friends, and I also recommend you stop letting people practice in ranked. The solution to this would be: You can't play a hero unless you have so many games or even wins with them against bots and in normal mode. This will improve the game quality of Ranked mm, which is meant to be competitive, not a playground, which will improve the toxicity of the environment as well because people won't flame at people for practicing a new hero in ranked. You're welcome.

I don't shave every day, my hair is getting too long and I don't like how I look. I have stopped caring majorly about the people in my life other than my family and my girlfriend. I haven't read anything for a while and the only exercise I can manage is a walk every couple of days. I cry often about my relationship and not being able to see my girlfriend (who lives in another country). I'm no longer trying to improve myself and will eat food when I don't need to, so I've put on a lot of weight. I am filled with negative thoughts and overthinking which is damaging my relationships. I am crying about that. I don't do things I want to do or enjoy, like developing a roblox game (which I've been trying to do for so long), making photoshops/edits or playing games I like. Even writing which the entirety of my degree is about. Even when I have shows I want to watch or books I want to read I don't. I find myself desiring to look at porn which I quit a long time ago and hate with a passion. I think negatively of myself and think that others think negatively of me also. I feel lonely even when people are there. I don't feel overly sad or anything, I'm not particularly happy either. Most of the time I'm okay, then I'll get overwhelmed emotionally and burst into tears during the night. My sleep schedule is ruined, I sleep at about 5-7 am and wake up about 3-4pm every day. This keeps me from doing anything throughout the day also. I go long lengths of time before speaking to my friends. I have become anxious of other people. I'm meant to be moving away from home and back to uni next month but even that I'm nervous about. I don't feel any excitement about seeing my friends. I know I want to but I literally don't feel anything and am frustrated. When I try and sleep before being tired my head plagues me with overthinking. I struggle to find any happiness with myself. I am forcing myself with some things but most of the time even trying seems like too much. I wouldn't describe myself as depressed but it probably looks like it. I just feel so lost, and I want things to be normal. I want to have fun with my friends and feel my girlfriend's touch. Be back at uni and feel free. It's like other than content, I can only feel negative emotions like anxiety, shame, loneliness, etc. Yes I am ashamed of who I am right now, and I don't love this person who isn't me. I don't know how other people could. I don't feel suicidal or have any desire to harm myself I just feel so tired. I want to sleep and wake up being who I was in March. I want to be in March.

I was confident in myself before, I considered myself pretty attractive and liked who I was. I had some social issues but that has always been the case. I would do things I enjoyed, I even wrote fairly frequently. My relationship with my girlfriend was more stable too. I was so happy. I slept pretty okay (minus the times I went out, I am an undergraduate after all) and even worked out. I did waste my money on pre-made food too much though. Now I have basically no drive. The few times I feel better is when someone comforts me or I cry my eyes out until I'm tired. Who I am right now is a pathetic loser. That is how I would describe them and how I feel. I feel like it wouldn't matter if the person I am died, who would miss them? I want to be myself again. I want to see my friends and my girlfriend and be attractive.

now, here’s my question. are my problems valid? sometimes, i feel like im wasting my therapist’s time because i know a lot of other people struggle with this too so is it just how the human brain works? my mom told me that she doesn’t take my “depression” seriously because she said i’ll grow out of it. she also talked about how hard other people have it right now especially because of the pandemic which is causing people to lose their jobs and all. and i know im privileged, i do. i know that i’m able to have an education, buy the things i want, eat good food, travel to places, and all those things... so are my body insecurities stupid? is it dumb that i just want to look at myself in the mirror for once and see someone that looks pretty? is it so bad i want to be able to take pictures and feel like hey i should post this on instagram i look good! is it so bad i want to be able to take goofy selfies and send them to my friends? am i an idiot for wanting to go clothes shopping and not having to worry and feel embarrassed about clothes not fitting me and wear cute fits like any other teenage girl instead of wearing the same 5 outfits? i just want to know what you guys think because im at a loss. thank you.",20Aug2020,1
158,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘this is brilliant news, very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",20Aug2020,1
159,"Don't ask me if I have  change for $5 , $10 , or $ 20 . For all you know , I could have have a stack ($ 1k ) on me the moment you ask me , but guess what ?? I don't care .  The answer  I'm always going to give you  is one of or a combination of  the following : ""I don't carry cash "" ; "" I don't use Cashapp or Venmo"" ; or simply , "" I don't  have cash "". 

If you and I have nothing more than just a strictly casual relationship , don't ask me for money at any time , for any  reason.Period. I don't know you , I don't want to get to know you . You're  getting NOTHING from me . I don't trust you or know your intentions. Nobody hurt me , I just generally find it annoying when people ask me , and I don't like being asked the question. Nothing more , nothing less .",20Aug2020,1
