0,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence / :",26May2020,1
1,"I hope all is well at your end.

I write this post today as I need desperate help. Im 19. A few months ago due to misconceptions by my parents I tried to get myself emancipated. As our Dean was witness to to the attempts made on abducting me from my dorms, and trying to discontinue my education, he offered to help out with the process. However, a few days later I was tracked down and manipulated into coming to Saudi Arabia with my family. Things aren’t good here. I’ve never felt this disenfranchised in my own home. They took my passport immediately and it’s been over 5 months and I can’t protect myself from it all anymore as things escalate pretty fast. They don’t plan on allowing me to pursue my education again. It’s all nothing compared to the agony every day gets with it, with constant emotional and mental abuse almost daily. I’ve worked really hard to get in with a full scholarship, and when I did they didn’t like me going away to study. But it’s been 6 months since they brought me if I don’t make it my student visa will expire and I’ll lose my scholarship it’s the only place I can go to and my only shot at education. 

My phone is directly linked to my brothers and checked at all times and the room they’ve kept me in has a device through which they listen to everything I say and do with anyone whatsoever. Hence, I’m unable to reach out to anyone else. My family has contacts here and so I doubt if reaching out to the embassy will work. I know how things escalate from here. They threaten to hit me and If they don’t choose to or marry me off they might resort to doing much worse. I don’t know what they’re capable of anymore. They think I did unimaginable things and I begged them to get me medically checked but they won’t. My batchmates, who witnessed my brother trying to attack me want to do something but are just as confused as I am. I don’t know how much time I have access to communication until. It’s been almost 6 months since I’ve been in this room. I miss the sun. My university is unable to reach me with clarity as everything is tapped and cannot do much as I am without my passport. I reach out right now with great difficulty and I don’t know what to hope out of it but I know that I don’t want it all to end the way it may.

It’s a circle. If I don’t get out, someday my children won’t be able to either. I believe it to be a basic human right to be able to educate ourselves, to be able to get married when we want to, and to leave when we want to. It cannot and should not be a luxury. They may take away all means of communication soon, so I might never have a chance to reach out before I lose everything. If I can’t escape now I’ll never be able to escape. If I somehow get the opportunity to return to my university and get emancipation I will work twice as hard to get by and give back someday. As someone genuinely afraid of never being able to escape all that this place brought to her since months now, I reach out here in hopes to gain some clarity on what can be done through this tightly speculated environment and buy myself some time.  

I can’t approach any organization here as I’ll have to file for an investigation and if that happens they’ll beat me up really badly or kill me. Please. Help me. It’s been nearly 6 months since this confinement please.",26May2020,1
2,"I’m a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 

Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again",26May2020,1
3,"I have made many mistakes in my life. Many of which I regret. I'm simply a regretful person. I hate some of the things I did and choices I made. But at the same time, I am also a very positive person who tries to spread the best of vibes that I can and get involved in absolutely zero drama. I try to be that person that nobody wouldn't want to be friends with, so when people don't want to be or stop being friends with me for whatever reason, I really take it to heart. And it hurts. It makes me feel like I have failed. I wish I didn't dwell on my mistakes so much, but it's just how I am I suppose.

I'm just putting this out there though to say, I just want to help people and I do not want to hurt anybody. I'm always the person that will try to make amends in any situation, even if it doesn't involve me. I hate when people get mad at me. I hate feeling like I made a mistake, and I especially hate having to deal with the consequences that come with making that mistake.

I just want everybody to know, I'm in it for nothing but positivity, anything but drama and good, easygoing vibes. I'm sorry to anybody I have ever hurt, or to anybody I made think I was a genuine person only for me to do something stupid that makes me seem like I'm not. I'm trying to better myself every day, all while making everybody else happy. And I know that pleasing everyone is an impossibility, but if anything it's just a bad habit of mine. And I'm not going to lie, it gets exhausting. I'm at a point where I don't really know what to do or think or am supposed to feel anymore. I'm not saying I'm giving up by any means, but I just need to get this off my chest.

Sorry we couldn't be friends. I would have loved to continue to make you smile every single day, laugh with you and build a relationship with you, but I made one tiny mistake and now you don't fuck with me anymore in any way shape or form nor want to ever again. I guess you could say that's your loss, but, if that mistake I made was that bad, no matter how tiny, and had that effect on you, then is it really your loss? That's basically my thought process.

Maybe one day I'll figure this stuff out, but for now, that's all I have to say.",26May2020,1

Still trying to get the political B.S. from what I understand. We vote for people who suppose to represent our interests. Now if these public servants have a life style a thousand times better then 90 percent of the people they serve. Seems to me like it’s there interest they are serving.

5,"Probably not the update anyone (me especially) wanted, but fuck it, I felt like the original post warranted one. Basically, the plan we had to to meet up on Sunday which was when I planned to ask her out fell through; her final college deadlines got announced and she found herself with a shit ton of work to do, plus the weather was pretty shitty, so we both agreed we’d just meet up sometime this week after her work was finished and she had more time. I didn’t feel the need to rush; I’d get to ask her eventually, I was a little disappointed I wouldn’t get to see her as soon as I thought but it wasn’t too big of a deal, people have lives.

Anyway, we were still talking like normal after that, nothing different. We had our weekly drunken zoom call with our friends, and while usually the two of us are joking around like hell with each other and having a good time, she seemed kind of off. We were still joking around, but it felt forced like her mind was elsewhere, and eventually she ended up just like uncharacteristically quiet. I messaged her asking if she was okay, and she said I was sweet for asking but she’s just really tired. She ended up going off early, and even though I didn’t say anything to the rest of my friends about it, they all instantly said on their own that she seemed pretty down about something, or at least she wasn’t herself, definitely not just tired. I just kind of stayed quiet about it, but I knew something was off.

The next day, she didn’t message me like she usually does. I think that’s been 3 weeks or 4 weeks we’ve messaged each other every day, and mostly every other day for a month or two before that, so it was a little weird. But again, I knew she was busy with her work and all that shit, and she probably was pretty exhausted from it, so no big deal. I sent her a funny meme or two over the last couple of days, but she just kind of hit me with really dry responses to them, no attempt at a conversation, but the thing is she was really talkative with everyone else in our friend’s group chat. It was like she just couldn’t be bothered with me in particular. Now I felt like there was like something off a little bit, but I didn’t dwell on it, I just thought I’d give her some space.

So for the last couple of days we haven’t spoke all that much at all, and tonight I saw on her instagram story that she’s having like a FaceTime movie night with that guy she’s been speaking to, which kind of screams to me ‘we’re basically gonna start dating any second now’. I didn’t realise they’d hit the ‘couple’s movie night’ stage lmfao. So it seems to me, sadly, it’s game over man. I mean, cancelling our plans to meet up, acting a little weird and off when we’re speaking to the point our friends noticed, not messaging me at all like she’s trying to distance herself, and then seeing that on her Instagram story when she didn’t seem to have time to even shoot me a message back the last few days cause she’s been busy? Yeah, I think it’s pretty obvious where her heart is set lmfao.

Obviously I’m pretty crushed about it, but what can you do? I’m not gonna act any different with her, I still get along great with her and I’m sure we always will, and I’m obviously not gonna hold it against her, but fuck man. I really think there was something there and I can’t help but feel I really fucking blew it and let her slip away. I’m gonna beat myself up about it a shit ton no doubt, but I’ve got like no choice but to move on at this point; I’m gonna take the hint and not message her first, and if she doesn’t reach out then I guess I’ll know for sure that it’s kind of done. We still technically need to meet up for her to give me the prize I won from our stupid bet, but at this point if she brings it up I might just tell her not to worry about it, and I definitely don’t see any point in asking her out if I do see her. I feel like it would just upset what she’s got going on with this other guy, and I feel like she’s sending pretty clear signals that it’s not gonna happen between us and I’ve just got to respect it man. I just keep thinking though, if we hadn’t cancelled that plan to meet up and I’d caught her just before things seemed weird between us and more serious with them, maybe things would have turned out different. Definitely gonna hurt to think about for a little while lmfao.",26May2020,1
6,"The sub /r/anime_titties is the bold child of the rotten /r/worldpolitics, i.e a sub to talk about non-US related politcs on Reddit. Most of you don't realize how US-centered Reddit is, and I really enjoyed the sub since it was something different than ""Trump bad/China bad"" and really focused of politics events all over the world I've never heard of.

Still, it took very little time for the sub to be ruined by the US politics and by the usual propagandists roaming on these forums. Here is just an extract of the most popular posts of the sub right now:

* ""**Taiwan vows 'necessary assistance' to Hong Kong residents**"" *&lt;- an obsessional US foreign policy topic*
* ""**China said Sunday that relations with the United States were ""on the brink of a new Cold War"", fueled in part by tensions over the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 350,000 people worldwide and pitched the global economy into a massive downturn**"" *&lt;- not even trying to be subtle, the source is french but still*
* ""**Costa Rica to declare same sex marriage legal**"" *&lt;- ok that's legit*
* ""**Mexicans Are 'Building A Wall' To Keep American-COVID-Carriers Out**"" *&lt;- aka US politics*
* ""**Israel's Netanyahu Says He Won't Miss West Bank Annexation Opportunity**"" *&lt;- seems quite neutral and non-US based POV so ok*
* ""**Canadians Want The U.S. Border Closed For Longer During Pandemic**"" *&lt;- still US politics*
* ""**Afghanistan frees first group of Taliban prisoners in response to ceasefire**"" *&lt;- a war lead by NATO and the US but ok, legit, I'm feeling generous*
* ""**Israeli leader vows to push ahead annexing West Bank**"" *&lt;- same as before so still legit*
* ""**What Nepal’s New Aggression Reveals For India And Its Neighbours**"" *&lt;- actually the content I'm looking for on this sub*
* ""**Former Hong Kong governor: China's proposed national security law should be on G7 agenda**"" &lt;- *US obsession for Hong-Kong*
* ""**Standing up to a Bully: Border Standoff is China’s Single-Minded Attempt to Block India’s Economic Rise**"" *&lt;- may be legit but may be US obsession for China so... I'm not sure*
* ""**EU needs ‘more robust’ China strategy, says bloc’s chief diplomat**"" *&lt;- China, you again*
* ""**Suriname’s President Shrugs Off Murder Sentence in Re-election Bid**"" *&lt;- nice content actually*
* ""**U.S. prepared to spend Russia, China 'into oblivion' to win nuclear arms race: U.S. envoy**"" *&lt;- US politics again*
* ""**Russia seeks 18-year jail term for ex-U.S. Marine accused of spying**"" *&lt;- still US politics*

The question is about the content itself, not its validity. While most of these news articles may be accurate at some point, they are posted and upvoted on the sub because they are the current obsession in the United States right now. Exactly what the sub tried to avoid in the first place.

I'm not sure if this posting is organized at some point, or if it's just the consequence of the inability of the US users to stop being self-centered for 10 fucking minutes. If I want to hear about the latest Chinese atrocities I would just visit /r/politics, this sub was different on many points and I feel like you ruined it.

7,"Halted my education in Computer Science because I landed a job that I thought I wanted.

2 years later, my current job isn't what I wanted it to be, so I desperately want to go back to school and work toward my dream job again.

I feel stuck because my single mother got me a car and was helping out on the payment, but now that I'm working I pay for it now ($400 a month). I have no idea how I'm supposed to pay for this when I want to go back to school full time. I also pay for my phone bill.

I answer calls at a helpdesk and work tickets, so working part-time isn't really an option for day to day tasks. I want to leave and start programming again. I try learning up on it after work, but after a typical 9 to 5 I'm completely drained. I can't even force myself to play video games anymore. I'm not sure what specific aspect is affecting me the most, but I can't function like this anymore.

12,"(23F) I dont know how much more of this I can take. 

Since the beginning of this year:

Had to transfer jobs and move into a house I despise. 

My cat of 10 years whom I rased from a kitten had to be put down and died in my arms. 

Got covid-19 from my essential retail job. Absolutley exhausted and hardly able to do anything but sleep. Everything hurt. Couldnt taste or smell. Fever of 101 almost the whole time.

Recovered from a month of having Covid, started back to work at the beginning of this month only to find my job changed completely and now kills my body. 

Made breakthroughs with my therapist which made me relive and realise more trauma from years of child abuse at the hands of a pedophile. Causing more panic attacks and ptsd. 

Car broke down, had to get it fixed. 

Brother lost his job and pays 1/3rd of our rent. Wont get another one. 

Basement flooded at 12 am after our washing mashine decided to break. 

Thought about letting my car drift into traffic so id die. Decided hurting someone else to kill myself would be incredibly selfish. Talked to my therapist about it and got a little better. 

Boyfriend got hired at my work and unknowingly took the full time position I was aiming for. Not blaming him because he needed it and they didnt tell him were hed be but it does suck for me. 

Had a panic attack at work infront of god and everyone, left and ended up at a pier 50 minutes away where I sat in the cold for about 2 hours just staring at the water. 

Realized we will have to move back into my parents house they were going to sell and take over that mortgage because we cant stay here and we dont have money for another deposit.

Lost a family friend whos been with my family for 23 years. 

And to add the icing to the shitty cake that is my life. My father told me today that my parents are now getting divorced!!! My parents who have been together my entire life. Separating completely amicably and as best friends but divorcing nonetheless. .

Oh also on the way home from that my boyfriends cars transmissions decided to begin to leak and now needs serious emergency care so I will have to wake up on my day off tomorrow and drive him in then drive back home and take his car to the shop and then walk half a mile back so I can drive 40 minutes to the vet to pick up medication for my 2 year old cat.

AND then his office chair broke so I told him to take mine so hed stop freaking out and now I have no chair. 

I know this sounds like complaining and first world problems or whatever. Its just all too much all at once. I feel like every good action I take in my life incurs 17 horrible things to happen to me. At this point Im just shrugging with tears in my eyes saying ""Well this might as well happen""",26May2020,1

It's like the universe threw me the perfect person, someone who could absolutely finish me and be everything I could need in life, only to taunt me by making her not feel the same way. It's even worse when I feel little attraction to most people and the fact that's it's super difficult for me to be close friends with someone. I know that someday I might find someone, but for now I have nothing. It's getting really annoying crying myself to sleep most nights because the dreams I have with her are impossible to achieve, and it's only made more difficult by the fact that she's one of my best friends so almost every day I'm reminded of what I can't have. I love the way our friendship is, but there's still that little part of me that thinks about what could have happened. When will I be allowed to feel love? When will I be allowed to love again? I'm scared to let go all the way because it would mean giving up on the first (and only) person I've ever loved. I'm also tired of constantly second guessing this stuff. Quarantine hasn't really helped because she hates texting in general, so I don't get to talk to her one on one most days (which is quite nice - when I'm with her this all goes away. It's only when I'm alone that I start to think and wonder). For example, I'll send her a message on discord where I *know* she's online, and she won't respond. She's told me that she doesn't feel compelled to respond most of the time (not because she doesn't like me, but because she just doesn't text much), but it still messed with my head. It goes from this to calling her for 9 hours straight. I just can't deal with the ups and downs anymore. I suppose I'm lonely until further notice. I'm just so scared that I'll never be able to find someone like her; I'm attracted to very, very few things and it's so rare to find someone that even comes close. I'm just sad.",26May2020,1

I’m feeling a lot better now, more myself, seeing that that relationship wasn’t good for me and I’m glad it’s over. 

But I still want to talk to my friends about it and vent all my problems and that. The problem is that my best friend who I would normally go to is having a pretty rough time at the moment, so I’m trying to more be there for her than lay my problems at her feet and add to it all. 

But my other close friends I’d go to are also having a tough time that I don’t want to add to at the moment. And on top of that they’re friends with my ex, so I don’t want to go telling them all the slightly irrational, horrible things that I’m unfairly mad at my ex for at the moment. Because I don’t want to ruin her friendships. Because even though I’m mad at her I know she’s not a bad person and doesn’t deserve that.

31,"Sup peeps, funny story, 

Today I woke up to a notification sent around 3am about my main account being banned for 3 days. Reason they stated? “Manipulating Reddit’s voting system” I got the exact same notification on my porn account. 

Thing is, I’ve never even so much as looked at the same subs on the accounts because that’s kinda the point with a “porn account” emphasis on the “PORN” part. You know, normal subs on my main account, porn subs on porn account? Etc. So they’ve never even done so much as comment on the same post. 

ANYWAYS it’s a pain in the ass disputing these types of things with corporations (just ask amazon last time it happened) so fuck it, starting a new account. 

Name suggestions? I have this username I use on all my gaming accounts modified to have some Greek letters but said Greek letters aren’t allowed on the usernames thing so without the Greek characters it just looks plain (because English is the only language in the planet right?)

35,"This is a throwaway for soon to be obvious reasons. On mobile, scattered as all hell, etc. My apologies on shitty grammar/formatting. TLDR at the bottom. 

Background, bullet point style. 
- Fiance and I recovering drug addicts, doing really well.
- FDA cuts supply of the maintenance drug he was on to our area, pharmacy neglects to mention it until it's time for a refill (i.e. he was out.)
- Tries his best to find another way, but no other pharmacy will take his script because his doctor is a shady SOB, ends up relapsing. 
- I don't like heroin, but have a past with it and have a really hard staying sober when someone is using in front of me. Relapse with him.
- Overdose at work, almost die, he saves me with Narcan. By the time the paramedics got there my blood oxygen level was at like 20%.
- Keep going because withdrawls. 
- Family member dies from accidental OD less than 72 hours later. Young kid, got a dirty bar. Last fucking person in the world who deserves it.
- Usual bullshit: constant fighting, car window broken out in the hood, dangerous situations, etc. 
- OD again, almost die again, he saves me again, like 2 weeks after the first time. 
- We'd been living with my mom and she had a breakdown (severe, undiagnosed mental health issues), she got violent and kicked us out. In the middle of a pandemic, knowing we had nowhere to go and that he was coming off his meds (but completely unaware of our smack use), like 2 days before his birthday. Over something she thought he said, couldn't quote, and he legitimately didn't say because he was walking into the room with me when it supposedly happened. I would have heard it. 
- Live out of car until friend takes us in. I want to stop but he has a much harder time than I do. 
- Cue fighting and pretty severe self harm and suicidal ideation from me.
- Call his dad, intervention. Both of us now have 5 days off smack. Woooh! But I feel like a horses ass and I'm an emotional wreck and it's going to be a slow road from here. 

Anywho, today. I get a call from someone claiming to be from publishers clearing house saying I'd won a prize and they were on the way to my house. (Red flags all through this, but I'm not in my right mind right now and I'm just so desperate for something to go right I let him lead me on for like 30min.) I was so skeptical and repeatedly cried to this scammer about how I was homeless and broke and just had the worst month of my life so please don't been messing with me, but he was relentless. 

Like, how can you sleep at night trying to steal from someone who has next to nothing? How can you lie over and over and over again, pulling God and blessings and such into it, knowing you're targeting people already at or below the poverty line, then be able to look in the mirror? 

I am far far far from perfect, but even at the lowest points of my addiction I never stole from individual people. It blows my mind. 

I feel stupid. I feel desperate. But most of all I feel sad. Sad that surviving is directly dependent on something hoarded by such a tiny fraction of the earth's population; that because of this inequality people will fully discard their regard for human life and wellness. Sad that as this world keeps getting worse, even more people are going to be dealing with the same demons I do, and even more people will set out to prey on the vulnerable.

Positive note: while I'm sure it's a burner, he called me back without hiding the number after I hung up on him. To whom should I report him? Revenge is best served cold and holding cells are freezing. 

TLDR: Shittiest month possibly ever. Get hit by scammer. He leads me on for like 30min because I'm so desperate for something good to happen. He is relentless despite me crying to him about how terrible things are for me right now. I snap out of it and chew him out, gonna report it.

Also tw for self harm and suicidal thoughts 

I (19f) have had a bit of a rough start to my life. I have a condition that essentially causes my body to be in pain 24/7, there isn’t really a cause, and it isn’t damaging my body, but there’s no real cure. I’ve been fortunate enough to receive some amazing treatment, but even then it can’t erase the emotional scars that this condition has given me. I was undiagnosed for about 3 years, and within that time frame I also lost 2 family members to cancer, had my only sibling arrested and he has gone into a depression/ anxiety spiral, and on top of that my family’s only breadwinner lost his job twice, and we came fairly close to having to sell our home in order to pay my medical bills. 

Because of all of this, I’ve developed a sort of complex to where I just feel like absolute crap about myself, and that I am only a burden and am clearly just meant to live a life of pain 

The really only bright spot in my life right now is my boyfriend 

We began dating just after all of this ended, so he never had to be a part of any of the active stuff happening in my life, but during that rough period I held in all my emotions and just tried to push through it. After everything began to calm down though, that’s when my depression hit hard. I had just started dating my boyfriend about a month before, and I started to really harm myself and came closer to committing suicide than I’d rather admit. My (then) 17, almost 18 year old boyfriend pulled me off the ledge and has helped stabilize my life. 

I can’t begin to express how much I love him, and how he has saved me (also yes I know we’re young and some people won’t feel our relationship is valid, but because of what I have experienced, I am very mature for my age, and he’s just very mature in general) but I know that I want a life with this man and I can’t imagine my life without him. 

But in comparison, his life has been fairly uneventful. His family is very well off (his dad is a doctor and is head of his department at a major hospital) and he has several siblings and strong family relationships.

We’ve been dating two years now, and I feel like I am only dragging him into a life in which he’ll experience more chaos and issues than he would otherwise. He’s attractive, kind, smart and funny, and even though he’s only a year into college, he’s had two major internships (like these internships are reserved for graduate level students) and just would have no issue finding a relationship 

So why the fuck would he date a mess like me 

I get the whole “I’m special to him thing” and I know it’s just my anxiety talking, but I’m so scared he’ll leave, but I’m even more terrified I’m going to ruin his life

Any advice on how to quell these feelings? Or maybe do y’all think maybe I should let him go find someone who won’t bring this depression and medical chaos into his life? We’re young so I know he’d find someone and he’d be happy, but I love him so much and just the thought makes me want to sob.",26May2020,1

49,"Busy-ness or being busy is more than what you think it is. Here are a few counterintuitive thoughts.

Being busy all the time is like having a myopic view. It doesn’t let us look far enough. We get so involved working that we forget to give our efforts a direction. Sometimes just putting out fires, not doing what actually drives progress. 

&gt;Bob Hawke put it the best, “Things which are the most important, never scream the loudest”. 

We could be using it as an excuse. An excuse to avoid certain things. Cooking stories to support it. 

It can become a matter of pride. The state of being occupied, giving us a feeling of importance. Only fueling our egos. 

On the contrary, what it actually shows is that we have no control over our time, our priorities, or our life. We’re probably micro-managing or not handling it well. What we might need is help. We must swallow the pride and go ask for help. 

If what we do is vital to us, then carrying on this way is doing a disservice to our purpose. The above is nothing but our obsession for **struggle porn**. 

Busy-ness can also be misleading. It can create the illusion of being productive. But often, productivity and work don’t have a direct relation with it. We could merely be filling ourselves up with the **non-essential**.  

Lastly, we could be punishing ourselves being busy. Acting out of guilt, rather than rationality. But more on that later. 

Often whenever busy-ness attacks it in a combination of the above thoughts. Proving to be a more significant **obstacle**.",26May2020,1

52,"My new mantra: Today I will not poison my body and my mind. Instead, today I will nourish my body and my mind. 

Alcohol is my gateway to falling deeper into my depression. When I feel like I need a drink, I need to write down WHY I need that drink. And to keep questioning why. 

Why I Need That Drink 5/25/2020:

Because [John Doe] hurt me.

Why did it hurt so bad? I only was with him for 4 months, I wasn’t seriously invested. We had a lot of differences even. Why did it hurt so bad?

Because I dropped my defenses and I was affectionate and caring and empathetic and patient with him, while he was just mirroring my own personality and being manipulative. While he was playing me. I showed him complete and total empathy and kind and gentle and nurturing through my affections and I never get vulnerable enough to do that. And I did it because he made me feel safe enough to let my guard down and be affectionate. I would talk about being in a relationship and he never shut the idea down, he entertained it even, not until the bomb dropped that he was in a whole other long term pseudo relationship with another woman that he was hiding from me. He kept telling me he was busy with work and his son, when he was just too busy to have two girlfriends. 

He never wanted me for more than sex and someone to vent to, but he assured me that he did want more. He said it in plain, precise language. We had sex more affectionate than I’ve ever had with anyone, and I held myself while I sheepishly asked him if that was all he wanted from me after it was over. And he told me no. He told me he wanted more. And for once I wasn’t being treated like I was only worth what someone could get from me. For once someone wanted me for me. And then he held me all night and we fell asleep together. It was the first thing I had asked and it gave me hope. And he made me feel like my love was safe with him.

And what hurt was to not only have that hope ripped from my hands, but to be lied to unknowingly for all that time, and then for that to be revealed to me not even by his own mouth, and to be humiliated and pushed to the ground in the process, and then invalidated, made to feel worthless, and suddenly in a position where I was second best, like always. But this time I wasn’t given any notice that I was. I was sidelined, and was delivered the news on a random morning through a vicious text by a woman who felt triumph over “winning” him in favor of him choosing me, and then rubbed it in my face and demeaned my worth to nothing. When I never even knew she existed. And I think what hurts the most is that I don’t know why these things happen to me. I don’t know why I’m always not good enough. Not wanted. Not lovable. And why it is that *every single time* I get back on my feet, and try to reach out, no matter how cautious I am, no matter how many different approaches I take, no matter how many preventative measures I take, somehow I am always shot back down. And even when I feel secure in it, even just for once, the rug is always pulled out from beneath me. And it becomes an option of either trying again to open up and accept others in and get vulnerable, or to close myself off totally, and don’t put the opportunity on the table so It’s a guarantee that I don’t get hurt. 

I’ve always felt like I wanted to hide myself away from the world. Like I wanted to be shrunken into a spec, so that no one would ever notice my existence. And I’ve always felt like I wanted to run, run far far away but never knew what from, or where to.

And life has always felt so UNFAIR. Like everyone else gets to have good things happen to them and I NEVER do. Like it’s somehow written in the stars. Because I can try so hard, I can try so hard to be a good person, to be humble, and patient, and self reflecting, and open minded, and kind and generous and loving empathetic and accepting, and try so hard to be the type of person that I believe wouldn’t deserve to suffer. And I get back on my feet and I settle back into being the generous person I’ve worked so hard to become. And then I take my chances and I open up and I do so hopefully and happily and then I’m shot right the fuck back down. 

And I’ve never been able to figure out what I did wrong. What I did to deserve never being shown any love by my parents and to be treated like I was nothing, like I was worthless. What I did to deserve to be treated like trash in comparison to my cousins when CPS put my brother and I in my aunt’s home. What I did to always be the scapegoat. What I did to be called a n-gger by my own mother. To be told she wished she’d aborted me and that she wouldn’t care if I died in a ditch with a needle in my arm. 

What I did to never be deserving of kindness or support or uplifting or guidance. 

What I did to always be second best. To never be worth it to someone. To never be the person that someone pines after for more than just my body. To never be someone who was someone’s first choice. To never even be shown affection. To just always be told that I’m stupid for even thinking I would be worth that. And then having to pick myself back up from the rubble, alone. Every time. And I don’t even know what love feels like. 

I’ve never known what it feels like. It’s like I get these little glimpses that are just right outside of my grasp and then as soon as I go to touch them they disappear into dust. And I imagine what life must be like for other people. Just for ONCE, to be able to lean on someone, anyone, and them welcome it with open arms, like I do for everyone else. Just for ONCE to know what it feels like to be loved by a parent. Just for ONCE to be able to feel wanted and safe and just for ONCE to not feel like the word love is like some kind of acid on my tongue, where I’m too afraid to even speak it because it holds so much weight and too much potential to fall right through my grip. And not even the romantic infatuation type of love. I just want the love that it takes to be reassured that I’m not worthless, or to be texted first, or to be complimented out of the blue. It holds all the weight to crush everything that I am and everything that I’ve built myself into. Just for once to feel like I’m not so alone. Like I am *something* to someone. To anyone. To not feel ashamed for wanting that. And to not feel small and insignificant. And to not feel like I’ve never known anything but. 

Just for once to feel wanted. And to feel like I’m a human. And to not feel like I’m just some bland piece of trash on the floor that should be expected to be kicked around. To not feel like I’m stupid for wanting to be kissed, or for wanting to be hugged, or wanting to be shown that someone cares, or wanting to feel safe or wanting to be able to be vulnerable with someone who won’t use my trauma to their advantage.",26May2020,1

I used to have a twitter account but I had to delete it recently because the amount of posts about sex was really overwhelming. I would scroll down my feed and 90% of it would be something sexual or basically porn. It’s also really disappointing to me how much sex is basically put on a pedestal. I know sex is an important human need/desire but it’s not the best thing in the world. A real emotional and mental connection with someone would probably be more rewarding.

2. A lot of people seem to be anti-men. I see a lot of posts from people that talk badly about men or about all the horrible things all men seem to do or how women are victims, etc. I honestly think it’s bullshit. Women can be just as terrible as men. I’m all for empowering women and fighting for women’s rights but there are better ways to go about it without having to drag the opposite gender into the dirt or disregard them all together. Ideally, we would all be working towards real equality where everybody is treated the same regardless of gender and we don’t have any more gender-specific stereotypes. 

3. People would do anything for clout. There was once a trend where a group of people would stand in the circle and throw something in the air to see who would get hit. That was honestly pretty dangerous. There was this small trend where people were licking toilets. Basically, a lot of people would do ridiculous things for validation from random strangers on the internet and it’s kind of alarming to me.

60,"Yeah this is a novel and no one probably read it but just needed to rant about stuff. 

When I was a kid I moved around a lot and while I always had people I got along with and was friendly with people I’ve never really had a best friend. I met a girl when I was young who I really liked and we ended up getting married and  for the 12 years we were married I mostly hung out with her and our daughter. I of course had friends that I would grab a drink with and spend time with but I not a best friend. When I did  hang out with people it was mostly me and my wife going to dinner with other couples or if my wife wasn’t there it was like happy hour at the bar type of thing. Not really emotionally invested. Basically I enjoyed hanging around them but if I never saw them again it wouldn’t bother me. 

About 4 years ago I was divorced from my wife and my daughter lived with her. Basically the only two people I’ve ever been really close to weren’t in my life constantly. I have my daughter on weekends and our relationship is still close but of course she is a 14 year old girl and she doesn’t wanted to hang out with her dad all day like we did when she was younger. 

After the divorce with her mother we were always nice and civil with each other and occasionally we will talk to each other on the phone. We aren’t enemies and the relationship wasn’t ended because of some terrible thing like abuse or someone cheating. We generally just grew apart. We stopped doing the little things that you do to make a relationship work and the things that we used to like or at least tolerate about each other became things that we just didn’t like or flat out hated. We weren’t compatible anymore in a romantic way. 

I feel like after the divorce I suddenly didn’t have anyone there to talk to. One of the things I loved about living with my family is how close we were. I used to sit with my wife and have coffee and we would talk for hours. Right up until the end we still did that, it is the one thing that always remained fun. We still talk randomly sometimes on the phone and even though we are divorced we can still be on the phone for an hour or two, normally the call ends when one of us says something and the other gets mad and we sort of start to argue, which was a big reason for our divorce. Now if I sense an argument coming on I end the call before it can start or escalate. We are not married anymore there is no use spending time on negativity or waste energy arguing. When we were married and lived together we couldn’t just end the call and cool off, talk about next month. We were stuck together and had to see each other everyday. 

Recently I’ve been thinking about my friends, and there is no one I can talk to about things past a superficial level like bar talk with the guys. I was thinking about why that is and I’ve realized that it is my own fault. I don’t let people in enough for our friendship to get to that level. I don’t really feel comfortable talking to guys about personal things and I wouldn’t want a girl as a “best” friend because I know for me personally I can’t be in a strictly platonic friendship with a girl past a basic level because eventually I’ll probably catch feels which would end the friendship. I don’t want a relationship. I was in one from 14-28 years old. I don’t need that right now. It might be to do with the fact that I was raised by a single mother and she was the only people I was close to since like I mentioned we moved a lot. She had boyfriends (some long term 1-2 years) that would come into my life but eventually they would all leave so I stopped trying to be close to them since than I wouldn’t care when they just left one day. 

I honestly don’t feel bad that I don’t have people beyond my family that I’m close to. I prefer it since I have introverted tendencies. I’m alone most of the time. I work from home so I don’t have any one around me all day besides my two roommates who I get along with but I’m not particularly close to. They work all day and I just stay in my room. We wouldn’t hang out with each other if we didn’t live together. We are great as roommates since we are compatible.For  example the foods I like they don’t really like and the foods they like I don’t really like so no one is at risk of having their food stolen. We respect each other’s private spaces and keep the house clean. things that you would look for in a roommate. 

The thing is I kind of just need someone to talk to that isn’t a therapist since I don’t want to talk to someone who I’m paying to listen to me. Like yes, it’s their career but realistically they don’t care at all about what I’m saying. I also feel like I am bothering someone by talking about personal things. At the same time I want to talk to someone who chooses to talk to me or listen to me but I’m too guarded to be able to do that and probably too selfish to be able to return the gesture. I figured I’d hop on Reddit and just rant, even if no one sees it or has the patience to read this novel. At least it was therapeutic typing it out.",26May2020,1

Hey guys

So I have a few problems in my life and I don't know how to get over these things.

1.. I don't know how to Express my feelings.

2. I can't tell my Mom that I love her and that I'm thankful for all the things she's done for me.

3. I hate the fact that I always have to act different when going to a family dinner or similar events.

4. I can't speak up for myself. If there is anything that's bothering me I'll always keep it to myself. ( scared of hurting other feelings )

5. I'm scared to talk to my boss at work. He's a really cool dude but still I don't know how to talk to him.

6. I always put other people over me. Everyone is always more important then me.

7. I don't want to buy things for myself. I bought my GF a iPhone and a Mac but when she bought me Tekken 7 and a headset I went to the shop to bring it back because it's to expensive.

8. I dont know what my passion is. I love doing a lot of things and my interest spreads on everything but I never really stick to something

9. I can't really talk to some people like my mom, strangers, my mother-in-law. My girlfriend always forces me to speak but I actually don't know how to.. This is one of my major problems that I have to change. When me and my GF are at my mom's house she's talking more then me and I don't think this is normal. My mom is definitely the best mom on earth but I actually never told her anything similar like this.. She deserves much more love from my side.

10. I can't talk with my girlfriend when we're fighting about things. My mind just turns off everything and turns on the ""noword"" mode. In these moments I just wanna give up on everything and die EVEN if it's a small fight about some stupid bullshit but everytime we fight it hurts me so much.

11. I don't really feel like going outside to my friends because I started to see the bad side of them and I'm happier sitting at home and playing computer with my younger brother.

12. I really don't have a problem with sitting at home doing nothing but my GF wants me to go outside and be social.

13. I can't have fun at parties or events! When I'm there I feel like everybody's watching me and judging me.

I have no problem with being alone at all. I actually love it because there is noone watching or talking to me. Just me and my mind.

I don't know how I got a girlfriend but I'm really happy with her. The problem is I really want to make her happy but I need to fix some things in my life..

I smoke weed and I think that's one of the factor of these problems.

When I was a kid and did some dumb shit my mom tried to speak with me but I never said something I think this behaviour lead to the things I do nowadays.

Hope you guys can give me some advice or recommend me a good book to help myself. If I could name the problem by myself It would be easier to get things done but the problem is I don't know what the problem is. Am I depressed, anxious or just introverted? idk...

I'm 22 btw and I'm sorry for my english grammar.",26May2020,1
64,"We're 19 and have been together a year and a half. I found this thing out a week ago and I still feel shook and sickened, as he is otherwise a great person.   When he was 13, my boyfriend went to a sleepover with several boys in his grade. He learned about dry humping and they all tried it out together. Shortly after this sleepover, he recalls tickle fighting his brother who is 5 years younger and then humping  him. He said he recalls feeling it was wrong on some level at the time and did not do it again. I feel like he couldn't have been all that clueless though, as he started watching porn at 12. He said if the brother had been uncomfortable at all he would have stopped, it was a once off, it lasted a minute or so and he never touched him during it. 

 He apologised to his brother and his parents recently. The brother can't remember and said it was ok. They are close and their relationship hasn't changed since he apologised. They play video games together and always tease each other, he is not remotely scared of my bf. My boyfriend seems really horrified by this event, he cried telling me this and said he felt he had to tell me in case I wouldn't wanna be with someone that did this. This is totally at odds with the guy he is now, who asked for permission to kiss me when we first started dating and continuously asked me if I was ok during our first few times having sex and whenever we do anything new.

The farther we go with this the worse I feel. I don't even want to know you anymore. I know this wasn't your intention, but I feel so abandoned.

67,"I will write this here, to strangers on the Internet, because I don't risk dealing with any consequences of telling people who know me in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a student in college. I graduate this December. I think the only thing that keeps me going is a hope for the future after I graduate, but I have to be really careful to hold onto this.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost my job that I loved due to covid furloughs, and it isn't apparent when I get to come back, if I ever do. To pay my rent, I am working at a grocery store, but it's not a great job. I stupidly went to college in my hometown due to pressure from extremely conservative and religious family, and so I am constantly trying to avoid being forced to feel like a weak kid again by overbearing parents, so my contact with them is limited. Any time I go home, they just get mad at me for not going to their evangelical church anyway. I live in Appalachia, and I feel like every force in the world is trying to trap me in this depressed, meth-ridden, hopeless place forever, like everyone else in my family has been for hundreds of years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really religious, and so I have pretty much no community here (life revolves around church or family, and I'm distant from both). I feel culturally empty. I rejected my upbringing, and so I no longer fit in here, but I'm a foreigner everywhere I go too. I belong nowhere, and I probably never will. That's why all my hope rides on graduating college and getting out.

&amp;#x200B;

But now, as the economy suffers, I am terrified that I will not be able to find work once I graduate. God forbid, what if I have to go home? I honestly don't know if I could live with myself. If that's my future, I don't know that I even want it. No, I am not at risk of suicide, I won't do that. But I think my future is not very bright.",26May2020,1

I hate myself so extremely much.  I really wish that I wasn't attracted to one of the worst things that can happen to a woman

There is absolutely  no positives for the woman that have big boobs. It just seems like an horrible experience all around. I like big boobs and constantly feel like a horrible piece of shit for it. That l like something that is so horrible to women.

It is if a woman would have a thing for prostate cancer

I don't even know why it bothers me so extremely much. Large breasts is absolutely not necessary.

A new woman has started at my work (she is 30 and I am 22) who is a lesbian and has a wife. 

We have become fairly close and if I’m being completely honest I think she may have feelings for me. I honestly can’t get her off my mind lately as well though due to her always texting me, fb messaging me and Instagram messaging me all at the same time - we message everyday from morning to night. She sends me selfies and we pretty much talk about anything and everything. 

She doesn’t talk about her wife much and I know it’s wrong how I feel as she is taken. If she does talk about her wife it is usually a complaint or saying if they have had a fight. I would never do anything to break a relationship up 
as that’s really not what I’m about. It’s hard to not reply to her though as she texts me quite abit. I know no one can really tell me how I am feeling in regards to my sexuality -  but just really needing anything at this point. I haven’t felt this way about a woman before and she is honestly all i think about and I can’t stop. I genuinely think I have feelings for her.

79,"Der Sommer kommt näher, man plant mit Freunden oder mit der Familie einen Tag am Strand zu verbringen. Was soll man mitnehmen? Dieser Blog soll Ihnen helfen den besten Strandtag des Sommers zu erleben.

**Basics**

Es erscheint vielleicht überflüssig zu erwähnen, aber man muss sich immer daran erinnern bei einem Stand Ausflug eine Badehose oder ein Bikini mitzunehmen. Alles andere ist zweitrangig. An einigen Stränden kann man ein Badetuch mieten. Ein eigenes Badetuch dabei zu haben, ist aber angenehmer. Man kann ein normales Badetuch mitnehmen oder ein Mikrofasertuch. Das hängt von den eigenen Präferenzen ab. Zusätzlich kommt es darauf an, ob das Material weit getragen werden muss. Mikrofasertücher sind kleiner und dünner und deshalb leichter. Jedoch können sie weniger Wasser aufnehmen als ein gewöhnliches Badetuch. Zusätzlich finden einige Leute, dass Mikrofasertücher unangenehm sind. Was man sonst dabeihaben sollte, ist eine Flasche mit Wasser oder mit einem beliebigen Getränk. Wenn es geht, sollten PET-Flaschen vermieden werden. Falls es nicht möglich ist und PET-Flaschen mitgetragen werden müssen, sollte darauf geachtet werden, dass sie entweder wieder mitgenommen oder richtig entsorgt werden. Es ist erstens besser für die Umwelt und zweitens ist es für den nächsten Besucher viel angenehmer. Ein weiterer wichtiger Punkt, den man beachten muss, ist dass man genügend Bargeld in verschiedenen Geldstücken dabeihat. Es kann sein, dass man keine Kreditkarte oder App für Zahlungen brauchen kann. Wenn man vor den Ausflug in Ruhe die Basics durchgeht, vermeidet man peinliche Missgeschicke.

**Sonnenschutz**

Es ist nicht das Ziel Ihnen den Spass zu verderben, aber der Rat der Hautärzte ist wichtig. Sie sollten einen Sonnenbrand möglichst vermeiden. Sonnenbrände sind nicht nur unangenehm und versauen den nächsten Tag, sondern sind eine biologische Katastrophe. Im Alter Hautkrebs zu bekommen ist unnötig, vor allem wenn es hundertprozentig vermeidbar ist. Dazu brauchen Sie einen guten Sonnenschutz. Schritt 1 eines guten Sonnenschutzes ist die Zeit an der direkten Sonne zu begrenzen. Alle, die eine sonnenempfindliche Haut haben, wissen, dass die Haut bei direktem Sonnenlicht sofort rot wird. Deshalb sollte wenn möglich ein Platz unter einem Sonnenschirm und einem Baum gewählt werden. Falls dies nicht möglich ist, muss eine Sonnencreme getragen werden. Für einen Tag am Strand sollten Sie grundsätzlich immer die Sonnencreme mit dem höchstmöglichen Schutzfaktor wählen. Beim Kauf einer Sonnencreme sollte darauf geachtet werden, dass die Inhaltsstoffe für Tiere, Korallen und für das Gewässer verträglich sind. Wenn man z.B. an einem belebten Strand geht, kann man die Sonnencreme deutlich riechen. Diese Chemikalien gehen auch ins Wasser über. Dort sind sie, für die dort lebenden Organismen schädlich. Es gibt heutzutage viele Produkte, die keine Chemikalien enthalten, die für Organismen schädlich sind. Es ist wahrscheinlich auch für die Gesundheit besser, da man die Sonnencreme für Stunden direkt auf der Haut trägt. Mit einem guten Sonnenschutz schützt man nicht nur seine eigene Gesundheit, sondern hilft auch die Belastung durch Chemikalien zu verkleinern. Eine gute Sonnenbrille ist ebenfalls Pflicht. Bei Sonnenbrillen sollte bei der Qualität auch und nicht sparsam sein. Bei zu billigen Sonnenbrillen kann es sein, dass sie bei fehlendem Schutzfaktor kontraproduktiv sind. bei Sonnenbrillen ohne UV-Schutz erweitern sich durch die Dunkelheit die Pupillen, sodass Mehr UV-Strahlung ins Auge gelangen kann. Dies ist für das Auge extrem schädlich.

**Einen Abfallsack**

Es ist sehr wichtig, sein Abfall zu entsorgen. Niemand will in einem vermüllten Strand baden. Falls Entsorgungsstationen am Strand vorhanden sind, sollten sie auch gebraucht werden. Abfallcontainer sind keine Dekoration. Wenn man jedoch den Tag an einem Strand verbringt, an dem keine solche Infrastrukturen vorhanden sind, sollte man einen Sack mitnehmen, um seinen Abfall mitzunehmen. Man sollte bekanntlich den Strand mindestens so hinterlassen, wie man es vorgefunden hat. die nächsten Besucher sind Ihnen sehr dankbar.

**Musik**

Es ist immer gut vorher zu wissen, ob man am Strand eine Internetverbindung hat oder nicht. meistens hat man durch Roaming oder die mobilen Datenverbindungen einen Internetzugriff, aber es kann gut sein, dass man sein Badetuch in einem Funkloch hinlegt. Deshalb sollte man vorbereitet sein. Es ist zu empfehlen wenigstens eine Playlist von 20 bis 30 guten Soundtracks auf sein Handy zu downloaden, falls man keinen Zugriff auf sein Spotify hat. Beliebte Genre sind Pop, Hip-Hop, R&amp;B und Sommerhits. Weiter benötigt man ein Gerät und diese Musik abzuspielen. Diese Lautsprecher sollten wenn möglich klein und tragbar, aber obligatorisch wasser- und sandfest sein. Ein gutes Produkt ist das UE WonderBoom. Damit der Bluetooth Lautsprecher nicht mittendrin den Geist aufgibt, sollte diese vor dem Ausflug aufgeladen sein. Eine weitere Option, um die Laufzeit des Lautsprechers zu gewährleisten, ist ein Battery-Pack mitzunehmen. Um den perfekten Sound zu haben, sollte man seine Freunde dazu bewegen ihre eigene Musik mitzunehmen, damit erstens, die Verantwortung aufgeteilt ist und es eine grössere Abwechslung gibt.

**Handy-Schutz**

Es ist wichtig sein Handy zu schützen. Niemand will derjenige oder diejenige sein, der oder die sein Bildschirm zerstört. Ich empfehle das Mobiltelefon mit einer normalen Hülle zu versehen und in einer Plastiktasche, das mit einem Verschluss verschliessbar ist, zu tun.

**Material für das perfekte Selfie**

Ein Strandausflug ist die perfekte Gelegenheit, um Selfies für Instagram, Snapchat und Facebook zu machen. Man kann es aber voll übertreiben. Die meisten Mobiltelefone können tolle Selbstportraits aufnehmen. Mit ein bisschen Übung bekommen Sie das Licht und die Bildkomposition im Griff. Diese sind fast wichtiger als das Gerät selbst. Um Fotos und Selfies zu machen, reicht ein Smartphone vollkommen. Wollen Sie aber Action-Videos aufnehmen und ins Wasser gehen, sind Action-Kameras wie die GoPro zu empfehlen. 

**Spielsachen** 

Wenn Sie mit Freunden oder mit der Familie an den Strand fahren ist es immer lustig irgendein Ball oder ein Strandspielzeug mitzunehmen. Es ist eine gute Abwechslung zum Schwimmen und zum Sonnenbaden. Praktisch sind Spielsachen die aufblasbar sind, wie z.B. Bälle etc. Wenn diese nicht mit der Kraft der Lunge aufblasbar sind, sollten Sie eine Pumpe nicht vergessen. Kartenspiele, wie z.B. Uno und Frantic sind leicht mitzunehmen und ideal für ruhigere Momente. Mit diesen Spielsachen ist das soziale Erlebnis gewährleistet.

**Alternative für falls es regnet**

Man hat Spass und geniesst die Sonne, plötzlich beginnt es zu regnen - Das ist ein Alptraum jeden Strandgängers. Das ist aber nur Vorbereitungssache. Sie sollten im Voraus die Wettervorhersagen kontrollieren. Die Wettervorhersagen sind meistens für die nächsten drei Tage ziemlich genau. Für den Fall der Fälle sollten Sie immer eine Alternative bereit haben. Dazu braucht es ein bisschen Fantasie. entweder kann man den Regen einfach ignorieren, wenn es im Spätsommer warm ist, oder man kann irgendeine andere Tätigkeit machen. Wenn es ein Gewitter gibt, sollten Sie aber das Gewässer umgehend verlassen. Der elektrische Strom eines Blitzeinschlags kann sich im Wasser weit ausbreiten.

**Fazit**

Dieser Blog war sehr ausführlich. Aber hier ist das Wichtigste in Kürze. vor dem Ausflug sollten Sie das Wetter kontrollieren. niemand will an einem regnerischen Tag an den Strand fahren. Nebst den Basics, das heisst Badehose, Badetuch, etwas zu trinken und Bargeld, muss ein guter Sonnenschutz gewährleistet sein. Danach kann man mit seinen Freunden guter Sound organisieren. Für die Unterhaltung können Spielsachen und Material für Selfies mitgenommen werden. Am Schluss des Tages sollte beachtet werden, dass alle Abfälle entweder mitgenommen oder richtig entsorgt werden. Wenn sie sich an diesen Tipps halten, steht Ihnen für den perfekten Strandausflug nichts mehr im Weg.

80,"I was in the supermarket the other day and found a discounted item. It was a piece of pork, with the skin and fat attached. I bought it home, thinking I'd make a good dinner out of it. In the kitchen I slapped it down on the counter and ripped open the packaging. Immediately I almost gag because of the smell. It smelled so bad, but I kept on going and got the knife out. The piece of pork stared back at me, the skin facing upwards, a leathery pink patch with a rough matte finish, dotted by little bits of hair. I've eaten pork before but I had never prepared it with the meat like this.

I grabbed it with my left hand and immediately the sensation of the skin underneath my fingertips felt so human like. Just as if someone butchered a human being and placed a piece of the belly on the counter in front of me. The smell hit me again and I gagged, and threw the whole thing in the bin. I've never eaten pork since. 

Has anyone gotten this same reaction? I'm not a vegetarian and still eat chicken. I just can't do pork.",26May2020,1

83,"I have a lot of personality issues, I am a coward, I try to look for acceptance in everyone. As a kid I used to live with my parents and my uncle's family. My aunt always hated me since the day I was born. She even slapped me once, when I was a kid, for no reason. She was always rude to me. She used to talk shit about me on my face. She never let her kids (my cousins) to play with me. As a kid I always wanted to talk to them and play games with them, but they were told to hate me and avoid me. I always wanted them to accept me, I wanted her to like me. I was also bullied in school by my childhood best friends, they used to scare me to take stuff from me. They stopped doing it as we grew up. Once some kid pulled a prank on a teacher, and she framed me for it. And my teacher was very rude to me after that, I ended up leaving the institution. There have been a lot of such events which are impacting my personality now and I don't know what to do. I just try to avoid my emotions. I never have the confidence to stand up for me, I always want people to like me and I get scared that people will try to blame me for things that I didn't do. I can't help but feel that way. I've never told all these things to anyone. If I tell my parents about these now, they will just be stressed out. I thought I'd just post this on Reddit.",26May2020,1
85,"I feel like I might be driving people off but I don't know how or why. I didn't have many friends as a kid, I've never been popular or liked and the few friends I had, I held really dear to my heart. Things changed for me  a little the last few years of high school. I got to know more people, like-minded folks and we started to hang out in a group. I had never had such an experience before and I finally felt like I belonged somewhere. 

After high school, we all found sort of serious boyfriends and it was even more fun, because they were all friends of friends and we all just hung out together in even a bigger group. I totally loved those times. I was the first one to break up with a guy from that group and he told an awful whole lot of lies about me to my friends and they cut me off, without giving me a chance to explain myself. 

After some time, they got to know him better and figured out that he was the one telling lies, so we started to hang out again, but it was never the same. During that time, we grew so much apart. I barely had anything to say to those people. 

Now, I just see that as the time passes by, we have totally different values, different goals and different lifestyles. Even when I try to stay in touch with some of them, it's like catching on a memory. The connection's no longer there. 

I still hang out with very few of them, but I don't feel really close to them anymore.  I'm 27 and I haven't really been able to find new friends. Even when I do, it's kinda' desperate, like I just hang out with them to have someone to hang out with, I don't really have much in common with those people. 

I honestly feel like I've out grown them by A LOT. But when I meet someone new who seems nice and interesting, it feels like I'm never really good enough for them. It's this rollercoaster of feeling inferior vs feeling superior to most people that really drives me mad.",26May2020,1
86,"For two months I saw this man every week, we would have a really amazing time together, and had great sexual chemistry. I was completely dedicated to him, and only ever wanted to please, doing whatever it took. I would do my best to satisfy him sexually, and try to do other little things to make him happy, like cooking him dinner, making his bed, buying lingerie to wear for him. I had thought we developed a friendship, and that the both of us gave each other a great time. I always left his house feeling satisfied and excited for the next time, and I was under the impression he felt the same. 

Recently he decided to end things to prioritise his relationship with another girl. In his message explaining this, he seemed very casual, almost happy to have things end, pretty much saying ‘it was fun, see ya 😗👋’.

87,"For two months I saw this man every week, we would have a really amazing time together, and had great sexual chemistry. I was completely dedicated to him, and only ever wanted to please, doing whatever it took. I would do my best to satisfy him sexually, and try to do other little things to make him happy, like cooking him dinner, making his bed, buying lingerie to wear for him. I had thought we developed a friendship, and that the both of us gave each other a great time. I always left his house feeling satisfied and excited for the next time, and I was under the impression he felt the same. 

Recently he decided to end things to prioritise his relationship with another girl. In his message explaining this, he seemed very casual, almost happy to have things end, pretty much saying ‘it was fun, see ya 😗👋’. I was devastated, and I called him to try and clarify if he was serious about ending things.

94,"I've been off for 8 weeks, and they have been the most stress free and happy 8 weeks of my adult life. I'm less anxious and less depressed. This time off has made me realise how unhappy I am in my job.

I have to go back to work on Monday, and for some reason my employer has decided to condense our work week in to 3 days/4 nights, so I'll be going back on a 12 hour night shift. I've worked shifts since July up until lockdown, but only 8 hour shifts, and I hate it.

The job itself is quality control for a manufacturer. I worked in quality for about 4 years at another company before getting this job, which I was led to believe would be a step up the career ladder with engineering training and more opportunities. In reality, I walk circles around the factory inspecting items that come off the machines. It's mind numbing, my coworkers are mostly middle aged men (I'm 29F) and foreign workers who speak very little English so I've found it really hard to make friends and feel like I fit in.

I've done factory work similar to this for the last 8 or 9 years. I never went to college/uni. I feel so trapped. I want out, but I have no idea where to go. I don't earn much but I'm a bit above the minimum wage and I can't afford to take a job that only pays minimum wage.

On top of all this, my boyfriend has been completely awful at offering any kind of emotional support. After getting the email letting me know that I had to go back to work soon, I was pretty quiet all morning and just kept to myself watching TV and trying not to cry and have a full blown panic attack. He eventually decided to ask me what was wrong and I told him, to which he responded with ""well there's not a lot you can do about it, you have to go to work. Crying about it won't help. If you hate it so much find another job.""

I don't know what I expected. I didn't want to talk about it which was why I kept to myself, but he asked, and then got angry when I told him what was wrong. I know I need to look for a new job. I'm not a fucking idiot. But it's not like there are a lot of places hiring at the moment. It's pretty much a choice between care work or construction work in my area, neither of which I'm able or willing to do.

hello,

i am a post graduate and in my culture parents take care of children till marriage. and this is really frustrating because there is no concept of freedom, individuality or personal space.

And due to covid pandemic i have been called home for my own safety and so that my dad doesnt have to pay much, had i been away from home, he would have to pay for all the expense. he is dominant and very egoistic. and everything under his control. whether i should go anywhere or noy. At what date i should go everything is decided by him. he hasnt ever taught me any life skill to survive i have learnt all that on my own

This has become quite a problem staying home it's very frustrating and i need space and freedom. expect for my mom nobody talks much and that leaves me alone. and i have grown to resent people and i dont talk even if i want to. It is disrupting my peace and making me underconfident.

**I NEED A WAY TO GO AWAY TO MY COLLEGE DURING THIS PANDEMIC.**

i cant directly say that to my dad, so that's a no go.

107,"When I first saw that video I was also disgusted by her racism and the way she treated her dog. And I do think she's racist and that she shouldn't take care of animals.

BUT - I think the thing that is happening on the internet right now is a full blown lynch that this woman does not deserve.

This video starts in the middle of the events. This is what the guy says happened before he started filming:

ME: Ma’am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.  
HER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.  
ME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.  
HER: It’s too dangerous.  
ME: Look, if you’re going to do what you want, I’m going to do what I want, but you’re not going to like it.  
HER: What’s that?  
ME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!  
HER: He won’t come to you.  
ME: We’ll see about that…

And that's the guy's testimony (it was probably worse in reality).

He was threatening her/her dog, that's pretty nerve-wrecking and intimidating, and her reaction shows it - she was in panic in that video. Even if her panic isn't justified in your opinion - it still deserves empathy, because she was actually afraid. A strange man was threatening her with no other people around - that is by itself a scary situation to be in.

Secondly, calling her a ""Karen"" because she's white and nervous is pretty racist and empathy-lacking. This woman is being stoned on the internet right now by herds of PC people who forgot the origins of PC culture - being conscientious and empathetic towards other people. Condemning racism is important but not if it's replaced by a different type of racism and a horrible lack of empathy towards a person in distress.

Americans are so afraid of being racist towards black people that it creates these absurd situations - both the way she said ""an African-american is attacking me"" and the fact everyone crazily hates on her without taking the time to think that this video doesn't show everything (but it does show she's in panic).

Thirdly, after all that man decided to threaten her dog and start filming her simply because she wouldn't put her dog on a leash. It's not such a big crime, he was being kind of petty (but it still doesn't justify her racist behavior).

I think this woman does not deserve the lynch she is going through right now. Yes, she's racist. Yes, she abused her dog (when she was afraid, thus irrational - it means she can't control herself and that she shouldn't have pets). She is not the monster people make her to be.

BTW I wanted to post it on r/unpopularopinion but it was immediately removed (probably because it's a very popular topic, but I think it's actually an unpopular opinion).",26May2020,1

137,"I feel conflicted because I do not like talking about people without them knowing. However, I know many other people are in my situation, and I know that there are people who match with others on dating websites then unmatch. Thus, this will be kept anonymous.
I've not been on a date, or have had a significant other in almost six years. I honestly do not know why compared to almost everyone else I know my age who haves/has had significant others over this time. I've been trying Hinge since the quarantine has been in effect. I already have low self-esteem when it comes to my physical looks because I have friends where people are immediately attracted to them, but do not know that I exist. I have been told that I also come off as ""hard to approach"" because I have a very disinterested look. This is something I can control, so I have tried to work on that. However, clearly my situation has not changed because here I am six years later. 
Anyways, I was very surprised to have matched with you on Hinge. Clearly, you are out of my league. The fact that we were messaging back and forth meant to me that maybe we were hitting things off. So, I just want you to understand that building my hopes and self-esteem up to eventually unmatching with me out of the blue without an explanation makes me automatically think that you are above me, and I don't deserve to try starting a relationship with somebody that I am interested in because there will be another person out there that they are more attracted to. 
The thoughts of, ""there is no way that the person that I am attracted to is attracted to me,"" and, ""clearly I'm not going to ever have a relationship where I am happy,"" go through my mind almost everyday. I could go on for a many more paragraphs, but I don't see the point anymore. I hope that anybody that has ever built up somebody's hopes like you have to me will understand after reading this that there are people out there that you are genuinely hurting in the short and long term.

None of the other cases were direct contact (ex - I work in the office for 10 minutes a day then from home and the cases were out onthe floor...we don't even use the same doors/hallways). I could be responsible for a chain of infections and deaths and... I'm not sure I can handle that. We are self-isolating, but my head is spinning at this point. Almost like I'm in a nightmare. 

How the hell did I even get this? I don't go anywhere, I even get my groceries delivered. We haven't done anything in 3 months and we did the hand sanitizer and the whole sanitizing/disinfecting routine. We even kept our toddler our of daycare. I was so careful. I was going to be one of the ones that ended chains of transmission, but now I am just a part of the chain.

I was so careful even when my state wasn't(it is the one that captured national (maybe international) news about protesting the ""safer at home"" policy. And, now I am part of the problem. My chest is heavy, probably partially from this virus, but also that I didn't do enough.",26May2020,1
164,"I’ve been going through a major relationship change and dealing with moving to a new state right before quarantine started. I didn’t previously live at home but due to some issues I’m back at my moms and it hasn’t been great. We’ve been knocking heads more times than I’d like. And it’s surprisingly a lot considering the amount of time I actually will get up the nerve to leave my room. Depression hit hard after my relationship change and having no support from family has been hard. But today is my birthday and we will be going to get some food from my favorite restaurant tonight. It’s not a big step but it definitely helps. I’m grateful for it! I just felt kind of happy and wanted to share this somewhere. Since I don’t have friends, this was the next best place",26May2020,1
165,"If someone loses their spouse, or family, or friend, and suddenly they're glowing, joyful, chipper, energetic, and being the epitome of happiness, then I do not believe that they're grieving. That's not how grieving works. Emotions may not always be simple, but they're not so that complex either. We have words like psychopath and sociopath because people lack certain emotions. If being happy immediately after a tragedy is normal, then we have no business labeling people psychopaths/sociopaths. Those people should also be considered normal. Why not say people deal with emotions in their own way? Yeah, exactly. The whole grieving your own way crap is just a way for guilty people to have an excuse because they can't contain the fact that they're happy about what should be a tragic moment.

I'm open to having my view changed.",26May2020,1
