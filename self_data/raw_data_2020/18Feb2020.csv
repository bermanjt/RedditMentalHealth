0,"I guess you could say we‘re acquaintances. I see her life through social media. She likes to talk about how she is such a changed person. How she has met better friends. 

I have such negative thoughts of her. I do think that our break up as best friends has forever impacted how I meet people and how much trust I give. It doesn’t help that just 2 years ago, she sent me a card saying how sorry she was for what she did. 

I actually think that made it so much worse. The memories came back and my hatred for her as well. I won’t go into details of what happened and I don’t think it’s something that can be so easily explained or understood. 

I hate how she tries to portray herself as such a kind outgoing social individual. All my thoughts of her are negative. I know this isn’t healthy. 

I need to unfollow and unfriend and block her from my life right? Please let me know if this is the right step. I don’t want to cause anymore issues between us, but I feel like it’s mentally hurting me. I also think I’m better than her in every way, but I feel like this is wrong? Idk input would be great",18Feb2020,1
2,"MY girlfriends reaction to me buying her a iPhone 11.

So I had the great idea to buy my girlfriend a new phone she right now has the iPhone 8plus and it’s a good working phone but recently a couple months ago I had purchased the new iPhone 11 for myself upgrading from iPhone 8 Plus as well and when I showed her mine she told me how she had wanted one to , like she wasn’t begging for me to buy it for her she just liked the phone..... other times before I had got the new phone I had brought the iPhone 11 up saying that I want to get it when it first came out and she agreed that she wanted that phone to ....... so months later as it came closer to Valentine’s Day I decided to buy here the 11 and so I did because our yearly anniversary is on March 1st so it’s very close to valentines so I thought it could count as two gifts for each day because I knew the phone was a bit pricey but I had saved the money to afford the phone for her  and so I bought the iPhone........ later I took her to the Apple store as a surprise to pick it up and when I gave it to her she was like “are you serious “ and I was like yes it’s yours and she continued to say no that “ it cost way to much “ and I continued to say the price didn’t matter like for me I wasn’t thinking of the price I just wanted to get her something I knew she truly wanted and so I did and she just kept saying it cost to much. 
,,,,, so as we got to my house she told me she really liked it and stuff but how was she going to explain to her mom that I got her the phone .. the reason for her saying that is because her mom does not really like me for other reasons that are another story. But her mother is very strict on her for being 19 in college doing everything right. So her mom is very strict and my gf doesn’t know how to tell her that she got a new phone from me , she thinks her mom will tell her to give it back or think that she is doing some sort of sexual favors for me to buy her the phone when none of that is happening .. so my gf and I are talking about it and she kind of wants me to return it but I don’t want to , I don’t see why she can’t have my gift just because her mom will be offended by it ,,,,
My gf is also saying that she doesn’t want to tell her mom that I got it for her like she wants to say her older sister got it for Her or to make up another excuse for getting the iPhone and that maybe her mom will let her keep it if she doesn’t know she got it from me . In a way I think she should just tell her mom that I bought it for her for our anniversary and just leave it like that like nothing else has to be said but my gf does not agree saying that her mom is going to be mad because of it.. I honestly don’t know what I did wrong I just went out of my way to buy my gf a new phone and she doesn’t want to except it because her mom will be mad about it , 
Should I just return the phone ? Or should Wait to see if my gf will tell her mom that I got it for her ?",18Feb2020,1
5,"So here is the thing. I have a mixed relationship with my name. My first name sounds great, it has a great story, cultural value and stuff. My last name is kind of ugly but like it’s okay. One thing however. It is just too ethnic (?) sounding for my liking. 

I am jewish of sefaradi (tunisian to be specific) heritage by the way. 

My first name is a girl name for jews but it is a very common boy name for the rest of the world (Noa if you are curious). Sure I love how it sounds and all but it just ticks people off when they are not familiar with jewish names. 


My last name well. It’s not that I don’t like it (I mean it’s really not my favourite sounding name anyway) it’s just that’s it’s wayyy too arab sounding for my liking. Like it really is. Some sefaradi jewish last names are just fine but mine just screams WOW LOOK AT THIS TUNISIAN PERSON, which I really dislike. Also it just sounds ugly. 


That and it is actually impossible to pronounce by native english speakers. Not saying they butcher it, no, they litterally just stop and stare in silence when they have to read my name. I don’t even know how to pronounce my name in english (i’m french but a fluent english speaker).   


It really bothers me as I would really like to move to the uk in the next 5 years and I feel like my name will really be a bit of problem. 


I have found a last name that would work for me, basically my last name with the last syllable taken out of it. Good, close to my original name, english sounding and I looked it up and wow, some jews actually have that name despite it being scottish apparently. Basically checks all of the boxes. 
 
Only thing is it doesn’t sound right at all with my first name (it has a 2-1 syllable rhyme that I don’t really like) but I am still unsure wether I want to change my first name or not since I love everything about it but the connotation it has to non-jews. 

But I am just scared it would hurt my family’s feelings or they wouldn’t understand my reasoning if I just changed my last name. They wouldn’t probably tell md to get married so I get to change my namd, but that’s not happenning anytime soon and I’m not even sure I want to marry so that’s just not a solution.

8,"I was born with something called pectus excavatum. Its basically a big dent in the sternum, but to those that suffer from it its much more than that. Growing up I was so ashamed of my body. I can count on 2 hands the amount of times I've been swimming in my entire 36 years of life. In basketball if I ever got picked for the ""skins"" team I'd have to come up with an excuse not to play. If anybody pushed me playfully in the center of the chest my entire life melted and I wanted to kill myself. You can see from my profile pic that I'm a decent looking guy so women were always in the picture. I spent half my life agonizing over what they'll think when I finally have to take my shirt off. It's caused me a lifetime of emotional &amp; psychological torture. This isn't unique to me. Everyone with this condition has these thoughts. Social anxiety, preoccupation with appearance, dissatisfaction with body appearance, inferiority, and depression are the psychological effects. That was 100% the case during my teens and early 20s.

I had a chance to fix it at 10 years old. I visited a doctor in OKC because I was having problems running in sports. It wasn't asthma but I couldn't catch my breath. I have a big fucking dent in my chest that reduces lung capacity and this doctor said it's not related! Then when pressed to fix it he said ""There's no need, it's not a big deal. It's cosmetic."" Looking back, everything he said was wrong. I've had to go through life with a deformity that hindered me physically and emotionally because of that man. Those emotional issues led me to a life of drug abuse and i ended up in prison for 5 years. Once I hit 30 I was able to turn my life around. Went from being a convict to being a family man making upper middle class income with a big house and an 800 credit score. I'm proud of that because I know how rare that turnaround really is.

I rarely think about it now that I'm married. I'm lucky to have a pretty lady that seems to be infatuated enough with me to overlook my many flaws. If any of you have a child with PE (supposedly 1 in 400 people have it but you'd never know cause we never take our shirts off lol) please do him/her a favor and get it fixed before they're old enough to realize what's going on. The surgery/recovery is incredibly painful and worse the older you get. Its too late for me but you can save them a lifetime of pain.",18Feb2020,1
9,"I guess I should be happy, I used to deal with late night binges until I felt sick and disgusted with myself. Not fun. My last binge was a few weeks ago around christmas, I started working out and taking a little more care of my diet. At the same time I stopped restricting because they say you shouldn't be when you have a problem with bingeing. I told myself it's okay to eat a reasonable amount of food because I work out.

So tonight I thought of the nuts and sweets in my shelf, I hid them there a few weeks ago, I don't know why. I had a rough day and felt low so I started to eat peanuts, but stopped after half a hand full or so. I don't know. It just doesn't feel like it used to. I want to numb myself, forget the pain, distract myself with something tasty... But it just feels lame.

13,"Hello people. 

I would like to change the way I talk, **but let me clarify first**.

When I read, I have a great voice. Warm, solid, articulated, etc. And it is like that because I don't have to think about what I'm saying (I'm reading) so I can focus on **how** I say it.

But when I talk to people, my voice sounds like shit. Nasal, muddy, even feminine (I'm a guy with deep voice, but the 'cadence' of the way I talk sucks). And it is like that because I have to think about **what** I'm saying (I'm not reading anymore), so I focus on **what** I'm saying, not **how**.

Is there a solution for this? **I don't need to learn how to have a great voice** (I have it when I read).

I need to know how to make it **subconsciously natural, automatic, internalized**... 

 Or how to think how I'm talking and what I'm saying at the same time *(but this is kinda impossible :P)*

16,"This is my first reddit post so bear with me. I was wondering, if any of you have found that connecting to your peers has become a chore. I am not an anti-social person I actually have tons of friends and generally get along with everyone. I go to the bar with my friends, I listen (and sometimes enjoy) the trendy music and I don't have any pressing issues in the department of sex. I'm no sexual behemoth, but I'm not abstinent by any means.

I just don't understand why every time I go out, I find myself closer and closer to wishing extinction. Now before you get on my case, this isn't my manifesto, I want the worst for my species but I don't wish to pursue this myself. In fact, quite the opposite, which is why I am here today. I feel more and more distant from the people around me, and it's beginning to tax me. Going out on the weekends is starting to drain me, going on dates is the worst, and even in my classes in college, while I enjoy the presence of some of my professors I find myself only socializing so I'm not viewed as the weird kid in the back.

Now, it is impossible when dumping thoughts onto a message board  to not ramble a little bit so I apologize. With that being said, let me clear a few things up. I'm not an alpha nor am I a beta, I'm not a chad and I sure as fuck am no Elliot Roger. I just feel like an anomaly. I don't feel like I am some ascended being looking down on peasants, I consider myself intelligent but am very good at acknowledging the intelligence in my peers as well. I am not envious of much and I don't hold any hatred for anybody. I just feel as though I view the world differently. Not in an arrogant way, but in a humbling way. I think the human race has exploited their time on this world and, for the most part, has squandered their gifts in every way possible.

When I say I acknowledge the intelligence of my peers, I feel as though everyone is smart in their own way. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. My natural strengths have always been with reading people and exploiting that to influence them (exploit is a strong word but I don't use this for nefarious purposes). The issue is going out has started draining me so much that I no longer use my natural strengths to benefit me. I simply don't care enough. Which saddens me, one of my favorite hobbies is reading people as I speak with them, Silently and free of judgement of course. Lately, that urge just doesn't strike me, I go out speak to people, wish I could go home the whole time, and then leave. Which worries me. Am I becoming so distant from people that I'm losing the ability to relate to them?

So, this brings me to my conclusion and the finality of my question/statement. Are there like minded individuals out there who share these issues with me? I could go on for pages but I do not wish to put you all to sleep any longer with my rambling. I simply wanted to paint the picture of what my life was generally like and see if i could reach others that think like this.

To those that share this view or some aspects of it:

How do you cope with it? Should I continue to play along? Should I seek new friends? Does it get better? Worse? What information can you offer me, or if just want to talk about this with me so perhaps we could draw some conclusions together, all is welcome. Thanks to anyone who can help.

No one is technically obligated to give answers or provide justice to anyone; it’s more of a moral concept that some may choose to partake in. I always thought that one should have the integrity to do what is right and provide justice regardless of others who say “suck it up and give yourself your own closure.” Recently, I was engulfed with the injustices that I couldn’t move past from, whether personal, familial, etc. I became vengeful and aimed to destroy instead of building on myself.

I gave up actively searching for these answers and let go, telling myself I’ll learn the truth as life goes on and let the universe deal with whomever wronged me. Suddenly, I had those from my past try to make amends. Maybe it’s through “confirmation bias” and I’m seeing things through a colored lens, but I finally feel like everything will be alright.

Sadly, one day my mom tells me we are moving away, so my ex told me to stay in touch with her until the move was done. 1st day I text her ""I'm pretty much done unpacking my stuff, Imma bathe and sleep"" 2nd day, was the same, but I couldn't sleep, all these lies I told her and my friends were suddendly just going through my mind and just reminding me what a horrible person I am, just a monster, I start crying, thinking what I should do. I stay up all night my ex texted me in the morning and this is pretty much how the conversation went, but not exactly how of course:

Her: Hey Janny!
Me: Hey...
Her: What's up?
Me: We have to break up, I'm sorry

That's what I can remember. What did she reply? I don't know, my dumbass blocked her immidietley after. I regret it, oh I regret it so much, I just wanna go to the past and beat the shit out of past me. I don't have any way to contact her now, I can't find her on facebook, instagram nor twitter , I even checked her old account where we used to play but, no responce. I kinda wanted to take this out of my chest, 'cause even 4-5 years later it makes me lose sleep. I hope she is well, I really hope she is.",18Feb2020,1

48,"I am currently a college senior, who worked to be ahead for my entire time here in order to try and save money my last semester by going part time. I accomplished that goal and have a great job lined up for after school. But now I feel uninterested and unchallenged in my life, leading to less energy. I have not felt rested for the entirety of the semester. It seems I stay up late because I can sleep in and can’t fall asleep because I sleep in. The cycle is vicious. 

For background, I have a part time job that helps me pay bills and have fun, but it is nothing that interests me. It can only capture my attention for 3/4 hour spurts until I put it away until the next workday. I workout 5 days a week. Run, lift, play basketball with friends. I attend my classes and do the work necessary but that is it. I go out at night with friends once or twice a week and maintain a quality social life but I find myself exhausted the days after which cause me to sleep in, watch movies, etc in my room.

When I first signed up I would self censor or delete posts that got downvoted. For some reason I cared deeply whether or not strangers here approved of me.

Then my life went to shit because I had been self censoring in real life, never truly speaking my mind. I had two options at this point - face and speak the truth or leave this world.

I decided to speak the truth.

Real sad that Reddit - a place I used to think of as being open to the truth and discussion, is nothing of the sort.

52,"Sometimes when I'm sad I like to think about what it means to be alive, and experience ""existence"". In hopes to somehow wither down whatever is making me sad.

I like to watch that video that scales all the way out and you can see the entire observable universe. Then it zooms back in and you can see very small atoms. 

But what really got me is that the sun will eventually die. In 5 billion years all the internal nuclear fuel will run out and our sun will expand so big that it will eat earth and then condense back into itself. Even if you could take a magic potion that grants immortality, you cannot survive that.

Then I got thinking, by then we'll be multi planetary or whatever so I could hypothetically hitch a ride to somewhere else.

Then i learned that eventually every single star in our universe will suffer a fate similar. It's inevitable, even if I could live forever, eventually I would live only in darkness. With memories of what was. Sure by then my current problems would be of no worry, but Id probably be wishing that i had problems to even worry about. If that makes sense? 

So even if today kinda sucked, or this month or even year has been shitty. Atleast it's something. Atleast the Sun is still burning. Atleast there's people to give a shit about.

55,"Lets preface this by saying that yes, I am Chinese, and therefore the typical helicopter parents is there. While I've been an immigrant to Canada for over 20 years, this thread is not about speaking ill of the Chinese government and I in no way came to ""escape communism"" or whatever. That's not what this is about.

So I am 30, a healthcare worker, and live at home because rent is expensive and I have ownership of the house. I have indeed become complacent of my living situation, have laundry done for you, food ready, etc. But I did live on my own for 3+ years for work, and I am going to say that since moving back, I've never truly felt I was free. 

With the coronavirus outbreak, they took notice around Jan 25, when Wuhan closed off the city. I had plans to meet a friend who is visiting. The night before, a Burnaby city councilor posted a rumour that she had received calls from a patient who claims to have been discharged from multiple clinics/hospitals in Vancouver area, then flew back to Shanghai, then was admitted and tested positive for coronavirus. The rumour has since been found to be false as such admission records did not exist. However, they had a shouting match with me about how I don't know how to protect myself and how if I catch the virus I'll spread it to everyone I work with. They stressed many times no restaurants, but I said we'd have to grab food somewhere, and their logic is false because even if I never visited any Chinese restaurants, whats to say my friend didn't. And I've stressed many times that I am still going to work, I am a front line healthcare worker, there is NO hiding for me. Somehow that didn't apply, to them going to work is necessary, but going out to eat, gym, movies, etc, was an unnecessary risk of getting exposed, avoid crowds, etc. I decided to cancel my plans with my friend, because I felt there was no winning the argument. Its been 3 weeks and I never really forgave them.

Now time and time I still stress how we don't have many cases in BC, and that the risk is extremely low but I feel locked up and not able to live my life. I've not gone to the gym, not gone out to meet any friends, basically just go to work, come home, and work out a little bit on the elliptical. They themselves have avoided going outside for too long, but course, dad also works an extremely public facing job and there is no hiding for him either. They kept stressing how in our home town in China, which is far away from Wuhan and there are only a couple dozen cases, people are living in fear, the city is locked down, all entertainment is stopped, people have to wear masks in the streets, each household is given a pass to allow one person to go out to shop every 2nd day, why can't I do my part. They keep saying Canada is doing nothing in terms of screening, flights are still coming in, even the ""at home quarantine"" that people are claiming to do is useless, when they arrive they'll roam around and spread disease. Course there's a lot of name calling, saying how I am acting like a child, I am adult and a healthcare worker so I should be the one advising them to be careful, not going against them. 

And honestly, my argument is just that, I am not an idiot, I follow the news, I look at what local authorities are advising, and I don't declare state of emergency on myself before there is an actual state of emergency. Everyone I know is still going about their normal lives, going on dates, working out, eating out, etc. Maybe not near the major Asian centers, but elsewhere. Am I wrong in saying that I feel chained up? Do they have a reason to be concerned the way they are? 

Leading up to this, I've had some alone time in another city and I really enjoy the freedom and I barely contacted my parents during that time, which has put strains to our relationship, and I am growing tired of how much they try to control my life. This is probably the last straw, and when this whole thing blows over I am going to look towards moving out, possibly across the country. I've been fuming mad for at least 3 days where I feel like the coronavirus is not going to kill me, but its having an aneurysm from arguing with them that will. Course I want it to be a peaceful, agreed upon decision and not a ""fuck you I am leaving""...

I get out and start running when the car stops and  that's when I wake up. 

There was no where for me to run because the area I was in was basically a shotting gallery. The sides of the road were pastures and there were barbed wire livestock fences on either side so I had no where to run but down the road knowing that Al Pacino was behind me aiming at me as I ran.

70,"Three years ago, I started dating a man I was absolutely enchanted with. For the year and a half I was with him, I genuinely thought that he could do no wrong and that the aggressions, the yelling, and anger was my fault. It took me years to realize that what he did was abuse. It took me even longer to realize that he raped me at the beginning of our relationship. My current boyfriend is far more understanding and generally a much better person; in fact, he is the one who helped me make these realizations. 

However, they’ve been in the same group of friends since high school and are still relatively close, and though my current boyfriend doesn’t seek out his company, only his friends, it’s functionally the same thing since if you invite one of them, you’re effectively inviting the whole group. We’ve only been dating for three months and I thought I was fine with this, but the more time has progressed, the more uncomfortable I feel about the situation. Though our current lives are separate enough that there’s an extremely low chance that I would run into my ex because of my boyfriend, it feels like by continuing their friendship as if nothing happened is the equivalent of excusing it. 

The complexity of the issue arises when you consider that nobody knows about this besides myself, my best friend, and my boyfriend. I don’t want to confront him, nor do I desire to completely ruin his life, even if he deserves it. Furthermore, my boyfriend has developed depression because I will, in all likelihood, be leaving the state for college. He currently goes to our state school and has asked me to attend school there, but for personal reasons, I would prefer not to. It’s also the school my ex goes to. 

He says that my ex’s friend group allows him some respite from his depression by providing a distraction, and there are limited alternatives because he has an extremely hard time making human connections (hasn’t made a single new one in two years, only developed the ones he already has; re: dating me) and his other core group of friends are scattered throughout the country (one of them is actually in Italy right now!) though about half are at the same school he is. He also believes that attempting to push away solely my ex will not work and alienate himself from the whole group. Thus, he argues that they are what’s currently keeping him alive and will continue to do so after I potentially leave for college. 

The problems I have with this is that a) it does not excuse the fact that one of the people he is close to is someone who hurt me, b) me leaving for college is, at a minimum, six months away, and even then, I don’t know if I’m leaving at all or even if me leaving would cause a breakup because we’re both willing to attempt long distance, and c) if he has a relatively large social network that he places this much gravity on, then why is my absence so profound especially since we’ve only been dating for three months? 

I honestly don’t know what to do; he’s appalled at my request to attempt some level of isolation from my ex while I feel like that’s a fairly reasonable request. If one of my friends had done something similar to anyone, I would have no hesitation in cutting them off, let alone if they had hurt someone I cared about. It hurts that he’s placing his connection with my ex above what I feel is basic human decency, but I also don't want to infringe on his life too much - I didn't ask him to cut out my ex or take any drastic measures, just see if he can distance himself a little from my ex and see how it goes. I'm at a loss because I want my boyfriend to get the support and help he needs - the last thing I want to do is cut him off from the people who can help him, I just wish that he wasn't getting it from someone who hurt me this badly.

76,"I went to boarding school in England for about 6 years in my teens and whilst it was far from the traditional stereotype of violent initiations and rampant bullying, there were moments of cruelty towards each other. One of these moments randomly sprung to mind today.

 There were four of us in our year who were really close mates, but occasionally we'd play these pranks on each other where we tended to gang up on one member of the group. One time three of us thought it would be really funny to provoke the other by saying how he had ""such an oval head"". I think it was literally the weirdest insult we could come up with (because virtually everyone has an oval-shaped head), but we wanted to see how far we could go with it.

We started doing it ""behind his back"", making sure he  was in earshot, saying shit like: ""dude, have you noticed how oval Benny's head is?"" ""yeah man, it's so weird"". Then we started just blatantly criticising him about it, randomly saying in conversation: ""Benny, why is your head so oval!?"" I think he found it pretty funny at first, but over the space of just a few short days it started to get out of hand. If we were just hanging out and he'd walk in, someone might say something like: ""Hey look guys, it's oval boy!"" and he started to get visibly conscious of the shape of his completely normal head. 

It all came to a head (sorry I couldn't resist) when after a busy day of oval-head-bashing he snapped, told us all to go fuck ourselves and went to bed early, hiding tears from us. We felt really bad and apologised the next day saying we just made it up, and then we kinda just pretended it never happened. The happy ending though is that we are still really good mates, and we often joke about the stupid shit we said and did at school like ovalhead-gate. 

TL;DR, we made a close friend cry because we made him think he had a weirdly oval head.",18Feb2020,1

78,"Hi everyone!

I am typing this post because I really need to get something off my chest.  
I am an 18 year old guy who is ready to enjoy life, but there is something that is holding me back.

One of my few memories of when I was a baby/infant was that my parents divorced when I was 3. I always thought that it didn't really affect me because I never knew something else and switching between staying with my dad or my mom was just normal. Although, other people who I went to elementary school with, thought otherwise. I got bullied physically and mentally by lots of people because I was different. People have straight up laughed about the fact that my parents got divorced and mocked me for it. That's probably not the only reason though, I also was different from the other kids in a few ways. Never really watched cartoons, never played with pokemon or things like that but I preferred to watch discovery channel, national geographic, etc. So I was probably seen as 'the nerdy kid'. This made me really reserved and I often locked myself up in my room. This also made me really antisocial. The fact that I also didn't do any sports or never participated in a youth movement didn't help with that. I grew up with just 2 friends.

When I was about to go to high school (we don't have middle school), I was really excited. Contrary to the fact that I am seen as antisocial, I really like meeting new people. I thought that the 'reserved and antisocial version of myself' would just disappear when entering the doors of high school.  
Sadly enough, this wasn't true at all. I really had a lot of problems actually talking to people because I was afraid of being bullied again. I got to know some people but I stayed with 2 of my old friends from elementary school most of the time.

This made me antisocial and reserved again. I always was standing behind others and didn't dare to talk to people. People just thought that I was more of a silent person but they were okay with that (thank god I didn't get bullied again in high school). After around 5 years in high school, I started to be a little more open, but just with people who I knew really well. When I met people who I never met or I only spoke with sporadically, I was the silent and reserved/awkward guy again. This continued until the last day of high school.

Again, when I was about to go to college I was extremely exited to meet new people. I had 1 friend joining me from high school and we're still in the same class. But instead of meeting new people, I kind of just stayed with this friend and let him introduce me to people he met there (even people who were in my class). I am now in my second semester of college and I am feeling desperate. I am 18 years old, I have never really had a best friend, I have never had a girlfriend, I am still a virgin, etc. and this makes me extremely insecure. The only thing I did since high school was locking myself up in my room, gaming (in high school), watching YouTube (high school and still today). I don't do any sports, and I only have some hobbies that are things that I can just do in my room (music). 

I feel like I am just surviving but not actually living. I don't have goals at all. Recently, I really wanted to get out of this depression-like state and I wanted to turn my life around. The problem was that I don't have a lot of friends to do something with and I also have quite strict parents. I am sometimes allowed to do something in the city with some classmates/friends after school, but I often need to get home by dinner, which makes it hard to actually do anything fun because I only have like 1.5h. I can also only go past my curfew once in around 2 weeks or so.

I feel like it would be way easier if I lived on my own and I could just take my own decisions. But I can't afford that. Now, I live at home with my parents and I have to take public transport to the city where my school is located (also the nearest city and where most of my friends live). Taking the bus to the city takes me around 50min on average or 1h+ when it's rush hour so I can't easily 'just go to the city'.

I really don't know what to do right now because I have the feeling that I am stuck. I am feeling empty, alone, don't communicate with a lot of people outside of school (not even my own parents). I even forget to shower for days, don't study at all, procrastinate homework, etc.

I really have no idea what I should do. That's why I poured everything out over here to see if there is someone who can help me or even just give me a push in the right direction.   
If you are still reading this, thank you so much for your time and hearing my story! You are amazing!

Can anyone help? Please?

Hi my name is Benny and currently life has been a bit weird for me. I’m 18 and life shouldn’t be so complicated but things are different for me. Back in late 2019 I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for a suicide attempt and after I got out I was unsure of what to do with my life. I suffer from ocd and anxiety and was going to college at the time. I had been messing up with my meds and that made me spiral a bit, ok maybe by a lot but you get the idea. I was sent into a room at the hospital that had blood on the wall and not even a bed and no clock or window in an emergency room. I started there for what seemed like days but it had only been 2. I was then sent to a psychiatric hospital where I was scared and wanted to get out. The people in there scared me and I know that sounds mean but at the time I had never been in a psychiatric hospital and I don’t want to ever go back. The also gave me the wrong medication from the one I told them and told my family I was in there for an opioid addiction and not a suicide attempt. Additionally I was in Oregon and was going to school there but when it all happened I was in Oregon, I’m from California. They told me since I was from so far away that it would take 10 days for me to get out. I collapsed into tears cause I was afraid of being locked away with strangers who I was afraid of. I do admit there were nice people in there. There were 2 other people who tried killing themselves and they were much older than me but they understood how I felt. I got out after 2 days sin be my mother waited in there lobby for two days and the people let me go. After I got out I hugged my mother and we went to get cheeseburgers from Carl’s Jr. strangely enough at that time it felt like the best meal of my life. I got back home and made a full recovery with working out, therapy, electrical therapy( not electro shock) and medicine. I worked hard and was able to convince my mother to let me go back to college and sure enough I went back. At first things were fine and I was doing well. Then I went back home for a check up by my psychiatrist and found out my dog had a seizure and died. I was devastated and even worse when I came back to my dorm my roomate/ only friend left and never came back. He was my only friend since al the friends I had in the past where actually really mean to me. I suddenly began to get depressed to the point where I wouldn’t get out of bed cause I felt alone and still grieving. The worst part of the grieving was the fact it reminded me of how my grandmother died when she had cancer and I wasn’t there to say goodbye. I then had to go back home and had to recover a bit. I then decided to go to community college and get my credits there so I could transfer and go to a school that I always wanted to go to, cal arts. I always wanted to learn animation and I’ve been drawing comics for about three years and that the best possible career path would be animation. So currently I’m working hard to get toward my dream of working at Cartoon Network and working there and possibly pitching a show there. Wish me luck.",18Feb2020,1

96,"It’s all inside my head but my chest can’t help but tighten up and squeeze my heart. The lumps build up in my throat and so does the backache one disk at a time. Eventually, you’re all sore and screaming for relief. Nothing helps whether it’s soothing melodies or mindless passtimes, the pain is stubbornly staying.

Every morning and every night, I seek refuge in pills that apparently alter my mind. No matter how strong they are, they never fully erase the pain. Every once while, I’m presented with a new form of pain that I didn’t know existed. Every year, it gets worse as they told me; it would develop into a bigger monster, a prodrome so it was called.

My mood is not mine neither are my emotions. My broken brain is unable to modulate them. Every day, I see things that aren’t there and hear things that don’t exist drilling themselves into my life. All I can do is run for medication and hope that a round pink pill will settle them down in an hour.

I don’t own my thoughts either, rather I fear them more than anything on the planet. Rumination it’s called, a euphemism for a terror of imagined horrible futures and unforgettable pasts. Never will I get peace from my mind, even that dreaded distasteful pill won’t do anything. I’ve taken too much.

The experts tell me that I will live with the monster in my head forever, and that it will never be vanquished. I must live with it and ‘cope’ and ‘manage’ rather than hope for a cure. No matter how hard you practice, no matter how hard you make believe that you live a normal life, it still really hurts in there.",18Feb2020,1

98,"..I grew up with my great grand father. My mother was continuing high school in another state. I didn’t fully live with my mom till I was 4–5. My grandfather raised me to be emotionally sensitive… he never yelled, never whipped me. He taught me to care about everything, especially to love and nurture the nature around me. I saw him as a father figure. But my mother is the opposite. She has a very brutal mouth on her. Fast forward and now I’m 18, saving up money to move out. I have 5 siblings, one of them she bullies to the max.. over the past year, my mother has been gone more frequently. She still entertains this abusive dude she was suppose to break up with. I risked my safety trying to get him to never come back around my family but she CHOSE to continue being with him..So she’s always gone.. I don’t care much, she should stay gone..but she came home yesterday and I noticed something. While I was making food for myself, she started speaking loud, not yelling, but she’s bi-polar she naturally speaks aggressive if she gets agitated. When she spoke loud; my ear started ringing, and she wasn’t even next to me. I struggle to look her in the eyes, I’m always hunkering down like some dog to her, why???? I never noticed how…shy?? I act around her… to the point where I LITERALLY can’t look at her— I’ve ran away from home twice before. one time, she got up in my face yelling and screaming like she was gunna have some street fight with a stranger— ever since that I’ve stopped speaking up for myself around her.

I used to be sure that I knew plenty of cheerful people, but now that my relationships with said people are stronger, all of them have opened up about how they are depressed and dissatisfied with something or other in their lives. I don't believe anyone is actually happy, they're all just hiding

This has definitely been the most painful part of the transition from child to adult. I even found out that my next door neighbour, whom I adore and thought was the cutest happiest old lady in the world, has manic depression and has been in hospitalised multiple times because of it.

My dad hates his job. He hates having to look after my grandma, he hates having to help my brother with uni stuff, and he has hundreds of those awful boomer comics about hating his wife. He even told me never to have kids cause they'll ruin your life.

And faith is all out the window. I can't truly have faith in anything when I know that science has proved it wrong.

What the heck do I have to look forward to? A life of working all day at a job that I hate, going home to a spouse who I resent, and sitting in front of the TV watching the same show I do every night until I go to sleep and redo it all in the morning?

I’m tired of people who come close to me and then they pull away. I must be so uninteresting... even though I do stuff for myself: I go to the gym every effing day, I draw and plan to sell my work, I study music... but I feel something is dead inside. I don’t enjoy going out with friends, nor alcohol, nor parties.... I barely go outside a  1 km area from my house because I panic. Of course I take my meds and see the doc every week.

Still death seeks like the only solution to this pain. I don’t want to die, I wish I could see beauty in life again.

I’ve been looking to get serious about art for a while, but every time I try to discuss it with the only person I trust to talk to about it, she seems to ignore me or put it off. 

I’ve been looking into courses I may want to take, and today I was excited and really nervous to talk about it and it is something I’m extremely passionate about. I’m not usually very passionate about anything. 

I started off, “Well... there is this online class that’s on a really good sale right now, and I’ve been thinking about taking it for a while...” I stared at her for a moment, expecting an answer, but then I realized she hadn’t listened to a single word I said. 

Suddenly she is like, “huh?” I felt like my heart broke then, I feel like for the past few months, maybe even few years she has been like this with me and whenever I’m really excited about something it’s swept under the rug, or she doesn’t want to talk about it, or she “already knows about that”. 

It’s gotten to the point where I don’t feel like talking to her sometimes at all and she always tells me I should communicate with her more, with family more. Me and her are entirely different people. She watches hallmark Christmas love stories all year around. I enjoy watching tv shows like supernatural, and anime’s and things like that. 

She’s pretty strictly into sewing, other things like that, while I’m into stuff that is more modern and whenever I show her art that is more in my style compared to realistic she kind of just stares at it, says it’s good and moves on. But when I show her something more realistic she is always wowed, sometimes it just really ticks me off. 

I usually listen to things she is interested in for hours, how she wants to make soap and sell it, how she wants to make candles and sell it, how she wants to get back into sewing and things like that. 

When I walk up to her and start talking about things I’m interested in, it usually goes how I mentioned up above... 

I know that I’m not necessarily alone... but sometimes it truly feels like I have no one to talk to. I doubt anyone will even read this. 

Whenever we go driving I almost always have to listen to her music and it gives me headaches, but I still put up with it because she almost always drives. When I want to listen to my music she always is like “No” or “Put it on and I will see if I want to listen to it.” Kind of thing. Sometimes she turns it off to focus, which doesn’t really bother me, I understand it’s safety first in driving. 

Every two weeks I’m forced to go with her on a 4+ hour drive down to her pain clinic because she won’t leave me home alone, with 2 big dogs, and 3 smaller dogs, with the risk of someone breaking in even though I’ll be turning 19 this year. 

At some point she usually ends up yelling at me like I’m underaged, or treating me like so. 

Once a month on one of those two weeks, we have to go down to my grandpas to stay while she goes to her pain clinic and we pick up some stuff to take to our new house. 

Last time we were there, which was probably about a week ago, we were packing up to leave when she suddenly storms in my room after I’d just woken up and starts screaming at the top of her lungs at me because I didn’t hear her all the way in her room. 

I’m sitting there shocked and confused, but I get up to go and help her anyways because that was what all this was about, but she says to fucking leave it and that she doesn’t want my help anymore. She then asks me how I couldn’t hear her screaming at the top of her lungs for me in her room, while I could hear her easily back at home. 

I wanted to tell her it was because her room at his house was all the way across the house, while our rooms are literally right next to each other at home. I also have hearing problems, which I’m guessing I inherited from both my moms and dads side because both my dads dad, and my moms mom have hearing problems. 

Usually when she catches me crying after her yelling at me, she will yell at me more, but sometimes the tears just fall and it makes me so angry when I can’t control myself. 

That day I got so angry when I began crying all by myself that I scratched up my arms until they began bleeding and I smacked myself in the face like a dumbass, before I began to cry even more because I felt like an idiot for hitting myself. 

Sometimes I hate how much of a pushover I am, but I hate yelling so much that I do anything to avoid it. Whenever people yell it hurts my ears badly even though it is across the house, maybe in another room. Doesn’t matter, if I hear it, it hurts. 

I hate talking like this so much, but this is the only way to get it out of me because I just want to lose it sometimes.",18Feb2020,1

The prize was 95 million euros. The numbers I play are 7 16 22 36 44 - 3 4. Those were the winning numbers. How the fuck do I come back from this. I didn’t play because I was feeling snackish and I bought a fucking snickers bar instead. What the fuck. If I had just done what I was supposed to do I would have been set for life this very fucking moment. I’m losing it.,18Feb2020,1
