I don‚Äôt understand how someone can say ‚Äúokay, I‚Äôm going to bed now‚Äù and then just go to bed! I know that I need sleep, and I know I‚Äôll be in a horrible mood the next day and feel awful for my lack of sleep, yet I will stay up hours past the time I said I would go to bed, doing nothing particularly useful or productive, just procrastinating sleep.
One of my favourite sleep-procrastination activities is to research ‚Äúhow to go to sleep on time‚Äù or see if anyone else struggles with this. 
It‚Äôs not a physical sleep issue- once I‚Äôm in bed I‚Äôll fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow. It‚Äôs more of a self-sabotage thing, and I have no idea of the cause. 
I do suffer from mild anxiety and frequent nausea due to emetophobia, which often gets worse when I‚Äôm trying to sleep, but usually I‚Äôm too tired for it to bother me.

I found myself smiling, and for the first time in my life I felt something akin to butterflies when I looked at myself. I went back to bed with a warm feeling in my heart. 

I always wondered what it would be like to love me. To walk by me and catch a hint of my perfume or admire my manicured fingernails while I type on my computer. I wondered what it would be like to hear me laugh from even the worst of jokes-- to make me blush with even the slightest flirtation or hear my heels down the hall, knowing that it was me approaching, to watch my skirt flow behind me when I leave the room.

I always wondered what it would be like to be loved by me. To take a daring kiss on the cheek from the girl who leaves red lipstick stains on the ones she adores. To receive a love letter spritzed with Chanel No. 7 and stained with midnight tears full of longing. I wondered what it was like to be loved among the stray kittens that I cuddled on my lace dresses and the chickadees fed by my bird feeders hung on my sacred trees. To receive carefully picked and hand knit gifts when my heart longs for love. 

To wake up beside me and catch a glimpse of my pretty face in the moonlight. And now I know, and now I learn slowly to fall in love with myself again.",16Nov2020,1

Basically, I need to analyze agents of socialization, roles/responsibilities, parent/family influence on children within the episode. 

I've watched up to s6e3, so any episode within that would be great. Or it's also fine if it's later in the show too. As long as it's a juicy episode with tons to analyze!

Hey fucker, 
I hope you remember me haha

I‚Äôm you from the past. Yeah, I know right? It‚Äôs weird that I‚Äôm writing to myself. 
How are you doing? Are you still the dumbass me? Or have I grown up to be even more than a fuck up than I am now? 

Either way, love yourself dude. I seriously mean it. I know we‚Äôve been through some shitty years especially 2019-2020. We are 25 years old right now. 
Yup, around the time she left you. Hopefully you‚Äôre over her. If not, I understand why not. It hurts right? Thinking about her? Yeah but trust me I‚Äôm doing my best to get us better for the future. 

You better not being doing any hard drugs haha 
I know I‚Äôve fucked up our body extensively over the last 10 years and I‚Äôm sorry about that. Its been a shitty decade but why am I telling you if you know that already. 

I want to be serious with you. 

Lmao I dont know why I‚Äôm getting emotional talking to myself in the future. 
But I want to tell something. 

I‚Äôm not disappointed in you at all. We tried our best. We gave love to those we cared for. I dont know if our bad luck ever ends. Chances are we aren‚Äôt with anyone. Probably because we don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone else or we couldn‚Äôt find the same connection as we did with that girl. Yeah, the one that starts with a J. 

Ill never be disappointed or mad at you or me. No matter how many people hurt us, we have to be strong, carry on and still give our all to anyone in our way. Whether it be a partner or friend. 

Never ever stop being the way we were. Dont change for anyone. We probably will have plenty more of obstacles to go through in life. Dont worry, I‚Äôll try my best to make future me happy. 

Remember John McKenzie? The tall white dude that you were friends in middle school and high school. He always looked out for you even though no one fucked with us. Do you remember what he told us the last day of high school? The thing he said that has stuck to me even after 7 years?

He said,‚Äù never change who you are. You‚Äôre a great friend and you look out for others. Take care and keep being who you are. Never change‚Äù

Why did that stick with me? Because you know that we are too emotional and we can sometimes feel the vibe that tells us something. Like foreshadowing. 

That weird feeling that tingles through our body. That makes our neurons in our brain fire faster. The chill that runs down the spine. That feeling that hits us right in the heart cause we know that they meant it. 

You‚Äôre not overthinking these connection my dude. We arent. We read into peoples words and expressions. We analyze every single things to see the true intentions of people. 

Tell me why we get so fucking lucky but at the same time bad luck? 
I dont know lol maybe you will know by then. 

How many times have you gotten lucky with things that makes you think,‚Äù why the fuck do things happen that I‚Äôd never expect or the fucking coincidences after saying something?

Let me remind you of some of those times 

New York- it was Fourth of July and you were with A and we didn‚Äôt know where to go to see them since there was so many tall buildings. But you said,‚Äù let‚Äôs go outside and try to see the fireworks‚Äù you said that to A disappointed cause you know it‚Äôll be too late. 
But once we got in the elevator of the hotel, a maintenance guy was in there. You asked them where was the best place to see the fireworks.

He said,‚Äù I got you‚Äù and he took out his keys, put it on the keyhole for the elevator and he pressed the button all the way on the top. The highest level. And trust me, it was fucking high. You might still have the pictures. But goddamn, that view was gorgeous. Good thing we weren‚Äôt cheap with the hotel and it was one of the tallest around. He opened a window and said,‚Äù be careful you can stick your head out if you want. We did and goddamn I felt amazing. 

The day prior to Fourth of July in NY, I  stupidly was drunk as fuck and I tell A that I was going out to look for weed. We were both fucked up. As I was walking drunk in NY at night, I randomly met this guy asking if I had a lighter. I did. He lit up a joint. I was like damn do you have weed. And he‚Äôs like,‚Äù yeah back at my hotel‚Äù. 
I dont know why we do dangerous, sketchy things but we always take the chance. 

He called a cab and said let‚Äôs go. Ill run in and get it. So we did. We got to his hotel, waited in the cab and he came back with 8 THC oil. He gave me 3 and one to the cab driver. He told the cab guy to take us to this bar. At this point, I totally forgot about A lmao

We got to the bar. Remember, we were drunk and barely 21 and the bouncer was a big black dude. He was cool and didn‚Äôt believe I was 21 but he let us in. The dude we met ordered two shots each and one for the bartender lady. 

We drank so fucking much dude. More than 10 shots each. Then we saw this Asian dude who was lonely. His gf just broke up with him and the guy told him if he wants to join us and he‚Äôs pay for the drinks. 

I‚Äôm like,‚Äù dude, that‚Äôs a lot of money. And he‚Äôs like,‚Äù I‚Äôll make it back.‚Äù  I‚Äôm like what do you even do for work. 

Guess where he worked? He was one of the dudes that filmed The Deadliest Catch. You might be thinking how can you trust him. He told us his name and we looked him up and yup he wasn‚Äôt lying. He said he‚Äôs leaving next morning to Florida for Fire and Forged on Discovery I believe. 

So it‚Äôs like 2 AM, all three of us were the last ones in the bar and we go outside and the bouncer is laughing and saying how fucked we were. He was cool though. He took a picture of the three of us. And then the Asian dude left. And the dude is like,‚Äù wanna get cocaine?‚Äù I‚Äôm like dude I have no money. And he‚Äôs like dude, I got you. 

We walked around and a group of black guys starting asking us if we wanted cocaine. The guy whispers to me, follow my lead and when I run , you run. 
I was like wtf. So we go to the grocery store so he can take money. But he was pretending and I saw him look at me and nodded. That meant I‚Äôm about to run follow me. 

We some how got away from the group of guys and I asked him why we run. He‚Äôs like,‚Äù they were gonna rob us.‚Äù I‚Äôm like wtf. 
The whole time I forgot about A lol

This guy and I walked around until 5 AM. We stopped by the big train station. I forgot the name and he‚Äôs like already dude nice to meet you I have to go catch a plane. And I was like dude how? Lol 
He‚Äôs like I‚Äôm good. 

So i head back to the hotel and A is sleeping but wakes up. She starts yelling at me and I‚Äôm like ,‚Äù ü§´ i got this‚Äù I showed her the Thc pills and was like I don‚Äôt care about that. I was worried about you. 

EP- I randomly tell A,‚Äù don‚Äôt you think people are most likely to lose a purse or money while it‚Äôs raining?‚Äù And she‚Äôs like idk and why are you thinking of that. I was like,‚Äù idk.‚Äù 
The next day it was raining bad and we were walking to wingstop and on the way back, there is a small purse on the floor. I look at her and I‚Äôm like,‚Äù see‚Äù 

Oak Park- we were with J. We went to whole foods and got groceries and food to make. We ended up getting two steaks that cost $45 bucks. We are checking out and the lady told us the total. I was extremely confused cause it should‚Äôve been way more but I realized that she didn‚Äôt scanned the steaks and already put it in the bag. I was about to say something but I shut up. 
Fuck yeah, free streaks that cost $45. 

2009-2013- how many times did we get in trouble with the cops and always got away? So many fucking times. 
 
Freshman Year- we took a lot of Xanax and drank a lot at the house. We were outside with a few people. You and A go inside to get alcohol. We mixed everything together. And to this day, I‚Äôm not sure if anyone was home lol

We go outside and I was like WTF. The whole backyard was filled with people. Definitely more than 50. I guess Kevin called people and they told their friends and yeah. 
We were all smoking, drinking and do all these drugs. 

My neighbor then tells me that they called the cops. So I tell at everyone to fucking get out of here. No one understood me since I was slurring my words so Kevin yells at everyone and says follow Carlos. Cops are coming. I told Kevin to tell everyone not to run and to act casual. 

Yeah, like a group of 50+ people walking down the alley and I‚Äôm in front leading them to who knows where lmao

We walked one block down the alley and we are surrounded by cops. One cop car to the left and another to the right. The cops asked us what are you guys doing. No one spoke up and I turned to look at them all and they looked at me as if I was the one suppose to talk. 

So I spoke and said,‚Äù nothing officer, we are just walking‚Äù how stupid was that? Lmao

The cop is like we got two noise complaints. I was like,‚Äù yes I‚Äôm sorry about that. I told everyone to leave. I‚Äôm sorry officer.‚Äù 

They cops looked at each other and said alright,‚ÄùSince you guys did the right thing, we ain‚Äôt got trouble here.‚Äù 
That‚Äôs when Kevin , the dumbass booked it. The cops knew him and went after him and told us to carry on. 

The next day, I find out Kevin broke his probation and was in jail. 

Sophomore Year- aldrin, Sierra and I decided to take a lot of Xanax. It was July 1st. We got 10 Xanax at first. We split it three way. Apparently we wanted more and we were already blacking out but we got more. (We found out how many we took when I asked my guy how many I bought) 

We started July 1st and we were blacked out until Fourth of July. I woke up to my mom telling me that the cops were outside asking for me. 

I was still fucked up and kept going in and out of conscious. I go to the door and say yeah to the cops. They are like,‚Äù are you carlos ?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah why?‚Äù
‚ÄúPlease turn around. We are taking you to the station‚Äù 
‚Äú for what‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk about it over there‚Äù 
They handcuffed me and took me to the station. They took me to a room and started asking questions. It‚Äôs illegal to question someone under the influence so whatever I said was voided. 

After giving them a hard time, they took me to the holding cell in the basement. Goddamn, I was cold and literally a bed made of stone was the only thing there and an urinal. I‚Äôm like fuck it, I‚Äôll take a nap. 

Who know how many hours later, they come and let me out and said Youre free to go. I‚Äôm like,‚Äù what the fuck that was pointless‚Äù and they were like,‚Äù well you honestly didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. The dad of that girl was exaggerating but she did end up in the hospital for possibly OD.  

She was fine. The parents just overreacted. 
When I left the police station, it was dawn. I was like fuck I was here all morning and mid afternoon. 

I walk back home and I realized the whole time I was wearing shorts without my boxers. Guess where were my boxers?
At her house lmao 

She did give me them back a couple days later. 

Junior Year- we were stopped so many fucking times at night since i walked back and forth from home or friends house to A house, which is on the opposite side of the town. I‚Äôd get stopped and questioned. At this point, I knew every single cop. 
 
One time, they suspected that i robbed a gas station. So I was wearing a Blackhawks sweater and it was red. So around 2 am that cops shine the light at me and right away I stopped and took out my hands from my pockets. (Around this time, there was so many incidents where cops were shooting people by accident thinking they were reaching for a weapon.

They get out of the car and shine the light right at my face and they are like ID please. So I said,‚Äù alright. It‚Äôs in my back pocket. Just letting you know.‚Äù And I got it and give it to them. 

One of the officers tells the other guy to get the paper from the car. He comes back with this paper and they put it in front of them and compare it to me. 
They were like,‚Äù hmm, is it him?‚Äù The other cop was like,‚Äù naw not at all.‚Äù

They then said,‚Äù sorry we thought you were the guy who robbed the gas station‚Äù
And then he‚Äôs like,‚Äù here take a look‚Äù 

I grabbed the paper and said right away joking around,‚Äù just because I have a red sweater and Mexican.‚Äù They laughed and said no but do you see why we thought it was you. And I was like yeah I was joking. 

As they left, I‚Äôm like,‚Äù hey officers, I have a question‚Äù they said ‚Äúyeah‚Äù 
Can i use this as a ID and I showed them my passport card. 
They were like,‚Äù yeah I don‚Äôt see why not and it‚Äôs government issued so even better. Why you ask‚Äù 

‚Äú cause the last at the same gas station wouldn‚Äôt let me buy cigarettes‚Äù and they said well you could use it tell them we said so lol and they left 

Senior year- you got into a fight at school and they called the cops but the other kid confessed that he initiated and the cops said you‚Äôre good. Let the principal deal with you. 
I got a week of out of school suspension. 

There were so many other incidents but those are the major ones. 
Why did I remind you of all of this?

Cause we tend to forget things and it‚Äôs to show me in the future that we‚Äôve gotten better, hopefully. 

Well this is one of many letters Im leaving for me (future me) to read and see why I‚Äôm proud of ourselves and why I‚Äôm not disappointed at us. 

We lived life and we will continue to.

When I was little, I assigned numbers personalities, and genders. I think I only really did 1-10, 20, and 100.

I was probably like 6. I don't know why I did this, but I would end up spending maths working on the story arc of these numbers whilst I did my questions. It's going to sound stupid but, here are some of them-

1- Is an adult, even though ironically the smallest number. Sort of plain, responsible, helps 2 look after 3 even though 2 is kind of childish like 3.

2-  Is best friends with three; close with one. Helps 3 stay out of trouble but isn't as old as 1.

3- cRaCkHeAd EneRgY (sort of). Like a little child, always up to something, usually mischievous.

4- Best friends with 5, and 8 is like an older brother to them. They're pretty chill, always hanging out with five.

5- Friends with 4. Is a prince as I guess I decided they were the son of 10, who is the king?? Chill, fun to be around.

6- Just 7's yesman tbh. Friends with 7. Follows them around, always with them.

7- Shallow, jealous, probably likes 8 ngl. Usually with 6 and/or talking to 8. Sort of rude, would talk crap about you behind your back.

8- Like an older brother to 4, but started hanging out with 16 and giving 4 less attention, so they're hurt. Kind of basic.

9- I guess I decided they're a princess? Sister of 5 and daughter of 10. Sort of like 7; shallow, moody.

10- King, sort of wise, brothers with 20. Kind, looks out for people.

100- Grandfather, ex-king, father of 10 and 20, very wise and very old, kind, caring.

20- Just 10 but basic and is a prince I guess since 10 is king.

26,"I know, this sounds quite peculiar. What I mean is that I wish to disassociate myself from human beings. Humanity as a whole is just so brutally horrible, and I see no benefits. If I actually believed in reincarnation, I'd like to be reincarnated as soon as possible as a dog, bird, alien species...quite literally anything else.

I do not like humans. In fact, most of my hatred and general issues are caused by human nature. If not for human nature, I believe I would be happy. However, the destructive, hateful, cruel, ignorant, arrogant, and generally unlikeable nature of human beings is inescapable. One cannot simply stop being human.

However, one thing I've come to realize in the last decade or so is that we have the power to change our identities. To properly fit them to how we feel, what we identify as, or to mold them to better suit our desires and needs. For instance, I've always claimed to be male, but I don't feel that I am. I'm gender fluid, and somewhere in the middle, not really sure where I belong on that spectrum. Just happy to exist and be acknowledged.

Well...from today on, I'd like to identify as something other than human. I don't feel like I've ever fit in as a human being. I've always felt alien, though validated in my thoughts or beliefs, no matter who chose to agree or disagree. I'm not human, and I don't want to be anymore. I want to be anything else. Anything.

Using them kind of like therapists. To make up for that I would do anything and everything they asked of me. I was a pushover and would take anything someone threw at me. Insult me to my face? Wouldn‚Äôt say anything. I saw it at a price I had to pay. I would try to be perfect so that people would like me. Then I would constantly break social boundaries and be overly invested in the friendship. I realize now that by over sharing my emotional baggage I would make people feel guilty for wanting to leave the friendship. If I did or said something that made me think I was toxic I would punish myself by doing more for other people. Emotionally draining myself. I made a lot of short term friendships  but ended up pushing people away and making them hate me. I‚Äôm ashamed of what I did and am making progress towards fixing myself. However, I wonder if my life will ever repair itself. Will I ever have more friends? Will my past failed friendships recover? Will people hate me forever? Will life ever get better?",16Nov2020,1
33,"Obviously, I'm not the best at the dating game, but I sometimes wonder if it's because I subconsciously don't really want to be in a relationship.

Me, my cousin, and his girlfriend all went out to a bar the other night. It's one of the few times I have ever been in my life. As soon as we walk in this cute blonde girl is very obviously checking me out, and I mean obviously. My cousin even pointed it out to me.

I should be happy, right? This is what I've always wanted, or so I tell myself. All my hard work improving myself has finally paid off. Obviously I am ecstatic... but not really. My first thought is, ""I want to leave."" An opportunity has presented itself and I have no desire to take it.

Luckily, I get my wish and we end up leaving cause it's kind of packed and we don't want to wait on the slow service for drinks. As I'm leaving she is just straight up staring at me. Her head turned and followed me as I walked past her like she is some NPC in a Bethesda game. I stare straight ahead and pretend not to notice her. Crisis averted.

So, yeah, maybe I don't really want to be with someone as bad as I thought. Maybe I was just chickening out. Maybe all I really like is the thought of someone finding me attractive. I don't know, but there seems to be something going on because I got what I've always thought I wanted and then turned it down.",16Nov2020,23

35,"
I was just sitting in the living room and all I can hear is the wind howling outside. I swear each year the weather is becoming more violent. 

Anyways, for some reason the sound of the wind outside made me want to feel pain. I wanted to feel hurt in some way. Not like cutting myself. It‚Äôs a different hurt I want to feel. 

I wanted to feel the the burn of the cold wind hitting my skin. So i went outside. 
I feel like I deserve to feel hurt. I‚Äôm used to getting my feelings hurt but I wanted to feel a different type of pain. 

I think I love to be hurt. I started thinking of when I was in high school. I was young, careless, impulsive and reckless. That was 11 years ago. 

I realized I‚Äôm still young. 25 is young, right?im still careless in some ways. I‚Äôm definitely impulsive still and I still do reckless things. 

I remember when I used to burn myself with a lot cigarette for no reason. Did i like to feel pain? Right now, I‚Äôm looking at all the scars on my hand and arm. I can still remember how I got each one. Some were by accident, some on purpose. 

My knuckles are scarred up from punching things all the time in high school and from playing a brutal bloody knuckles game with my friend. That was a fun day. It was sophomore year in HS and my friend and I were at Burger King and decided to play for the hell of it. 

On my wrist, I have scars from when I used to cut myself with a razor that I kept in the American Idiot CD case back in Middle School. I remember just watching the blood just roll down my arm. I dont know how I was able to do that cause now I wouldn‚Äôt be able to. Ive found a new way to self-harm. I went from cutting to just self medicating myself with drugs. Lots of drugs. 

On my forearm, I have a couple of cigarette burns. I like the intensity. The thought of doing something that I know will hurt. 

On my elbows, the scars remind me of the time I‚Äôd fall off my bicycle when I was barely learning to use it. Some scars are from when I learned to rollerblade and didn‚Äôt know how to stop.

On my bicep, a tattoo. It‚Äôs technically a scar. I‚Äôd get a tattoo every time I was at my lowest  

On my thighs on both sides scarred from tattoos. 

My knees scared from falling on the bike and rollerblades. 

My left lower leg almost completely covered entirely by tattooed, while my right lower leg is empty except from a few scars from when I accidentally hit my shin with the skateboard. 

On my Achilles heel, scars from the one time my uncle borrowed me his shoes since my shoes didn‚Äôt match my outfit and since he‚Äôs a shoe size bigger and I wore them all day, it left scars from the shoe constantly rubbing on my heel until they both were bleeding. 

My right palm of my hand, the webbing between my thumb and pointing finger, is a scar and memories of my first stitches off when I stupidly was cutting an apple while holding it and the brand new parring knife went through the apple and through the webbing. That day was the most I‚Äôve bled to the point that I was about to pass out at the ER. 

And lastly, my heart scared from all the times I‚Äôve been broken-hearted or disappointed by a loved one. 

I should be used to the pain, right?
No. I‚Äôm not. 
I give people chance after chance after breaking me down each time. I never learn my lesson. I‚Äôm too generous most of the time. I keep hoping people will change. 

Then once I get fed up with them tearing me apart, i finally let my dark side out. 
And still, I‚Äôm teared down after standing up for myself. It‚Äôs funny how they don‚Äôt see how many times they hurt me but when I fuck up once, I don‚Äôt get another chance. 

So I sit in the cold. My toes freezing since I only have on socks and slippers. 
My hands freezing as I type this. And yet, I sit here embracing the cold when I could easily stop myself from feeling cold and go inside in the warmth. 

But what‚Äôs the point of going inside? 
I feel uncomfortable due to feeling claustrophobic, overwhelmed by the sounds everyone makes, feeling not part of the family as they see me differently after showing them the real me and the loneliness that always creeps only at nights. 

I could be laying down under a warm blanket, being all comfortable and safe. 
But I don‚Äôt. 

Why?

Cause at nights, I miss having a warm body next to me. I miss being able to turn and kiss someone goodnight and getting all comfortable by cuddling. I miss randomly waking up in the middle of the night and hearing them snore. But what I miss the most is waking up and seeing the one you love barely waking up and I‚Äôm just smiling as they open their eyes. Always waking up before them and waiting for them to wake up so I can kiss them and say good morning. To lay for a couple of minutes while we cuddle a bit before getting up. 

That‚Äôs why I hate sleeping. Ive always have. My mind goes into a rabbit hole every night. Thinking of random things or replaying how the day went. Thinking of the things I regret saying or not doing. Every night, my mind tortured me with irrational thoughts. 

But all of it goes away when there‚Äôs someone there with you at night. Distracting me from those thoughts I hate. 
But there‚Äôs no one next me at nights. 

The way to cope with feeling lonely, depressed and insomnia is by using drugs. Yeah, I know pathetic, right?
But that‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôve learned to cope for the last 12-13 years. The people I tend to give my heart to end up always leaving. Always finding someone better than me. 

It literally gets me depressed every night knowing the one I love is in bed with another person that isn‚Äôt me. They get to sleep next to the one I cared for. They get to wake up and go to sleep next to them. So what do I do? 

Instead of of dealing with those thoughts all night, I take a sedative to knock me out. I drink until my mind is blank. I take Xanax to make me randomly knock out. I smoke weed to make me feel comfortable with all the pillows making me feel like someone is next to me. 

What am I trying to say? 
I‚Äôm trying to say that I feel lost and lonely in this big world. It makes me feel worthless. Pathetic. As if I didn‚Äôt exist. 

All my life I‚Äôve felt lonely. For the last 13 years, since I was 12, suicidal thoughts have always been in my mind. 
It‚Äôs kinda hard not to think of suicide when everyone around me, including my family, didn‚Äôt care much for me. 

Growing up with an abusive, narcissistic father who would belittle me to make himself feel powerful and in control. Constantly moving or staying with a different family member each year. The constant changing of schools, which made it hard to make friends since I knew it was temporary. When I‚Äôd stay with my dad, he‚Äôd be gone for days since he‚Äôd stay at his GF place. And when he came back after a few days, he‚Äôd always have a reason to yell at me. Always feeling like I was a burden to him. Or the times I stayed with my mom and she couldn‚Äôt handle my behavior so she sent me to live with my dad. It just made me feel like i was unwanted everywhere. 

Then 8th grade came to an end. I couldn‚Äôt stand living with my dad since he never was home and when he was, I‚Äôd be hit or yelled at. 
So I had no choice but to get my stuff in a bag and walk to my moms and asking if I could stay with her instead. 

But it didn‚Äôt get better. What did she expect from all that they put me through? I was a rebellious teenager. Never listened and always did what I wanted to do. And what I hated the most was the threats of calling my dad and saying if I don‚Äôt get better, I‚Äôll be living with my dad again. 

So what did I do Sophomore year in high school?
I started living at my gf at the time house. 
Her mom didn‚Äôt mind as she knew my story and why I didn‚Äôt like being home. She treated me as if I was part of their family. 

I ended living with them until I was 22. Seven years I lived with my ex. From age 15 to 22, when she decided to break up with me. 

I had no choice but to go back home. But I couldn‚Äôt be around my family still. So I‚Äôd stay over my friends house since he too knew about my life. He didn‚Äôt mind at all. I mean it was perfect since his roommate were my friends as well and they had a small living room, where I‚Äôd sleep. We‚Äôd party everyday and do tons and tons of drugs. 

Then fast forward two years later and my other friend ends up buying a house. He asked me if I would want to go and stay with him since it was literally a few minutes away from my job and we were good friends at the time. 
But I was hesitant since his girlfriend and I were messing around. 
So I said idk. 

Then the day came that he needed help moving. I helped him and then after finishing, he asked if I wanted to stay for the night. I said sure since I had no way to go back home, which was 30-35 minutes away. 
Then the next day, he‚Äôd ask if I wanted to stay over and chill again. I said sure. Basically every day after the first day, he‚Äôd hint if I wanted to keep staying. That went on for a couple of months until he found out about his gf and I. 
So I had to go back home since I mean it‚Äôs pretty obvious, he didn‚Äôt want to hang out anymore. 

As you can see, I spent most of my life away from my family. I never felt like I fitted in with them. I hate them honestly. They are all hypocrites and have narcissistic personalities. They were all into business and banking, while I was all about science. 
I thought differently than they did. I never agreed with them. 

I‚Äôm not writing this for anyone to read. I‚Äôm writing this for myself. To let out my emotions and frustration from all the shit in my life. To remind me that I‚Äôm worthless. That I‚Äôll always be lonely and that I‚Äôll be lonely for the rest of my life since no one seems to stay in my life. 

Likes shit, I had a decent amount of friends back then. 
But now, I honestly barely have one friend. 
The one that I used to stay with and was friends with his roommates. 

But that friendship has been slowly deteriorating. When this Covid shit began and the girl I loved left at the same time, I spent every day with my friend being all depressed and negative towards everything. At first, I‚Äôd stay over everyday the first few months after Covid started. But as I was depressed and frustrated from her leaving, I started randomly leaving without warning from my friends house I told him why I did that. It was the girl I loved that was frustrating me and I didn‚Äôt want to put my anger towards my friend so I‚Äôd leave randomly as soon as I got in a bad mood. I usually end up walking for hours after randomly leaving his place. I‚Äôd end up back home around midnight almost every night. I wouldn‚Äôt go inside. I‚Äôd stay and sleep in the back staircase since I didn‚Äôt want to interact with my family. 
Then I slowing stopped hanging out with my friend. I wanted to be isolated and alone. I started getting bad with drugs and my friend would sometimes come to my house to pick up weed and he‚Äôd tell me I looked horrible and that I needed to sleep and lay off the drugs. When he told me that, It kinda pissed me off and started talking even less to him. 
Now, we barely talk and rarely hangout. 

I fuck up all my relationships. I do this to myself. I cant blame the girl that left me. I have only myself to blame. And this is why I truly fucking hate myself. 

Fuck my life 
Seriously fuck this fucking life",16Nov2020,1
36,"I can't take this anymore. I can't take despising every aspect of myself, down to what chromosomes I have in the nuclei in my cells. Down to what's between my legs.

I try so, so hard to pretend to be someone I'm not. I try so hard to act like I like who I am. But I despise every second pretending to be what everyone thinks I am.

I hate being a boy. I have having a penis. I'd give so much to have been born with a vagina and naturally develop breasts as a part of puberty. I want long hair and a plump butt. Every day when I put on sweatpants, Nikes shoes, t-shirts, etc., I look at myself in sadness and disappointment. Every day, as I watch my nascent beard continue to grow, I feel detached from my body. I want to be totally hairless aside from my eyebrows and the hair on my scalp, which I want more of.

I want to wear girls clothes. I want to burn every pair of boxers I own and replace them with tight, cute panties. I want to wear Vans, Converse shoes, boots, skinny jeans, leggings, denim shorts, overalls, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, tutus, etc.

I have a Sephardic Jewish/southern European skintone, and I hate it. I want southeast Asian skin. I don't know why, but I do.

I feel so ugly, and when everyone tells me a bunch of girls secretly are in love with me, and every says I look beautiful, I feel like I'm being lied too. I feel like I'm a goblin and everyone sees me as a phoenix. It's so bizarre.

I hate my face. I hate my small eyes, huge nose, tiny face, huge skull, large hands, and small mouth. I want the opposite of all of that. And I hate pretending to be content just so I don't look insecure and look like a pussy.

And I despise how everyone slams all these expectations on my shoulders. My family expects me to be the next intellectual. My father is trying to shove my name into the great scientists and philosophers of human history. When I told him I didn't want to be a well-known intellectual or activist, he seemed bemused.

I can name like one conversation in the last 5 years I had with my aunt that wasn't about ethical philosophy, psychology, or politics. Our relationship more closely resembles that of Friedrich Nietzsche and Paul Ree and opposed to a boy and his aunt.

My family always tells me how proud they are of me. Every adult who interacts with me acts like I'm smarter than Einstein. But I don't want that. I just want to be a normal kid and have fun.

Halloween, video games, time with friends, etc. have all been taken from me because no, I have to write my next dissertation on the geopolitical background of the Franz Ferdinand assassination. I like these subjects, that's why I was pushed into them, but I don't want it to be my life.

I was pushed into maturity at such a young age. And now I want everything I didn't get then. Hoppity hop balls, bounce houses, video games, Pokemon cards, teddy bears, cartoons like Adventure Time and We Bare Bears.

But I worry that my family would think once I gain independence (I plan on being a history teacher as an adukt) and use it to become who I've wanted to be for years now.

What will they think when they come over to my home to be greeted by a woman who looks southeast Asian wearing leggings, a sweater, and lace-up boots - the person was once a Sephardic Jewish - Czech youth. Then as they walk into their small, split-level home to gaze upon Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and We Bare Bears posters accompanied by a giant Snorlax beanbag, dozens of toys arranged on a shelf supporting a tv playing Gravity Falls. They look upon to see dozens of Pokemon plushies, teddy bears, a gumball machine, and cotton candy maker - what will they think?

When they were 14, they were discussing the economics of the post-Soviet world. Now they're lounging in a Snorlqx bean bag playing Scribblenauts and binging Adventure Time. What will they think?

It took me a second to process what I heard but after that I bolted up went to my roommate knocked on his door to alert him something was up (fully forgetting he wears range earplugs to bed) Grabbed a cleaver out of the kitchen and went to knock on my neighbors door. 

Note: it is 4:20 (~~blaze~~) AM at this point and I‚Äôm knocking on a door to do welfare check on people who I‚Äôve only met in passing while they walked their dogs. No answer after 2 knocks so I went back to my place just to make sure cops didn‚Äôt show up to find me with a knife tucked behind my shirt before the sun came up even up.  Just as I was closing the door I heard the neighbor door open and I see a light come outside. A half naked dude comes out with a bat. I ask if everything is alright, said I heard a scream the girl comes outside.

Apperantly she had a night terror that someone was climbing in through the window- her boyfriend was trying to calm
her down when I knocked on the door which then made them think that there was *actually* there which prompted BF to get a weapon to check outside.

Where I wish to be, I will not find

Where some want me, I shall avoid

Where you find me, I shall enjoy

Our time will not be the same

This life diluted by such a childish game

We have no hope to meet each other

Greet each other

For when we do, our looks defeat each other

Find your heart within your chosen lover

For this time is imperfect

It is a failure by force

Take heed that you should love yourself

No more reaching for another

Reach into your heart, your mind

Find yourself willing to be kind

Lies betrayed are all we find

Define your character with truth

Who you are, grasping at stars

Not lost, nor forgotten

Known for decades unknown to some

They cannot take our past with their present

What is true may not be right

Still worthy of the willingness to fight

Incapable it seems

Through the warm light that glows

Brighter, hard and painful does the white light shine

Not mine

Never to be, not for me

You will see

This new world is brokenness

I stand defenseless with my outspokenness

Belonging to another place

As I see your face

It all becomes clear with nothing to fear

Only your memory to hold dear

So long as this memory of your voice is found

My choices will be bound

So long as the words whispered softly while alone

So many hours and weeks to years upon the phone

So long as they exist within my mind

You will be the only comfort that I find

So long, so long",16Nov2020,1

Well. Initially we connected because his Facebook profile photo was him in a chicken suit, holding raw chicken. But I digress.

I know I met him somewhere before. It‚Äôs always been this feeling deep inside me, that he‚Äôs stupid familiar. I just have no idea where. The funny thing is, we had countless chances to meet before we actually did.

He went to middle school A and high school B. I went to middle school B and high school A. As such, we had a ton of friends in common, but none super close. Mostly acquaintances. 

He also came across my tinder profile months before meeting me (his friend swiped left after taking his phone from him) and my ifunny profile (I know.) even further back. Keep in mind, this dude doesn‚Äôt have a lying bone in his body. I 100% believe him.

57,"So last year, I took a DNA test through MyHeritage DNA and learned that I had quite an interesting cocktail of DNA

I was ~58% italian, ~12% irish, ~15% South American, and ~9% African. 

Now the only pureblood Italian in my family is my grandma(or so we thought), my grandpa is pureblood Irish and my dad's side of the family are Puerto Rican(maybe some Italian ancestry there? We're not sure)

So that means that genetically I take after my grandmother the most.

And she ended up taking a genetics test too. It turns out she's 25% Jewish  and 75% italian and a couple of our genetic regions overlapped in that sector. She has North African DNA too, except her North African DNA is more narrowed down as Sephardic Jewish. Which means that I do contain Jewish blood as little as it is!

I know this doesn't mean much, but I've always thought it would be cool to have Jewish ancestry. I'm not about to be one of those ""I'm 1/16th Native American"" people who put on a ceremonial headress to their all white family reunion. But still. I find some cool joy in having that relation.

64,"He burned all the bridges I tried to build. I don't think I tried enough but I also don't think he would have crossed any.

I am thousands of kilometers away from him and from anyone in my family of origin. 14 years ago he broke the relationship (or what was left of it) between him and his two daughters. We were heart broken but we also agreed ultimately that it was for the best. He was always a conflictive person, a conflictive dad. Anytime he announced a visit we braced for whatever was the worse possible outcome. He did so many weird things based on his paranoia, distrust, but he was sometimes warm, he could even sound wise. He is a smart man and is deeply troubled. Most people who know him don't know this, or how deep it goes, or how much it has been a hurtful thing that has even made him believe and preach his own twisted version of reality. He is a hurt soul and he hurt us too and now he is dying, alone and bitter, unable to breathe, unable to connect.

I went to visit him when I knew he was sick a year and a half ago. I flew back to my home country determined to see him and listen to him, I know it would be hard and painful or maybe not, but still, there was always this deep fear every time I knew I would see him. I went. I sat. I held his hand while he told me about the cancer and the tumors, about money (always so important to him), and about my sister and me. Ally these hateful things, this made-up memories that he has repeated to himself to justify whatever he has chosen to do to not face his own actions and deflect blames and construct new ones for us to wear.i listened. I could only bring myself to say that I remembered things differently. Why argue. Why bother. I just wanted to be there for him. He was the exact same as always. I left heartbroken, again.

Today my head feels heavy. I've had a headache all afternoon that makes me think of him ant the tumors in his back, head, and the new ones in his nose. I ask my uncle for news regularly. Before this, I just looked at my dad's whatsapp to see if he had been online lately, which meant he was still alive. He is not using the phone anymore. He is not doing anything anymore besides struggling to breathe and having the doctors agree to do more and more radiation treatments. 

I wish he had done something for his mental health. We were a great family, I thought when I was little. We had everything I thought was needed. My parents loved each other, and they seemed to love us too. He had a good job we were healthy. I remember the first time a classmate told me that her parents had never beaten her. I asked her what? I did not know that was possible. That day a very slow process started in me that has never ever ended. The vision of myself and my origin changed. The expectations of life. The image of authority. The notion of love. 

I have lost my father many times. I am about to lose him again. I have mourned in many ways many times. I don't think this will be the last one. I have him in me, I look like him, I catch myself trying not to be him. I love him. I miss him. I mourn him. Good bye.",16Nov2020,4
65,"Instead of repeating his name, I said ""fuck off I hate you"", I say fuck off tons to distract myself from the memories so that's normal but I don't know if I was saying ""I hate you"" to myself for embarrassing myself or about him. I don't hate him but I don't like him as much as I did, I still think he's a great person but I can't idealise him really anymore. I don't hate myself either, I hate parts of me and my memories.

I say I hate you sometimes to the memories but it's normally just with the people in the memories that I hate.

It would be a big step if I disliked the person since I used them as my main coping method. In that and other situations so I'd be curious to see how it effects it, if I'd still use their old name, they go by a slightly different name now but I still use the original one because that's literally just my coping method, it's hard to change a habit. Also if I develop a new one or completely stopped using it. I'll still likely say fuck off constantly or grab my head which I try not to do because it makes me seem crazy, 

I wonder if without him being my coping method, if it'll just be hate.",16Nov2020,2
66,"I (28F) live on the opposite side of town from the rest of my immediate family. We are very close and before Covid, would be together nearly every weekend and sometimes more. At the beginning of all this (March - ~June), my family was very understanding and we kept our distance, did video calls, etc. During the summer months, as numbers started to look better, we started letting our guard down a bit and hung out more but it was easy to keep distance and feel safe since we could be outside. Now the weather is getting colder and Covid cases are rising. I am wanting to go back to distancing how we were at the beginning and I don‚Äôt feel like they really understand. It‚Äôs nothing personal but I feel like they are taking it personally. My mom and sister work at hospitals that have Covid positive patients and my other siblings also have jobs that are not work from home, so they are all in contact with many people on a regular basis. On top of this, my partner owns a business and if he were to get sick, it could mean shutting down the business for at least 2 weeks which is not ideal in any way. When I tell my family of my concerns they seem to think we are okay since ‚Äúwe can be part of each other‚Äôs bubble‚Äù. This would work if they had a job like mine (work from home since March) but they don‚Äôt and the amount of people they see just makes me uneasy. My mom did send me a text yesterday letting me know it‚Äôs okay to do what I am comfortable with and to keep my distance but I still just feel there is tension. 
Is anyone else feeling similar stress? I feel like I should have no problem saying that I am uncomfortable and concerned with cases rising. Does anyone have any words of advice to navigate this?",16Nov2020,1

70,"Currently, I‚Äôm sitting out in the cold; waiting on people who drag me around during lunch even though I find comfort sitting inside by myself. 

They‚Äôve taken me outside many times to ‚Äúeat‚Äù with them even though I enjoy sitting in the back of the cafeteria by myself. I just got used to their schedule of making me come outside, but they‚Äôre not out here. I‚Äôm in the cold, on a small bench, just scrolling through Reddit. I‚Äôm too embarrassed to go inside but too frustrated and disappointed to stay out here.

All of the people I know usually just take me with them and don‚Äôt talk to me. There‚Äôs about 3 people who actually talk and listen to me. None of them have this lunch period. 

I talk to a lot of people, but in reality, they ignore me most of the time. I can barely think about when they actually listened. I‚Äôm just a background character in their lives, and I‚Äôm one in my life too.

No one ever wants to hang out with me, no one ever wants to really chat or call, no one even wants to play video games with me. I can‚Äôt think of a time that anymore (except those 3 people) walked up to me and wanted to talk, like actually have a conversation.

My fears of being abandoned and forgotten are always becoming worse. It could just be the rejection sensitive dysphoria (rsd) or something else along those lines too. 

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm talking to people who probably don‚Äôt care if I talk. I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm hanging out with these people who force me to do things to only forget about me. 

I‚Äôm always doing things for people and never getting anything back. I‚Äôm their free therapist, I‚Äôm who they vent to, I‚Äôm who they rant to, I‚Äôm their comfort animal, I‚Äôm the one who does tricks for them for them to forget about my existence. I‚Äôll do almost anything for anyone, as long as they listen and look at me, yet they never do anything for me.

So many things I want to say, yet they won‚Äôt listen. I‚Äôm so lonely and I want to be seen. I‚Äôm forgotten so much but I want to be remembered. 

My life seems like nothing if someone can forget that they forced me to do something that I hate just so they can have another chunk of meat and flesh to take warmth from.

72,Most Redditors are children.  Anyone using Reddit has to be aware of that and to take it into account when he receives shit-eating braindead Neo-Nazi replies from children.  But there seem to me so many shit-eating Neo-Nazi adolescents replying to my posts that I have to wonder why the kiddies are picking on me in particular.  There isn't anything different or unique about me among the many victims of psychopath abuser children who happen to be using Reddit.

75,"Arnold Toynbee propounded a theory that meritocracy engenders a natural elite who deserve to run the world on behalf of the much larger undeserving majority.  Once you accept that, it's impossible to avoid the inference that the natural ruling elite also deserve to be the only ones with happy lives, as enabled by the miserable lives of the undeserving majority.

Not every Toynbee fan is part of the ruling elite.  I met one who is among us suffering billions of supposedly undeserving.  He propounded to me that the object of life is to rely on prospect of mobility to launch oneself personally into the ruling elite and abandon his former mates among the billions of sufferers so that their suffering can enable him to live a happy, opulent, oblivious life.

I immedately blocked that monster of wrongfulness.  He is even more odious and wrongful than those who already enjoy elite privilege.  Them, you can at least understand to be protecting what they already have.  This other guy wants to shaft other people of his own socioeconomic bracket so that he can personally benefit from doing harm to us.  That's not the kind of guy anyone should want to know.

81,"Hello, here is the brief story about how I ""woke up from a bad dream"" and decided that I am taking back control over my life.

I am 19 years old Polish college student. During the last three months I noticed that my life has been going on the undesirable path. I gained weight and I am now overwheight, I did not study psychology as much as I wanted because of procrastination, I kept masturbating night after night and, which is probably what hurt me the most-I got banned from Facebook group due to accidentaly writing few undesirable comments and the moderator said I am banned forever. To sum things up, I screwed up.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then, today as I was working out, an enlightening thought came to me. I have had enough of my mistakes defining my life and decided I am no longer gonna waste my life. I made several life changing decisions in order to help me take back control over my own life. 

1. Become a vegetarian and work out 30 minutes every day in order to lose 5 kg or so and become physically fit and to live long (I am personally planning to live long enough to celebrate my 110 birthday üòÅ).
2. Write a 300 page fantasy novel. For a long time I have wanted to write a book, but I always ended up either abandoning my projects, or chickening out and not writing the first page. To make things worse, my perfectionist nature (or Asperger's syndrome, I am not sure), makes me want to do something creative every day or else I end up hating myself for being lazy).
3. Learn how to play guitar. 
4. Learn a new language. I am torn between Italian, Japanese and German, but I think I will start with German first. Mostly because I had problems learning it in the school and I want to prove to myself that I can break my mental limits. And because I am thinking of moving out of my country after the college to follow my dream of becoming famous and Germany seems to be a good place to start.
5. Save enough money to get Lasik surgery so that one day I won't have to wear glasses anymore.
6. Limit Internet usage (free time activities)  to no more than 2 hours per day.
7. Train my memory and intelligence to be as smart and resourceful  as Leonardo Da Vinci, Jacque Fresco, George Carlin, Steve Jobs and Stephen Hawking.  

That's all I wanted to say. I feel much more calmer now. These 7 rules will be my philosophy of life now.

Have a nice day, fellow Redditors. And remember-it is never to late to change for better. I finally realised that life is too short to worry about past.",16Nov2020,1
82,"From a very young age I was always different from other children; Antisocial, I had a lot of lack of remorse, I had little tolerance for frustration and stress, I didn't consider myself a total rebel but I struggled to respect authorities, etc. Whenever I could, I mistreated a lot the few pets that I had at my parents' house, it really made me laugh and excited in a way difficult to describe. What made my parents begin to care deeply about my mental health was once when i was eleven years old, they discovered me torturing a dog that soon after that they gave away and they took me to many different psychologists and specialists who, in addition to diagnosing me with like a 3/10 of the syndrome Asperger's, they came to the conclusion that I had strong and undeniable tendencies of sociopathy.

85,"A few months ago, the woman I‚Äôve been dating for almost five years broke up with me. Today would've been our anniversary. It shattered my world as I believed that I loved her. However, I was struggling, emotionally and mentally, and it was starting to rub off on the relationship. We started having some issues as a couple. However, she has always been my rock, the one I could depend on for comfort. The five years that we spent together had been amazing; we went to concerts, traveled around the world, sought out different and new restaurants, drank and partied together, played games together. I really thought that one day I could marry this person - someone who shared so many interests with me and loved me for who I was. 

After several days of contemplation, I realized I didn‚Äôt want to give up on this relationship. We met up a week after to talk, and I asked her if we could give us another shot. She was unsure but was willing to try. We talked for a couple weeks, and during this time I tried to make sure she knew that I still cared. She told me that she still needed some more time to think about it. A few days turned into weeks turned into months, she has not contacted me since. I had to accept that this relationship was over, and it broke my heart.

During this time, my mother‚Äôs health was declining due to metastasized cancer. After a few accidents where my mother had fainted and fallen a few times, I decided it was time that I moved back to my parents so I could be readily available to help, as I was the physically strongest one in my family. Mom always joked that Dad could‚Äôve divorced her so many times, but he was willing to support her no matter what.

Shortly after I moved back home, my mother‚Äôs health started to rapidly decline. When she couldn‚Äôt walk by herself, my father bought her walkers and wheelchairs. When she couldn‚Äôt chew solid food, my father blended her food so it would be easier for her to eat. When she couldn‚Äôt eat much, we started buying shakes for her so she could get her nutrients. When she couldn‚Äôt swallow liquids, my father used a syringe to slowly drop enough so she wouldn‚Äôt choke. When we had to admit her to the hospital, he was there every day as soon as they opened, talked to my mom and watched after her, only leaving when the nurses kicked him out due to COVID restrictions. I will never forget the image of my dad hunched over my mom, talking to her about what‚Äôs going on and telling her stories of their past, continuing even when she was unresponsive and couldn‚Äôt even open her eyes.

My mother‚Äôs final day eventually came. My hopes and dreams, that she would be able to hold her first grandchild, or cheering me on when I complete my next degree, or being there at my wedding, all vanished. I felt lost, but I could not imagine what my father was going through. I have never seen my father so broken. His spouse of 35 years was gone. However, he knew that we were not done yet. He was determined in honoring her as best as he could. He made the arrangements to have family and friends contacted, and tasked my siblings and I to figure out how to handle the memorial service, in which her closest friends attended. There were many more family and friends who attended virtually. It was touching to see that my mother had been such an important person in so many people‚Äôs lives. We still reserve my mom‚Äôs favorite spots around the house, and have set up a memorial for her as well. Anyone can tell that my father still misses her, and that he really truly loved her.

I learned my lesson on love during this time. Love isn‚Äôt about only the enjoyable parts in life, it also includes the ugly nasty bits. It‚Äôs about being willing to sacrifice everything you‚Äôve got for your significant other, about taking care of one another. It‚Äôs not about only accepting the ups but also the downs, the highs with the lows. It‚Äôs about caring for another person unconditionally, even when they are struggling the most.

In the end, my situation has helped me realize a lot that what I had wasn‚Äôt lasting true love. I learned that I should evaluate my next serious relationship more than just the fun companion factor. I truly hope that everyone out there will find or has found that special someone and experience the love that my parents had.

I am forever grateful to Mom and Dad for this lesson on love.",16Nov2020,6

93,"I just want to kinda' get this off my chest, so to speak.  
&amp;nbsp;  

My ex and I split up a few months back, around June/July. I'm a huge gamer. They are my passion in life. She likes to play them sometimes but it's honestly pretty rare. She's spent her brief time gaming playing Animal Crossing and Gardenscapes-esque games on her phone lately while I play, well, everything. I'm not trying to gatekeep gaming. Just pointing out that it's much more a part of my life than it is hers.  
One thing that has been irritating me more and more the longer I've thought about it is that she did leave me the PSVR and original PS4 we had but she took the PS4 Pro.  
The reason it bugs me so much is that she doesn't care about the better graphics on the PS4 Pro. She only wanted it because of an offhand joke she'd made when we bought it, that she'd get to keep it if we split. She was adamant about it when it happened too.  
I, on the other hand, really enjoyed the increase in graphics for the VR games on the PS4 Pro. Games like Skyrim VR are blurry by comparison on the original PS4. It sucks even more because my eyesight has gotten worse in the last year (I've just had to get my first pair of glasses) and the difference has become much more noticeable with time.  
To add insult to injury she hasn't even played the PS4 a single time since we split up. We're still roommates and it's just sat over there, gathering dust.  
The final irritation is that she's a nurse and makes close to $40 an hour. She could easily afford to replace it and frequently, randomly spends more on things like makeup. I, on the other hand, can barely afford my half of the bills, am still trying desperately to find another place to live, and have no hope of upgrading back to a pro any time soon.  
&amp;nbsp;  

It just frustrates me, you know? Everything else aside, I've had a very hard life and it bums me out when stuff like this happens. I thought I'd be further along at 35 and would be able to afford situations like this. I think my own failure to get to a point where I could replace the PS4 Pro (or even buy things I actually need) bothers me more than the fact that she decided to keep ours. It just sucks man.",16Nov2020,2

Shit, for some reason I have a lot on my mind and just want to keep writing. I love writing. It helps me organize all the thoughts that are inside my unorganized mind. 

It‚Äôs a clusterfuck in there haha 

But right after I posted the last post, I went inside, grabbed my AirPods, started walking back outside but I stopped and looked at the Keurig. Should I have another cup of coffee? I decided that I shouldn‚Äôt right now since I‚Äôm highly sensitive to caffeine and it‚Äôll trigger my anxiety. So I‚Äôll wait until later to have another one. 

Now that I think about it, the reason I want to keep writing is because of the coffee. Duh lol

Well this letter is for my future friends and partner. I‚Äôm going to layout the pros and cons of me. The good and the bad. The best and worst characteristics of me. To let you know what you‚Äôre getting yourself into. 


I‚Äôm probably the most loving and caring person you‚Äôll meet. If I care about you, I‚Äôd do anything and everything for you. If you have a hard time getting what you want, I‚Äôll always find a way or atleast try my best to get what you want. I‚Äôll always have your back. 

But I can also be the worst and meanest person if you get on my bad side. See, I‚Äôll remember the small things that will break you down. I can make you feel like shit when I‚Äôm hurt. I‚Äôll make you hate me. Ill be your worst enemy. But you‚Äôll never see that side of me as long as you don‚Äôt betray or do something bogus to hurt me. 

If I like you, you‚Äôll see the real me. The outgoing, loud, spontaneous me. If I act like myself around you, I care and trust you. I‚Äôll always be down to do anything. Well as long as we don‚Äôt get arrested lol. 

But if you see me just being quiet and sitting there fidgeting with my hands and looking anxious/ nervous, I‚Äôm either really uncomfortable with the vibe/environment or I‚Äôm trying real hard not to show that I‚Äôm mad and trying not to argue. If I‚Äôm happy and talkative then out of nowhere I stop talking and don‚Äôt have a smile and giving one word replies, something that someone said or something that someone texted me either upset me or i disagree with someone‚Äôs opinion and I don‚Äôt want to argue. 

When I hear someone being closed-minded and/or getting mad, i try my best not to call them out or tell them to shut the fuck up. I really try so hard to hold back. So I might just get away from everyone so avoid an argument cause I‚Äôll lose my temper. Ive gotten in trouble a few times with the cops for losing my temper. 

(Here‚Äôs one incident, I was on the train heading back home with my friend after dropping of his niece back home. I was extremely tired and had a long day. My friend was taking care of his niece so we decided we‚Äôd hang out and I‚Äôd bring my brother and go downtown and to the beach. It was better than sitting at home and being bored. 
So we spent basically all day downtown. I hate having to just sit and not being able to get up and move around. I get to anxious and spent atleast 3-4 hours sitting in the train. 

30 minutes from where we live to Union Station. 15-20 minute walk to the beach. A couple of hours at the beach, in the sun and dehydrated. 20 minute walk back to Union Station. Wait 30-45 minutes for the train to arrive. 1-1.5 hour ride to his niece house. 45 minute ride back to our town. 

But we didn‚Äôt make it to our stop. Why?
Cause I was exhausted and irritable at that point and the ticket guy in the train was being bogus to this African American teen around our age. That kid didn‚Äôt have money and only had his mom‚Äôs disability card, well that‚Äôs what he said. The ticket guy accused him of stealing it and took it from him. The kid was upset and saying that his mom needs it to get around and if he takes away from him, she won‚Äôt be able to go to the doctor or anywhere.  

I didn‚Äôt know if he was lying or not. But the way the ticket guy handle the situation and seemed pretty racist. 
But who knows, maybe I overthought the situation. So with those two things in mind, I was on neither side. 

But I thought about it. If that was a Caucasian or even me, a Hispanic, the ticket guy wouldve probably handled it differently. 

But really got me was that he said he was going to have to go all the way to Union Station and handle it from there. This was all happening only a few rows in front of me. So I said,‚Äù here‚Äôs the money for his ticket. Can you just take his card and not make a big deal about it?‚Äù 
The ticket guy said,‚Äù no you don‚Äôt have to do that for him‚Äù
I‚Äôm like,‚Äù dude it‚Äôs only $1.75. Thats literally nothing.‚Äù And since he didn‚Äôt want to take the money, I was like fine I‚Äôll just give it to the kid cause what‚Äôs wrong with giving someone money to help them out. 

The train guy got mad and gave me a bit of attitude so that pissed me off, remind you that I was extremely exhausted and irritable, I pulled the racist card on him. I got up, which was a really bad mistake, and gave him attitude and said,‚Äù dude are you being fucking racist or some shit? Why the fuck do you need to give him a hard time for just 2 fucking dollars?‚Äù

Then he pulled the victim card and says,‚Äù I need to back away and you‚Äôre making me feel threatened‚Äù 
I started fucking laughing. ‚ÄúAre you fucking serious? I‚Äôm fucking 16 years old and you‚Äôre way bigger than me‚Äù and I sat down. 
But now the train dude took it to a new level and radioed the other train dude to go to where we are at and then told the driver to stop at the next stop and wait until the cops arrive. 

I started laughing again. Are they fucking serious? 
‚ÄúCops? Really?‚Äù 
‚ÄúI feel threatened‚Äù said both of the conductors. They overreact, seriously. 
What the fuck were the cops gonna do?

We get to the stop and I see two cop cars. I just shook my head and was really pissed off. Cops come in and tells us four, the teen and two train conductors outside. They separated and asked individually what happened. I was filled with anger but also with extreme anxiety and overwhelmed. I hate cops cause they always make me nervous. I start panicking as I start telling what happened and I couldn‚Äôt make my words. I started crying and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I was having a panic attack. 
The cop told me to sit down and relax and told me to take my time. 
The cop was handling the situation perfectly. Calm and understanding. 

After I calm down, I calmly told him what happened. My friend, his niece and my brother looked worried about me after seeing how I got. But for me, this is normal. I have panic attacks when I get overwhelmed or overstimulated. 

I remember the first time it happened. My mom and I were heading back home from Walgreens when out of nowhere, I start hyperventilating and claustrophobic in the car. Before it happened, I was overthinking a few things and was feeling really anxious. I took off the seatbelt, hoping it will help me control my breathing. It didn‚Äôt. I put the window all the way down in hope that fresh air would help. Nope. I told my mom to pullover and i got out of the car and told her I‚Äôll walk the rest of the way home. It wasn‚Äôt far. I didn‚Äôt give an explanation and just walked. I didn‚Äôt go home at first. I went to meet up with my gf at the time. I needed to talk to someone. We met at the middle school baseball field. I told her what happened and I felt better. I felt relieved since she understood and was listening. That was the summer going into Sophomore year of high school.)

They are becoming more frequent each year. 
But as you can see, I‚Äôm a handful I guess. And that‚Äôs why I always tell someone when we start getting closer, that they really shouldn‚Äôt want to be with me cause I‚Äôll push them away for the way I am. I dont open up to people unless they really like me for who I am. And once I get comfortable, I‚Äôll slowly become more of myself and ill again tell you that I don‚Äôt want to be a burden on you. I‚Äôll tell you all of this beforehand because I want you to understand who I am. That I have flaws just like everyone else, except I‚Äôm a bit extreme. My mood swings are always intense. I‚Äôll be emotional at everything and anything. My feelings get hurt easily. I feel too much of everything. I get overwhelmed easily. 

But it‚Äôs not how you think it is. Reading all of that probably makes you think I‚Äôm a bit crazy or I‚Äôm too much to handle and I can see why. 
But I‚Äôm normal like anyone else. And I try so hard to control myself. 

But please understand that we all have a tipping point. If I tell you that I‚Äôm overly exhausted or worn out and mentally drain. Do take it serious. I‚Äôm letting you know that I need a break from all the stressors in my life. And I‚Äôll need you to be there for me when I‚Äôm at that point. I‚Äôll overwork myself at work. I‚Äôll overwork myself in trying to make everyone happy. I‚Äôll overwork myself mentally. I‚Äôll always been looking out for you. I‚Äôll put you first before myself. 
And I don‚Äôt expect anything back. I really dont. But I want you to understand that I tried my best at everything. Everything. 

I‚Äôll always do everything until I burn myself out. I‚Äôll keep doing this every so often. It makes me happy with myself and life when I always put my everything to everything cause I‚Äôm living life. I‚Äôm taking advantage of what life has giving us. But there‚Äôs always a downside to everything. My downside is when I burn out. I‚Äôll need you to help me back up and not give up on me easily. 

Now I‚Äôm not saying you have to deal with me. That is why I tell you multiple times before I reach that point. 

But I‚Äôm done writing for now. 
And this is only the beginning lol

Again, this isn‚Äôt for anyone. This is for me to just I don‚Äôt know. To let out the my thoughts and clear my mind.",16Nov2020,2
96,"11:03 AM (Random Thoughts) 11/16/20

When I woke up today, I thought I was going blind since I could barely see anything. 
But then I realized that I took of my contacts in the middle of the night. 

It‚Äôs what, day 4 or 5?, that I have been taking those anti-psychotic and tell you the truth, I feel fucking amazing still. 

One thing I don‚Äôt like about them though is the sleep. I do get enough sleep now but I feel like I toss and turn even more since I wake up with all the pillows and blanket on the floor. I never used to wake up sweating as if I was running from something. 
When I woke up today, I felt like I had some crazy dreams but I can‚Äôt remember them. It felt like it was intense since my body is aching. 

But anyways, right now I‚Äôm just sitting outside on the small step by the back door. Surprisingly, it‚Äôs nice and warm outside compare to last night where it was cold and windy. 

Ive been sitting out here for the last 30 minutes. Just embracing the heat from the sun and enjoying the blue, clear sky.

I‚Äôm starting to drink coffee every morning now. I dont know why but I‚Äôve been wanting it lately when I wake up. 
Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm starting to feel like my old self again. 

I used to drink coffee everyday or drink a couple of red bulls in the morning. I stopped doing so after she left. I dont know why. Maybe cause I lost interest in certain things. Actually, most of the things. 

I stopped cooking, taking care of myself and just feeling down all the time. 
But things are starting to change. 

Now, I wake up without the sadness and negative thoughts like I used to every day. 
I‚Äôm starting to interact with my mom and grandma more. I usually wake up and don‚Äôt talk to anyone and just chill outside until everyone is doing there own thing. 

I mean I still wake up and go outside right away but lately I‚Äôll sit down and talk for a few minutes with my mom. 

It‚Äôs kinda annoying that the first thing she ask is how am I feeling. Like shit, I‚Äôm fine mother. Dont need you to be worried about me all the time. 

Ever since I tried to OD and then had the psychotic episode, she‚Äôs been worried about me. I mean I understand but I don‚Äôt want to think about that anymore. 

Well about a week ago, I had another psychotic episode and thought that they were hiding my notebook from me. The notebook contain personal things such as letters that I wrote to J and a suicide letter from months ago when I tried to OD. 
I got pretty crazy and wanted my notebook back. Finally, they found it and then I got really depressed and embarrassed that I wanted to kill myself. 

My mom was saying sorry that she didn‚Äôt look well enough and wished she found it sooner. But at that point, I felt ashamed of myself. I started telling her how I never felt part of the family and how they don‚Äôt care about me. And then I said I‚Äôll just go kill myself and left. I went to the back stairs and cried for awhile and thinking of why I‚Äôm like this. Why no one loves me. Why I have to have this mental illness. Why I had to be born with it. 

I stayed in the back until 4 AM. Just thinking of why I‚Äôm the way I am. Wondering where I fit in in this world. If I‚Äôm even worth anyone time. 

But after knocking out at 5 AM and then waking up a few hours later, I was fine. I didn‚Äôt feel like I did the night before. 

That‚Äôs when I start thinking,‚Äù do I even have a mental disorder? Am I faking this?‚Äù 

No, I‚Äôm not faking it. It‚Äôs extremely hard when I get into those moods and can‚Äôt snap out of it. These mood swings are horrible. I feel bad every time. I hate it. 

But I‚Äôm getting better. I mean, I have a better view of the world and it‚Äôs not as negative. 
Though, I still feel lonely. And worthless. 
But I‚Äôve learned that I‚Äôll always feel like this no matter what. 

In all the my relationships, I tend to feel lonely and worthless still. It‚Äôs not because my partner is not giving me the attention. It‚Äôs the emptiness that I feel internally. A void that will never be satisfied by anything. Which becomes problematic in relationships since ill constantly need reassurance and ask for more attention. 

I dont mean to be like that. I really dont. And trust me, it wasn‚Äôt any of my gfs fault. I‚Äôm sorry that I put all the fault on them when truly it‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôm sorry if I made them feel like they weren‚Äôt enough. They were. 

My past girlfriends told me that I have to work on myself and be happy with myself first. But the problem is, I‚Äôll never be happy with myself. 

Ive tried for years and years to find happiness in myself. I cant. Like I said, the emptiness inside will never be satisfied. 

The only way to feel temporary satisfaction or happiness with myself is helping others. Since I know I can‚Äôt be happy with myself, I rather give my all to the ones I love or need help, instead of wasting time looking for my own happiness and knowing I‚Äôll never find it. 

I hope everyone finds happiness with themselves and if they can‚Äôt, you‚Äôre not alone.",16Nov2020,1

https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/jqwps5/i_finally_left/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I decided to get settled a bit before I posted this update but here it is :)

-‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

After I left to my friend‚Äôs place, I was feeling a little uncomfortable so I was couch surfing and looking for my own place. About 5 couches later, I finally agreed to move in with my boyfriend even though we have been dating for less than 6 months (I wasn‚Äôt planning on moving in with him until we‚Äôve been dating for 2 years but hey I guess situations change?). Since moving in with him I just want to say this:

I found home.

I feel so free, so liberated, so loved. He‚Äôs done so much for me, shit I wouldn‚Äôt even expect my parents, brothers, hell, I wouldn‚Äôt expect ANYONE to do for me. I feel so safe, so happy, so at ease with him. He‚Äôs changed his schedule so he comes home earlier from work, he bought me replacements for the stuff I‚Äôve left behind like toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo &amp; conditioner (he did his research on what works for hair like mine), hairbrush, underwear, clothes, and so so much more. He cleared space in his closet, added me to his lease, I can keep going but I‚Äôm still in shock every morning I wake up to see that he‚Äôs up and made breakfast for me and leaves me an uplifting note next to it and tells me when he‚Äôll be back, then always texts me and asks me if I need anything at all.

This last week I have been focusing on being my true self, my real self. The clothe i wear are stuff I like and it makes me really happy. I wear my hair how I like and eat what I want when I want it. I feel like I‚Äôm finally in control of myself and what I do and can actually achieve the goals I have set.

My father took everything well and actually gave me my car back and said he only wishes that I finish college, get a degree, and do something with my life. I went back with a friend, as I am not ready to introduce my boyfriend to them quite yet as my mom is still hurting, and my dad handed me a full box of my favorite pizza, gave me a hug, and said I‚Äôm always welcome and that he‚Äôd continue to support me. 

My mom gave me a look of pure disgust and said I was just another sinner who has shamed her and her image - again, making it about her. I shrugged it off, grabbed some winter items I needed, hugged my dad, and left.

But I‚Äôve never been this happy before and all I want to do is cry. Which I kinda have been tbh. But my boyfriend has stuck by my said and made sure that I felt validated which honestly makes me cry even harder because he‚Äôs too kind and could‚Äôve given less of a shit.

Kind of on a separate note, moving in just confirmed that I do have a future with him and that we can work out a lot of things together. When I met him I was hella drawn to who he was and I knew I had to keep at it so I did. Before I moved in I actually was able to envision a future with him, something I‚Äôve never been able to do in past relationships.

Our connection has got a lot deeper and I‚Äôm scared shitless but I also know my heart is in good hands. I‚Äôm not going to say the four lettered word because I still feel like shits too fast between us - even if it feels right - and that I should still sit back and observe but also enjoy it how it is right now. So that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôll do.

I guess the next step is getting a new job, as my income is pretty small since my parents were restrictive. I hate having my bf pay so much for me even though it‚Äôs within his financial capability. I just want to uphold my own weight and pitch in for rent and groceries and dates and stuff. I passed my math exam with a 98% so I‚Äôm kind of on cloud 7 right now cuz I have so much planned and things are falling together and, fuck, I‚Äôm so excited for the projects that I‚Äôve been working on to release and hopefully hit big social media platforms and gain lots of fans.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. It‚Äôs only up from here so I‚Äôm going to take a moment to bask in this moment of peace I have while I write this. :)",16Nov2020,1

104,"Ok so some context. I have lived in this apartment for around 3 months. My neighbour (call her Sue) spoke to me a bit when my flatmate and I moved in, and have seen her in passing every couple of weeks since. I‚Äôd say she is my go-to because we have those neighbourly formalities etc, and she is really kind and lovely. It is also worth mentioning that I have not actually seen or spoken to any other neighbours, so Sue is literally my go-to.

Now, down to business. There *was* an 8ft tall fake plant in our shared hallway until last Thursday. Me and my flat mate were drunk on beer and whisky and decided it would be a nice piece in our living room. It is important to note that we assumed this plant didn‚Äôt belong to anyone as it was in the hallway. After ensuring the coast was clear we drunkenly and quietly (yes it is possible) moved the plant into our flat. 

Four days pass, and I‚Äôm sitting watching The Office and my doorbell rings. I open the door, and it‚Äôs Sue. After our usual greetings, she informs that *her* 8ft plant has gone missing from the hallway. I panicked, and then pretended that I had never seen this gigantic plant, and definitely hadn‚Äôt seen it go missing. Luckily there was a big football game on that night and I suggested the missing plant may have been the result of people having parties. However, this didn‚Äôt resolve anything as she told me that her plant had been there for *4* years, and was devastated that someone took it. 

I feel so guilty. How can I fix this?",16Nov2020,1

108,"And I started to wonder when it stopped being entertainment and started being propaganda. Then when saw the clip after the Charlottesville tragedy and he said there‚Äôs good people on both sides of the argument about taking down statues, then he said‚Ä¶not the neo Nazis and white supremacists of course. But when it gets re- shown they always cut off the part where he denounces the evil. He did a press conference where he said ‚ÄòAmerica is the greatest country and there is no room for racism as we are all Americans.‚Äô But that is never shown. I saw a press conference at the White House where the press secretary was asked if she could denounce racism so she ran through a grocery list of dates and news agencies that Trump denounced racism. The next question was‚Ä¶so you can‚Äôt denounce racism, she replied I just did and told you all the times in the past that it was done‚Ä¶the the reporter asked, so you cannot denounce racism.‚Ä¶I was horrified that he was elected but when I saw what a hatchet job the media was doing trying to form my opinion it made me suspicious of the motives. Yesterday on the radio the story was how Trump has finally admitted Joe Biden won the election but refused to say his name‚Ä¶according to the radio report Trump tweeted ‚Äòhe won‚Äô. But then today I looked it up and Trump said he won by fraud and not allowing observers to observe. OK, that‚Äôs crazy talk from Trump I doubt that that is what happened. But why the fuck is the news not reporting the full news? Why is it misrepresenting what he said? That‚Äôs not news, that‚Äôs propaganda. So why is that happening? Colbert and Van Jones crying on the air‚Ä¶ones a comedian and ones a reporter. Neither are supposed to be pulling on heart strings with whimpering tears. Nothing goes on air that is the entertainers idea alone, it‚Äôs rotten and it stinks. Trump is a joke but the mass hatred for him is way more than it ever was for Bush who started this whole thing off after 9/11. Why? It just doesn‚Äôt make sense when you look at it closely. Trump is a liar but the way he lies is that he exaggerates the truth. He doesn‚Äôt fully change the truth.

110,"Im using a throwaway due to my wife following my main. Im 23 years old and im a jehovahs witness. My wife  is 22 and is very intelligent and is amazing at video editing(we'll come back to this). We've been married for almost a year and what she said today made me write this post. Ive known her since we were kids and shes always had some type of obsession over me. She is a nice looking woman but shes never been attractive to me. Ive always found her annoying if im being honest. Oh, i'll be calling her K in this.

**The Rape:** So I moved out of my parents house when I was 21 and I threw myself a house warming party and invited my friends, including K. I didnt have any alcoholic drinks at my party and as witnesses we dont do drugs or get drunk. So I had a bunch of sodas that had caffeine so my friends wouldnt fall asleep if the party ran late. The party was great and my friends started leaving around 8:10pm. I remember at exactly 8:25pm K was the last person at my house. She said she was gonna help me clean up and I let her. About 10 minutes later I told her I was going to the bathroom and I set my drink down. I come back out and she rushes towards me holding my drink insisting that I finish it. I was creeped out by told her no and she told me that it would help me ""stay focused"" so we could finish faster. I believed her and I gulped it down. Half an hour later I started feeling tired and weird. It wasnt a natural tiredness from my body, it felt forced. Like how you feel when taking the allergy pills that cause a drowsy effect but worse. This was an instant tiredness and I felt sick to my stomach. I told her I was gonna go lie down on the couch for a while and I was out. I dont even remember falling asleep.

I remember being forcefully woken up by someone saying ""Stop! Ah Please!"". I was still extremely tired trying to piece together what was happening but I saw that K was on top of me. She was riding me still saying ""Stop!"" and I weakly said ""what?"" and I fell back into unconsciousness. When I woke up again it was around 3am. I was still on my couch and I soon realized that K was snuggled up against me naked, we both were naked. I remember I legitimately screamed and started squirming trying to get her off of me. She woke up and I basically screamed at her asking why we were naked. And I will never forget this but she smiled at me and told with that I raped her. I was in disbelief and protested and threatened to tell the the elders in our congregation and get her disfellowshipped.(Basically she would be lose all her religious privileges and she wouldnt be able to talk to anyone) But she pulled her phone out and showed me a video of us having sex with her screaming ""No"" and her asking me to stop. She told me no one would believe and that she would show the video to everyone if I tried to tell.

**After Rape:** After the first time we I became depressed. As Jehovah's Witnesses we arent supposed to have sex before marriage as we could get in serious trouble. I felt horrible and I wanted to tell but with the evidence stacked against me no one would believe me. A week later K hit me up again asked me to come over to her house. Reluctantly I did and she told me she was pregnant. I shocked and sad. She told me she didnt want to get in trouble and neither did I. The only option left for me was to marry her. Because of this we started having sex on the regular. I was black mailed and guilt tripped into doing this until I eventually started wanting it as well. Eventually we told our friends that I was going to marry K and they were all shocked. All of them knew that I didnt want K and that I was never interested in K and they couldnt get their heads around it. 5 months in me courting her and I saw no sign of pregnancy from her. I had asked what was happening and she told me she was never pregnant. She was on birth control the whole time and she told me that she only said that to make sure she had me. I was livid. I had never in my life been so mad at a person before and I slapped her as hard as I could. She fell back and she had a bruise on her cheek for weeks. 

**Marriage:** So I married her in december last year and my depression started lifting. I stopped feeling bad about the sex due to us actually being married now and I tried to move on from what happened. She deleted the videos she had against me and I was relieved but I realized I was truly stuck with her. I now had no reason to divorce her. Witnesses arent supposed to divorce due to god hating it unless its truly necessary in the case of someone cheating. K was never going to cheat on me and I never plan on doing it either despite wanting free from her. Im not happy in this relationship and I dont love K. We have had some pleasant moments but I want nothing to do with her and I certainly dont want to start a family with her.

**Today:** Today we were talking to some friends on a zoom call and one them asked her how she got me to say yes. They quoted that I was never into K and asked what was her secret. She told them it was a lot of planning and that she gave me something that I couldnt refuse and she then looked at me and winked. All the memories I tried to forget and let came flooding back. And my mind started wandering and I was thinking about how my life couldve been without her and how I couldve been with someone I loved. I was upset and it was noticeable and I left walked out of the call and apologized I drove for an hour until I got tired. Im now sitting in on a walmart parking lot typing this out. I could really use some help.",16Nov2020,0
