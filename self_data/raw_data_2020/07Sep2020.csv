In a population of 6 humans, 3 male and 3 female, with each female having two children by age 20 (and no additional children), with half male and half female offspring, in 60 years there will 24 people. However, if a female is 'sacrificed' then there will only be 18 people after 60 years. If a male is 'sacrificed' there will be 23 people in 60 years. Thus in 60 years the loss of a females leads to a loss of 6 people and the loss of a male only reduces the population by 1.  And many females can have far more than 2 children in a lifetime, so the loss of a single female is a huge loss in any population seeking to grow.  There is no other reason why, biblically, male sheep and goats are sacrificed and why human men are allowed to do risky jobs.",07Sep2020,1

16,"So, despite the fact that it's on hold for now, a fourth AP has been in the works for some time. I have an idea for one, though. Instead of just parodying the classic Bond films, it instead mostly parodies the ""gritty reboot"" style so many franchises miss the mark with these days. Mike Myers as Austin Powers is back, and his hair's a bit grayer, he's less playful, more jaded.  He's also been failing a lot more missions as of late, and Basel Exposition is starting to get concerned. So they bring back a younger Austin, played by a different actor, via cloning or time travel, and both Austins play off each other for the duration of the film. Possibly, in the end, old Austin retires and leaves the new Austin to take over.

Possible titles include: Hotel Magnum, No Time To Shag, ThunderBall*s*, In Her Majesty's Secret Crevice, Austinpussy (from Goldmember), You Only Shag Twice, Shagfall, or others I can't think of atm.

For me, I like No Time to Shag or In Her Majesty's Secret Crevice.

18,"I felt really upset today for some reason and I suddenly remember all of the other times I've felt this sad/empty/shamed. It did happen often for the past few years. But I now often distract/entertain myself with the internet so I'm not sure what I'm feeling most of the time (I still find things funny and laugh and I still have interest in reading/watching but no energy to do anything else).  

I used to dread going to school and I guess it showed in my face because my teachers and friends would always ask if I was okay. I now dread going to college even for extracurriculars and work but who doesn't, right? I changed majors to one that I thought I would like more but I feel just the same (maybe less stressed but same amount of anxiety about being a homeless failure in the future). 

I haven't taken care of myself well for the past several years and though my grades were at the top of my class in high school, they've completely tanked to almost failing in college so maybe that's also it (I know high school doesn't count for much but I mean the feeling - if I'm failing now, of course I'd be upset). I used to do things like exercise, wear my retainers, at least be conscious about my food intake in the past but now I just sleep and stress-eat all day. I feel ashamed when with my parents and friends, and also when I ruminate (everyday). 

I've always told myself I'd get myself together first to see if it was either my lifestyle or grades that were bothering me and then if it doesn't change, I would ask my doctor about it. 

I haven't been able to. So of course I still feel this way. 

It sounds like I'm asking someone to diagnose me with something but that's not my intention. 

I just wanted to see if this is a normal part of life? Do you guys feel like this or is this not normal?

I'm still young-ish (turning 21 in a few months) so maybe this is normal for a loser like me and life really is just this dreary.

I always feel like I’m not creative, funny, or witty. Yeah sure my friends have told me I’m really funny and pretty creative but ever since I’ve started having anxiety and depression it’s felt like hell for my brain. I’m honestly scared to death I won’t be able to just be myself and be the person I want to be, I just can’t put my mind to it and it really bothers me I’m really insecure about this stuff.

Then there’s something with my speech, sometimes I can speak clearly but then most of the time I fumble my words and it just sounds weird. I swear I’ve never had a speech impediment, I don’t get it, this is one of the number one things that ruins my jokes and my confidence into trying to add something to the conversation. It just puts me in an awful mindset and discourages me and even makes me sad. I’ve never had this issue it’s like just now I guess I don’t know to be honest. 

I know depression has messed with my brain a lot, I haven’t laughed a lot until just recently it’s been 2 weeks I guess maybe a month since I started laughing again and laughing a lot usually in my Group FaceTime’s, I just don’t know what to do about it I wanna always feel happy and funny, I just wanna keep feeling the satisfaction of making people’s days with my jokes. 

Tonight I went outside for a walk of course it was dark and I was listening to 432 hertz music and while I was walking I constantly felt like I was being watched and followed. I swear I kept seeing figures, I was scared and my anxiety kicked in and now I have this weird head ache. 

I don’t wanna feel like this anymore I want to learn how to be witty again, I want to learn how be happy and crack jokes, I want to be more confident in myself but my stupid brain just doesn’t want to work, there’s something wrong with my brain I can’t think quickly and I just want to think quick of a joke or just doing stuff in general.

26,"Imagine you and your spouse get together and have a baby.  Now the baby is starting to get a personality and turn into its own person although to you you can’t really relate to it as if it is yourself because you see it as separate and as the role of child. 

But who would that person be if you and your spouse didn’t conceive it? 

Would it be born to different parents?  Or did this child pick you two to be born into?  What if you never had kids? 

Who would you be if your parents didn’t conceive you?  

Would you be experiencing life just with a different set of parents or would you still be experiencing yourself as you experienced yourself before being born? 

If you look at someone with dementia, someone who has lost all of their memories, they are lost.  They are many things but essentially have been boiled down to blank awareness. Is that really all that we are?   

Are we as an ‘individual’ simply the total sum of our awareness plus memories and how we have handled our life experience?   

Very similarly to how bugs just sort of exist.  Where do they go when they die?  is each individual bug a soul?   It’s quite difficult to believe that each individual bacteria strand, bug and small worm is each its own ‘soul’ or separate entity on a cosmic journey for reincarnation through the chain. 

What then if the earth suddenly started being able to house life?  

Therefore it would seem difficult to assume that we are a separate entity.  So there in lies the problem... Why then as human beings and at a deeper level just awareness expressing itself as a individual part are we experiencing ourselves as individual points in the world rather than I having the ability to be everyone at the same time? 


And also why then when one of us dies is the whole game of life not over but continues without ‘them’ in it? 

The paradox is that while we experience ourselves as the individual and die as an individual, we are not the individual. 

The variable not accounted for is that to experience requires mind, and an individual exists within the concept of space and time. 

A billion years in the grand scheme of things (that in which existence or awareness occurs outside of not independent of space/time) happens in a flash when you are unborn/born and so much of what we contemplate concerning life and death has in it the matrix of considering space/time

We think 100 years is a long time based on everything around us but in actuality it is nothing to awareness 

our memory and mind assumes 100 years is a long time, awareness just is 

Our entire existence since the big bang to the moment it turns back in on itself and swallows the universe whole is but a blip 

We don’t die because we never lived

The perceiver is riding a carriage of two horses, one named space and other time 

The rider is the illusion of the individual 
What is a carriage without the horses 

the carriage is the belief that we actually exist, the mind

every single moment of life is a blessing because it’s not even real

it’s a gift from god, a gift you gave yourself

what we are collectively experiencing is a dream 

it’s not even real",07Sep2020,1

32,"Novel warning. Tl;dr - you might not have found it yet.

I’ve loved everything having to do with performing since I was tiny. I used to play music and put on my own shows for my imaginary friends, did all the theatre in school, majored in it, etc. I’ve always been acutely aware of my love for performing. I call musical theatre my first true love. Pretentious? Yes. But obsession feels the same whether for a person or a passion. I was pretty good at it too - I have great pitch, an expressive face, and natural musical ability, so there was at least enough potential there to not be written off as crazy.

I loved books too because they’re stories and I wanted to tell stories to audiences. I liked to write because I could create my own stories that I could act out that would help me understand the stories I was exposed to. And I was an okay writer; I created mildly interesting characters and my caveat was certainly my “voice”.

I loved my family because they took care of me. I loved my friends because they provided a system of interaction that was both emotionally fulfilling and exhausting. I have a daughter and I love her because she’s a pure, sweet, whole person and I can’t wait to keep getting to know her as she gets to know herself. I love my fiancé, as much of a walnut as he can be, his purity is absolute and ethereal, and his soul is just good. 

What I mean to say is I thought I was done finding new love. I am grateful, I am privileged - to have this many things in my life that are full of love, especially considering the unpredictability of my life, my perpetual bad luck, and the crumbling staircase that has been my life path that has amounted to little more than failure... but then I started learning Swedish. 

It was like a rush - new words that other people use and understand and I was getting a window into their world. I’d studied French in high school and college, so it’s not like I didn’t know this option existed... but there’s something different about learning about a new thing because you want to, not because it is mandated. It was so easy... the words stuck to me like glue and I flew through the lessons. Every new word I learned... it was like there was a voice in my head telling me why that word made sense that often acted later as a mnemonic device.

I went back to French then, because it’s beautiful and romantic and I always thought it was just the most lofty, fantastical sound... other loves just got in the before. But re-exploring it... I couldn’t BELIEVE how much I remembered. Literally I’m just doing Duolingo so it’s not like I’m passing nationally accredited tests here, but it felt SO GOOD to be presented with those words and phrases and remember what they mean.

Still high off of a few weeks introducing myself to Swedish and welcoming the basics of French back into my life, like the polyamorous person I am, I added Spanish because where I live, nothing is more useful. I found out there’s a burger joint near me that takes orders in Klingon, so obviously I needed to add Klingon. And there was only one Romance language remaining, the language of music, so obviously I had to add Italian.

I’ve been working hard and still find it easy, and it’s so hard to ignore the rush of pleasure I get from these new words and grammatical rules massaging my brain and giving new vibrations to my heart with sounds I’ve never heard before... and to come to this slow understanding... I never thought anything would feel like my first love ever again. I didn’t think there was anything else in this world I could do all day and still be happy even if I weren’t getting paid. But these languages... I’m just so in love

I’ve added German and Greek too (and Danish accidentally... stupid app..), and as soon as I get the basics of those I’m adding Japanese...and even if I burn out my brain I’ll have burned it out in a frenzy of ecstasy. Obviously I’m not naive enough to think I’ll be fluent in all these languages, though I want to pursue two or three... I want to learn an alphabet different than the Latin one, and have started on Greek because it’s just so gorgeous and their culture still affects us so much... 

I just honestly can’t believe how in love I am with this process. Just thinking about another language now I wonder what it’s like... is the alphabet the same? Is it gendered? Do the adjectives go before or after the subject? What do the numbers sound like? What are the basics: “I”, “how are you?”, “what is your name?”, “where’s the restroom?”. For the first time in a long time I’m okay with the tiny minutæ that comes with learning such an intricate process as another language - a completely different way of communicating from the very bits and pieces. I’m in love... I’m fascinated... I don’t even know what to do with it other than to keep learning... ride the wave while it’s there and try to keep it going if the NRE fades. 

And I still can’t believe how easy it’s been. Maybe I’m delusional and only am the kind of person who can apply it one Duolingo, but apparently as of today I’m the kind of person who makes files for different languages and collects the number names for the most familiar ones to kick off the worksheets I’ve printed.

What I guess I hope will be the point for other people is... I’ve had a passion for a very long time. I’ve known what I wanted to do with my life since I was a small child. And now I’m thirty, and I’ve all of a sudden uncovered this passionate, feverish obsession with something I’d only barely considered. Be open minded. Ask your younger self. Who you were before you were programmed by the greater “they”? What is your actual power? I thought I knew what I was good at, but years of not getting hired for it is starting to tell me maybe I was wrong. And maybe there’s nothing wrong with that. Maybe I have a new dream of being able to communicate with millions more people, telling stories and entertaining farther than I ever could have dreamed. Making people happy.",07Sep2020,1

I don’t know how I’ve gotten myself into this mess.

I’ve hit the lowest point in my life. I’ve never been less financially and emotionally secure.

This whole shitshow began at the start of the lockdown. I lost my job, which wasn’t a great job but I had good hours and a decent amount of income. Nothing special, but I was getting by and beginning to save. 

Once I got laid off, everything changed.

My small amount of savings was gone within the first month. For the past 2, I’ve been struggling badly. I didn’t qualify for the covid payment, and unemployment doesn’t even cover my rent. I’ve been diligently applying to jobs for months now, and have gotten 1 interview, but no luck.

Spoke to my mom on my birthday earlier this week and it was such a great conversation and made me feel real nostalgic/teary eyed....

Anyways, that made me bummed.....but then, I saw my in-laws yesterday for the first time since my birthday and they didn't even said happy birthday to me face to face and this was the first year my mother in law, father in law, or sister in law didn't even give me a birthday card.....a small gesture, but it's important to me 🤷‍♂️

I know it's small issue, but it kinda made me feel shitty, you know?

Then, I only had one IRL friend say happy birthday to me because I reminded him it was my birthday....none of my longest IRL friends said happy birthday just cause they remembered it was my birthday (Like a phone call/text or VM).....I just had a bunch of internet friends I haven't seen in 10-20 years say happy birthday on facebook but it's not that meaningful because the FB software reminds them it's my birthday, and we're not really face to face friends?

I don’t know how I’ve gotten myself into this mess.

I’ve hit the lowest point in my life. I’ve never been less financially and emotionally secure.

This whole shitshow began at the start of the lockdown. I lost my job, which wasn’t a great job but I had good hours and a decent amount of income. Nothing special, but I was getting by and beginning to save. 

Once I got laid off, everything changed.

My small amount of savings was gone within the first month. For the past 2, I’ve been struggling badly. I didn’t qualify for the covid payment, and unemployment doesn’t even cover my rent. I’ve been diligently applying to jobs for months now, and have gotten 1 interview, but no luck.

76,"A little over a week ago, I got a call from my mom to drop whatever I was doing and go to her house. I was afraid, but I got in my car and drove to her house.

When I got inside, my sister was there, and she was crying. I was really confused.

She said ""just know that I love you, and I never meant for any of this to happen."" 

She had gone on his phone and found pictures of me, and at least a dozen other girls. Most of the pictures were nudes, mine were the only pictures that weren't, because he took them from my facebook account. 

My sister called him and he admitted it over the phone and said he made $3000 off of the pictures of the girls, including mine. He changed his story multiple times from selling them online, using my name, to only selling them to a perverted old man on instagram, to only having them saved on his phone so he could jerk off to them (disgusting) , to being on drugs and not remembering them being on his phone at all.

My sister has believed every single story change of his, and has decided to forgive him and be with him, despite knowing all of this. 

I publicly bashed him on facebook, and three local girls came forward to me, saying he did the same thing to them. My sister thinks this boy is somehow going to change, when he's not.

He also had pictures of my sister naked, while she was sleeping, because she wouldn't send nudes to him. She found out he had an onlyfans account and was subscribed to 2 canadian girls, and he was paying money to watch them perform sexual acts on themselves. He told my sister that it was her fault because she wouldn't send him nudes.

My sister tried making me out to be the bad guy for wanting to go to the police and wanting to stand up for myself on social media, but I did it anyway, and now she said she never wants me to talk to her again and told me I ""pushed her over the edge"" and that I am going to be the reason why she commits suicide. She said this only to make me feel bad by trying to guilt trip me.

My mom and dad are saying ""she's still your sister"" and ""you can't hold a grudge against her"", but I don't feel safe around her boyfriend, who is most likely going to turn into a sexual predator. He is sexually attracted to me and had other pictures of me with my entire body covered up, which doesn't make any sense-- other than the fact that he is attracted to me. 

Before my sister and her boyfriend started dating, he had hit on me 2x and when they began talking I told her this. She decided to be with him anyway, and now a year later, I find out he's been saving pictures from my facebook to sell and jerk off to, along with at least a dozen other girls.

My nose is very weird, no lie. It's very frustrating and people just stare at it when im outside. Some may giggle. And even guys may try to record, take pictures off it to be bullies. And no I'm not joking, I'm being serious. 

I've never had the confidence to get a job. I feel I won't be taken seriously. I work at a charity shop atm, I volunteer, thankfully it's with friendly people, but I do wear a mask. I need a paying job. My nose is that bad , when I was feeling confident, I went out to sunbathe with my hair tied up. And I ended up in tears as kids started calling me 'big nose' through the window. I'm very sensitive about it now. 

What annoys me is the front of my face is not ugly whatsoever it's just the side of my nose. And it's very upsetting, and frustrating, and it feels like it's holding me back in life, but I need the money to actually get my nose done. Can anyone give me tips how to overcome mean comments from bullies, and get some confidence? It's embarassing because I'm 23F asking for help, but im stressed.

Right now I have no job, my SSI is coming soon, I'm borderline homeless, I used to be completely homeless living on the streets, I got no family, no one to call my own- and I keep on relapsing mentally, trying to kill myself and alll that. Being obsessed with some ex friend, etc. 

Well no more. I'm gonna pick up my shit and try harder. Soon I'm gonna look back on my past self and be glad I've come so far. I've already came so far already and look here! I'm still alive! My face may be paralyzed, I may be sleepy and drowsy a lot more than a normal person, I may be blind to the point I can't drive, I may be anxious, a skiddish lil mouse .... But I'mma make it, imma do it. Ain't no one can stop me. 

I'm only 19. I have my whole life ahead of me. Just because others were given things I didn't and have a good life advantaged doesn't make a failure. Fuck! I'm so ready, I'm gonna stick it to everyone- you'll see.",07Sep2020,1
114,We need help settling a debate. A party was thrown for New Years and everyone but one person was at the party. Those already there were setting up for the party and getting dressed and ready. The person not there was approximately 30 minutes away from the party. We asked him to stop and get ice on his way in. He said no because it didn’t make sense for him to get ice when he was still 30 minutes away and we were just 5 minutes away from town and could leave the house again after we just got back home from the store and forgot the ice. The ice wasn’t something we needed right then and there and he was already out and on his way. Who was right?,07Sep2020,1

116,"So here’s the thing... I’ve been married for almost 9 years and it’s always been the same thing (I’ll do better, we can work it out).

I have 3 beautiful, intelligent kids that I adore and would be devastated if daddy said he won’t live with them anymore, but I can’t keep living like this.

When you get married, you make compromises, that’s the deal.  But you can’t compromise so much that you lose who you are.  That’s where I am.  I love my kids and I don’t want to hurt them, but I also know I can’t be the best father I can be if I’m miserable for being in a relationship that is literally killing who I am every single day.

What do I do?",07Sep2020,1
