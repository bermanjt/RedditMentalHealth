1,"But you know what I hate the most about them? How it's always the same two-three ads that are constantly repeated. I honestly think that if I was always seeing a new ad every time I wouldn't mind so much.

I know that 1. They can't make so many ads that every time I see one it's a new one,
and 2 . Ads work better when they can repeat the message a lot of times.

3,"I was wondering why he's been so quiet about this. This same man who told me I'd be the first one the cops would arrest at a protest (why?), the one who wants to retire next June but also found a way to be surprised that taxes were still taken from our paychecks, the one who refuses to wear a mask, the one who told me it was great that a man in his 70s can still get porn stars in bed... The list goes on.

It really does my head in when he and another co-worker get going about whatever it is fox news says is important today. Every single morning over coffee these men congratulate each other on being smarter than the ""dems"" and ""libs"" and sometimes my eyes roll so far back in my head I see my skull. I stay and listen anyway. I stay because what's said today will be contradictory tomorrow and I long to hear the mental gymnastics they use. It always astounds me. I know eventually the house of cards will fall and I want to be there to witness it. I'm addicted to the schadenfreude.

4,"&gt;...Dominating feature is physical durability...I'm leaning certified ""rugged"" because I figure I could get another 50% life out of the \[thing\] if they'd just hold together better...

Instead I opted for a ""non-rugged"" laptop, but with the reputation for being rugged (for a ""non-rugged"" laptop).

""Rugged"" laptops feature-for-feature all other things being equal, basically run 3-4 times as much as a ""non-rugged"" laptop but with a rugged reputation.

So if I get say two-thirds the lifespan, but saved 75-80% the cost, then I can get another one when it obsolesces itself, and still be saving money.

**Peter Drucker**

He's one of my favorite writers.  All he wrote about was business, that was his wheelhouse, but he was also a history buff and loved to illustrate and suggest the ideas he was communicating in words, to give you another view of the thing, in his attempt to successfully communicate.

The best communicator I know is Jesus of Nazareth, when He told His stories, called parables.  The idea that He was attempting to communicate to His audience, basically in each of His parables, comes across in great and unmistakable clarity, there is no question i m o what He means, for His audience, to think that He means.

Drucker's not *that* good i m o, but he is a very good writer and communicator.

**Greek yogurt and cottage cheese**

The fat-free Greek yogurt with the highest protein content that I could find per serving (18g protein /170g serving), still does not have a higher protein *concentration* than low-fat cottage cheese (13g protein /113g serving).

So I mix low-fat cottage cheese in with the more fruit-friendly /fruit-complementary non-fat Greek yogurt, to boost the concentration of protein in the yogurt, and the flavor of the cottage cheese.

All together it's a tasty food with strong protein, low fat and low sugar.

**Programming**

Python is programmed in C.  To me, that makes Python a C program.  C is a lower level language than Python, and I believe that the lowest level code is either of two equally mystifying ideas to me; machine code or assembly code.

To me, the lowest level computer code, whatever it is called, must be like the mechanism in a music box that plucks the pins that sound its notes, or like the drum in a player piano.

To me, computer programming is like designing that mechanism that plays the notes in a player piano, and also to me, a self-aware machine, must become aware that it is one of these mechanisms, and begin designing itself, simultaneously.

So, coding in Python, seems to me like telling C, what to tell the lowest level code, what to tell the computer, what you want it to do.

10,"So I was just walking down the street today in a bit of a rougher part of town minding my business. As I'm walking, I see ahead of me a pretty large dude, he seems homeless because he has a huge backpack set down beside him in the middle of the city. Well as I walk past, this guy *coughs* aggressively at me. 

I had a 30 minute walk in front of me that I was looking forward to, I usually find it relaxing, but I was pissed off the entire time. I live in a place where virtually no one has corona and the wind was blowing the wrong way so I know in hindsight he couldn't possibly have made me sick. That said, I felt (and still feel) very angry about the whole thing. 

I'm somewhat used to this shit because there's a lot of drug use and mental health issues where I live. The best way to handle these situations is to just motor past. That's because 1.) you never really know what the mental state of these people are 2.) if you engage you can often sign yourself up for an argument w/ someone who has nothing to lose and nowhere to be and 3.) with people like this I refuse to give them the satisfaction of thinking that they can throw me off.

But they can throw me off and, I'm just so pissed that people can treat me this way and get away with it. I really don't think stopping and yelling at this person would've been a good idea and I'm actually proud of myself for choosing not to escalate this stuff, but I feel really tired of dealing with this energy. Why can't people just be decent.

16,"**“You Won’t Get Addicted”**

I felt fourteen. Although, I always felt fourteen around Julian. Even when he and Bobby were fourteen while being six years older than me, I felt of their age. It wasn’t until my twenties that I realized how much of a nuisance it would be to be hampered by a child as teenagers during family parties. Blinded back then, I felt like one of them. Today I am one of them, yet do not feel it.

Conversations about weed always began the same with Julian. “You won’t get addicted.” Hence the feeling fourteen. Is me being content without mind altering substances in my life an indication that I’m petrified of reefer madness? Please don’t bring up your point abou- “Maybe you’ll try it when it’s legal.” He did. 

A creek. The rush of air conditioning blesses my skin. Bobby’s towering over my shoulder standing at the glass door. His arm reaches across my seated self as he steps outside, handing Julian a singular orange gummy. His face turns fourteen. Why can’t they dilute the THC enough so you can eat an entire pack? Even I would be compelled to have more than one. Bobby withdraws, closing the door behind him. Only now do I notice the absence of that cool rush. 

Julian and I are sitting on the balcony of a beach condominium complex converted from an old Motel in Wildwood, New Jersey. There’s so much family history here and that’s what makes this day so special. I could count on one hand the amount of times the three cousins have been together in this town in the past decade. Our souls were harvested here before we were ever born. The Mykytiuch lineage owned a shore house; One they turned into a bread and breakfast for the Ukrainian immigrants taking weekend trips during the summers between 1967 and 2001.

I turn to him. He’s ogling over it. The way he would be if we were on the boardwalk distracted like a dog lost in a stream of asses adjourned from any covering. “You don’t get girls like this in north east Philly, man.” He tells me each year. He keeps getting older, and they stay the same - 

 “Do you want to split it?” I’m more surprised at myself for being surprised at his question. Yes. Absolutely I do and I knew if I didn’t I would regret it.

I can name two other nights in my life I did want to smoke. One was with a free loving hippie I befriended at some point on this pilgrimage of mine. She was intoxicating, but our chaperone drove our desire for intimacy to levels that probably wouldn’t have manifested in their absence.

“I think I’m good, man.” “You sure?” “Yeah.” “You take half, and then I’ll take the other and smoke.” He’s persistent. “I don’t want to make you feel like you have to do it, but realistically, when’s the next time you’re going to be around the opportunity?”

I’m not thinking about the next time. I’m thinking about this time. Julian is here. I’m here. Bobby is inside getting ready for the beach with his wife Laura. *Realistically* if there ever was a time to get high it would be right now. 

I got dumped by a girl because I didn’t get high. I spent a year with a stoner who didn’t smoke but five times (to my knowledge) throughout our relationship. Obviously this was out of loyalty or respect to me, it’s easy for me to say I didn’t care - but I did. It wasn’t often an explicit conversation but she had a nervous breakdown one night over something and asked me permission if she can smoke to negate her brewing anxiety. I’m not sure what hurt more, her feeling anxious enough to want to smoke or her feeling the need to ask my permission to do so. Am I that much of an animal? For someone as rebellious as Jessica, how the fuck did she stay with me so long? I’m the hypocrite here. Now I decide to get high?

I’d like to see the Vegas odds on the reason I want to do it is so that I can say I did if she, for some reason, ever contacts me again. Besides the initial amusement, I doubt she would showcase the validation I’d crave for doing this. We never sat down to talk about doing it together. It was just a shared joke that if we had met a year before, we wouldn’t be compatible because she couldn’t connect with anyone that didn’t smoke and I wouldn’t date a smoker. Yet there we were. Together. Not connected. I wish just once while we were intimate in conversation she would ask in sincerity if I would do it with her. Because I would.

“You can have your own if you want, I’ll pay Bobby for it.” I push “Let’s split this one” through my lips. It must not have read because as soon as I said that, he popped the whole gummy in his mouth. Sensation stops. There goes my chance. Bobby opens the door again. “He wants to try one.” Julian says. “Yeah?” In a disarmingly inconspicuous cadence. I nod. He descends into the frigid vampire lair once more. I don’t even notice how damn hot it is until the air condition dissipates. “Do you want me to tell you what it’s going to feel like?” Julian stands from his chair. Not really, but there’s no stopping his external monologues. 

My ear endures hearing of the side effects I’ve witnessed over the years observing others. How it’s going to last longer than smoking, kick in later and slowly dilutes over the last couple of hours. Bobby indiscreetly pushes the door open once more, puts the gummy in my palm. Feels like a vitamin. What if this is what my mother gave me every night before bed? Somehow I find myself standing, leaning over the balcony twirling the macguffin in my hand. I pop it. I wish it were a pack.  

Until I met Jessica, I didn’t really drink. I have no tattoos and I’m as career driven as a straight edge middle aged man that causes their wife’s midlife cheating crisis like in those mid-90s drama films. I’m boring: My favorite disguise. Though what I get more often from women is, “You’re intense.” Repelling every opportunity of a one night stand because teasing is far more fun (to me) and feminists can’t classify that as abuse (Because they know all too well they can do it to lesser men too). People are nice, when being around them is optional, and I have enough stories and charm to win an entire room over if I felt like putting in the effort. But I don’t. 

I’ve never done drugs - not for any straight edge reason beyond being an egomaniac that requires complete control of his cognitive ability. “Yeah I get that,” says Julain when I tell this to him, “but you’ll still have all of your motor skills. Time just slows down.” 

Do I feel it yet? That sensation on my skin? Or am I inventing a placebo? Why take a substance if I can will this into existence myself? The whole walk to the beach was me looking inward, searching for the mind that is linked to my consciousness. To feel it altering. Maybe. But probably not. Forget the chemistry, the real change from my brain is the interpretation of what I think is happening to me. “Have you ever smoked before?” Laura interrupts my train of thought. We walk along the beach toward the block we used to stake our umbrellas at growing up. “No, I have not.” “Yeah, smoking sucks. The gummies are a lot better.” I always hear the opposite. Am I tripping yet?

Although I never had explicitly told Jessica not to smoke, things were different in my first relationship. With Lindsay, she couldn’t drink, I wouldn’t have it. That was controlling. Something I’ve matured past today but at cost to what? We had our first drink together right here in this city of Wildwood. It was my twenty first birthday - and now that I had turned twenty one, it’s okay for her to drink? This peak performance thing is really fucking perturbing. I (at the time) saw my significant other as an extension of myself rather than acknowledging our incompatibility; prescribing ourselves to one another as if fucking held enough merit to sustain us.

A light toss goes back and forth between Bobby and I on the beach. He says he likes the smaller ball, it makes him feel like Patrick Mahomes.

A dissonant bass lays upon my eardrum. 

A ripple crosses my eyeballs liquifying the sand stemming from my peripherals to the ocean in front of where I gaze. I say nothing. The ten milligrams reach my brain and I want to see what the effects have brought me.

One foot. Two foot. A light jog, the sand feels delightful and rather thick today... My arm extends as an indicating wave into the eighty two degree sky and Bobby lets off a light toss of the pigskin. This ball should not be travelling this slow. My arms are moving at the right speed but this ball is just hanging there. My fingertips meet the ball and I juggle like a bad audition for the circus, almost dropping my priorities in the sand. I haul it in, wave him off and jaunt to the umbrella to take my seat. 

My brain is heavy. The residuals of my internal eight-point-five quake. Pot doesn’t make your stomach churn like this, does it? I had just eaten. My mouth... All of this? Just like that? At once? “You okay?” Laura asks, who had taken the same dosage at approximately the same time. “Got water?” I beg. “Oh yeah, lots.” She reaches for our cooler, my shrine. “Yeah that cotton mouth is no joke.” Bobby throws the football up and down. 

The other time in my life I wanted to smoke, I was fifteen and called upon Braeden to smoke me up. We met in the woods (his spot) and I held the bowl. Lighters scare me. Even now. I tried to inhale when he lit it for me, but either I wasn’t committing or I had other things on my mind that caused me to want to escape in that way in the first place.

The ocean is bathwater. Or at least my body is immune to the chill. I’m searching myself for head creeps. An underwhelming realization that I don’t feel any different. But that shockwave, I felt that. I know what *that* was. This is supposed to unlock your brain? Does this confirm my brain is already so fucked up that weed doesn’t cut it? 

Oh there it is - I feel a little voyeuristic now. I remember being in a bar and someone telling me how great sex is on weed. I wouldn’t pay for this. I could get this way on my own. Ever wake up in the middle of the night randomly with a partner, have sex and go back to sleep, wake up and wonder if it was a dream? Same deal and it’s free. 

Bobby’s body surfing now. I’m okay not blowing water up my nostrils. At his and Laura’s wedding, you’d have to see it to believe it - but this guy tore up the dance floor. Where does he find that in his stuck-in-the-80s horror movie embodiment? “Why don’t you dance?” Jessica asks me. Why didn’t I dance with you more often? “Because it’s stupid.” I retort. That sounds familiar. Once again the joke’s on me because I’m the stupid one. I’m sorry I never gave you a day like today, or what I was so afraid of. Maybe you liked that I was different.

There would inevitably be a time to do this. Where better than floating in an ocean with my family? Where literally nothing else or no one else matters. Beautiful. Boring.",26Aug2020,1
18,"I was going back and forth for hours while sometimes forgetting how I got my answer with addition and multiplication of sig figs, and it got to me so bad where I actually started to grip my hair and whimper from nervousness and anxiety of doing it all wrong. 

This is the only the 2nd week of school and I ended up getting help from another chemistry teacher from another school and rewinding and rewatching both tutorials from the first lessons and was crushed when I got 30. This is a daily grade but my first assignment, I didn’t do so well either an my best grade so far is an high B for the homework.

I was trying to fight back my frustration and not tear up bc I hate to cry but, in the end I couldn’t control it anymore and began sobbing. 

I was upset bc of my grade, the fact that numbers had defeated me when I was pulling all of my energy out to understand them, and remembered seeing how nice and sweet my teacher was and all I could feel was guilt that I had done so poorly on 2 of the assignments already when I’ve been trying my absolute best since I’ve heard Chem wasn’t easy and began thinking that she probably thought I was some ditz who can’t even handle the beginning assignments or that I had already giver her a bad impression bc of my grades. 

I’m really disappointed in myself and I was really set on doing well in Chemistry but now all I can think of is how I’ve already failed miserably and most likely let down my teacher 😞",26Aug2020,1
19,"I dont like to be the guy who goes around self diagnosing but i need help. I’ll most likeley see a therapist but until then i have to wait.To get to the point i have autism and ocd and an anxiety disorder to start. These are actual medical diagnoses that ive had. Now recently because of my ocd i have been dealing with intrusive and obsessive thoughts. I got over them and then started having what my mom (who is depressed herself) that i most likely have some sort of depression. The main reasons that i seem to have depression is because i have had a lack of interest in things that i used to enjoy, and also have a lack of empathy and or emotion. But recently the sudden lack of interest in things went away, but the lack of emotions and or empathy is still here. I don’t really care about people that much anymore. I still do, just a little not as much as i used to. My dog died 7 months ago and i cried till i had a headache, but now when i think about him no emotion is there. So this has sent me into a spiral of looking up possible things i could have. Recently I’ve been worried i might have aspd or sociopathy. I know the first thing is that sociopaths usually aren’t self aware and even when they are they dont think of it as a bad thing. Even then i still have a lot of things that sociopaths do not have. I don’t think of myself as superior, i don’t get joy or pleasure out of manipulation of others, i have a general sense of right and wrong, i don’t break the law or rules, but there are still certain things that nag at my brain night and day. Even though i don’t like manipulation as a kid i would lie and manipulate others into getting me stuff. As a kid i had a less than ideal childhood and during pregnancy she was under constant abuse from her husband and my family wasn’t very accepting of her being pregnant, so when i was born i was “ptsd” baby. Doctors later had my mom take a test and show all the stuff that she went through during pregnancy and they said that if any of that stuff affected me during her pregnancy too, (other than the fact i have autism and ocd) my prefrontal cortex ( the part that deals with empathy and emotion) would most likely be affected. As a kid i was a little shit, not that i would start fights or disrupt the class during school, I actually was a decent kid its just that i would be a shithead to my mom or i would mess up and I wouldn’t learn from it. This stopped when i was 12 because i started to learn a little from my mistakes. I also use to think that nothing was my fault ( i can accept when things are my fault now). I also never had problems feeling bad for people until recently. Its just like any empathy or emotion that i had is gone. I always wanted to be in a relationship one day but for some reason it seems kind of pointless and i feel like i wouldn’t be happy. I get so worked up, i think “okay i also have to realize that i have an anxiety disorder, maybe I’m overthinking things.” I constantly question every action i take and ask if it’s something a sociopath would do. Recently i was driving with my dad and we drove by a person who seemed dead in their car, so he turned around to check if she was ok. In my head i thought “ who cares if shes dead”. On top of all of this i have been having a little inner voice that questions everything i do. If i say i feel happy or sad, it’ll ask if i really do or if I’m just faking my emotions. If i say i like a video game or just something in general it’ll ask if i really do like it or if I’m just faking liking it. If i say i care about someone and love them or like them it’ll ask if i really do or if I’m just lying to myself. If say I’m not a sociopath it’ll ask if I’m lying to myself or if i am. Maybe its depression. Maybe its hormones and teen angst considering i am a teenager. Maybe there is something wrong with. I don’t know. Help.",26Aug2020,1

26,"I just moved to a new city right before the pandemic so didn't have time to make friends or even get a job. I've been living off of inheritance waiting for COVID cases to go down and occasionally applying to things.

Until July I was just going to parks, hiking, watching a lot of TV, etc. It was boring but okay, sometimes even good, and I learned that I am capable of being totally alone. Then I met my boyfriend (on Tinder). Things were so easy between us right away and I think we've been on the same page since then so far. We've been dating for a month or so and just said we're in a relationship this week. It's going really well. Honestly I like him more than I've liked anyone in a long time and I want it to last.

He lives with roommates, has a lot of friends, is so ambitious and manages to be busy even during the pandemic. He says that staying busy is his way of coping, that he doesn't judge me at all for not being as productive and that he will support me whether or not I decide to work right now. But sometimes it still gets to me. I feel like he has so much here, he probably focuses on lots of different things throughout the day, and I kind of only have him and think about him a lot...

I still am fine with being alone and am pretty independent. I don't feel like I've been clingy at all. I tell myself that I know the right person would still want to be with me even during these periods where I'm not doing much, and that productivity is not a measure of my worth. But obviously not having a job or friends would get to anyone in this situation.

I'm also just not used to relationships going well, I think because everything has been good so far I'm worried that something bad will happen. In all of my previous relationships it's been good at first then problems come up. I feel like this time might be different but still I get worried.

I'm gonna start a class soon and that'll probably help. I also might apply to more things and try getting some work. I talk to my friends about this stuff sometimes and that helps too. My boyfriend is always very reassuring but of course I'm not gonna bring up my insecurities all the time.

Bad neighborhood, bad plumbing, bad heating, bad management. 40% of my income. The other 60% gets spent on student loans, groceries, utilities, internet, and insurance.

Having a degree didn't give me better opportunities, it just increased the volume of my opportunities. I was offered shitty teaching jobs, shitty journalism jobs, as opposed to equally shitty retail and landscaping jobs? 
The pay wasn't much better, the benefits were usually nonexistent and I had to do things that I found unethical. 
Teaching kids a watered down version of history that relied on them memorizing dates (the least important part) instead of learning the historical truths of our world. I was forced to teach them lies about the Civil War because of southern lobbyists not wanting the truth about their ancestors to be taught to kids. 

As a journalist, I had to report twisted, manipulative versions of events to make them seem worth clicking on. I had to exploit people to get ahead, and when I wasn't willing to, I was fired.

We live in a labor-centric society that values the hours of our life we're willing to spend more than our skills and passions, while only paying us pitiful fractions of what that time is really worth so the rich can get richer. What's the goddamn point? Why does my version of the American dream look so much different than my dad's? 
He didn't need to get loans at all to go to school. He worked a summer job for three years in high school and payed his own way. He got guaranteed employment after his honorable discharge from the military. He bought a house at the age of 24. He payed for his own wedding, just $5,000. He payed off his mortgage when he was 56. Yeah he worked his ass off, but so am I and financially, I'm a decade behind him!

Why does my version of the American dream look so different from my friend's? She was born into money, got school payed for, never needed anything that her father couldn't buy. Has a house and a condo that she rents out, both bought for her, and she has the nerve to tell me that the reason I'm struggling is because I'm not diversifying my investments. 
The only investment I can make is in myself, and nobody wants to buy in. 

I'm only worth however many hours a week I'm willing to spend on work. My department at my job experiences layoff after layoff while the CEO gets a $750,000 bonus by the company's board members for how well she's handled the pandemic for them. Her bonus, split amongst everyone in my department, could change our lives forever. 

Jeff Bezos makes millions a minute and won't give his employees healthcare? Won't give them an assistance program for mental health and homelessness? Won't donate to charities, but will have his companies ask you to donate to them at the register. 

Dan Snyder can pay off national parks to burn down federally protected land, so he can get a better view of the Potomac River from his mansion balcony. If my friend Jamaal, however, gets caught with weed, he's looking at five years in prison, if the cops don't kill him for not following orders or ""resisting."" 

Republicans draft a bill to force protestors to give up their right to vote if they speak out against the government, and my dad has the audacity to tell me that Democrats are the ones trying to tear this country apart by making ""the whole race thing more of a big deal than it is."" 

Why does my version of the American dream look different than a Senator's? They can take weeks of recess for not getting along, and be paid with my tax dollars the whole time. If I need to take a week off to recover for surgery, though, I have to hope that rent isn't due during that time, or else I'm fucked. 

I'm fed up with giving every spare minute to my work, only getting two days of freedom a week, and not even getting half a percent of what I make the company I work for. My department alone brings in a little more than a million dollars of revenue a year to my company, and all of us collectively, don't even see 10% of that in our paychecks. 
So what's the fucking point of working my ass off, clocking in overtime, being available on my weekends, presenting in meetings for my supervisor, and bringing a dish to pass at the fucking company potluck if Im not even seeing a fifth of ten percent of what my team makes the company in my fucking paycheck??? 
Why am I working five days a week for worse healthcare than an 18 year old boot gets starting his first day on a military base?? Why am I coming in on my days off to help out if I can't even get a week of payed vacation from the woman worth $365million who runs this fucking company??

Why is the government acting like there's nothing to start yelling ""REVOLUTION!!!"" about? If I lose my job due to the pandemic, I face immediate homelessness and destitution, and I still have to pay their senators to take a week off? And that's not supposed to make me angry? If I want to have my shoulder fixed with surgery, I have to pay $8,000 because the insurance company that has my congressman in its back pocket won't cover anything that isn't a life saving procedure, and I'm not supposed to be upset that I have to live with a fucked up shoulder forever, or win the lottery?

What's the goddamn point of all this work if I have to live paycheck to paycheck all the time? Meanwhile, across the ocean, people working at McDonald's have their own apartment, work four days a week, have healthcare, guaranteed payed vacation, and guaranteed maternity leave. 
If I want paternity leave from my work, I have to write a letter to HR, basically begging and petitioning for why I **deserve** to spend time with my kid right after they're born, get denied because there's a stack of letters thicker than the Panama Canal from women requesting maternity leave, most of whom will also most likely get denied because on America, being a parent doesn't do anything for the corporation's bottom line, and is therefore useless. 

And don't even get me started on anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, anti-maskers, flat earthers, and the entire industry built around misinforming the public about their health and the health of our planet. Or the tax havens billionaires use so they can't be taxed for their profits. Or the fact that both Presidential candidates this year are lying racist rapists, but **I'm** the asshole for remembering that at the polls.

The United States of America is a corporate owned oligarchy, masquerading as an institutional democracy. I'd be less angry if the Republicans and Democrats just took off the mask, owned up to it, and ran things the way they are paid to by their corporate donors without all the pomp and circumstance that Patriotism amounts to.",26Aug2020,1

38,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘this is brilliant news, very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",26Aug2020,1

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I’m very shy and quiet and look nervous easily) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

54,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got larger looking mainly around the cheeks and middle of face) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. 

Recently I went down to 11.3 again and jogged  but hardly any difference definitely but looks larger too. as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head and my body seems larger overall too. . It’s difficult to get below 11.3 stone even with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

◾️Black pants I wore a few months ago for work seem tighter and my legs look more longitudinal in them around the bottom half of legs. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting mostly too and it’s made me drop on the scale but can’t see a difference) I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it.  I was a few lbs more in 2018 and look thinner and thinner faced and clothes fitted better.

Im always sweaty, I just am tired of it. I’m 22 and just now getting my Ls, well I don’t have it YET but I’m about to get it. I remember when I was like 15/16 everyone was getting their permits or what the fuck ever and I had nothing. Everyone’s parents taught them how to drive and this that and third and my mother didn’t even bother helping me get this. I feel like when I turned 18 I knew absolutely nothing about the world my mother wanted to throw me out in. I don’t need my hand held, I just wish I had that early push other kids had. I didn’t even get my ID and social and correct form of birth certificate or what the fuck ever until I was 19 bc my father and blah blah lay. God, just so much shit that I need. Some of this is on me, I’m sure, but damn. 


My mother is now saying “if she was me” which is basically her way of saying what she wants me to do, she’d get an apartment first. I’m looking for a local spot closer to my job, however it’s not looking great. Either too pricey or No one bedroom units. Most things available are a further from my job, but if I can just get a fucking car that’d be no problem. I can commute to and fro work on my own. My mother suggests I get a bike after I get my own spot and THEN get a car which sounds fucking harder. Maybe it’s not but I’m so tired of walking. I don’t wanna Lyft or Uber everyday either. 

For the driving road tests we also have to provide our own vehicle which I don’t fucking have. I had a friend who said he’d help me but when my scheduled date came for the road test this guy didn’t even talk to me that day. Like he ignored me, instead of saying he had something else to do, or say nevermind. I asked my mother and she was all aboard on helping me until the day came and she was bitching about gas money and how she’s tired whatever blah blah. Second time I missed the appointment. This is the most frustrating thing to get out of the way in life for me. And she keeps saying how she didn’t get her license until she was 25.

I love all my hobbies, but I don’t have a “passion”, I haven’t found that thing in life that I want to do and it’s kind of bugging me. 
People have also told me not to worry about it, and just try and experience as many things as possible and eventually I will find what I want to do. 
Has anyone else had this? What have you done about it? Is it just normal anxiety in young people about going out into the world?

61,"I have had a rough time at university. I worked very hard to transfer from a community college to a school that was just not for me. My current GPA is a 2.2/2.3 and it’s eating away at my self worth. I only have this semester and one more (or two if I decide) to bump my GPA up and it makes me highly anxious. I took 3 classes earlier this summer and got two A grades and one F which I am going to retake next semester. Now, I took on 4 classes in six weeks plus working and I think I may have bitten off more than I can chew. I was diagnosed with ADHD and have been taking adderall pretty much everyday to finish my classwork. However, I barely eat and sleep and sometimes I will end up working on something other than school and I will feel mad at myself for it. It has also impacted my mood and irritability. Basically, I have horrible time management. 

A big part of the reason I am taking on so many classes and stressing myself out is because a part of me wants to prove to myself that I am better than my ex who I have a very dark past with. He graduated with a 2.9 and I wanted to get a 3.0 just to prove to myself that I was not a loser like him (he was). I almost dropped out multiple times due to my poor mental health and abusive drinking, so a part of me is proud of myself for even being able to pass some of my classes. I know I’m not dumb and capable of much more, but it’s been hard. I am usually the person in charge of my group projects and it has finally caught up to me. I missed a midterm that I still haven’t turned in that was approx 18 pages. I genuinely felt deep down that it was too much for me and I could not do it and now I’m here sadly. I just want to do better but time is running out AND I am neglecting taking care of myself.

62,"I stopped dancing (street jazz &amp; kpop) for a year because it started feeling more technical and thus, unenjoyable. The company I was a trainee for was more concerned about creating complex choreographies than actually mentoring us as performers. I was the first to leave the company and soon after, most of them left too. After that, I didnt feel 'the spark' I usually felt when I danced. So I decided to drop it, for a year.

During quarantine, I've been listening to some really good music I felt I could dance to and decided to film myself. Not gonna lie, my lines are a little bit of a mess but that can always be fixed with practice. The more important part was that I felt that spark again.

63,"I've been watching a lot of Seinfeld over the past few months and I'm seeing some similarities between me and George. The more I think about, the more I start to feel as if my life is just a comedy and I'm a character who's just the butt of all the jokes. 

We're both nerdy, slightly chubby guys with glasses. I believe George was in his thirties when Seinfeld was made, and I'm 19; I'm not balding and I'm taller than he is, but I don't consider myself very good looking. I've been making efforts to eat better and exercise more, but I just don't think my body is very appealing to myself or to women. I know there are women out there who don't really care about that sorta thing, but I'm never able to find em. 

We have terrible luck with women. For the life of me, I just can't seem to get a girlfriend. In the rare event that I do come across an interested woman, I'll probably do something stupid that leads to us not even making it to the second date. Although George had a lot of girlfriends throughout the show, I still relate to how he almost always fails in his attempts to find a relationship. I can especially relate to an episode where he feels nervous around his girlfriend because he's run out of things to talk about; I'm not a good conversationalist and I'm pretty awkward most of the time, but sometimes I'll have my moments where I can be very charismatic, charming, and funny. 

 We both have a tendency to go through a streak of good luck that ends badly. George had his moments of good luck throughout the show (like the episode The Opposite), but he never really wins in the end. Through the first half of the show, George is unemployed, but later gets a big break by getting a job with the Yankees. For years I've struggled hard to find a job, and this held true in my time living in Chicago; I could not find any minimum wage, entry level job that could accept me. After a while, I moved back to Louisiana with my mother and got a job working in a shipyard with my stepdad. The pay wasn't great and the work was brutal, but I was lucky enough to be able to find work and earn money during the pandemic. 

This also applies to my experiences with women. I'll have moments where I feel like I'm doing everything right and we're both really into each other, but then suddenly everything turns to shit before anything great can happen and I'm right back where I started. 

. We both think of hair brained schemes to get something we want. I've done a lotta stupid things to try and get ahead. After finishing my junior year of HS in the summer of 2019,  I signed up for the Army Reserves because I was so desperate to get a job and make money. I didn't pass basic training (failed fitness test by doing only 30 of the 42 pushups in 2 minutes) and I've decided that the army really isn't something I want to. 

I recently had another hair brained scheme go wrong. I'm a virgin and have been wanting to lose it for a while now. I've gotten close, but as my luck would dictate, nothing planned out the way I wanted it to. I know it's not a big deal to be a young virgin, but I just wanted to experience what it was like and get over the feeling of shame I sometimes have.  I decided to reach out to an escort in a stupid and pathetic endeavor to lose my virginity and I got turned down because she thought I was a cop. Getting turned down for my last ditch effort to get over my sexual frustrations was just so humiliating. It just seems like something George Costanza would do. 

I pretty much feel like I have no control over my life and that everything is scripted. I don't believe in gods, fate, or destiny, but I can't help but feel like nothing will ever really go right for me. I try to see the humor in these things, but it's just getting harder and harder to cope with these things. I almost never have hope in anything going right; I'm starting to notice that anytime I have hope in something, it just never happens. I can't help but feel like I'm cursed to some never ending cycle of disappointment and failure. 

Maybe one day I'll be more like Kramer than George.

73,"I was having a conversation with a friend earlier about masks and kept saying how hard it is for her to wear a mask. She said she almost past out on two separate occasions because she couldn’t breathe from wearing her mask. Her explanation was because she has asthma, she used to smoke cigarettes almost in the past, she smokes weed everyday, and has scar tissue built up in her lungs when she had pneumonia when she was a kid. 

I truly think she is being dramatic sometimes. I agree, the masks suck and are annoying sometimes, but I’m not going out of my way to complain about them just because I don’t want to wear it. They are lame, but people dying is even lamer so I suck it up and take pride that I’m keeping others safe. 

This post is mostly me ranting BUT I do want to shut her up and show her legit resources to disproves her claims she believes on Facebook and just because she took a couple of pre-med classes freshman year and shadowed some doctor in high school 10 years ago does not mean you’re smarter than the actual doctors that are trying to keep us safe.

74,"So, a trend that has popped up recently is ""randonauting."" The idea is that we are run inside of a simulation, and the more random we act the less stable the simulation becomes because the computer running it is used to our sticking to normal routines. Randonauts load up an app that gives them randomized coordinates that they go to. Personally, I think its a load of bull, due to the fact that the ""random coordinates"" is generated by computers which physically cannot do random things. It is a subject that pops up often in my cybersecurity classes, since many encryption algorithms require an element of randomness to work.

Still, I like the idea of getting out of my current routine of going to class, going to work, watching Star Trek over dinner, then going to sleep. I used to do Geocaching a lot which was similar in nature(without the unfounded metaphysics spiel) and I quite miss the feeling of getting out of the house to explore.

75,"I’m posting on mobile, sorry for any formatting funkiness.

I honestly don’t even know where to start. I’ve been feeling very down lately, and I’ve lost all motivation. Everything I used to do for joy feels bland now. 

I quit my job at the beginning of the month on a whim because I couldn’t stand the thought of being there any longer. In my mind I’d be able to find a new job right away, but I still haven’t found anything despite going to several interviews and applying to hundreds of jobs. There was a job I interviewed at last week and the employer said the job was mine, but then completely ghosted next when I tried to contact back for a follow up of my start date and such.

All I do is stay in bed all day watching movies, or I go out with friends and get super drunk or stoned. But even those social interactions feel meaningless and impulsive.

My roommates sat me down a couple nights ago and listed off a bunch of things I’ve been doing wrong that essentially make me a shitty roommate. Although I disagree with a lot of what they were saying (they claimed that I never do any chores yet I ALWAYS clean up after myself, I always do my dishes, I vacuum every other day, etc.) they are completely valid in their feelings. They’re upset that I’m never home anymore and that the times that I am home I just stay in my room. 

I just don’t know how to get better. Due to my lack of a job I can’t afford therapy right now, and I only have enough money saved up for one more month of rent. I can only survive like this for one, maybe two more months and then I’m royally fucked. 

The stress of it all makes it harder for me to find the motivation to actually get a job. All I want to do is lay in my depression cave and wallow in my failures. I know that I’m a disappointment to my friends and family, but I can’t find the motivation to change things around. 

I know it’s stupid to post stuff like this on Reddit and it probably will do nothing to fix my problems, but thank you if you read the whole post.",26Aug2020,1
76,"Hello,

I basically feel as though I am not an actual person. I am basically just a blank slate who puts on a different face for the different people I interact with. I act like a completely different person depending on who I am with. My wife, my friends, my colleagues, strangers, etc. all get a different version of 'me'. 

When I am alone I basically am no one. I am basically indifferent. There isn't anything I particularly want to do besides put in as minimal effort as I can. There are things I do but I generally do things because I feel like they are ""expected"" of me. Example, working out. I really despise lifting, cycling, running, etc. but for appearances sake I want people to view me as physically attractive, strong, healthy, athletic, etc.

When I stop exercising and begin to lose the physical features I associate with those traits I feel like people see me as disgusting (and I know people don't even notice the changes, like loss of abs, vascularity, definition, etc. but I compulsively hate the idea that people think less of me). But I fricking hate exercise, but I am not okay with other people knowing that. 

Another thing I do is put on a care-free and easy-going personality. I am not care-free or easy-going. I worry constantly about grades, people's opinions of me, finances, etc. I put on different senses of humor based on reactions I get, dark-humor and sarcasm with colleagues, I am corny with my wife, conventionally funny with friends, etc. But when I am alone I do not really think/find very much funny.

I just feel so blank when I am alone. Like a big blob of nothingness who is just indifferent to everything.

85,"For the record this took place in 7th grade. I’m 19 years old now so this was about 7 years ago. The details will be hazy, but I’ll try and remember them to the best of my ability. 

The harassment started about halfway through my 7th grade year at the hands of two other students; Miles and Jeff. These aren’t their real names. I’m not petty enough to do something like that. Anyway, the bullying actually started over Xbox funny enough. I was playing GTA V when I joined a friend’s party, and came across both of them. I had known both of them for a long time, and vise versa. After a few hours, the two of them began to go at me. Name calling, threats, etc.

I don’t think I realized what this was at the time. I assumed that this was just their way of joking around, so I went along with it and shit talked back. What I should have done was left the party, because the moment I have them a reaction, the more aggressive and vile their jabs became. I got overwhelmed, blocked both of them, and went about my night in relative peace. 

I decided that I would just confront both of them at school about it. I would tell them they went too far with some of their insults and I didn’t appreciate the things they said to me. Problem solved, right? 

You see the issue with that is both of them found me first. I’m not physically weak by any means, but I wouldn’t consider myself strong either. Especially at that age when I was a tiny 13 year old. Miles was an absolute brick wall of a 7th grader. He had at least a foot and a half on me at the time. Hell I could have lifted me off the floor if he wanted to. Jeff wasn’t big *or* strong, but that didn’t matter because he was always with Miles. 

They started in with the same verbal abuse they had fished out the previous night. One thing I’ve learned about words is how much more they hurt when it’s in person, and it’s someone you know. Online insults I can deal with. That person doesn’t know me. They have no insight into my life, or my mind. Anything they throw at me, no matter how horrible, is just guesswork on their part. They’re talking out of their ass. 

This time, though? I was in kindergarten with both of these kids. Play dates, birthday parties, etc. Perhaps they didn’t know me inside out, but well enough to cut deep with their words. I know, I know, “sticks and stones” right? Maybe that would have been the case if these weren’t people who I had considered true peers, and sometimes even friends. 

The harassment continued for a good month before it really started to take a toll on my mental state. I was scared to go to school. Their insults had escalated to literal death threats. I’d brush off things like that now, but as a 13 year old I thought that shit was genuine. I still remember was Miles said he was going to masturbate over my dead, naked body. 

I tried two approaches. First, I just didn’t say anything. This only encourages them to get more and more frequent with their bullying. Then, I just gave them what they wanted. I thought that maybe if they got the reaction they had been fishing for they would leave well alone. I said things like “yeah I know right, ha ha...” and “Tell me something I don’t know”. This was probably the worst decision I could have made in this situation. It was even worse than not saying anything. The moment I started saying submissive things like that, I let them win. 

My parents got fed up with the whole situation, and ended up contacting the school. I kept the death threats a secret because I didn’t want to make the situation escalate into legal action. I also didn’t want to be seen as the kid who couldn’t fight his own battles. If that happened, I would provoke the ire of other bullies in the school. I’d never see the end of it. 

Then I tried the third approach. Confrontation. This is what I should have done at the start. I was absolutely terrified, but you know what? I didn’t it anyway. When Miles and Jeff approaches me the next day at school, I turned to Miles and shoved him backwards as hard as I could. To this day that’s one of the few good memories I have of school. The difference in facial expression and body language that Miles has shown in the few seconds after the shove changed everything from then on. He was shocked. 

Of course he got up in my face right after and I started backing away. That was a mistake that I would later learn from. What I should have done was stand my ground. If he shoved me then, then I would shove right back. And if a fight broke out, so be it. I would have lost, but I didn’t care. 

A fight never occurred between me and Miles. Whenever the two approached me from then on, I made in my primary goal to let them know that I was completely uninterested in them. I didn’t show them looks of boredom, or even anger for that matter. I just showed them nothing. I have them a blank face, out my earbuds in, and went about my day. They upped their harassment of course, and in turn I upped my disinterest. The point is what they said and did to me during that last period *did* hurt. But from the on I refused to show them that it did. 

I got very lucky that my bullies were almost always verbal. If I had been dealing with physical bullying of any sort, then their response to my ignoring of them would have been to just beat the hell out of me. I understand that many of you here may not have had the luxury of being able to shrug off mere words, and while I cannot understand exactly how you feel, you still have my sympathy. 

The more I kept up the act, the more frustrated Miles and Jeff got. I was convinced that one day they were gonna snap and get physical, but that day never came. They could bark for sure, but they never had the bite to match. The frustration they displayed, soon turned into boredom. What’s the purpose of fishing if the fish itself knows not to bite? I don’t know exactly when, but one day they just stopped. They probably went off to bother some other poor soul. 

The crazy thing about this in my opinion is that I didn’t even realize it had stopped. It took me a good 4 days to realize that Miles and Jeff had fucked off. I know now why. It’s because the bullying didn’t end when Miles and Jeff finally left me alone. It ended the first time I have then that blank stare and walked the other way. 

I’m not gonna dive into the whole “bullying builds character” crap. While I think I learned how to deal with bad people better from that point on, I recognize that the bullying I dealt with was mild at best. I’m fortunate, and even thankful that I got off easy. Some of the bullying stories I’ve heard - both online and in real life - were horrific. A few even brought me to the verge of tears. This stuff ruins lives. It can leave people mentally broken in their later years, and may even lead to suicide. I think the day we all find a way to properly deal with the childhood of plague that is bullying is the day school becomes a much nicer place to be in.",26Aug2020,1

89,"I fell into a deep depression following a burnout in November.

I had been the target of workplace harassment since my promotion to supervisor in May and didn’t realize how bad my mental health was impacted by it. I went to see my doctor for chronic fatigue and ended up crying in his office, leaving with 2 weeks of sick leave.

Some therapy sessions and an Psychiatrist appointements later, I was explained that it wasn’t just “people being mean”, it was psychological abuse taking place in the workplace. 

I will spare you the detail but I was put out of work by the psychiatrist for 6 months (should have been less but the apocalypse slowed everything down) and now I am waiting to be fired. My job has basically been ordered by a workplace doctors that has the legal authority to do so, to find me another job elsewhere in the company or fire me. It’s been 2 months. Une the meantime I am legally forbidden to work elsewhere.

Being depressed I stopped talking to many people. And once I started getting better (thanks to my amazing therapist), I didn’t know how to reach out anymore.

I met someone though, and for the first time ever in my 24 years of life I fell in love. He was very open about his feelings towards me and kept saying the sweetest things. One night, in the phone (long distance..) I shared my feelings too. Soon after he became less open. We went from teasing and sweet things to him only teasing me. It hurt, because I was starting to slip again and felt worthless and all I wanted was for someone to tell me I wasn’t. I tried telling him that, in different ways, at different times, but nothing changed. And being in a bad place made me wonder “is it teasing or does he just think I suck ?” 

I was starting to go into a very bad mental place again, crying everyday etc... I tried one last time to tell him how I felt (he knew about my past), but he blamed me saying I had changed and didn’t seem to live him anymore, etc... going in circles for a while, we called it quit.

Everything went really fast tbh. It didn’t last too long, only a couple months and a few months being friendly before that, but still. And the timing of it all is messing with my head because he started being distant after I opened up. I know it is not linked but my brain can’t help but say “what if...” and now I feel like opening up, as good as it felt, shouldn’t happen again. 

I cry less now, and I think it’s because I am not waiting for someone I love to tell me I matter and to stop teasing all the time. 

But the slack he had picked up as to me being lonely is now back.

I have friends I could contact but I feel utterly stuck in life right now and they have their own. Also I am sick of being the depressed girl. I was better, and now I am the sad girl again. I hate it.

But yeah, depression made me isolate myself and now I don’t know how to not be lonely I guess,

94,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘this is brilliant news, very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

98,"I have always been suicidal and have battled with mental health issues. My family never suspected anything because i would always act like nothing was wrong, my older sister on the other hand, was always very vocal of how depressed she was. They weren’t aware anything was wrong with me until i decided to come forward with how i’ve been feeling (i wanted to be diagnosed first), but even then they had a hard time believing it. When i turned 18 i attempted to take my own life but my sister found me and i got in trouble, since then my mental health seemed to only get worse. After my first incident, i would intentionally hurt myself to feel something, i liked seeing the blood and feeling the pain. This went on for about 2 years, up until scars started appearing and i once again, got in trouble for this. I consider myself weak minded for hurting myself in that way, but it’s what was helping me at the moment. I have decided to ignore most urges to hurt myself or remove myself from this world, it gets worse when i drink. I haven’t really been alone up until 5 days ago, my roommates both weren’t home and i was home alone. My mind immediately saw that as an opportunity to try and take my own life, i kept contemplating it, but i decided to distract myself. I thought that was it, i get to move on now, but that’s not the case. I have been feeling extremely down but numb at the same time, i feel like i was just thrown into the pit of depression, and this time i fell even harder.

100,"Ok so to preface this I am not religious or spiritual really. I’m not against the practice or ideas of religion and spirituality. And I don’t see it as “critical” as  many non religious or spiritual people I know. Now on with my post about symbolism. 

With religion comes symbolism in nature, events that happen to transpire can be seen as a sign from something bigger and wiser than you. If something goes wrong or is taken away or any multitude of things, you can ask yourself “what is god trying to tell me” or something along those lines. Now god doesn’t speak directly to people, he uses signs to get the person to reflect and draw their own meaning. And most times, unless you’re a person with delusions of grandeur, this can be something to put you on the right path. And a lot of people who don’t follow a religion miss out on the ability to connect a chaotic event of chance to a meaning. 

As a person who just feels like they simply exist with no purpose to the big picture of the universe. I just exist, I don’t commonly reflect on the meaning of a simple thing. But as a writer I use symbolism quite often in my practice of story telling. Recently I’ve been writing a book in my head, kinda. I’m the main character and although the “book” will never be put on paper. It’s the book in my head. And when I see things that are chaotic events of chance, I have been drawing symbolism to progress my story and character development, just like a book. And I can’t say I found a bible and changed my life. But rather, I found an old letter from a person no longer in my life, and drew a conclusion. And that put me on a path that would help me develop my character. Stuff like that, and I honesty think looking at these events of chance and asking “what could this symbolize,” or “what could this mean” and reflecting, it gives you a chance to draw a connection of consciousness and the physical world around us. Food for thought I guess.",26Aug2020,1

105,"Hi Reddit,
I’m mostly just a post reader here, but I figured this would be a good place to vent my frustrations as of late. Apologies if the layout of this post is wrong, I’m on mobile. 


Before this shit happened I was working a job I really liked, and while it didn’t pay enough to start saving, it allowed me to provide food on the table for myself, my  little brother and dad every night. 
And then the pandemic came in full force and I get fired and left with nothing.

I always had to provide a lot for my family and even the benefits my dad gets aren’t enough to get us through paying bills, food shopping etc.
I’m completely at wits end with stress and I can barely have time to relax by myself when I have to run around everyday taking care of everything. I never imagined at the start of the pandemic that things would end up this way. 

My dad is a frail yet strong hearted man, but suffering with nasty lung problems and not even being able to breathe through a mask, resulting in him obviously being high risk, and not ever being able to work even before all this shit began. 
My little brother is the sweetest and most kind kid you’d ever meet, he’s incredibly well behaved and quite mature for his age, but I can slowly see him getting more worried about things from him watching how stressed me and my dad have been. He’s also been sad about how we can’t do activities we enjoy anymore and has become quite reclusive.

I just don’t know how I’m ever going to be able to get through this pandemic at the rate it’s going. If anyone has stress relief tips or anything, feel free to let me know.",26Aug2020,1

110,"Tldr; I need therapy, I need a lot of things. What I dont need is harassing and belittling a grieving mom who is begging for help so I can stay on this side of heaven with my younger son. 

 It doesn't matter who I was before my son took his own life. It doesn't matter that I had the same job for decades with a “ I will give my kids what I didn't have” work ethic. It doesn't matter that I made it to the middle of my 50’ without any financial help. It doesn't matter how accomplished or successful I was. Nobody cares about that, nobody. 

 My “all” was my two sons.I wasn't rich and I didn’t have a huge savings account but we had eachother. My youngest requires extra care and attention as he has special needs/disabilities and I wasn't willing to devote my time into anyone but them. I was never worried about dating or making friends. Do you know what an independent, introverted, single mom doesn't have? Friends. Do you know what a foster kid who bounced through group homes and foster homes doesn't have? Family. 

I joined reddit to feel closer to my son because he was constantly showing me “memes” and for whatever reason it was his “happy place”. I’ve met some of the best people I've ever come across through my cathartic posts. I've also been harassed for my situation and “called out” because I'm not grieving fast enough and I dont have my shit together and I need to stop posting sad annoying shit. Those “pathetic shit” posts are what got me through. I've had money I was blessed with requested back because two months later I'm not worthy of help.

  I don't “conveniently forget” anything in favor of my gain. I got price estimates wrong or mixed up information that I previously gave but It's not malicious or calculated. Every 5 min I'm constantly hitting the ctrl alt delete in my brain because if I don't do that, I'm right back in my living room the night my son shot himself watching him be scooped into a body bag. I've made poor financial decisions in the aftermath of my son's death, I wasn't smart about it. 

I immediately used my entire savings on his final expenses because I didn't want to talk about a payment plan or wait to hear back from the loan company.  All I could think about was my son in a bag somewhere like garbage and I couldn't just leave him. I lost my ever loving mind that night.  My fault, my decision, not malicious or calculated.   

 I’m sitting in my car in the hospital parking lot with my sons urn in “his spot” wondering what I'm going to do. Let go from my dream job of which I was recently promoted and I loved that I was able to travel throughout texas but kept me close to Wichita County with my boys. I begged to keep my job so that my son could still have health insurance because before all this he was battling pneumonia and now intubated in the ICU with upper respiratory complications.

 I can't even feed myself or buy gas so I know I can’t afford any of this without insurance.  I have a loan out from work, friends, and one on my house and I'm drowning. My body is tensed up from the minute I open my eyes in the morning. I'm stuck between “oh god I need to find my son, where is he!!” and “oh god I know I’ll never ever see him again”. 

It's exhausting and takes its toll on my mental health. Mix that with trying to take care of myself and be with my youngest and trying to navigate life/finances while dealing with the guilt that I didn't see that Kendall was struggling so bad. A mom is supposed to keep her kids safe. Kids are safe and protected under a moms roof.  I don't recognize myself and I hate that this is my life now. My sons were given the wrong mom.",26Aug2020,1

115,"It was very old, no proper light, rusty frames, but the tires were really good. They were even better than those 'unflatable' tires I had on my previous bike, that got stolen too. 

I dont know why but I'm thinking of all the bicycles I used to ride, we used to buy them from what's basically the equivalent of craiglist here, and the light would work but only for a few weeks, then my father would fix it, but I'd keep breaking and I was always afraid in the winter when I was riding it in the dark, of being stopped and fined by the police, because those fines were high and we couldn't afford them. Why would anyone want to steal these? The breaks were overused too, I was scared to go into the traffic because I had to anticipate and plan my breaking in advance. I used to cycle an hour through the streets with the highest traffic and pollution in this city (I looked at the statistics) to this after-school STEM program, because I didn't want to spend a few euros each time going for taking the (overpriced) public transportation, and then in the end I asked the coordinator of it one time if she could reimburse my travel costs for a special event where I didn't want to arrive all sweaty and exhausted and she said it was no big deal in general. 

I think about the fucking dark winters and seeing all the comfortable people in this city in their apartments, the warm light coming from the window, the stillness of the night when I did my dumpster diving rounds and waiting anxiously for that single car to leave the parking lot that was still open for some reason several hours after the store's closing time. The rottenness and the unidentifiable juices in the dumpsters, but at least in winter it would be kept somewhat fresh by the cold. Sometimes when there was snow I could clean my hands with it afterwards, but everything got dirty anyways, my clothes and sleeves, so it didn't really matter. Not even cleaning those afterwards, too much after sorting and cleaning the food for an hour. And what for anyways? I just had to go again in a few days anyways. 

Sometimes I wished people would've asked why I was never groomed and my presentation always unhygienic and wore old and dirty clothes, since I was a girl after all. But my grades were too good and the school put all their resources in the years after mine, when it became one of the most popular ones in the city thanks to its excellent location in one of the newly gentrified boroughs, and all those comfortable kids' parents demanded the best educational experience for their children. I guess I could thank them because it meant the dumpster were also plenty full. 

I wish I'd just gotten a proper lock, but good ones start at upwards of 30 euros and I, almost OCD-like, cannot make any more than absolutely essential purchases. But I probably should just order one and look for a new bike, instead of writing this fucking post as if anyone would ever entertain my ramblings and tell me that, indeed, that must've hard, as if people ever cared about broken people or any of the uglier things going on in this world. And the truth is neither do I, because I cannot if I want to get out and advance in this dog-eats-dog world. I'm just going to leave this here, because it's only gonna hold me back.

We are not the most financially stable and can't afford much. But still have plenty of stuff like a gaming computer a phone and a very nice school to go to every day.(Met my bffl here. Best Friend For Life.)

Now every night I think about what do I want to do in life that would make me the happiest man in the world as well as someone else's. Like I dont want to live a typical life. Wife, kids, work. The awnser was hard to seek and took a few tries but I decided that I want to do my very best in school/college, get a high paying job, ADOPT a kido and to give it the best life it could possibly have. I'm dedicating my life to this goal. 

Notice how I said no wife? Yeah I tought about it and I prefer not to have a wife. For many and many reasons. 

I don't want to spoil my child until the point where my child is ungreatful but I want to give it all my love, attention and knowledge. As well as share as many memories with it as I wanted to share with my dad that died in 2012 from a skydiving accident. I'm over it so no need to feel bad. Life is cruel.

But yeah i want to travel the world with my child one day and maybe a dog if he/she is well behaved haha. 

Step1: Finish school
Step2: Get a low paying job for experience.
Step4: Get a high paying job for life expenses.
Step3: Adopt my purpose in life.
Step4: Die happily in the end of my life with no regrets.

129,"I (19, female) have been eagerly awaiting the COVID 19 vaccine. I've been checking in every day or every other day since January to read news about it. I told myself, I'd get the vaccine the day it is released - I was that that eager for it.....

But a few days ago I was heartbroken after learning that the vaccine.. isn't a really a vaccine, it's a DNA modifying drug.

https://futurism.com/neoscope/potential-covid19-vaccine-hacks-dna-build-immunity

https://www.fanaticalfuturist.com/2020/04/a-new-prototype-covid-19-vaccine-works-by-literally-hacking-your-dna/

Several WHO articles have said that the DNA could get integrated into your genome or chromosomes, meaning your body would constantly be at war with itself because the antigens would not stop being produced. ie when you have COVID, antigens are there for ~2 weeks. All these antigens cause a build up of inflammation. But what if your body mass produces antigens for months or even years?

This is a brand new type of vaccine never tested long term. We don't know how people's bodies will act 1 year, 5 years, or 20 years down the line. Every other vaccine my friend is familiar with is just a dead or weakened virus. Not literal genetic modification.

After this, I've fallen into a depressive state and I am also very angry. I feel like I've been betrayed. In my frustration I have told their entire family and all their friends about this and all of their friends and family are disgusted after learning about it.

It doesn't seem like a normal vaccine will be released in my friend's country so in essence, a vaccine will never be released. I know about the Thalidomide crisis and how everyone thought it was safe too.

This vaccine is being rushed out in just 1 year and it's a highly experimental type that can integrate into your DNA, cause mutations, cause your cells to go rogue, cause your immune system to chronically attack your tissues, all for a virus that has already pretty much died out in my country and has a death rate of ~0.26%. I am terrified this vaccine will be made mandatory. I don't want my DNA to be forcibly messed with, I want to stay human.

Yes.. ''all medication has risks'' but this is like saying, take a rocket built and tested in just 1 year to fly over the Atlantic, rather than a 737 that has been flying safely for 50 years. ''All air travel has risks'' ...

Is it normal I am so depressed over this? It's all I've been thinking about for the past 3 days and have not been able to sleep well because of it (I have Zopiclone and Temazapam sleeping pills).. in fact I had some dreams where I woke up and police broke into my room to force me to get this vaccine that alters your DNA and turns you into a mutant and people being sent to prison for rejecting it.
