2,"When I was a young man, a teenager even, listening to Bill Hicks and getting mind blown high on weed, it seemed like all the world's problems could be solved if people, well, stopped being dicks. Ignorance, sadism, fear, etc all seemed like choices people make, and we could all just make better choices.

Then I got a little older and did a degree and travelled and learned about all the complex difficult curly bits, and it seemed like, wait no, it's actually this really hard, and we have to fiddle and fix and work through all the details.

Then I get to the part where, on some issues at least, important ones, I had done the work and thought through the steps and phases and obstacles and approaches, the points of friction and the possible lubricants. 

Then I realised I was right the first time. The blockers aren't practical or logistical or even properly political. The blockers are emotional, psychological and cultural.

It would be easy to stop climate change, to end hunger, stop war, to elevate the arts, to give people more time to themselves and with their families, to ""explore space, both inner and outer"" as Bill would have put it. It *would* be easy, if that's what we wanted to do.

Why don't we want to?",27Jun2020,1

5,"I’ve always had a fear of anal sex. Idk why just did. Terrified it would hurt or smell or poop would ooze out. I never fingered myself or used toys. I’ve been fortunate enough that the guys I’ve been with haven’t wanted it. 

Fast forward to today and I’m seeing a gastro doc for abdominal pain. He tested me for celiac which came back negative and he’s having me try a special diet called fodmaps. Anyway, he mentions that he can look inside to see if there’s a fissure or anything causing the pain. He gets a female nurse and returns to the room. I’m not thrilled by the idea but I really want to feel better so I agree to the procedure. At first he uses a finger to explore. I relax as best I can and surprisingly it didn’t hurt. Just pressure. He feels around before pulling out and says he needs a tube to look a little deeper. He inserts the tube and again no pain! Wow! 

So now I’m a little excited to explore this whole new world. Where do I begin? Do I get a small plug or something? Just finger and gasoline?",27Jun2020,1

They fucked her up. I hate them for the controlling, playing the victim, myopic, and abusive behavior. They never supported me. Maybe it is because I am aware of all their shitty behavior and personality. However I lacked that support. On one hand, my great grandparents were the loving, sportive people.

8,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",27Jun2020,1

11,"I received a call tonight with no caller ID. I generally don’t answer anything when it’s not someone I know, so I naturally I let this go to voicemail. Didn’t think anything else of it. About 15 minutes or so later I opened up my phone and saw I had a voicemail. It was 5 minutes long meaning it’s the longest it can go. I’m with my gf and opened up the voicemail to see what I assume was a prank or butt dial. I couldn’t quit make out any words until about 30 seconds in. I noticed it was a recording or myself and gf talking after the call came in. It was really creepy and I’ve never seen something like this happen in the past.

14,"Im struggling to word this out well so I’ll do my best, sorry if it comes out all weird 

Basically I’m 16 years old, I’m staying on at school and I suffer from anxiety. I struggle to hold one on one conversations with people, and this leads to me never being invited out to party’s and stuff. I’m friendly with most of my year though, but I’ve only got about 3 real friends, but even with that I still don’t get out with them. 

I don’t tell my parents the real reason I always stay home, and instead I just tell them that I “don’t really like going out”, all in an attempt to make them think I’m not a massive loser. I even told them that I’m going with friends when the pubs reopen, even though I’ve made no such plans. 

I’ve always told myself that it will get better, that when I’m older I’ll get out more, but I believe that less and less each day, and I can feel myself getting more irate and lonely. My lowest point was my birthday earlier this week. I was wished a Happy Birthday by all my family which was nice, but outside of that I got two happy birthday messages. 

That was all. I know I sound wry complaining about it, at the end of the day people still did wish me a happy birthday, but still. 

I’ve known some of my “friends” my whole life, and some I’ve been in school with for 5 years. Ive helped them, laughed with them, played sports with them. And they didn’t care. I got nothing. And it’s been like this for the past 5 years, only this time it really hit me hard. It was the first time I’ve ever truly contemplated suicide, just to see if they’d care then. 

Now I just can’t bring myself to do any work, i just want to lie in bed and eat. But anytime I feel low or depressed I feel guilty, like I’ve got a family, a home, *some* friends. I do feel happy sometimes, but I also just get these feelings of emptiness regularly, and I can only put it down to depression. I’m scared of telling anyone I’m case I’m made fun off, or I’m told that I’m just feeling sad and it will pass, and that I just need to man up a bit. 

But maybe I’m wrong. Maybe I’m not depressed and things will get better. If you’ve read this far, fucking fair play to you, and thanks for reading my story.",27Jun2020,1

Just tear the whole fucking thing down because we've clearly started valuing a made up symbolic barter and trade system of credit. What the fuck even is credit? And I don't mean the textbook definition, I mean why do we choose to give that meaning? Why does it hold so much power over our goddamn lives that people can't even get access to basic shit, like shelter or food or healthcare or clean, running water and electricity. Or how we let another made up entity called corporations take such a personhood that they're allowed to have a good amount of sway in the political sphere. And destroy our earth at the same time! Why? Because Money! Gotta get more of that thing we place a value on. 
We don't have to place value in money, we don't have to place value in corporations. Humanity as a whole decides what has worth and what doesn't, so why the fuck aren't we doing the right thing?

16,"Hey guys. I'm really embarrassed to talk about this and I'm using not a throwaway really but just an alt account to hide my identity.

Title kinda says it. The stereotype of teenage boys being incessantly horny held up for me but it seemed normal until maybe the past couple years. It seems now like I can't think about anything but sex and it was very negatively affected my life.

I masturbate probably 3-5 times a day on average which of course is a little excessive. Nearly all of my dreams at this point are sexual and it seems to be what I think about 24/7, to an unhealthy degree.

The reason I say unhealthy is because of how much money it's led me to spend and trouble it's gotten me into. The biggest is the money. I've spent a lot of money I didn't have on various sexual products and services, including nudes/videos, premium snapchats, onlyfans, phone sex, strip clubs, and even lately prostitutes. I've been an idiot and sent money to now 3 different prostitutes locally who I found in some way online and they all just kept the money and I never heard from them again. I gave one $100, another $100, and another girl I gave $500. All for nothing. The $500 girl (it's fine, I'm not mad at her I'm just an idiot and I'm coming to realize that) originally wanted a certain amount, ghosted, asked for more money and so on until $100 turned into $500 and still nothing happened I just lost that money.

Overall I'd estimate the money I've spent on just stupid sexual shit to be $1200-$1500 or so. You can guess by my age that that's most definitely not money I have.

I also cheated on my ex girlfriend because we were long distance and when sexual opportunities came up I took them.

I've hooked up with complete strangers (men and women) without even knowing their name and never talked to or saw them again after. I don't think that's inherently bad -- casual sex of course is fine between consenting adults -- but it makes me feel terrible to do it so often when it isn't satisfying anyway. 

I feel so much shame and stupidity. Even after these things have happened I may have felt regret but then I still did the same things later on. There's a logical side to me and then it also feels like there's just this animalistic side that keeps doing things I hate.

I've been diagnosed and treated for several mental health problems but never anything related to this because I'm always way too embarrassed to talk to any therapists or anyone about it.",27Jun2020,1
17,"I am 20 years old and my mother is 41. Two months ago we found out that she is pregnant. At first, she wanted to have an abortion because she thought she wouldnt be able to have a normal pregnancy (she had complications when she was pregnant with me and also had a miscarriage 14 years ago). A week ago she went for another checkup and the doctor told her that the fetus is developing and everything is going fine. Thats when she changed her mind about abortion. My dad was so happy when he found out about this, he really wants another child because I will be moving out soon. She talked to me about it, asked me if i would help with everything, and of course i said yes. I would always be there. I would do everything i can during the pregnancy and after it. Im really happy because im an only child and i probably wont have children of my own, so having a brother/sister now would be amazing. But like i said in the title, im also terrified. I've heard that for women over 35 the chances for miscarriage and stillbirth increase, they can experience chromosomal abnormalities,... What scares me the most is the pregnancy-related death.

26,"I feel superior to everyone around me. The cynics, or those more cynic than me, are negative people who care too little not to assume the worst in others. And those who are more open and happy with their lives, they're simply ignorant. Their ignorance comes from their lack of intelligence; and intelligence is a good higher than all others.

Contradicting the subconscious, I know that not everything I wrote in the last paragraph is true. If I'm superior to others why do I view some as more successful than me in many areas of life? And intelligence is simply one more characteristic of a person, no more important than, say, honesty, or even appearance. It's just something that makes me feel superior.

Writing two paragraphs, one contradicting the other, how original. The extremes whose middle is virtue. And what would that be? Being happy knowing I live in an unfair world?

But damn its like i should just google instead of being SOCIAL on a SOCIAL media platform. If you ask any questions your dislike bombed. Just why? And heaven forbid you correct someone or even try and just get downvoted for no reason even if you try and correct the OP and he admits he mistyped but NAH some asshole just has to downvote your helpful comment. Its not just me either i see that reddit is inherently toxic most of the time and i honestly need a new platform where i can get the same entertainment without the needless toxicity. 

If your one of the people who are toxic, or you think ‘just grow up its the internet’ honestly tell me why you are the way you are. Why do you ruin something for other people and then tell them to screw off when they dont like it? Bold of me to assume any toxic people read this far they probably are already writing hate comments telling me they hope i die.

Ive had to remake my account so many times cause im just sick and tired of having the hate there as a reminder. Its not even kept to toxic subs which is the problem. It spreads all over reddit cause why the hell not.

There im done, if you know any social media as diverse but less toxic than reddit please let me know. If you wanna rant in the comments go ahead. If you wanna leave hate in the comments its not like i can stop you. Reddit folks the best and worst of the internet rivaled only by 4chan when it comes to toxicity.

37,"Can't believe I'm writing this. Throwaway but will keep the account and return with updates. This is a very long post, but I think that's important for believability. I want to give you evidence that there is other life out there and they're ready to slowly reveal themselves to our culture. I also want to shed some information on what they want. And it's not all great. (The aliens are chill though).

So I'm quite a heavy weed user. I have a gut problem which can make me feel pretty crappy, but I use weed medicinally nightly to sleep well. Also, I've been reading a lot about UFO's recently. I'm a lifelong skeptic but only recently noticed that there are actually some pretty credible accounts of UFO activity, after watching Joe Rogan's interviews with Bob Lazar and David Fravor.

My credibility is already shot, because I'm a stoner who loves UFO's, but I have to assure you that I'm a normal, well adjusted sane dude with lots of friends, a business and a job that I love. I just have a pretty open mind.

Anyway, last night as usual I got pretty high. Did my usual stuff, got some food, played Modern Warfare, watched some shitty YouTube. The thing about edible weed is it can be trippy. It's like a deeper high than if you smoke, So consciousness is a little hazy, but I'm still very much with it.

At one point I'm lying on the sofa. And I'm in and out of consciousness. But I assure you. I'm conscious. Please understand. As a heavy user I'm still able to function on high doses. This was all incredibly vivid and took place over the course of what felt like a very real 20 minutes.

When you're high thoughts come from nowhere. And they can sometimes make no sense. So to start visualising aliens out of nowhere when you're high as fuck is completely normal. That's what happened. But then I started feeling a pull in my body. I 'knew' the aliens were going to try to tell me something (God this sounds absolutely insane - but bear with me I will redeem).

This was actually kind of scary. A couple of weeks before the same thing had happened. I felt myself getting 'abducted' while high. Like I just knew. But I was scared so I resisted. Then in the morning I woke up and was like 'Holy shit I was so high I thought I was being abducted by aliens lol'.

Back to last night. I kept resisting. I wasn't ready. But they insisted. What followed was a mild trip where I feel that extraterrestrials implanted knowledge into me. Like I said - I was high, but I promise you this was incredibly vivid and unlike any experience I have ever had. And forgive the fractured writing style - it is designed to make you understand the confusing nature of the experience, and explain how some details may be hazy here, it was all abstract information. I often can't give you a concrete account because it wasn't demonstrated to me in a concrete way.

The trip was beautiful. They wanted to impart information to me through experience. I felt compelled to lie on the bed, from the couch, so walked over. I lay down. My spotify playlist was playing. I have no idea what songs. I started to understand things. Information was being fed to me in various ways, through music. My mind was racing, as normal when you get high. But my thoughts first are, as though I'm trying to comprehend that this is an alien experience. It's as though I was slowly brought under to not blow my mind. 

I was experiencing thoughts coming into my head. They started more abstract and became more concrete, with words. I was watching the picture of the flower on the wall, as they started to explain to me that they can communicate with us using weed. (I sound fucking nuts). Basically there is a chemical inside weed, or released in our brains when we use it, which allows them to send information to us with it using technology.

They were clear to me that this was happening because it's ETHICAL. This is the ethical way to add information to human culture and guide them towards a higher path. The word 'ethical' was repeated and very clear. It's as though I was able to be given all this information without having my mind blown because of the weed. They use it to give us information in an ethical way.

The whole thing was kind of like a music video, me being guided to pay attention to specific things in the room while information was added to my brain through various means. It could be from either me just instinctively 'realising' some sort of concept that they were trying to impart, to literal full sentences flashing up INCREDIBLY vividly in my minds eye.

I understand this sounds kooky but if you think about it, if you were an alien species with benevolent tendencies toward a younger planet, how would you help them? We worship anything that moves. They don't want to destroy our culture by interfering. 

It was like a weird communication process. Like I'd think something, and it's like something was trying to guide my thoughts to reach a conclusion. Then I would realise and understand that thing, then my thoughts were guided towards another conclusion. Being drip fed information.

One crazy part of this was when I was compelled to sit down in front of the router. I was sort of guided by the music playing and by the patterns on the wall. It's as though they were using the psychedelic component to send information. Explaining here to me that they were communicating to me using subjective experience and technology. Somehow the music I was listening to and the effects of the 'trip' were guiding me towards 'realising' certain things. This included the words in the music (again, no idea what I was listening to, I wasn't paying attention). I would approach a thought or realisation in my mind, then the music lyric would be sung, and it was the thing I was trying to reach a conclusion for.

They wanted to be clear to me that empathy is key. Life is inherently valuable. This isn't all for nothing. They are aware of information that tells them that there is a higher stage we can get to. But we need to work together. Which is why it's important to guide civilization.

They want to implant some people with knowledge. Information. As that is what influences behaviour and guides culture. So there are more like me. We have been chosen because we can best influence and guide society. This sounds incredibly delusional. I get it. Imagine how I feel.  

It's as though they deeply understand the human experience. They place high value on emotion and subjective experience. Feelings of shame and embarrassment are all painful but ultimately they are fine. Humour is important, and a way to cope with the difficult realities of reality. They kept fucking with me. We would banter back and forth once I realised and was content with what was happening. It's like I was in a room with them, but not, while they interfered with me. They would do something uncomfortable and I would be like 'ow', and they'd tell me to suck it up, but in really good humour. It's as though they knew and recognised this was difficult (my experience and life in general), had tremendous empathy for us, but wanted to be clear that they couldn't completely avoid pain for us, but that's okay.

So, the darker part. There is a problem. Something to do with the start. And the end. One. Singularity (as in the point before the Big Bang). It's something to do with AI. It's not an easy problem to fix. But maybe we can fix it. There's something going on there but they didn't explain it clearly.

Anyway I hope it happens again because while parts were uncomfortable, it was a pretty cool experience. As far as my day to day goes, this did not happen. There are some people I may tell in private but it's going to be easier for me if I just keep quiet for now. I still have responsibilities and my belly still needs filling. But it was clear to me that more information was being planted into our culture. I think there are others like me.",27Jun2020,1
39,"Like the title says, im not okay.. i feel sad all the time for no reason sometimes its so overwhelming i cry! Like wtf... whats wrong with me..? And the stupid part about this is,i don’t even know why! I cant think of a damn thing that would make me feel so DEPRESSED!!!  I sit and contemplate suicide day and night... i cant help it .. i think of the ugliest way to take myself out i don’t want people to think i was okay when i wasn’t,that one day in-front of a loved one id just say something stupid like “i asked you for help” and then, boom!, i shoot myself or throw myself into traffic... i have MANY reasons to live... but why do i want to hurt myself?!

41,"
I never felt like she loved me especially when I was younger she would completely dismiss what I had to say and treated my siblings a lot better than me so I ultimately knew something was wrong with me, she would even tell me to shut up if I was talking she never enthusiastic when I tell her something but she was all ears to my siblings.
Just today I went downstairs and saw her and my sister talking and when she saw me she went silent and got up and left I didn’t think too much off it until she would act all frigid if I was in her presence this happens a lot but she’s only nice to me when she wants money which I’m happy to help out because it’s mostly paying utilities as I am 17 and it’s a rule for her I guess to help out. But overall I don’t like this feeling like she hates me, I don’t know what I did like damn even at a young age what tf did I do to you and even now I feel so lonely and unloved",27Jun2020,1
42,"I’m a 19 year old female living in a diverse city. Growing up all my life throughout the years I’ve had my own handful of awful experiences with male strangers.
I don’t understand why guys keep targeting me and approaching me. I don’t seek or want attention, and I keep to myself and mind my own business when I’m outside. And I don’t want strangers here on Reddit to say stupid shit about how I carry myself or what females wear- it doesn’t matter because if I’m completely covered from head to toe- wearing baggy clothes (sweaters) or just wearing normal casual clothes, females would normally wear - I still get harassed or have a male approach me. 
Giving compliments after compliments, trying to flirt with me, asking for my number, not leaving me alone. I’m so scared and exhausted.
It can be anywhere and any time of the day so many situations have occurred throughout the years. Or even guys just touching your arms or wrist!! Even sexually harassing you..
You would expect for shady/scary things to really happen in the night but no, also out in broad daylight in public, which is shocking!! 
One time I was exiting a subway station on my way to work, and this guy who had a bicycle with him, tried to flirt with me and he kept calling me beautiful but you can’t see my entire face because I’m wearing a mask like?? And then he tried to follow me and I had to run all the way to work. That’s not even the scariest situation I’ve ever experienced... 

I get really anxious nowadays to the point where I absolutely always want someone I know and feel safe with, to be with me when I’m outside. But that can’t always be the case - when having to go to work or school or do errands. No one can be a full time babysitter or bodyguard obviously. I appreciate my friends and family whenever I do call them when I feel unsafe. But everyone is not always available. I do however appreciate when I’m outside with a male friend or relative bc no guy tries to bother me!! Only at that point. 

I always try my best to wear headphones and listen to music or just avoid eye contact with any males near me, hoping they don’t start a conversation or anything, even pretending to talk on the phone. It doesn’t matter what I do- nothing seems to work.
If I tell the guys “no thank you, I have a boyfriend, or (lie) about being underaged or say I’m just not interested (either kindly/calming or very confidently) - OR most importantly flat out ignore them” - males don’t seem to get it!!! 
Like omg, who raised all these scary idiots?

Today multiple guys riding their cars, tried to holla, Unfortunately that’s the world we live in and many females have to deal with it- and okay I’m used to that - it’s even happened on a walk with my own mother. But tonight this guy on the bus, who was clearly a little drunk kept trying to bother me and it got really scary I just kept hoping he  would listen to me and stop. I didn’t want to give him any information. I told him no thank you. He kept flirting and trying to get my number. And got a little violent. 
Honestly I’m not even that attractive enough for guys to be coming in my direction. Am I just always unlucky?? I’m a human being with feelings too

Am I somehow doing something wrong or attracting unwanted energy towards me? I can’t step one foot outside without being bothered or harassed.
I really wish guys would leave me alone. It felt like I was having an awful panic attack tonight.
I’m sorry for ranting idk it’s just become too much to handle at this point - I really want to be okay but it’s affecting me with being comfortable in the outside world and even being able to talk the people in my life. I can’t even take any compliments properly now from anyone. I didn’t think I would become this anxious or traumatized. 
Why are there so many shitty men? I didn’t do anything wrong. It’s also starting to feel like I can’t trust my own guy friends when I’m by myself with them... it’s rare to find males with good intentions all the time",27Jun2020,1
44,"I joined track in the spring and then corona hit so then I didn’t really have a chance to improve but it was also the only sport I joined for the school year and I’m horrible at long distance. 100 m is the one thing I’m good at and the year before, in junior high I was in the relay and got 2nd by a few milliseconds. It is a lot of fun tho and I was kinda fast. During track all the way back in March I struggled to run around my decently large school but I was definitely getting better after that first day where my legs took a hit after lazing around for months and I could barely walk for a few days. Now however...I gained 15 pounds since March and I’m trying to lose all of it and then some more to get to maybe 115 but I’m horribly unathletic. I want to become more athletic to improve my health but also lose all the fat I’ve gained before I spin out of control and get to like 145 by the start of the new school year. So even though I can barely get through 100 m in 15 sec, should I join XC to gain endurance and better prepare myself for track in the spring?

46,"I was okay for a few weeks. Then i really started to miss having someone to talk to. I balanced myself out after a few days, but some times i fall back to old habits.

Yesterday was a bad one, im still trying to get my emotions under control. As a kid, i was spoiled. As an adult, its really hard to accept no when i wanr something and have the money for it. I have bad spending habits. Ive been tackling some things regarding this habit, like spending less on games and less on take out. But if its not one thing, i find another.

Yesterday, my boyfriend switch to an anual subscription for some courses. It was 150$ but we have money saved up. He uses it a lot and of course its helpful. I trust how he manages money. A few hours later, i wanted to upgrade to paying for a video editing program that I have (pirated) so I could get the latest effects. It was 40$ anual fee, 70$ for a one time fee. But he gently convinced me that we shouldnt buy it until I get paid more as a freelancer. Even though we can afford it.

I cried later that night, it's eating me up. But i want to deal with it and accept it. I dont want to talk to him and let him think i want to buy this so bad because i, as someone who has had to pirate a lot, can live with what i have. Im just really tired of not having money and feeling powerless. Im also taking courses and working really hard for my future but when i feel so hurt, its difficult to be patient. I really wish i could see a therapist right now.",27Jun2020,1
50,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",27Jun2020,1

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 

Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again and she filled out the application form for me for it and I didn’t ask",27Jun2020,1

I am a minority who has suffered due to the laws and policies enacted by our government . Black lives matter, I support that movement, but what saddens me, is everyone has forgotten mine....
Counting back hundreds of years, if people like me were to survive birth, we were left alone, abandoned to die, because we were cursed.
After being left to die, things “improved”... instead people like me, if we survived birth and were not left to die, we were put in asylums... tested on and tortured, left alone and afraid....
Eventually these places were “shut down”(although some still exist around the world),and people like us were left abandoned, for the foster system, left to die, or aborted...
After this, an act to “Protect us” and “give us job and educational opportunity”past.... 

The Americans with disabilities acts...

This haven’t stopped the discrimination and hardships we face...

I have moved schools because of bullying about my illness 

I have had people advices their children to not be friends with me

I  had people cross the street to avoid me

I have been followed in stores to make sure i didn’t touch anything

I have feared police, because people like me, risk miscommunication that can put our lives at risk.... I have learned to be extra cautious and stay out of any trouble

I have faced judgement by people 

I have faced disbelief by doctors
 
I have been told to leave a home, a business, a restaurant... because of things I cannot control

I have had teachers single me out, and make my education harder 

Almost everyone in my life has judged and mistreated against people like me... Other Than those who chose to live us..

THEN THERE WAS HOPE...

Covid-19 hit, and people started to see life from my eyes.... and they did something about it....

People put on masks, stayed home, washed their hands, tried not to touch something in stores.....
They did this to help everyone, but to also allow people like me to be safe


Then Memorial Day hit, and we saw the devastating results, and so things are shitting back down

 But then, also the protests hit.... and things got even worse.....

The people who are protesting for BLM are the same who were staying home to protect me....

There are ways to do both.. organize with your block, and those around you to kneel and chant in every drive way.... boycott places that are refusing to support BLM... write your senators and courts! Post on social media and make your voice heard...

But right now, with these protests, you are sacrificing so many lives, lives like mine...

I haven’t seen my family in Over 90 days, because people won’t due their part...

I haVent left the house in over 90 days

I haven’t gotten to hike, or go to the store, or walks down the street.... or even visit my mailbox...
All because my life isn’t important enough...
Through generations it never had been... So I guess it is on me for expecting this generation to be different 

I was so happy to see a change when covid came around and people  worked to help keep things safe..... and now I realize we were only a fad, no one cares about us unless they know us....

Please, 
wear a mask,
Stay home,
Find ways to send your message without showing people like me that our lives don’t matter...

I have sent five letters to our senators
I have signed 10 petitions
And if I was allowed outside I would organize something with my neighbors 

I know it’s hard  Black lives matter- And Th e justice system needs reform-... but  so does mine...
can’t we fight for both? Justice reform is a passion of mine, but so is my right to live.... please help us... not everyone at risk is the elderly, we are young and hopeful, and have lived through so much hate and oppression.... a few weeks ago you gave us hope for the first time in centuries, that people care about us, that people see us... and were willing to work hard and “flatten the curve”.... please don’t take that away from us

I love you all ✌️💕",27Jun2020,1

The only people who like it are music geeks.  They insist other people should like it too tho, and that's annoying because every explanation as to why it's good you'll need a master's degree in music theory.  It does not speak for itself.

Thing is Never Meant also has normal song element that make it tolerable.  Math rock is nothing but arpeggios.  All that bunk about atypical time signatures and rhythms is because they arpeggiate every chord which makes jamming that all into a song mess up the rhythm and time signatures.

In 2008 there was a huge international controversy when the old 1992 TV show video re-appeared on Youtube. The original TV show video has since then been meticulously removed from Youtube and other platforms – even from Bitchute. Pretty much the last place to watch it is now here: **https://d.tube/#!/v/transformati22/QmdU1ukJ5rq4BghtQ8Kkiqz4VugTabCvXgMokC12Aa5PnL**. If you are for some reason not outraged enough at the beginning of the video then watch the last 20 seconds…!

**The Infamous Brongersma website**

What I find very revealing is that Paul de Leeuw is referred to several times in the posts of the pedophilia promoting website brongersma.info. There is for example the following entry: “What does Paul de Leeuw think of when someone says 'Martijn'? Tonight in the broadcast of PaPaul the answer turned out: ""a chief editor of a pedophile magazine"". This off-topic comment was a bit dead, but is actually more of an insider joke;) “ This “inside joke” refers to the infamous court-banned Dutch pedophilia association Vereniging Martijn.

**Direct accusations**

The following excerpt is translated from a Dutch web article: https://www.boublog.nl/2017/09/10/seksueel-geweld-en-bart-van-well/ and it also refers to this article: https://web.archive.org/web/20111130004924/http://www.klokkenluideronline.nl/artikel/796/ook-ed-van-thijn-in-beeld-bij-pedo-netwerk.html

“ Below is a transcript of notes taken by Micha Kat from an interview held on Sunday January 16, 2011 in Hellevoetsluis. The identity of the source is known to this site and can be revealed to the National Prosecutor's Office if the Public Prosecution Service undertakes to respect the source in its rights. The importance of the source is also apparent from the fact that he has proven to be the source of an explosive article published on December 7, 2004 on Kleintje Muurkrant about a pedo-bar in Amsterdamse Paardenstraat (the 'Festival Bar') where people when Ed van Thijn, Paul de Leeuw and Andre van Duin raped children. This bar was closed shortly after the publication of the said document. “

**Modified Wikipedia profile**

The following cannot be taken as direct evidence against Paul de Leeuw in this matter but curiously in December 2017 an article appeared in the political weblog Dagelijkse Standaard https://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2017/12/dienst-parkeerbeheer-amsterdam-neemt-paul-de-leeuw-op-de-korrel-hij-staat-bekend-als-pedofiel/. It states that someone from the city of Amsterdam’s parking service department had modified Paul de Leeuw’s Wikipedia page claiming that he is living a double life and is actually a pedophile. This claim has since been removed by other Wikipedia moderators.

**Association with the Dutch ""Harvey Weinstein""**

Paul de Leeuw also happens to be a good friend of Job Gosschalk who resigned his position as a producer and director of a known Dutch film company due to sexual misconduct. Mr. Gosschalk has been called the Dutch Harvey Weinstein and there has also been accusations that he has abused children (underage). See RTL channel presenter’s research on this subject (in Dutch): https://www.nporadio1.nl/75-jaar-vrijheid/onderwerpen/7626-2017-11-15-wendy-beenakker-job-gosschalk-heeft-zeker-3-minderjarigen-misbruikt.

In spite of a huge public controversy and disgust towards Mr. Gosschalk Paul de Leeuw has openly requested that Gosschalk should be forgiven and returned back to his former position as a caster for movie roles!

**The truly bizarre Filmpje! movie from 2005**

Paul de Leeuw also wrote the script and acted the main roles in a disturbing 1995 movie called Filmpje! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMwOYbu3o-k&amp;fbclid=IwAR0pu-gY9u4ZjCdTESrh0e3ZCsMv27HP3oRBWE46lSyT4w_7-DQ7NL5iinE? Already during the first minute they start talking about ordering a child ('rare kindje') from the internet. Although it is meant to refer to an adoption this really gives me a bad feeling...

At a strange scene (starts 6:05) Papa spits into the crib, shakes it violently and then throws the whole crib against a wall. It is unclear if a baby was inside (I hope not).

At the court room scene (starts 8:25) there is a naked baby doll on the table..

In one scene (starts 19:27) the main character 'Papa' visits a strange ""Eyes wide shut"" type of corporate building where sex services are offered.

In another scene (starts 27:49) the 'Papa' comes home and his daughter (who is wearing a really gruesome looking tooth straightening device on her head) goes to greet him by kneeling in front of him – what happens after this is not shown. After this 'Papa' violently throws his daughter against the glass door of a cabinet. A bit strange...

And sure enough a Wizard of Oz inspired clip (start 1:34:16) is used in this movie. According to victims of sexual abuse, ""pedophiles abuse the movie The Wizard of Oz to brainwash their child sex slaves.""

For some reason there are lobsters everywhere in the movie - the main character (Paul) is even wearing a lobster in his/her head dress. According to the Urban dictionary website the term ‘rock lobster’ refers to a male pedofile.

The movie is supposed to be funny but it has a very dark undertone the whole time... My Dutch isn't good enough but I am pretty sure there are more indications of pedophilia in this movie.

**Adoption**

Considering this background I think it is a bit alarming that Paul de Leeuw adopted two children from Africa. At the beginning of the disturbing movie Filmpje! they talk about ordering kids from Africa...

**Public reactions in the Netherlands**

Many Dutch people have expressed their disapproval of the 1992 TV show video but I have also seen disturbingly many people trying to explain it away by using the following types of arguments:

“It was such a long time ago (28 years ago) and the times were different back then.”

“It was a staged act agreed to by the boy’s parents and and the boy knew what was happening.”

“Oh Paul is Paul – he is a comedian and he pushes people’s buttons, his acts shouldn’t be taken literally.”

“Foreigners just don’t understand the unique Dutch humour and culture.”

“Paul is is a very famous person, he is also a very likable guy and he shouldn’t be accused of these kinds of things.”

The elephant in the living room BUT, there is still a huge elephant in the living room here - a video that shows a young boy being sexually molested on public TV in a very obvious and graphic manner (whether the act was staged or not). Taking into consideration the other indications I have described above I am asking the same question that was asked by someone on Quora years ago - why is he still allowed to have his own show on Dutch TV? Is he perhaps protected by some very high level people? Does the Dutch society still stick its head in the sand and pretend that there is nothing to address here!?",27Jun2020,1
70,"Just to start off I have severe mental issues I literally go to therapy weekly. I used to make a ton of money and support a lot of other people and yes I survived without therapy. But as soon as I couldn't support everybody and realized how rude they were to me and how they would attack and lash out against me when I couldn't support them anymore and when I actually needed a little help even if it was just mowing the yard.

I had a big life upheaval that's been going on for at least 4 years. Getting rid of abusive relationships and trying to break even on the damages they cause. I started to focus on my mental help I'm literally paying most of my paycheck just for my insurance. I only make about $700 a month right now but I'm paying $400 a month for insurance that I don't have any co-pays on and don't have to worry about anything throughout the whole year. It's not Dental or Vision but it helps me focus on my mental issues.

I found some new friends once that I honestly started working for one company that would take me during a lot of my issues. And I did not like either of the people. They had known that I used to work as an electrician before I head issues and asked me to come over and help install a fan. I'm a generous person and will give people a helping hand. Well long story short I'm not living with them over a year-and-a-half later and a much better off being away from my family.

However I have a lot of issues that are starting to build up after these months of living with them. One they never clean or take care of anything they have. Even before I started living here I could tell that their water heater was about to explode and bust it seal. I cleaned it out and I mean it took me two whole days to clean all the hard water out I replace the elements and everything on that water heater made it almost like brand new.

I have cleaned and taken apart their AC and their indoor furnace and coils. I have fixed massive leaks that they have had. At one point they were literally paying three times the amount of their water bills than what they are now with me living in their house. They work all day everyday. But when they do get home they stay up late. I currently am sleeping on the couch because the bed that they have in the room that's available is just too uncomfortable to sleep on. The wife keeps saying it's new but it's not. It feels like I might as well just be sleeping on the straight metal Springs. I have seen mattresses outside that (I used to train horses with to walk over cuz it's a new texture). That I would feel more comfortable sleeping on than the one in that bedroom.

They didn't used to have a TV in the living room but they bought one. Now they'll stay up in the living room. With my new phone I've noticed I'm only getting like six hours of sleep. Because I actually wake up early in the morning and I can't just go back to sleep. I can't sleep in all day anymore. And I like that I don't sleep in all day anymore. But I don't like being up till 1 a.m. and then my body naturally waking up at 6:30.

I've even passed out on the couch with him still watching TV. I would even be fine with that. Put some of my other issues are even their vehicles. They have two cars that used to run that they've taken everything off of an they're only show. They have one room in their house that is full of nothing but car parts and tools. I have cleaned that room multiple times and reorganized it.

Even before I lived with them I would come over and maybe twice a week and I would sweep their floors dump out their trash and clean up. I got them washers and dryers so that way they wouldn't have to go to the laundromat every week. And then because they still want to do their clothes and we'll just make a massive trip to the laundromat cuz they could start all the washers at once I started doing their laundry.

All of this before I moved in with them. Well now that I've moved in with them they've got another broke down truck that gets the park in the driveway while I get to park on the grass with my newer actually working vehicle. They spend tons of their money on food and on vehicles that aren't even in their name. They're in the wife's Mother's name who is very manipulative and controlling and to be quite Frank I'm surprised they haven't gotten divorced over that woman. I won't even talk with her side of the family anymore.

It's really sad because I literally read it a staircase for her mom read it some Plumbing redid her water heater and she bought it but I installed the massive new AC unit. I am very handy and of work and a bunch of under the table jobs but stopped working there because I didn't like how they jerry-rigged and cut Corners I like to go above and beyond. So needless to say these people have been taken care of by me. But her mom is so vindictive and shallow that when I was cleaning out the water heater I turned off the water opened up the lines in the sinks that were in the kitchen and in the main entryway and they have a whole nother family living upstairs that is related to them and gets everything taken care of and don't have to pay any bills. When I left the house I didn't realize the mom had turned on a sink in her private bedroom. The entire house flooded on one whole half. Because one her sinks were incredibly clogged to where it was able to overflow even though the drain was open. And nobody noticed 4 hours and there were people in that house going back and forth. When the wife went over she's the one that turned off the water and started cleaning it up. And then when I go back over another time to clean out the sinks and put new sink Stoppers in the mom wanted to blame me for the floors and said ""oh it's okay we'll just have you fix it.""

Even recently there was a big falling out with her mom trying to kick her out of the house that they live in. Because technically it's in her mom's name even though she paid for it and her mom was going to let the tax go so long that the city would repossess the house. But after the fight it was literally the next day she was talking to me like she was best friends with her mom and taking her kid to go look at a private school.

 They barely have enough to live themselves but are paying $5,000 on vehicles they don't even own on phone bills and everything else and brand new clothes. They have so many clothes!

I have been the only reason this house has been up and going. A few weeks ago they're back fence fell in and I had one small dog that you didn't have to keep any fences closed with. But with their dogs that she was friends with they all got out and ran off. I busted my knees going up and down the railroad lines I stopped every hobo on a bicycle pulled in front of people who had their windows down and asked. I posted all over Facebook at least 12 different Facebook pages made flyers and everything. All I needed was some to print out the Flyers. She put off plant printing out the flyers for 3 days! And then when I sent her new Flyers with some updated information and had my mom print them out she got upset because I wasn't making flyers for her Great Pyrenees. I had already found one of their dogs. In fact they had seen their Great Pyrenees pulled over and almost had her but she got excited by the streets and run off. They decided to go drinking at a bar after that! During this whole Corona your dog was right there you know what block she's in and they fucking go off to go drinking. I had been at a farmhouse that a family member owns to help take care of some geese that day. I hadn't gone to The Farmhouse and weeks. And I literally dropped everything I was doing and made it to the city in 30 minutes when it should have taken more like 50. And they were already at the bar drinking. I was trying to figure out where they had seen their dog so I could find her and bring her home. I also paid for a cracked tooth that was getting infected to be pulled in her Dentistry to be done. Because they wouldn't do it.

Before I moved in there dog was almost bald on her whole back and her ass in because she was so allergic to the fleas and had developed a mange. They're absolutely horrible with dogs but keep getting more and more. I just can't live like this. Now they're asking for internet money because I use the internet to work from.

Oh and here's the kicker I have been buying food for them a couple nights and every time they want food and want me to pay for it it's like 60 or $80. If it were me we're going to go get 20 Burgers from McDonald's for a dollar. Also they kept saying they were going to pay me back for taking their dog to the dentist and they never did I got them completely new blind for their house and they never paid me back for those. I don't mind paying rent or doing something but I've literally stopped the city from taking their house because of bad taxes I dropped their water bill to a third of what it was I've have fixed electrical issues in the house and drop their electrical bill about $50. I'm constantly maintaining this house or their dogs of which they only have two now and I still can't find my dog.

I just need to get a job. But because of some of the abuse issues I dealt with and how hard it was to get a job because of some legal issues I was fighting that were expunged dismissed and everything but that doesn't mean it didn't cost me $10,000 and years worth of my life. I can't even find the strength to type my name into a blank spot on an application page. I haven't even been in a field that I specialize in in years but I don't want to go back to having to live with my family. Right now I'm saving up money. But they keep wanting to borrow money. They even asked me if they could borrow 900 to buy this car and I had said sure. But I'm glad they never bought the car cuz I'm realizing that they're not going to pay me back for anything. At one point when I told them that I was broke and didn't have the 80 bucks for the internet money because I just spent $200 on their dog who medically needed it who they got pissed off at me because they didn't think I was doing enough to find her who they saw and then left to go drinking. They mentioned what we know you've got that savings. Will that savings for me buying my own house for Me Maybe buying a $2,000 computer that way I can do some of the old projects distantly and remotely that I used to do to earn passive income's. But sadly if I didn't have their house to work out of I wouldn't have good internet access. Most of the people I can even reach out to for help live out in Countryside where there is no good internet access I don't care how good of a satellite you think you have.

Also the husband has hit on me quite a few times and very heavily. I've talked with my therapist about this and I've even talked and Reddit it about this. He's not forceful or anyting I definitely poured some water on it and stopped it but I don't like this situation. And I feel like I'm stuck. I can't even go out and make new friends that I might be able to live with temporarily because my credit so shot in my score looks bad because of the years I was fighting legal problems rather than paying other bills trying to keep my name clean.

I don't know maybe I'm just done with everyone maybe I was so fucked up at such a young age for so long and continue to take care of people and saw that as my self-worth that I'm beyond fixing. I can't even stop myself. I just take care of things all the time it's just a natural thing for me to do. But when I'm trying to save up money so I can find my own space so I can get my own things I still feel like everybody tears me down. Just because they make a ton of money they make like $1,000 every week and I make 350 every two. And they want me to take care of everything and do everything when I'm trying to focus on my own self growth and map things out and fix my own life. I'm grateful for them and I want to express that but I feel like now they're just taking advantage of me like everybody else has. Oh and by the way I bought them new doors new exterior doors. These people don't take care of anything and I just can't live like that. I can't live without valuing a single thing in my life. 

It wouldn't even come to this head if they had tried to look for their dogs. I don't know literally the way they treated the whole situation about their dogs has me utterly mortified. I don't care if you don't even like animals. That's still your dog. It's still your responsibility. I don't know I'm utterly mortified by everything. I think it's all just starting to hit me. I think maybe taking care of their dogs filled that need inside me to take care of other things and repairing things in their house I got to see a physical difference and the drop of their bills. And even their internet bill used to be $160 before I moved in because people were stealing internet. Once I moved in and fix some of the problems not only did their internet connections drastically improve but their bill drop to $100 because they're not using the extra internet.

I feel like I should just move out and let them realize that I live in maid repairman and security guard that they had and took advantage of finally got their own place away from them. Don't get me wrong though they seem like good people they do care about me personally. There have been times where I don't realize because of my depression but I haven't bathed in a week. They'll just let me know. Just by asking hey are you going to take a bath tonight. Nothing insulting. But just the way they live their daily lives I've lived like that I gave up making all that money so that way I would have time in my day to spend my time. It's so stressful to see them spiraling down a deeper and deeper hole of more and more debts because they're taking care of everybody else but not their own house they're not making sure anything's in their own name they don't have any security. Like literally if her mom got pissed off enough she doesn't realize how technically her mom could literally yank everything out from underneath her. But her mom stupid as shit anyway and probably won't ever do it.

She's been wanting me to go over to her mom's house and stain the stairs a different color because we had talked about it a little over a month ago. I didn't bring it up the mom will bring it up. I'm not going to sit there and remodel her house remodel her mom's house take care of every little problem still pay bills take care of their dogs and set here and not have any security for my own animal and get tore down just because I didn't find their animal fast enough. The one that they didn't even care about because they decided to go off drinking instead.

But right now with covid-19 pooh bear virus I don't even know how to get back into a career field I used to specialize in that I want to go back to that I haven't been in for years and they probably have tons of applications right now. But if I'm going to get my own place I do need to make more money. I already spend so much of it on my insurance. And that's if I can get anybody to give me my own place. There are a couple of Mexican contractors around the area that have a couple houses for sale. One of them is willing to work with me on a payment plan has a good contract written up and I've gone over it and everything. But I still need like an extra 500 a month. That would just be for bills and a very low house payment. And this isn't a high dollar house don't get me wrong. To be honest if I had $15,000 upfront he would sell it to me. But it would be mine something I can slowly improve that I am contributing towards. Not somebody else's stuff that they obviously don't care about and have no value for even if it's a living thing that has spent years with them.",27Jun2020,1
71,"Lately I've been noticing that sometimes I'm forced to change certain ways to achieve results but doing that also takes a young trait of mine. It feels like I'm noticing the beginning of a habit that some day my kids would describe as ""ugh you think that way because you're old"". It's like when you had a friend your parents didn't approve of, and you'd be like ""not everyone is the same MUM"" but then you realise that actually, everyone is kinda the same and your parents were right...

Anyway, the latest ""adult habit/belief"" has been that I only achieve results at work when I put myself in the mindset of an asshole. 

I'm not saying that being an asshole to your coworkers makes you successful. But the young part of me is sensitive, wants to get to know people and make friends, and thinks work is the perfect place to make friends because of how much we interact together. This, at least in my field/position/work environment, does not work. 

I gotta be tough and put work first. It seems that, as long as my mindset is ""get the job done timely and successfully"", I can do whatever the fuck I want, because ""I'm just doing my job"". 

Young me thinks that's a shitty excuse for being hurtful-blunt. But present me thinks that I love my job and want to be good at it and also I do need to grow a thicker skin, so if that's what it takes, then might as well. 

I just hope I don't change too many parts of my personality 'cause I love most of them.",27Jun2020,1
72,"I was the person, as I'm sure many of you are, that for some odd reason needed to be the person to initiate (almost) every interaction. Whether it's just to say hi and catch up, making plans, or trying to ask someone out on a date.

Looking back I can easily see how I got into this situation and knew how hard it would be getting out (one of my issues being needing to be social and interactive; therefore not being offput if I had to reach out to others).

For years I didn't mind this (or so I used to think). I was the person who had quantity over quality (in terms of friendships/acquaintances). Trying to keep dozens of relationships alive and giving each person almost one hundred percent. Slowly I cut down the amount of people that I was trying to be friends with but the problem was still the same.

Every interaction was the same. I would message the person, lead the conversation (by asking questions and trying to get to know them in different ways or risk just having the conversation stop), sometimes making plans, and so on. If by the odd chance people would message me i would make sure to get back to them almost immediately; sending double or triple messages to make sure that things were cleared up.

It became exhausting and overwhelming. Feeling as though you're giving so much to other people yet they can't even be bothered to say hello first? This just seemed so ridiculous to me and I couldn't really understand why it had to be this way. One day I had had enough and decided to just ""ghost"" everyone.

It was an interesting turning point. What you expect to happen happened. A lot of those relationships disappeared; which to me meant they were only holding on by a string. But what also happened was unexpected to me. A few people in my life actually messaged me first wondering ""what happened"".

People began initiating with me and eventually making plans first or just talking to catch up a bit.

The one part of me I kind of miss about my old self is how I used to fight until the bitter end for every single relationship; trying to keep it alive and that person in my life. There was a passion about that that was very pure and powerful. Now I'm kind of the opposite where if the person wants to leave... I'll let them (some of them reaching out to me to try to rectify things to which I'm always open for) - unless they're someone I'm very close to/in a relationship with.

I appreciate all of you people out there that initiate as much as you do. I wouldn't wish the position I was with on anyone. Though I had dozens of people in my life that I was talking to at that time in my life I was the loneliest I have ever been. And although I'm no longer one hundred percent that person anymore I know how emotionally draining it can be. To be honest, it's way easier on this side being the person people reach out to (though I've Slowly been trying to find a balance in the middle where I reach out - but not so intensely as before - or ""wait"" - not purposefully of course - for others to reach out).

To those of you that don't reach out, aside from what I'm feeling in regards to it being ""easier"" on this side, why do y'all just... Not reach out to people?",27Jun2020,1

- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bite to me about how much she smells.

84,"It happened last August 2019. My Contemporary Arts teacher used to stay a little while in our room during our recess after the subject discussion. One day, I was talking with my friend down the hall and saw my teacher went outside our room. He walked toward us, while staring at me. Next thing happened, he pushed me slightly on the side  and shouted at me saying that I was blocking his wAy because I was too fat and too big. I honestly didn't know how I should react on what he has done. I looked at my teacher and saw him talking with my friend while 'admiring' her looks and her beautiful body. After what happened, I kept myself crying in our room the whole time because I didn't like to be labeled as a sensitive person. I told my friends and family about this. Some of them told me that he shouldn't have done this to me, but some of them told me that maybe he was just joking and playing around. 

I was aware how my body looked like at that time. I knew that I gained weight because of stress in school. In any jokes that my friends said about my body didn't offend me at all. In fact, I even laughed with them. But, something really crushed my soul after my teacher did that. My self-confidence that I'm still working on were gone. A few weeks after that day were so hard for me to deal with. I was crying almost every single night and almost tried to starve myself.

Fast forward to now, I still don't know how to completely move on from that day. There are days when I still cry and get unmotivated because of it. I never knew that it will be this hard for me.

93,"Its a pretty well known fact to my friends and family that my dad hated me from a very young age. When I was 12 he kept physically abusing me for being bad at maths. When I was 15-17 he the abuse shifted more towards verbal abuse and the focus shifted to all my grades not just towards maths. Now I’m in University doing my Bachelors In Education (TESL) Degree and he still says, in his own words, “A person with such a big head but small brain, how can you become a teacher?” . I always wanted to move out of my house, every single day I feel stressed and live in fear of when his next outburst is. Wake up in the morning? He’ll start scolding me for having the inability to cook. Afternoon? Get ready for a good scolding session of not cleaning the house. Night time? I get a scolding for not being able to cook dinner. I’m no chef, I’ve never studied how to cook and when I did, whatever questions or doubts I had was answered with criticism and words such as “Stupid, Moron, Asshole”. What type of dad calls his own son that? 

Anyways, with the lockdown its much worse. Waking up in fear everyday. I’m not some super smart person with a 4.0CGPA. I’m around 3.6CGPA and I just want a break to play my video games sometimes, even then he complains that I play too much.

Around December 2019, I tried to commit suicide. He was kind, or at least I thought so, for the first 3 weeks. Then he went back to being aggressive. There was even this one time he said I should have died when I tried to commit suicide.

94,"Back in the day when I was a kid with no income, credit card or anything of the sort I used to play MMOs (some more pay-to-win than others).  I saw the super powerful players with all the shiny gear, so obviously I wanted a piece of that pie. So I started searching - how do I get that premium in-game currency?

It didn't take too long before I found a YouTube tutorial - the classic Notepad-typing, Unregistered HyperCam with that one over-played track in the background. You can earn money by watching ads and clicking through surveys it claimed. Zero initial investment, only that sweet cash flow for your pay-to-win games.^(Use this referral link pls) I'm in!

I never really cashed out on it, but it's crazy remembering how big of a deal seeing $1.00 on that account. ""Hey, this survey earns you $0.20 as opposed to $0.02, hell yeah!"" With in-game purchases starting at around $14.99, I still had ways to go, that's probably why I didn't do it for too long, but the memory of me as a kid being on a mission to earn $15 cent by cent brings a smile to my face.

I'm not defending his racist jokes; here I am referring to stuff like his affinity for the number 69, discussing his theories of how to induce lactation (when he actually tested them that was admittedly too far), etc.  As someone with a crude sense of humor, there is nothing more annoying than redditors ignoring my actual words and accusing me of being a secret incel/redpiller/chauvinist just because my username is a genital pun.
2. if you look at Jim's behavior over the course of the series, he's really not in any position to be arbitrating who is a feminist and who is not.
3. outside of ""feminism"" specifically I think Kevin has a much purer heart and in a lot of ways is a better person than Jim is:
   1. His ""problematic"" jokes about Oscar and Angela aside, Kevin is the one who stands up for them when he realizes how shitty the senator is treating them. Jim literally runs and hides to avoid helping Andy in the episode with Robert's wife, even though Andy really needs Jim's help and Jim is the only person who can corroborate Andy's story.
   2. Kevin was ready to throw down to protect Pam when Roy was destroying the bar. Jim gets caught with his thumb up his ass and has to be saved by Dwight in the next episode.
   3. Kevin knows he's not smart, but the one thing he's good at is homemade chili, and he goes to the trouble of making it for his coworkers ostensibly with regularity. When has Jim ever even so much as bought lunch for ONE coworker (that he wasn't banging or trying to bang) besides the time he took Michael to hooters to manipulate him?
   4. And the way Jim treats Katy and Karen is just awful.  Stringing them along when he has no interest is bad enough, but he was just fucking rude to Katy and the messiness of his breakup with Karen really comes down to Jim wanting to eat his cake (do sex to Karen) and have it too (leave the door open to date Pam). He handles romance very immaturely when it doesn't go how he wants, while Kevin's initial instincts are to treat Lynne very sweetly and respectfully (""boobs"" faux pas aside) before *Jim* gets into his head\*.

Fuck Jim, long live King Kevin.

I've apologised a lot. Done stuff to try to make it up. 

We're obviously split up and she's moving on.

From a certain time in the past

I became very paranoid and sensitive and getting hurt from the tiniest things

And questioning people who're closest to me and unable to trust anyone

Feeling like people are laughing behind my back

And whenever I'm alone and it's quiet, I have a lot of suicidal thoughts. I would turn on radio or YouTube and listen to the voiceover so I don't hear my thoughts

I am still working and I rely heavily on the source of income. working from home. It makes me more isolated. But apart from work I have absolutely no energy to do anything else at all.

Obviously Coronavirus put those plans in doubt. We decided long ago that I can't go but she was back and forth on them going. I get it. She has a very close relationship with them and this is the only time of the year she sees them. Still I argued, we've stayed isolated for months now, only going out for groceries and to parks and what not. Are we throwing all that away?

What put her over the edge was that her dad is getting risky surgery in August and could end up paralyzed or even die. She wants to see him and let him spend time with the kids before then. How can I argue against that? 

Still, I don't like it. I'm lecturing them all day long about keeping their masks on and using the hand sanitizer and not touching anything or their faces. I WANT them to be a little scared. 

Any words of encouragement or is this a huge mistake??

105,"When my oldest sister was a kid, my dad had a whole room for games, board and video.
His favourite was call of duty and a wrestling game which name I cant remember, he used to play them all the time after work, while my sister watched.
Last week I was going thru cabinets to see if we had any CDs I'd like to listen to when I found his games.
He said he doesn't remember playing them but my sisters disagree.
I'm over ten years younger than my sister so I cant obviously remember if he actually played the games, but I hope he did.

108,"Not hating on video games here. Quite the opposite. More looking for a discussion and some space to reflect.

I was never a *huge* gamer, but I have definitely spent my time in front of a PC gaming. Most RPGs and strategy games, particularly Paradox Games. Occasionally action games too. And I enjoy the *theory* of games quite a bit, and play TTRPGs and board games eagerly. But video games have recently done very little except frustrate me, with some exceptions.

Darkest Dungeon, Dwarf Fortress, Dark Souls and Crusader Kings II continue to engage me profoundly. But almost every other game I have tried playing recently, old and new, has just left me feeling oddly powerless, frustrated and annoyed. And it's not because they've been unpolished indies.

I tried playing Divinity II: Original Sin, and *loathed* the experience. I felt it was advertised as a sandbox RPG with lots of trouble-solving opportunities, but I found myself quicksaving and quickloading all the time, and not as much doing creative tactics as just... Cheesing my way through and being slapped over the fingers when I arrived in an area I was underlevelled for, something not at all telegraphed by the game.

I tried playing Banner Saga. I loved the aesthetics and the artstyle, but I had absolutely no clue what the impact of my decisions about morale, supply etc. were. I came to a battle that I had huge trouble with, and finally, after literally dozens of tries, I got through it - only to find out that it was one of those rare two-part battles where you continue right on with the same team, no healing or changeups. I checked online, and *apparently* I made a decision right before the battle that I didn't know would keep a character that would have made the battle a cakewalk from joining my team. Why? Why even do this, game?

I tried playing Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark, and actually had some fun, until I ran into a battle I just couldn't beat, and found the solution was: ""Do this specific kind of levelling and build right from the beginning and it's easy!"" Again, frustrated and annoyed.

I feel like whenever I try to get into a video game where tactics and choices are there, it's all so illusory in the end. The experience ends up seeming hollow, and the fact that there is often a large layer of mechanics to understand and master makes the whole learning process doubly challenging and, ultimately, doubly disappointing. It's all added up to me asking myself what I even play video games for, and... I'm not even sure anymore.

111,"So the past few days, maybe week, I've been wanting to close myself off from people.  One friend kept texting me, videocalling me etc. and it drove me nuts (but I still answer of course). We usually talk often but I just needed a break.

I learned I have panic attacks ( I was at the doctor Tuesday and she confirmed it) and they make me feel so tired and listless. So I have very little tolerance for her energetic persona after an attack. 
I should communicate that though but she should see from my body language as well that I'm not feeling it right?

 Today my sister started spamming me  with questions for school and we called I helped her a bit. Less than an hour later she's spamming me again.

114,"I’ve got a best friend, she’s amazing, been in my life 13 years. I’ve got my family, they’re amazing. 
Whenever someone other than them reaches out, FaceTime, iMessage, WhatsApp, I get so much anxiety. I like them, but I don’t feel the need to FaceTime them? I don’t get excited. I actually don’t even reply for usually 2 days. 

This quarantine has been so great for me, all I want to ever do is read, write, nap, edit photos. I don’t feel the need to talk to people ever.  
I feel guilty though.
As silly as it is, I don’t even ever want to post a pic on my Instagram or story anymore because people message me and are like “let’s hang out” no. I didn’t post a photo of the beach for you to say “hey I’ll come meet you” Or, “you’re off work? Let’s hang out!”

I actually googled today “why don’t I want to have friends” I love being alone, doing errands alone, thrifting, everything. 
It’s not them, it’s me. I just prefer to be alone, always. 
A friend messaged me today asking to FaceTime at some point to show me some new things she got. I don’t want to. I don’t care enough. Great person, super nice, but I don’t feel the need to have a conversation. 

I feel bad for letting people down around me, people that want to spend time with me but I also have hung out with people because THEY really want to and so I give in. I don’t want to do that anymore. Doing what’s best for me is more important than pleasing them.

115,"So before this post starts, I want to get out of the way that I know what he has done is vile and unforgivable and that the allegations surrounding him are too numerous to ignore. I genuinely hate him and want to see him punished for what he has/is done/doing. The reason I haven't come forward in my own name will be explained in the post.

My Step-Brother is genuinely a disgusting person. He is a rude, vile, extremely wrong person in every aspect of his existence. He gets away with absolutely everything because nobody calls him out on what he does. If he approaches a girl through dating sites or social media and he gets rebuffed he threatens her and proceeds to besmirch her reputation to anyone he can. Let me give you an example.

He's recently broken up with a girlfriend. This has come after she accused him of raping her at a party. He tried to keep this under wraps until he slipped up and mentioned it to his dad. Instead of admitting to what he did he concocted a story that painted himself as the victim. I don't know and have never met the ex. The reason I know his story is a complete lie is because he's come up with about 5 different versions of it. It changes every time he talks about it because he can't remember what he's said. 

This is just one example of what he's like as a person. She messaged me after they broke up asking for my mum's phone number so that she could explain what really happened. I feel terrible that I turned down her request and said that I wouldn't get involved. I guess that I didn't want to upset the mood of the house and put pressure on my mum and stepdad (both of whom I love dearly). Heres where my dilemma comes in. I have no evidence of it happening apart from the person saying it did, the fact that his story changes so much and the fact that I know what type of person he is because I've lived in the same house as him for a number of years. I really can't keep it to myself anymore though. Its eating me up inside and I genuinely feel guilty for letting it slide.

I've filed an anonymous report that will hopefully be looked at and taken seriously. I just don't know if I'll be able to deal with the pressure it puts on my parents and the arguments it will cause when it inevitably comes out that I'm the one behind the report. I feel like he'll get away with it again and again though. I am weighed down by the thought of being a person that lets him do this to someone else. I live in the same house as him and I can't look at him. I got into an argument with him today that started over him moving my clothes around in my room because he wanted to use space in my wardrobe. He threatened to hit me and because I didn't back down and told him to go for it he backed off. I found it difficult to not bring up what I know during the argument. He is a coward and a disgusting person and I can't deal with him getting away with everything anymore.

TL;DR: Step Brother is a predator and I feel guilty for not speaking up",27Jun2020,1
116,"I am almost crying while writing this.

Let me explain a few things.

Me and my brother always spread positivity whenever we can and always ALWAYS help motivate people and gave quite a decent bit of food to homeless people in the past. Dropped envelopes of money in random places for strangers to pick up. 

We never expect anything back ever and literally never want recognition for the good things we done in the past. 

We always write this comment on videos “Whoever is reading this is beautiful and can achieve anything :)” or “Anyone reading this is beautiful and can achieve anything :)”

One time I posted it on a YouTube video and it got over 1 thousand likes and over 800 negative comments. 

Literally take a second to imagine from my point of view smiling as I’m writing our traditional comment to make even just one person smile. But then to find so much negativity coming from one positive comment with people telling me to kill myself or telling me how I’m begging for likes.

Nothing ever annoys me and I won’t mention the persons name but when I asked for a bit of money on a subreddit, after a bit of back and fourth of conversation on how nobody will give me money, the same person calls me a scammer and I tell him to go my Instagram to see my posts (which are very positive) which would have proved I wasn’t trying to scam anyone.

And without hesitation the guy starts saying how I should have self respect because I was “begging for views” when if he clicked even just one of my posts he’d have seen he was wrong.

I really couldn’t care if he sees this or reply’s. I just want the world to love a little more. 

Things like, if we all gave just 1 pound, dollar whatever. To Africa, we’d solve their hunger issue and can build their communities. If we all just threw our stuff in a bin instead of the ocean then global warming wouldn’t come about so quickly. 

One day in the future, me and my brother will show the world love and spread positivity wherever we go like a never ending waterfall of love. Just watch it happen.



Anyway, whoever is reading this is beautiful and can achieve anything :)",27Jun2020,3
117,"Hello! As stated in the tittle I have.... \*ahem\* .... control issues..... I've just come to terms with it...and I hate it. I hate it because I always feel so out of control. I always feel like I'm running after life. Running after time, running after joy, running after health, literally running to keep my weight down. Control of time is my biggest issue. I hate having other people tell me what to do with my time.  It drives me nuts. In a funny turn of events, I actually *liked* quarantine/stay-at-home order. I was in university at the time so I could grind and get all my schoolwork done then do whatever the heck I wanted to with the rest of my evening. I could exercise all day or watch tv all day or clean my house all day- it didn't matter and no one could stop me. But now I work, M-F 8-5, I get off work and I have to finish up schoolwork, clean the house (no one else in the this dumb house lifts a finger to clean up, they just make more mess), eat, exercise and get my butt out the door for church activities ( I'm more or less obligated to attend every church event my mom attends because I ""live under her roof""). I absolutely hate it. I hate having my whole day taken up by exercise and my entire evening taken up by chores and exercise. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. I wish I could control my own life- but I don't know how. I don't feel like I'm capable of controlling it. For awhile weight loss was one way I could take control (I was waay too heavy for my height) but now that I'm at a good weight I feel like weight maintenance is controlling me. I hate *having* to spend all day in the office and I hate having to spend all my off time going to things I don't really want to be at. I just want the freedom to make my own choices. I hate cleaning the house or exercising and then having to listen to the little quips and comments about how I do it or how I didn't do it right, I really enjoyed quarantine. I don't have a lot of friends so no social interaction was fine and I felt so good that my relationship with my family improved soo much (I often feel really sick emotionally and mentally and I tend to take it out on my family- I'm trying to find better coping methods but its been hard).

118,"Let’s call her D. D and I had been friends off and on since we were 7. This happened summer 2018, I was 17 at the time. I wasn’t new to going to the bars, I had been doing so since I was 15. (Where I’m from its ‘normal’ do be doing this from age 14 or so.) D was 16 at the time, and let’s just say she didn’t have the body of a 16 year old. Due to this she only slept with men who were 25 and up, occasionally they would be 40. One night we went out to the bars, and I got very very drunk, the point where I couldn’t walk or talk. I was slouched on the road outside the bar, barely conscious, whilst D was trying to find someone. She comes back with one of her friends friend, who was 28 and said he had bread in his house for me. He lived on the next street over and offered to help. They carried me to his, carried me up the stairs and laid me down on his sofa. D then sat on the chair next to me. I was barely conscious. There was no bread. He then got on top of me and grinded on me. I couldn’t move my body. I made no sounds. He then proceeded to forcefully have sex with me. Rape me. I don’t remember how it stopped as I passed out. D did nothing - her reason? Because she thought he was cute. The few people I’ve told, have said it was my fault because I drank too much.

I haven't talked to her in over a year but recently I've been meaning to reach out and tell her I appreciate our time together. Couldn't find her social media, so I just had to write this out and put my feelings somewhere:


After things ended between us I kind of forced myself to forget you. It never really worked, but it at least mostly kept me from being sad about it. Anyway, only this past year or so I've really been thinking about everything again, sort of reflecting on it all. Made me realize how truly lucky I was to have what we had. Like, yeah, we had ups and downs and we ended up hurting each other sometimes, but still that relationship made me really understand what it feels like to be so deep in love with someone and have them be that much in love with you. It's a phenomenal feeling and I'm so grateful that I got to experience it because it has made and has been continuing to make me a better person. Without this experience, I'm sure that I would have ended up being less happy and less of everything that I like about myself right now. I'm sorry it took me so long to say but I really am grateful to have had you in my life for all those years (even when we were just friends). You made such a huge impact on my life and I'm sure you have no idea just how big it's been. I hope you don't think I forgot about you, I still think about you and remembering everything we had makes me happy and brings me comfort when I need it. Honestly that makes me miss you sometimes. I like to believe you still remember me with the same fondness and that you appreciate us as much as I do.

I know talking with exes can always evoke some bad feelings so I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable or sad or anything, it's just that I'm really starting to realize how important you still are to me and I felt like I had to share that with you, you deserve it. I really do hope you're well and that you're getting (or will get) to experience these feelings still with someone else. Last thing I wanna say is that I love you. Not in an ""I want you back"" way of anything, I say that in the most harmless possible way. At first, most memories of you were bittersweet, but after dealing with those feelings I see them as just sweet and they're all very dear to me. So basically now I understand that you've given me so many fond memories and helped me grow so much as a person (even today), and I genuinely do love you for it.

128,"When we first entered into shelter in place I didn’t go out for anything but groceries and it’s been that way since March. I’ve ventured out a few times to target and have gone on one long fairly remote hike since March. I wear a mask whenever I’m out, I social distance, I wash my hands and so on. I’d say the most adventurous thing I’ve done is have a nice dinner delivered on my birthday. 

I live right by the beach and haven’t gone in months, something I love to do. I had camping trips, trips to new cities, trips to see old friends that had moved away, my birthday party all planned - and all cancelled. I’m extremely extroverted and love to be out and about and traveling. I haven’t seen my closest friends since March. It just feels like I’m stuck working from home, sitting on my ass doing nothing. I’m lonely and feel like my 20s are being wasted away in all of this. I’m just frustrated.

I also realize my problems are small compared to others. I see stories of families dealing with COVID, and have read articles on the toll this pandemic is having on our health care professionals and I honestly just start crying at how awful everything is. I do not want to contribute to any of this suffering let alone go through it, so I stay home. And when I have to go out I cover up for mine and everyone else’s safety. 

And then I go on Instagram and see videos of friends partying it up, some of them are even teachers or in professions that interact with the public. I see people in other states at the beach, at the bars, and out without masks. Now we have a HUGE spike in cases of COVID in these states and around the country. I see videos of fucking Karen’s screaming about not wanting to wear masks and I just can’t take this bull shit anymore. The selfishness displayed by these people is unbelievable. It’s like in the last 4 years half this country has forgotten how empathy works and just lost theirs. Don’t even get me started on what I think of the trump admins response to this crisis. 


Myself and countless other people are following the rules and just when cases seemed like they were dropping in May - we’re back to shit being awful because of these people. The best way I can put it is - it feels like I’m being punished for something I didn’t do and I’ve done everything I’m supposed to. I just see my state and many more closing down again because cases will continue to spike - and in turn we’ll all be stuck at home for much longer and that means wasting even more time at home alone. Every person I see contributing to this, I just hate with a passion. 

I just needed to rant. Thanks for reading if you do. Wear a mask, please help end this.

Edit: wanted to add a personal thing - I only have a front yard and was using it to sit out and do work or get some sun with my dog and drink a beer.
