Decided to share hoping it would take my focus off of the pain. My family loves me. They are very supportive. My life is above average with blessings. I have strong faith in God. I need to remind myself that I am not special. Lots of people have worse things they have to deal with. I am grateful that my chronic pain is being recognized and treated. Finally after 25 years of going to doctors and being told it is only in my head. Being labeled as crazy. Finally someone listened. A doctor that listened an Angel of God that listened to me. I am crying right now. Remembering the relief I felt, the feeling that the weight off the world had been lifted off of my spirit. The renewal of life. All of my health problems finally made sense. The self confidence I gained that day. It has been a year 1/2 since I have been getting treatment. I made sure to write a letter gratitude to the doctor and nursing staff. I like to thank God for blessings. But in this case all of gratitude goes to doctors and nurses that sacrifice their time and energy to help people heal. They truly saved my mind,body and soul.

8,"First, a bit of backstory:  
I am a 22-year old guy, and the person I was with is a 31-yer old girl. We were together for approximately 5-6 months before we split up early March this year.Whether it was the age gap, our incompatible attachment styles (I'm very affectionate, she very avoidant) or just the latitudes we found ourselves at during this period, it became very clear that as a romantic couple, this relationship was not going to work. We enjoyed each others humour, sex life was great, even each others quirks others might find annoying. It was during those banal, arbitrary times whilst at home, long walks and/or eating at restaurants that we realised that this whole thing was doomed. As we were breaking up, we promised each other we'd stay friends.

She has had her fair share of issues in the past. From split parents, that weren't ever around to show her love, over abusive boyfriends (or ignorant ones, for that matter) to spontaneous abortions. This has made her build walls around herself.During our time together (approx. 4 months in), she told me she kept reminiscing about her Ex, thinking that maybe she shouldn't have broken up with him; This was nothing new to her, as she came clean to me about those thoughts reoccurring throughout her past couple of relationships.

Paraphrasing, she'd often tell me: ""There is nothing I'd change about you. You're funny, you're caring, you're *this*, you're *that, but what if there's more out there?""* At first, I hoped that those were possibly just hormones talking (she has got a Birth-Control implant). Then, I thought she might just be scared of commitment and laying it off a bit on my side might make more comfortable.My behaviour towards her changed - I went from being a hopeless romantic and real-life Ted Mosby, to becoming very cautious and contemplative around her. It caused regular disagreements (not fights) and suspicion (From both parties, I believe) to settle in, and after 3-4 mini-breakups (I say mini, because she'd break up with me in the morning and later on in the evening call me, sobbingly, apologising for what she said), we eventually broke up, *for real.*

I have told myself  *and* her, that no matter what, I'd see her through this ""crisis"" of hers. She has started counselling, reached out to friends of old and even started working out again. She was doing great for a bit, until this whole Covid-19 situation escalated and we all had to self-isolate.She lives on her own, and knowing how anxious she gets and how self-destructively her brain works, I have tried arranging going for runs with her, calling her once a day just to check how she is doing. And this is where I have found myself in a dilemma; She seems to not want my company. At least not when it's not off of her own initiative.She will send me memes, ask to go shopping with her so she doesn't feel alone, hell, she even asked me to come over to hers with wire-cutters to cut her braces out (They snapped a day or two into everything shutting). And during those times, she'd be very affectionate, friendly, caring.But it is when I try to establish contact, that she seemingly goes cold. To the point, where she's annoyed when I call her so much, she can't fake hospitality. ""*God, What do you want? What do you want now?""* is usually what I'm met with. And whether purposefully or not, her social media seems to be getting ever so slightly celebratory of single life and anti-relationship. Which hurts.

What am I supposed to do in this situation? Whether it's my ego that can't handle defeat, or my selflessness that desperately wants to help someone who seemingly does not want my help - *I feel as if I'm sinking into sadness.* It's quite exhausting, but facing some with that form of anxiety in these great times of uncertainty, seems like the most douchebaggy thing to do. Am I wasting my time and youth by being too sensitive? Am I still idealising relationships (whether they're romantic or platonic)?Or am I justified in my naivety?

18,"I’ve had a reallly shitty year. First, my skunk died after having issues breathing out of nowhere. All the sudden one night after all the vets offices had closed he started gasping for air and I was able to get him comfortable for the night but then on the ride to the vet he was gasping again. It turned out he had lung tumors we had no idea were there, and they had started bleeding. The vet said that kind of thing happens a lot. And since skunks aren’t that active in the winter it wasn’t too alarming he was more tired than normal. And then this whole covid thing happened. My work shut down so now I don’t have any income. Luckily I have savings but it’s in the stock market which isn’t doing so hot. I won’t get a relief check because my fathers name is on my student loans (even tho I’ll be the one paying them off because they said they wouldn’t give me any financial assistance once I graduate) and that’s the majority of my expenses. I don’t make more than what he takes out. Plus I’m still on their health and car insurance so I’m still a dependent. But my dad work just cut his hours and wages so he has to use whatever money he gets for himself. And on top of that I finally found the area I want to go into but with all of the covid stuff happening they’re not hiring and the entire industry is running short on funds because it’s mainly nonprofit. But I can exactly leave my job because I have to work there for a year to get my license to do the same thing and so if I stop now and get another job and then have to stay at that job when everything starts back up I’d have to wait a whole extra year to get my license.

22,"**Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/fpmomc/australias_mental_health_system_is_really_failing/**

****

To begin, things didn't really get better.

**Context**: 

**My two best friends** are directly related to eachother (siblings), I sent each of them their own unique long apology letter (10 or so paragraphs, two hours of writing each). One absolutely grilled me and didn't find it believable. To quote **""First of all, yeah, thanks for apologizing but you'll excuse me if I think it kind of means shit""**, which absolutely broke my heart, I appealed to them as someone who had been in the same situation once (having lost their way for a few days and saying things that weren't true to their beliefs) but they didn't accept it.

The other sibling grilled me over it, I kept apologizing, said I'd sit down and listen to everything they had to voice about what happened without me uttering any rebuttal. But they gave me the silent treatment. I left them alone for a week, and we got in touch again; Things are still rocky, we haven't talked about the issue but have sort of ""moved on"" from what's happened, had casual talk, and I'm probably going to see them soon to fix their laptop.

**What have I got and what's the deal with meds?**
I'm almost 26; Three and a half years ago I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I switched meds multiple times since the first set made my conditions worse, and supplementary changes would make me chuck up. 

I found it really hard to actually stay on a set of meds since I found my mental capacity was extremely lacking for the kind of work I do (IT), and pretty much deadlocked myself in a situation where if I was taking them I would be failing at work, and failure to solve issues would ingrain a sense of dread/worthlessness in me. So I'd stop taking them, get back my mental strength, fix issues, and get a high off that (but it was never enough to sate me).

****

**My hunch on what's going on with my head?**

I'm training to be a pro wrestler, I've landed on my head a few times and ended up with concussions. Was sexually abused as a kid by someone who was extremely close to me (a father figure. *Story: I didn't realize it wasn't normal until one day when I was 9 and walking back from the school bathrooms with my best friend, I told them at the time what would happen, and he said ""This is a joke right? You can't be serious"". Told me to tell a teacher and I neglected to.*), 

I've never been able to really move on from it (Jeez looking at that F word still doesn't source any sense of meaning within me). I'm reaching an age where mental health issues rear their head and come in guns blazing. I also have issues keeping friends long term, there's this consistent paranoia that there's something I can never know, and I'll often grow an unhealthy attachment/infatuation to them (sort of like it's the only thing I can do to make people happy). It's scary of often I feel jealousy.

Objectively, I think I'm someone who's just been through the ringer both physically and mentally, and is in need of some solid stability in the external parts of my life. I need to know that I'll have a rock to fall back on and support me should I lose track of reality. I kind of need to be afforded care that I'd never received before in hope of getting back somewhere relatively normal.

****

Time for the actual update:

**Onto my mental health visits/trying to fix this shit in my head:**

I went to my GP the next day after my last post and appealed to get reassessed, I explained:

* What I did and how I'd lashed out
* That I wasn't finding even a hint of content in just living. 
* That I'll get high days (A simple 6 out of 10 in terms of ""Happiness""), followed by consecutive days of crushing lows.
* That regardless of energy, when I'm faced with a weird situation I kind of go internally on myself and habitually smile and act like everything is okay (when it's really not and I'm thinking of all the ways I can hurt or kill myself with the objects around me). Which was happening at our appointment.
* Disassociations; As in there's very few people I interact with who exist beyond them turning a corner and out of my vision, it's impossible to imagine their life after I lose sight of them from our last hangout.
* That I'd go on and off meds.

He got me a referral to a partially gov funded organization called HeadSpace (Victoria). We faxed my details to them with a breakdown of what I'd explained and my current state, it was marked as a priority case due to the circumstances from my last post. I'd call them every 2nd or 3rd day and ask for an update on my place in the queue and was met with one nice receptionist, and another management staff who was completely unsympathetic. I don't blame the former, she's doing her job, I am annoyed by the latter and their handling (the jist I got was that that person wanted to rush the call and get onto other things, generic ""You'll have to wait for our callback"", which to be honest, no one ever calls each-other back these days.)

I called again a few hours ago, reached the receptionist again and was put on hold. Came back and got news that my mental health plan was out of date and that I'd need a new one (things I would've loved to hear 4 phonecalls ago), at which point they'll put me back in the queue. My concern is that Headspace will only attend to people as long as they're 25 or younger. So my time is running out.

She was nice about the whole thing and asked if I'd be down to be contacted by pros for research, group sessions and such (like, kudos to you lady for extending the olive branch and not just leaving the call cold, I appreciate that) I said sure to everything. I've booked myself in for another appointment with my GP over the phone this afternoon to get this mental health plan figured out since they're not doing consultations face to face anymore. 

I'm kind of on edge, the lack of communication with anyone is making me feel like I'm in a box and being watched by invisible people gambling on whether I make it through April (like I'm a soulless object for entertainment). Random bursts of crying fits, shouting at myself to be lovable, and that I need to shut up and go with what's happening. It's almost like there's a reassuring personality that sits in the back of my head but won't come out to talk until I've messed up, and will lecture me about what I need to do to keep calm, where are you 98% of the time, where are you when I need those words of assurance that I'm losing my way but that I'm not to far off the path and it's an easy walk back?

Hopefully someone takes away something from this and enlightens them on something they need to attend to in their own life.",02Apr2020,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat",02Apr2020,1

I warned them back in March come April we may be having a tough conversation but I'm hoping to avoid it.

Well that conversation came and they were let go due to the business impact of COVID19. I told them the second things improve I will call them and offer them their position back but when and if that happens I can't guarantee anything.

Problem is all the relationships I've entered into and girls who've been interested in me that I didn't date were before my life went to shit and depression ruined it completely. Now I've gained 70 lbs that I'm to weak willed and pathetic to do anything about, I don't take care of my hygiene or dress nicely anymore, I don't work out, don't do anything interesting, don't have anything to say, don't achieve anything, there's no way any girl would be interested in me now. Most of all I'm a failure; I dropped out of college and can't go back possibly ever, I have no goals at all and just work a dead end customer service job barely making ends meet.

But I'm at an age where people are successful. My friends are graduating college, getting engaged, moving to other states, etc. And I just do absolutely nothing. Now even if I ever do get my life on track (big if) I'll be about 10 years behind. Nobody wants to date a 35 year old undergrad. 

And I've already lost any and all hope that my depression might someday be better. If 5 years of professional help and extreme effort hasn't done anything then I don't think anything will. I'm just stuck in this life being unwantable and alone forever.

39,"Men’s room is shared by two different offices...total of 6 people...all males.

“OFFICE A” complains that “OFFICE B” has put food scraps/wrappers into bathroom trash can 3 times in the last month, causing the bathroom to smell like food. OFFICE B contends the bathrooms usually smell like piss and shit anyways, what’s the big deal? It’s a bathroom trash can.......OFFICE A contends it’s a shared bathroom and so its common courtesy to not throw away eaten food items in restroom garbage. And the reason you don’t throw away leftovers in your office trash can is because you know they will smell. 

Leader of “OFFICE A” is pretty smug, at times condescending, and is known “one upper”. Leader of “OFFICE B” can be a sensitive and will overthink things to a fault.

All the people that i was sorta friends with and never hung out with who are going to different colleges i’ll never see again. I just got my friend group to start hanging out a few months ago and we were all really close and even tho we keep talking texting just isn’t the same. I haven’t really had a good conversation with my parents or sister in probably a year. The girl i’m talking to keeps seeming like she likes me then randomly will just pretend i don’t exist. 

I wholeheartedly understand the stay at home order and beg people who are not following it to please stay at home. I don’t wanna loose my summer and my only chance to see people who i will never see again in my life. My only sadness with it is that no matter how much i text people or try to make conversation I just feel so so alone sitting behind a screen. I keep trying to fill my days with schoolwork or games or anything but I end up having so much free time and keep thinking negative thoughts and make myself feel even more alone.

51,"Thanks for taking the time to read Coco’s story. 
My friend’s dog, Coco, escaped her house in Los Angeles, CA on 12th March 2020 around 3pm. She wasn’t noticed missing until 5pm, and my friends family started their first search.. which lasted up until 10pm. Then local volunteers, family, and friends came together and searched into the early hours of Friday morning. The search went as far as 10 miles around the radius. There were many sightings reported to us but we just kept missing her. Then on Friday afternoon, we received a report that a white dog with black spots had been struck by a train near my friend’s house, near where Coco was last seen. They sent a team to search, and in panic we as well scoured the area, but found nothing. Not a single trace of Coco. Continued searching late into the night but nothing. Coco was missing for a 2nd night, until the morning of Saturday 14th, a miracle happened. 
A lady three blocks from my friend’s neighborhood was on her daily jog. As she was jogging, she spotted Coco.. she laying lifeless on the side of the track. It was pure chance. She changed her usual jogging route last minute and that was the only reason she’d spotted Coco. Luckily she’d seen the appeals all over Facebook asking for help with the Coco search and contacted my best friend right away. We are truly blessed for this miracle! 

At the vet, we found out Coco was in major shock and suffered from many injuries from her face down to her tail and the vet believed she could’ve had neurological damage as well. Standing and moving is very difficult for her to do and basically impossible due to her broken leg. She’s in need of a spine operation so it makes it easier for her to walk, or at least we hope she can walk again. Any amount would mean the world to my best friend, her family and I. I want to help her as much as I can because she has done the same for me in these hard times. and as you know times are really hard right now with everything else going on. Anything will be appreciated, thank you so much!

**- Notes**

* “One gets a huge rush of adrenaline flying down the street at over three times the speed limit.”  

   * That was a long time ago. I’ve grown past that. The word “yesterday” is not used literally.
* “Across the “creek” from the poorest part of town, lay the wealthiest.”  

   * I don’t mean to stereotype. This is just for literary effect.
* “People leeching off the concrete walls of buildings like worms leech off rotten fruit.”  

   * I’m not disrespecting them or being inconsiderate of their circumstances. This is what I perceived as someone who has never been exposed to this before.
* Now that that's out of the way...........

The coronavirus lockdown is in place across Canada. Most days, I sleep, eat, play video games. But my favourite thing to do is to go for a sunset drive. I did many drives over spring break totaling over 2000km of exploration. More recently, I had stopped going on my daily drives because I didn’t find them interesting anymore. April 1st, not knowing how eye opening and wonderful this drive I was to take would be, I set out at 5:05pm from my house high in the hills. Music blasting, windows down, I first visited the UBC Vancouver campus to get a feel for the university I might be going to next September. The beautiful road leading to the university was so plain. I had never seen anything like it. I took the scenery in, slowing down to give myself more time. I usually drive my sports car pedal to the metal, engine screaming, exhaust popping, gears banging. One gets a huge rush of adrenaline flying down the street at over three times the speed limit. Today was different – going under the speed limit for once. Occasionally pulling over to let cars behind me pass in front. The grass so evenly cut, the curve and slight incline in the road so perfect. Surrounded by thick trees on either side and a lawn filled with the greenest grass on earth running down the centre. The UBC campus, once a vibrant community bustling with people, now, a ghost town. Usually no people in sight. Sometimes, a car here and a person walking over there.

I headed to Point Grey. Across the “creek” from the poorest part of town, lay the wealthiest. The streets so narrow, cars parked on both sides allowing only one direction of traffic through. Some stretches are so thin for so long, when you see a car ahead of you in the distance, you wonder if you’re driving the wrong way down a one-way street. Relieved when another car pulls up behind you assuring you that you aren’t. I pull over and flash the driver to come through. As he approaches closer and passes, I see the friendly smile of the driver and his kind wave as he thanks me for pulling over to let him get through. The pure quiet at Point Grey caused me to turn down the radio; only realizing that I had done so a few minutes later.

Crossed the Granville Bridge. Nothing out of the ordinary except for a young police officer not much older than me arresting a twenty or so year old white man on the side of the street for I’m assuming drugs or things of that nature. I went to West Hastings for the first time in my life. I’d heard about it. Never experienced it. Oh. My. God. People leeching off the concrete walls of buildings like worms leech off rotten fruit. They had turned the streets into a landfill. No sense of order – just chaos. The traffic lights had no meaning. People doing whatever they want as the lights attempted to hold up the last bit of authority. Swinging in the wind, they failed as no one obeyed them. Every other car, an undercover police officer looking suspiciously at people as they walked across the streets and lurked in the shadows of tents and other people. I was in shock. This sight was intensified having just come out of the complete opposite, Point Grey, only minutes ago.

7:00pm, I heard cheering in the streets. I turned down my radio once again. At this point, it was off. I looked around, cars honking, people banging pots and pans hanging off their balconies. I thought to myself, “Have these people gone mad?”. It took me a few moments to realize this is the appreciation event happening every night as a thank you to healthcare workers battling the coronavirus. I did not join in to toot my horn with the other cars around me. The sound of the horns were aggressive and unwelcoming.

Driving back home on Barnet, a motorbike came up to me and invited me for some spirited driving along the shorelines. He took off. If this was yesterday, I would’ve downshifted a couple gears, floored it and followed suit chasing him down. But not today. I hung out in the right lane behind a minivan. I had too much to think about concerning my future.

61,"This has been my first relationship ever, and we've been together for almost 2.5 years now.  Lately, I've been struggling with something that has left me feeling down/unhappy in my relationship.  However, I don't know if this is a valid issue for me to bring up to my boyfriend to discuss with him, or if I'm just overreacting and holding onto a grudge that I need to get rid of on my own (via therapy, or whatever).

For nearly all of 2019, my bf got into the habit of criticizing my clothing choices and my weight (I weighed approx 125 lbs when I met him, but due to work stress I had gained about 10 pounds).  Or lots of times when I'd go over to his place, little things here or there (that I said or did) would annoy him.  It kind of got to a point where for a long time, I'd get really nervous before going to visit him because I'd worry that something I would do/say would make him act this way towards me.  I'd talk a lot less because I was worried that I would say something stupid.  It also shattered my self-esteem with regards to how I viewed my own appearance: I know I'm objectively not the prettiest, but I used to like myself.

Now though: I feel depressed when I'm around him and I feel gross/self-conscious during sex.  I got back into shape sometime around December but gained a little bit of the weight back in January.

Sometime during the middle of January, it's like he experienced a huge mood shift and suddenly became waaaay nicer to me: he compliments me regularly now, and he doesn't snap at me for things I say or do anymore.  But the thing is that I still feel like shit, because I can't stop remembering the past.

67,"Throwaway because drug use reference. Not meaning to come here and brag, but genuinely wondering if anyone has experienced this or could offer some explanation.

Basically, despite the whole Coronavirus thing I'm feeling really happy lately, **almost to the point of exhaustion**. I'm enjoying getting in touch with people over the internet, am talking to complete strangers and generally clicking well with people. I'm cracking jokes constantly, they seem to be landing, and I am finding myself to be utterly hilarious and impeccably witty (this is **not normal** for me!). Things have been generally going well for me in life lately, and I am largely unaffected by this whole thing because I am usually quite introverted and I have a government job so I'm still getting paid.

The best way I can describe the feeling is, it feels like being on MDMA. (I have taken MDMA exactly once at a concert and had a great time). This includes just feeling a bit weird, I literally feel like I am on drugs.

Aside from the things I have already mentioned, the only explanation I can possibly come up with is that I am/was a regular weed smoker (roughly one small joint daily or every other day) and I haven't had any weed for two weeks. I have taken breaks before and never felt like this.

71,"So about 6 years ago a good friend of mine retired from the Military and decided that he was tired of the hustle and bustle of the world around him and his wife and he decided to purchase some land in Alaska, build a small home, and lock themselves away and just enjoy nature. His only real form of communication he has available to him (By choice) is a satellite phone however they leave it off unless they have an emergency. About 3 times a year he travels into the closest big town and restocks on essentials like spices, oils, non-perishables, ammo, supplies in general, etc. They also have a little business to do with furs and crafts that his wife makes that they sell for extra income.

The last time I spoke to him was early January. He calls me every time he gets into town. Well, I just got off the phone with him and he's fucking beside himself right now.

He felt something was off when he drove into town all the restaurants and stuff were closed and that felt odd to him. He gets to his friend's house that lives in town and he and his wife crashes at and his friend fills him on the details.

A man in china ate a bat back in December which resulted in a new virus that is deadly spreading all across the world. A cure is a year out, thousands are dying everyday and in order to combat the virus communities across the world have gone into lockdown. Also Kobe has died, someone he actually admires.

And he's sitting there and thinking...fuck me man. He then suggests to his friend they head out for a beer and a steak at a local restaurant he likes to go to every time he's in town and his friend informs him that's not going be possible since its closed.

Also when he went to go restock he ran into rationing limits. He said him and his wife have decided to stay in town for about a week before heading back that way if they caught COVID 19 they are closer to medical assessment but after that week is over they are heading back out and going spend 2 months before having to come back to restock again.

76,"I’ve had problems with focus for as long as I can remember. With everything. It doesn’t even matter if it’s something I like or not. I get distracted super easily and will spend my time doing pointless things such as making random lists. I’ve been doing this sort of thing ever since I was a kid. Back then, I was able to finish my homework because my parents forced me to, but even then it brought me immense pain to focus on something that I simply didn’t want to. I occasionally get bursts of energy where I will be able to work on something, but it usually doesn’t last very long. I had pretty bad grades in high school and constantly got in trouble for it. My final year of high school I didn’t do any of my homework at home. I was always rushing to do it 5 minutes before it was due, even with big things like papers or projects. I’m sure I wouldn’t have done any of the work if it weren’t for my fear of being yelled at by my parents. I decided to go to university because I didn’t have a plan for after high school ended and didn’t want to just sit around my parent’s house all day.

I thought this lack of focus was attributed to my depression as that can be a symptom of it. But it’s looking like that’s not the case. I got on a medication for depression earlier this year, and it has improved my overall sense of self, but it’s done nothing for my work ethic. I don’t know if I have any actual conditions like ADHD since I’ve never been tested. All my life I’ve been told I’m just lazy, and that’s kind of what I think, but at the same time it doesn’t feel like that? Like I said, I spend my time doing pointless things. It’s not like I’m ignoring work to watch Netflix all day. I do things that don’t even make me happy. I feel like I can’t do anything even though I know that I can and should. It’s really bad.

So I’m sitting here now, trying to do my work and crying because I feel as if I’m too far behind to catch up now. Obviously due to the coronavirus classes have been moved online and just being here at my house instead of the dorms is one big distraction. You’d think being stuck inside all day would help. Nope. I spent pretty much all of today making lists. WHY DO I MAKE LISTS SO MUCH?

My advisor told me I could just drop a couple classes in order to focus on the ones required for my major, but I’m really not wanting to do that considering the class I’m currently most behind in is one that I already had to retake.

I’ve thought about flat out dropping out of university many times before because I really just don’t think I’m cut out for it. I can’t focus on anything. I don’t even know why I thought things would be different in university with my track record from high school. In fact, I didn’t even want to go to university until my senior year of high school because I knew I wouldn’t succeed there. I only decided to go because I had no other plan. I don’t even really enjoy my major, and have nothing I would want to change it to.

The only thing about dropping out of university that worries me is the friends I’ve made there. If I dropped out now, I’d likely never see any of them again. But I also don’t want to keep paying for something that I’m not enjoying in the slightest.

I don’t know what to do. I feel stuck. Even if I ended up dropping out I’d have no plan and nothing to do. I suppose I would get a job and live at my parent’s house but the only job I could get would be something like food service. Which is okay, I had a job like that for two years in high school, but I know I’d basically be doing nothing but work and the same routine of making lists and sitting around that I am stuck on. Cause that’s exactly how it was in high school except for the fact that I went to school.

79,"I’m just thinking about this right now and prior to this whole corona virus thing, I was starting to go to the gym super consistently, I was starting to make new friends with maybe a couple people, I was supposed to get my first tattoo that month, I was in the process of finding a job and I had an interview a couple weeks before they shut things down, and I’m realizing that I was really living life. 

The tattoo was supposed to be like symbolic or independence and I’ve always felt like my parents were and still are controlling and stuff, so this was like something that was for me only and symbolic of telling myself that I have ownership over my life. The job interview was to save up for an apartment that I planned to get with some friends and although I didn’t think it would happen, at least I was trying to do it and that was bringing me satisfaction that I was working towards that goal. It’s not like I was guaranteed a job after that interview but now the economy is plunging and it’s going to be harder to get a job. I was really in the groove with working out and exercising, and I had my routine going and I was going to the gym consistently 4 days a week and training hard. I feel like I have to start over these things and I’m of course going to still try at all these things, but now they’re just delayed, it’s going to take more time to do these things, and they won’t be the same perhaps. 

The biggest thing I realized was in those moments I thought I was living shitty life and I was depressed and sad for I don’t know what reason and I told myself I didn’t have XYZ, which is maybe why I was sad. Looking back now, I was on an uphill and was doing everything right without even realizing it and just really trying to accomplish my goals. 

I’m always afraid of not doing the right thing or following the right path, and here I was starting to do that and the world gets essentially shut down and I can’t even go outside anymore. If anything I’m realizing that maybe I should give myself more credit and trust myself, but these things are of course only hindsight realizations that you could come to.

I’m just bummed how things are right now, and I don’t feel like doing schoolwork, I’m literally home all day, and things generally suck. And now things suck when I thought things sucked few weeks ago but looking back now i didn’t realize how good things were going.

Why. Today the only thing that news r doing is spreading the fear and uncertainty, making the whole world scared. Comparing it to WWII or saying that improvements r no where to b seen, all of this is just awful. 

Due to this fear we r no longer in control of even our small daily tasks. We can’t go out. We can’t talk to our family. We need to buy hand sanitisers and masks. We must stay home, completely isolating our selves from the world. Suddenly it’s ok for government to monitor our every movement through our phones. Suddenly it’s ok to put a bracelet on people to monitor their location, among other things. Cash is no longer ok cuz it can spread Coronavirus. You have to use a card so they can monitor your every transactions, one more way the government has extended their control over our private lives. 

In spite of all of this happening, including us losing our privacy, we are ok with it since it’s an extraordinary situation. Yep it’s fine that people’s phones r being tracked because they need to do it to fight the virus. However, there were many situations like this in the past, where government was able deal with them without intruding so much in our lives. Without locking us up in our houses til further notice. Now they have an absolute control over the population and we have just given in without a fight. ‬

‪People in Italy have been been locked up for a month now. No one is helping them financially nor providing some special caring package with necessary items. People r slowly running out of money and other resources, leaving them to starve. They can’t earn any money because economy is shut down so people have started to rob grocery stores. They are on their own and government ain’t about to help them. 

With compulsory isolation we r all separated and left on our own to deal with all the fear the news is bring upon us. People r losing hope and motivation, which makes them easily controllable. ‬We feel powerless and no one out there is helping the population keep their morale. So many things are happening behind the Coronavirus pandemic facade, things that r going to significantly affect our everyday lives in the future but we wouldn’t even know. Today news outlets have made it clear that there’s only one thing that everyone must understand - Coronavirus is the worst thing that has ever happened and we must give up our freedom to fight it.

Ps: I’m not saying this virus is nothing or whatever. I’m only talking about implications.",02Apr2020,1
81,Holyyyy fuck. I’m a college student and left right behind everything flew to shit in a big city that I attend school in. I only packed for two weeks as I didn’t believe we wouldn’t be allowed to come back and went home and now everywhere is under shelter-in-place. I need to get the rest of the shit out of my dorm but my home is a good seven hours away and I don’t want to risk exposing my parents to corona any more than they might have been already. I’ve been home now in self isolation for three weeks and it’s okay except for night. I see all my friends moving out of their dorms and I want to get my things too but I’m scared that inevitably we will be exposed to corona because we need to stop at least once for a bathroom break on our trip if we go pick them up.

85,"So I've been dating my boyfriend for going on two years now. I'm happy in our relationship and I have no real complaints, but I've been wondering if what I'm feeling is what I'm ""supposed"" to be feeling. 

We get along really well -- we have a lot in common, he's incredibly respectful of me, we have a shared sense of humor, and we're best friends. Physically, he is not my ""type,"" but I do find him attractive and we are mostly sexually compatible (sex doesn't matter that much to me as I have a very low drive, but for what it's worth I find it pleasant to be with him physically). 

I care about him deeply and the thought of us breaking up makes me sad. I know I love him, but is this what ""love"" on a romantic level is supposed to feel like? 

I've been infatuated with people before, which is a whole other feeling from what I feel with my boyfriend. But, the people I've been infatuated with were people I did not know very well but found incredibly physically attractive. It's a deep-seated lusting feeling, and at one point in the past it was so strong for this one acquaintance of mine that I felt like I was going slightly insane. 

Am I supposed to feel that infatuated lust for my boyfriend or is it normal that I don't? I've been second-guessing and questioning myself because the depiction of love I see all around me is not in line exactly with what I'm feeling. Is it just that love is romanticized in the media? Or is that ""romanticized"" idea what you're really supposed to be feeling? How does everyone else feel with their SO's? Is it similar to mine? Please put my mind at ease.",02Apr2020,1

87,"As the title suggests, this is what my mother did. I am now 23(F) and in my household it was accepted and normal to be bulimic. 80% of the time we would eat junk food at home my mother would go to the bathroom and throw it up. I started doing the same thing when I was 13 and she even encouraged me to do it. I was crying in my bed because I was a chubby kid on my 8th birthday. I started dieting around the age of 11, and I was diagnosed with anorexia at 14. Although it seems rational not to encourage your kid to be anorexic or bulimic, imposing your own beauty standard can cause that too, i.e. my mother would always say ""She has a pretty face but her body is too big/fat/bulky...""

It happened again a couple months ago, an older woman at work asked me where I’m from, again, because of my “accent.”

I’ve recorded myself speaking on a few occasions since then and I DO pronounce certain words with an accent and I have no idea how or why. It sounds normal in my head (for example, teabag becomes tea “beg,” lamp becomes “leamp”)

i've been like this since last year, well even more actually

im so used to this, that i dont even know how i should be, you know?

honestly, i think im doing pretty good still

keeping it cool, i dont let emotions take over, honestly, why should i even be surprised that no one gives a shit about me? i used to be a dick sometims, sometimes used to act standoffish, sometimes felt a bit shy, cuz i kinda felt they didn't want me around anymore

now im lonely

have met people, actually im socially pretty good. those days, those fun days, were my school days.

now im at college, and you know, it was fun, first month, met lots of people, but then it got dull again, i keep having the same feeling, does anyone want me around?

Having a birthday while quarantined isn't exactly the best thing. But with the cards we were dealt with, it was a pretty darn good birthday. 

My mom got me strawberry cheesecake for dessert and we had chick fil a for dinner. That in itself was great, but my presents were pretty cool too. My sister tries pranking me every year and this year I almost fell for it. I'm a huge tea drinker so she offered to make me tea. She came back with a dark colored mug you can't see through with a hot liquid. I was about to drink it but she started laughing so I knew what she was trying to do. She admitted it's just hot salt water. Haha she didn't get me this year. 

I'm kinda bummed about not being able to see my friends but at least most of them didn't forget to wish me a happy birthday. I love them, they're the absolute best I gotta say.

Anyway, yeah, no one probably cares. However I just wanna wish anyone and everyone who has a quarantined birthday a happy birthday! I know it's not ideal, and I know you probably could have had more, but make the best of it. Do your hair, watch your favorite show, have your favorite dinner. It doesn't matter how you celebrate your birthday but don't let restrictions stop you from having a good one.

105,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

Some people tell me, everyone is different. Some other people tell me we are all interconnected. I wish to help, but I doubt myself. I asked myself, even though I wanted to help, is my way of helping really the correct one? 

It is not good to overthink. It is unwise to not consider how to move forward. I cannot be empty, for I have memories. Some say, listen to your heart. Some say, think methodically, logically.

I'm trying to figure out why it's on opposite extremes, in the hopes of finding the middle ground and going back to normal. However, the thing is, I'm not sure that I'm now standing on a flat terrain. And I'm not sure if anything about my old self remained. Certainly I'm not the same, not after knowing you. I'm now like a ball on a hill, I can't settle on the middle ground if there's no force keeping me there. Or so I thought.

I've always seen my mom as more of a sister though, in the worst way possible. She is incredibly irresponsible and capricious. And of course, the classic narcissism. My brother is almost completely indifferent to any problem that's not his, but he is also starved for affection and approval so he'll go along with anything she says. But when it's just me and him he's easier to deal with. 

Now normally this isn't such a problem since I would normally only see my mom at night since our work schedules are odd and we have dinner and it's usually a good time. But I've been doing home office as has she, so we've been seeing a lot of each other the past few weeks. That has been a problem since every little thing becomes a catalyst for conflict. One major thing, is her aforementioned capriciousness. On a whim, she'll look for any excuse to leave the house. Which is normally fine but we are in the middle of a pandemic and a statewide lockdown. 

I confront her about this and it immediately becomes a one-sided shouting match of her telling me I'm controlling and an asshole. She has also said things like ""You're not my dad.""... yes. From a 56-year-old woman.

I read my internal monologue as a separate person, and at first I thought I did this because the character was actually my anxiety but it's not- it's just my own thoughts. in fifth grade I went through a phase of just absolute garbage. I won't elaborate for your sake but as I came out of it I realized how immature I was, how what looked at the time like my core personality was flawed and unlikable. of course it wasn't my core personality- I was eleven, I wasn't grown up or even close. but the next year I tried to reinvent myself. and I fell flat on my face. I started living in my head more after that, which, unless my self-analysis is deeply flawed, is where my problem originated. I put anything to do with *me* on the back burner. this abstract concept of who I truly was inside was the only thing that mattered; I lived on autopilot because I was so much more comfortable only being honest with myself in my head. I was pretty ok with doing that for years, but then I realized it just might be an issue, so I tried to stop. and I can't. my state in the moment is all I'm aware of- I tried to inhabit my body again and developed a habit we're not going to talk about. I tried to talk about my problems with my friends and was so sarcastic it came off as a joke. I tried to fix myself by talking to a therapist and only made small talk because I can't be honest with anyone about any real emotions or struggles. they're not mine anymore. what do I want? what do I like? what do I struggle with? I have no idea. I'm not sure I even really feel things anymore- I can't cry, I can't remember the last time I more than chuckled, I'm just totally apathetic and bland and *meh.* and I can't even care about that because the nature of my problem prevents me from doing so. anyway.

129,"Hey sub, lately I've been trying to get over my long distance friend. We have s difference in time so we used to have convos in odd times either for me or to that person. We became very good friends and we talked everyday for like 5 months. Im one of those people who sweat a lot even during winters. I just keep on sweating. So as we had not met in real life And I had no idea how they sound or Smell, my brain has put my own scent as theirs ( due to sweat I have a strong scent but I mask it with cologne when I go out but while in home I just live with it). I acted like an asshole and that person stopped talking to me like 2 months ago. Said I created an anxious environment while we talked. Tbh I myself realised I was toxic (probably still am). So I really want to get over about missing that person a lot but my scent reminds me them back. It's fucked up. I try so hard, keeping myself busy even in this isolation period and at some point I catch the scent and it just reminds me of them. How can I get out of this?

134,"Kind of a long post, adding a tl;dr at the end. Talks about s\*cide and SH as well as anor\*xia (not in detail, but still) so please don't read if triggered)

I was in and out of some adolescent psych wards a few months back (SI, EDs, depression, etc), and I met this person, let's call her M. Anyway, the ward is almost full, so there's quite a few people there, in my group it's mostly guys who don't really talk to anyone, a few nice but quiet girls, a few really loud girls, and then M. M starts talking to me and we make friends because I share my markers with her (we were only allowed to have markers), I was working on concept art for my webcomic (mostly character designs, etc), and within a few days she was copying all my art and passing it off as hers. Understandably this pissed me off because she denied it, but it was tolerable since nobody seemed to believe her anyway, and her art style was kind of shitty. I passed it off in my head as her wanting attention because she didn't really have many friends in there, and left it at that, hoping she'd stop.

It got worse. As background, I've struggled with self harm, and have some scarring on my wrists. Not much, but it's pretty noticeable. At the place I was at, there was a rule that you had to wear long sleeves or cover your SH scars if you have them to not trigger others. I had some open wounds at the time, which needed care from staff, so they bandaged up my arms and called it good at that, since everything was covered. Since I'm a private person, and really didn't want to trigger anyone, I wore a baggy sweatshirt over it. Great. Problem solved, right?

Wrong. The second day I was there she started berating me for being an attention whore because I had a panic attack in the hallway, and I ended up attempting to h\*ng myself with the sweatshirt. It was taken away, exposing my bandages. She apologized for screaming at me, and said she was psychotic and that's why. I forgave her.

She started following me when the nurses took me to change my bandages, and then would beg them to give her the same ""treatment"" as me so she could cover up her scars. The nurse very politely explained, several times, that since she had no open wounds, and had a sweatshirt she could cover her scars with, they couldn't give her them. She lost it after maybe the third repetition of this, yelling at me and the nurse about how I was ""faking selfh\*rm for attention"" and ""showing off"", along with other things. The nurse told her no, again, and she stormed off. When I got back to group, she had gotten some other nurse to bring her a box of mini bandaids, and was in the process of covering her arms in them to ""hide her c\*ts"". The nurse I was with came back and took away the remaining band aids, telling M that if she had open wounds, she would need to come with her and show them to a doctor. M refused, saying that she didn't have to prove anything, and that *I* should go show the doctor, since ""I was obviously faking it"".

Nearly the exact same charade happened every day for the next week, and she kept asking for more and more ""medical care"". She also kept yelling at me, and asking for ""proof"" and to see my wounds. It escalated to the point where she physically tried to take off my bandages. We were separated and she was moved to a different group. I had been struggling with an eating d\*sorder for a while, and they were going to move me to the ED group. I had been protesting, and that's why I had stayed in M's group for so long, but they finally moved me involuntarily. M immediately requested to be moved to the ED group.

The staff refused, on the grounds that she did not, in fact, have an eating d\*sorder. M threw another tantrum, saying that they were refusing her treatment and that her ""anorexia"" was going to kill her and she needed help. She would scream at her psychiatrist in the hall about how she had anorexia and he needed to give her the diagnosis because she ""just knew"". He very politely told her, after offering repeatedly to have the session in private, that she did not meet any of the criteria. She stormed off.

This was when she tried to physically assault me by trying to pull out my nasogastric feeding tube. She was moved to a different facility after that, and I didn't see her again.

Now she's going to the same therapy clinic as me, spreading rumors, and harassing my friends there.

fuck.

Tl;dr: this girl harassed me for weeks in the psych ward about being a faker and then attacked me because she wanted to be in the ED ward instead of me. Now she goes to my therapy clinic.",02Apr2020,1

140,One time when I was young like 4 or 5 I was carrying a worm around and I was filled with glee and then all of a sudden there was this pool of brown mystery in my hands and I asked my dad what it was and he said it was poop and I scream cried running through my backyard after throwing the worm to the ground. Complete and utter fucking betrayal. On both of our parts honestly. I’ve since regretted my decision regarding the worm and its doom. It must have been in distress.

141," So recently I was thrown out of my parents house and I moved in with my girlfriend who lives with her parents. I'm 23 and she's 25 and we've been together for over 2 and a half years. For most of our relationship, I had to keep a distance from her because she needed space due to a tramatic event that happened with her. Because of said event she has trust issues(especially with guys) and was afraid to tell me what happened to her. I was willing to give her the space she needed and for the first couple years we just went on a date about once a week or every other week depending on how she felt. However about 6 months ago she came out and told me what happened to her and why things were the way they were and I said it was fine and she was worth it. Since then she got attached to me and we started seeing eachother frequently and I can show her physical affection now that's more than a hug or kiss. I've been talking to her trying to make sure she's OK with me being with her as much as I am, especially now that we live together in a world that's shutdown for coronavirus. She said since she finally trust me she doesn't just tolerate my pressence but she actually wants me to be with her all the time. She used to have to lock herself in her room by herself if she was having a bad day or if she had a flashback, but now she tells me when it happens and she will lock us in her room away from her parents so I can brush her hair and play with earings to calm her down. I've been concerned because of how much space I used to have to give her and it seemed like it was overnight that I was able to see her more. I'm also concerned because I feel I am a bit clingy, but she has told me she likes it.

I was pretty comfortable with just asking her what she wants me to do with her and when she can handle this and when I need to give her space(granted she never ask for space anymore). But her mom keeps telling me to find new hobbies to give her room. My girlfriend has fought with her mom about it, stating that she's an adult and if she wants me there I will be there. She fought with her mom about it because I talked to her about it. I was worried I was smothering her and she needed space and her kind nature didn't want to tell me that. When we talked about it she said it's nothing like that and her mom is just worried because of the incident. The other day I wanted to go the doctor with her because it was a new doctor and she was scared so she wanted me to be with her because she's comfortable with me. Her mom absolutely hated it and said she would go instead of me if she needs someone to go. My girlfriend told her that it's only she gets to choose who goes to the doctor with her and took me with her against her moms wishes.

I want to make it clear that I'm very grateful for her mom. She has no issue letting me live in the same house as her daughter and is only asking a few hundred for rent. She's also helped me get unemployment and medicaid. She also plans to help me get on disability when coronavirus winds down. I don't have any ill will tward her, in fact I am eternally grateful for what she's doing for me. I'm just afraid I'm either getting between her and her daughter or my girlfriend needs space and she's not telling me but her mom is.

TLDR: My girlfriend says I can cling to her and her mom is telling me to back off. How should I handle the situation?",02Apr2020,1

152,"I'm writing this because I've gotten myself completely addicted to a cam girl. It's developed over the last year and a bit. Before I met her I had never paid for any kind of porn or cam sites before but something about her made me feel her energy and I was instantly hooked. 


So starting last summer I started to think about where she might be in the country because I know she's in the same country as me. I made this a personal challenge to find out where she is and learn her real name and such. By the way, despite my username, there has never at any point been any dangerous intentions here. 


So over a number of months I first found her city, that was by her own mistake in trusting me in a indirect way where I was able to put two and two together and figure out what city she's in. 

From there she was often talking about the kind of place she lives in, not even going to mention it here because I don't want her to read this and know who I am which is possible. She also took some snaps of her at the gym. I being obsessed with her at this point looked on google maps at pictures of EVERY gym in her city, and finally put two and two together to where I narrowed it down and found out which gym she goes to. From there I looked on google maps for similar places to what she describes she lives in that is near by since she mentioned she lives only a short drive from the gym. 

I was then able to find her place, it's not a house so I don't know the exact suite but I was able to recognize it from one of the videos she has for sale. Yes this is fucking ridiculous now right? Can you imagine if somebody with bad intentions did this? 

So at this point I began saving this information and listening to her every time I seen her online and gathering more data about her. At one point she was selling a phone, she mentioned she was selling it on a specific classifieds site however I know for a fact no body in this country uses that to sell things so I searched on marketplace on Facebook to see if I could find her listing it on there and sure enough I found the exact phone and the seller looked exactly like her. So I now at this point had her REAL name and location. WHAT THE FUCK RIGHT? 

This wasn't the end of it, I've done further digging, found her parents address, found what school she went to, what she's studying in uni (she's becoming a teacher, no wonder she never talks about it).

Unfortunately, as I've found more info about her, my obsession has grown further, I've located her real instagram account so I find it funny when she talks on cam about going with X friend and I'm the only one who knows what that friend actually looks like, she also lies about what time zone she's in so I find that amusing. 

Most recently I've found public records about her that indicate she lies about her birthday (only by a few days) and changed her last name a couple of years ago. 

I really think my obsession with her is getting a bit out of control, I want to limit myself to when I see her but should I just tell her I know all this about her? She considers me to be one of her regulars and definitely has some kind of trust for me. I wouldn't want to scare her and I wouldn't want her to ban me from her room. 

As mentioned earlier, I've never had any dangerous intentions whatsoever, I'd never make this info public since I know there is people out there that would actually have bad intentions.",02Apr2020,1

168,"Two and a half years ago, I met my first and current boyfriend. He is everything a girl could ever dream of--a tall, shaggy haired dream boat who plays guitar and has the voice of an angel. He's a good cook, a cyclist, and has excellent taste in dad sweaters. We often get lost in conversation about politics, philosophy, life for hours. He loves my curls and my ability to knit and finds all of my insecurities endearing. The relationship was just perfect.

A few months later, we became official, and I found out about his exes. There was one in particular who I became fixed on, he was in a relationship with her for a total of three years from when he was 15-18. I'm Arab and she's Turkish so we looked.... a little similar? But she is far more beautiful. She has softer curls, bigger eyes, a smaller nose, and is skinnier. She sings so beautifully and plays guitar and has close friendships. She introduced him to his favorite bands that he STILL raves about. They got to be in plays together, he had his first kiss with her, lost his virginity to her in a fort they made among lit candles and with one of their favorite bands playing softly in the background (I found out about this because I discovered his reddit and was reading through some comments he made).

When I was 16 I was a very sad, sore loser who spent far too much time locked in my room on the internet. I, in comparison lost my virginity to a guy I only had a few dates with who ghosted me a few months later. I have coarse curls, was told I am the curviest girl he's ever dated (which is funny because I'm pretty skinny), and have smaller eyes (although they are somewhat big). I am average looking at best but what hurts the most is that I sing like a dying cat and can't play a musical instrument even though those are things I've always wanted to do.

So of course, I became enamored with her. Flitting between wanting to be her and hating her. I stalked her on social media constantly. I took control for a little while and blocked her on all social media before the curiosity consumed me all over again a few months later. She is better than me in almost every way. I talked about this with my boyfriend and he disagrees and thinks I am 100x better in every way, but I don't believe him. I want to be her so badly I cry. I talked about this with a therapist who considered the idea that she is a girl just like me, a girl who I may even have a lot in common with and who I could've been friends with in a parallel universe. I considered the idea of that and followed her on social media. This weirded her out (for a very valid reason!) and made the stalking/jealousy even worse. This is ridiculous but in my darkest moments I pray that I can somehow become her and have her life.

My self image is shattered. I used to think I was halfway decent but now I feel like I shouldn't even exist. Our beautiful relationship has been overshadowed by this woman. I would like this extreme jealousy to stop. I'd like to see myself the way I saw myself before I ever knew she existed.",02Apr2020,1
169," 

The first condition essentially necessary for happiness has always been admitted by all men to be a life in which the link between him and nature is not destroyed – that is, a life in the open air, in the sunshine, in communion with nature, plants and animals. Men have always considered being deprived of this as the greatest misfortune that could befall them. Prisoners feel this privation above all others. And now consider what the life of those who live according to the teaching of the world is. The more successful their worldly career is, the further they are from all that is true happiness. The higher the worldly prosperity they have attained, the less sunshine do they enjoy, the fewer are the fields, woods, and animals they see. Many, indeed almost all, women dwelling in towns live to old age without having seen the rising of the sun more than once or twice in their lives. They have never seen the fields and woods, except through the windows of their coaches or of railway carriages; not only have they never brought up and tended cows, horses, or poultry, but also they have no idea even how animals grow and live. These people see stuffs, stones, and wood worked by human hands, and do not even see them in the light of the sun, but in an artificial light. They hear the noise of machinery, cannons, or musical instruments; they inhale strong scents and tobacco smoke; their enfeebled digestions crave stimulating food that is neither fresh nor savory. Nor are they nearer to nature even when traveling from one place to another. They travel shut up in boxes. Wherever they go, be it into the country or abroad, the same curtains hide the light of the sun from their eyes; footmen, coachmen, and watchmen prevent all communication between them and nature. Wherever they go they are, like prisoners, deprived of this condition that is so necessary for happiness. As prisoners find consolation in a blade of grass that grows in the yard of their prison, or a spider, or a mouse, so do these men and women find consolation, from time to time, in keeping half withered plants on their window sills, or in parrots, lap dogs, or monkeys, the care of which they leave to others. 

A second indubitable condition necessary for happiness is labor – congenial, free labor, physical labor, which gives a man a good appetite and sound, invigorating sleep. And, again, the greater the prosperity a man has attained, according to a worldly estimate, the further he is from this second condition, essentially necessary for happiness. All the ‘fortunate’ of this world, the great dignitaries and rich men, are either as completely deprived of labor as prisoners are, and struggle unsuccessfully against ill health, which is the result of the absence of physical labor, and still more unsuccessfully against the ennui to which they are a prey (I say ‘unsuccessfully,’ for work is a source of pleasure only when it is necessary), or they have work to do that they hate, as, for instance, our bankers, attorneys, generals, and bureaucrats. I say it is work they hate because I never yet met one among them who liked his work, and who found as much pleasure in it as a stable boy does in clearing away the snow before his master’s house. All these so-called fortunate beings have either no work to do or work that they hate; they are, indeed, in much the same position as a galley slave. 

A third condition essentially necessary for happiness is family life. And again, the further advanced men are in worldly prosperity, the less accessible that happiness is for them. Most of them are adulterers, and voluntarily renounce all family ties. Even if they are not adulterers, they consider children as a burden rather than a joy, and try by all possible means to make their unions sterile. If they have children, they take no joy in them. They are obliged to confide them to others, for the most part to complete strangers; at first they are left to the care of foreign nurses or governesses, then sent to some 66 government school, and the children grow up as miserable as their parents19, and often have but one feeling toward their parents: the wish for their death, that they may inherit their property. These men are not prisoners, but the result is more painful than that entire separation from all family ties to which a prisoner is condemned. 

A fourth condition essentially necessary for happiness is a free, friendly communication with all men. And again, the higher the step on which a man stands in the world, the further he is from this condition. The higher your position, the narrower and closer is the circle of men with whom you can have any communication, and the lower in intellectual and moral development are the few persons who form this spellbound circle, out of which there is no escape. The whole world is open to the peasant and his wife. If one million men refuse to have anything to do with him, there are eighty million working men left like himself, with whom, from Archangelsk to Astrachan, he enters immediately into the closest, most brotherly communication, without waiting to be called upon or introduced. There are, for a functionary and his wife, hundreds of men who are their equals; but their superiors do not admit them into their circle, and they are cut off from all the lower classes. There may be ten fashionable families for a rich man of the world and his wife, but they are cut off from all the rest. Bureaucrats and very wealthy men and their families may find about ten friends as important and as rich as themselves. The circle of emperors and kings is still more restricted. Isn’t that called solitary confinement, when a prisoner can only have communication with two or three jailers?

 The fifth and last condition essentially necessary for happiness is health and a painless death. And again, the higher a man stands on the social scale, the further he is from it. Take, for instance, a moderately rich man and his wife, and a well-to-do countryman and his wife; in spite of hunger and the hard work – which is the peasant’s lot through the inhumanity of others, and not through any fault of his own – you will find, if you compare the two, that the lower men stand on the social scale the healthier they are, and the higher they stand the weaker they are in health. Recall to your minds all the rich men and their wives whom you have ever known, and those whom you know at present, and you will see that they almost all suffer from ill health. A healthy man among them – one who does not take medicine continually, or at least periodically every summer – is as great an exception as is a sick man among the working classes. Almost all the ‘fortunate beings’ are toothless, gray haired, or bald at the age when a working man is still in the full vigor of his manhood. They are almost all sufferers from nervous diseases, dyspepsia or worse, from over-eating, from drunkenness or depravity; and those who do not die young spend half their lives under medical treatment, using frequent injections of morphine, and becoming shriveled cripples, unable to maintain themselves; living on like parasites. Think of what the deaths of these men are: one has shot himself, another’s body has rotted from disease, another again has died in his old age from a too frequent use of medicines; one has died in a drunken fit, another of gluttony, etc. All perish, one after the other, for the world’s sake. And the crowd crawls after them like martyrs in search of suffering and death.   ",02Apr2020,1
170,"Ok so one of my biggest problems is the doubt I have about the abuse. I don’t know if what happened constitutes assault and I have been having doubts about it. So I am asking for the opinion of people on this subreddit because it just is really bothering me.

So when I was 12 I was at my uncles cottage and I was in the lake with the neighbour’s kid who was ~3-4 years older than me I think, and we were play fighting kind of. He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, it may have only been once I don’t remember. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop. It didn’t last very long I don’t think and he didn’t really do anything but touch and grab me. Does that count as sexual assault? I don’t know anymore. It’s just really overwhelming. I hate feeling the doubt along with the pain. It makes it so much worse.",02Apr2020,1

172,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence",02Apr2020,1
173,"On January 31, I was rushing around to get ready for vacation. I remembered thinking I should pop into Canadian Tire to pick up some N95 masks “just in case” but figured I was being paranoid. I did, however, find an hour to get my toenails shellacked before my 2-week vacation.

I spent that whole vacation watching the news. And when i got home mid February, I ordered masks on Amazon, slated to arrive before April 9.

I still have that shellac on one of  my big toes. My race is to see if things go back to normal before the shellac on that toenail grows completely out.",02Apr2020,1

I'm positive there will be over 20 people there. Also, they dont have any soap where the party id going to be (a relative's house).",02Apr2020,1
177,"Not much to my story. Not much unique, anyway. I married a guy I thought was great. And then he turned into a sadistic, controlling monster soon after marriage. It took me having his child to realize I needed to get away from him. I couldn’t care for a newborn if I was sobbing all day every day. That, and video games were his priority. To the point that our son choked on spit up and turned blue, more than once, while his dad sat two feet away and kept playing. It wasn’t safe for either of us. So I took our son and disappeared for almost 5 years, too scared to go after him. But I finally filed it and I’m so excited to finally be free of all the pain and drama. There is nothing more liberating than putting yourself first after you’ve lived in darkness and isolation under the thumb of another for so long.

I can finally say the words, “I feel good” and mean them. And goddamnit, I FEEL GOOD!",02Apr2020,1
