0,They all are a certain type of ‚Äúway‚Äù as well.,14Nov2020,1
1,"Roughly 2 years ago I was struggling with a lot of mental health problems, and I was rapidly running out of good days. I wasn‚Äôt in a position to get help, and I ended up browsing some rather dark corners of the internet. One particular forum I found was on the topic of suicide. I don‚Äôt even remember what forum it was, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt Reddit or 4chan, it was very much the backwater of the internet. The forum poster had a very strange tone. Most posts about suicide open with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do it‚Äù. There was none of that here. It simply stated that if you were so selfish to kill yourself, the least you could do is make it look like a genuine accident so there isn‚Äôt any burden on your family. It was....strange. It was so crass and cold that it made me genuinely uncomfortable. I guess I was expecting a pep talk, and instead I got this. Below the original post was a comment that went something along the lines of ‚Äúthanks for the advice! I didn‚Äôt even think about what my family would be going through! Going on a skydiving trip soon, I think I‚Äôm gonna forget to pull my parachute!‚Äù I immediately clicked on his profile and that was his most recent post, and it was about 1 year ago. For a brief moment I snapped out of it. I saw the pointlessness of ending that way. I saw that life was so much more than what I had thought it was. I still think about it a lot. I really hope he pulled that parachute. I really hope he‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs quite possible the only reason I‚Äôm living is because of him.",14Nov2020,1
2,"In the process of trying to find a job. My girlfriend has one but since I‚Äôve lost mine due to covid 19, we have to pay her mother rent. I am grateful to have a roof over my head. I‚Äôve just wanted something besides snacks these last months. Yes we have food, we have chips and soda and candy. I really have not had a filling meal since I‚Äôve lost my job and I‚Äôd rather have a roof over my head then food and I‚Äôm using my savings to put gas in the car and cover other expenses and it‚Äôs running out very quick. I do have interviews all next week so I‚Äôm hopeful . I was wondering if a stranger  can or wants to send a pizza to another stranger. I‚Äôd gratefully appreciate it .",14Nov2020,1
3,"Ok.  I don't know why I'm thinking like this, but I feel like when I make a mistake by accident, I start to get this mindset that certain people will start to see me differently.  

Let's say there is a coworker that sees me as a great coworker to look up for in any situation, even to a point where we get along as friends.   

I don't know why I'm thinking this, but today when everything got busy, I've been making certain mistakes when the coworker asked me for help.  The problem is that I have a hard time hearing people wearing masks and I'm embarrassed to ask to repeat themselves.  The coworker wasn't upset, but just repeated the instructions, in which I knew exactly what to do.  I don't know why I'm thinking this, but the coworker didn't even talk to be at all for the rest of the day for help.  Maybe because I just have a mindset of assuming that they already see me as a employee that's messing up and it has nothing to do with me.  Don't get me wrong, I learn from my mistakes. 

So Reddit, is it just assumptions and how can I overcome these thoughts?",14Nov2020,1
4,"FUCK CANCER!!!

Taken way too young (48) by metastatic breast cancer.  Her mother died on this day (yeah, on her daughter's birthday) 2 years ago as well, from metastatic lung cancer (AFAIK, ex's mom never smoked).  Saw my ex at the service for her mom a week or so after her mom's death, we made plans to get together after the 1st of the year and catch up.  She seemed fine then, but didn't live to see Christmas.  My wife and I were friends with her, my ex and I divorced in '96, the past was the past.  Oddly enough, the first year I knew my ex, 1992, her birthday fell on a Friday also, and being Friday the 13th, we got a good laugh out of it.

12,"I am independent adult.

But I was born in an authoritarian country that doesn't respect your rights, you are just garbage... in that society I faired worse than usual, for being, little gay and poor.

So I migrate, I had to fight and fight hard for my right to work, many times immigration would take away my job. I had to fight for my right to healthcare I was paying for, I had to fight for my freedom to roam, I had to fight for my right to rent a property, I had to fight hard to do basic things.

Because you see, what might be a right for you, is a privilege for me, and people will ensure to make me realize that; and make me struggle to attain such privileges, and constantly test me.

Then my country of origin revoked my right of identity; because why not; yet another legal battle to recover the ""privilege"".

And then because I am a dumbass who confused two numbers, I filled a form wrongly, and since I am expected absolute perfection, I lost my right, no wait, my privilege to work, all because I flipped two goddamn numbers; and I might just lose all the remaining privileges; because I have broken the law by flipping two numbers, I am a criminal - These aren't my words, that's what they told me.

I am just tired of this, the world and all its rules, its forms, institutions, courts, so called justice. People just like to step on top of others, to impose their wills, to feel morally superior.

Because everything I've worked so hard for, isn't the product of my hard work, it's a privilege they have granted me. My own success isn't my own, and I am inferior to their own kind - and I am not making this up, they say these things.

The whole system is such garbage; governments, institutions, justice, it's all garbage. While some are full blown authoritharian, the other systems are just jelaous of such, they desire and wish to oppress people, so they make rules, and pick targets; because that's what people enjoy, feeling superior and dictating what you can do or not, dictating what you can say or not, dictating what you can think.

There's no freedom, only the illusion of, and it is so fragile. I am so tired.",14Nov2020,1

The earth was created billions of years ago as an oblate spheroid that spins while orbiting around a star on a tilted axis.

18,"(TW: animal death, emotional trauma)



Earlier this year, I was with my bunny through her death throes, whispering her name and trying my best to comfort her. Now I see her reflected in every animal in pain. üò≠ Unfortunately, this year has been a particularly gruesome one since her passing and I'm struggling with it tonight. 

i. During summer, I caused an accidental inferno, killing pups and injuring their mother mouse by overlooking the little grass den she had made deep under the grill in our barbeque. She got one of her babies out, but was burned and ran off. I placed the pup where I had last seen her, but they did not reunite. 

ii. Not long after, I was driving dad's new car (fittingly, it's rather hearse-like) when I swerved to avoid a bird walking into the road. I succeeded, but my new trajectory took me into her partner, previously unseen. I felt a small thud and looked in the mirror to see only a cloud of feathers where love and belonging had been seconds before. 

iii. Tonight I had to mercy kill a mouse caught in a trap but quite alive, thrashing. I didn't know what to do so I grabbed a nearby ornamental piece of driftwood and bludgeoned it while apologizing over and over. 

Life is inherently entropic, inevitably chaotic. We enjoy and share in existence only for a short time: this defines us. We're blessed and burdened with trying to derive meaning from randomness... But aside from the math invented to find it, the formula is arbitrary. There's no secret we can discover that will make humankind understand our significance in the universe, because significance is a human construct. The brain that named itself has successfully defined who, what, where, when and even how we are... But there is no answer to why. Our meaning is unique to each of us.

I used to work in IT and didn't even make 20 an hour as a NOC technician. I worked so hard for so little. I thought big money was just around the corner but I could never quite get there. I was **REALLY** shooting towards becoming a network engineer and making huge money. I never made it though.

I eventually quit IT and went into a job in the real estate world (don't want to say the specifics). My first month I made 5 figures. I couldn't believe how much money started to come my way. I work less than 40 hours a week for more than 10k a month. After I saw how big my first paycheck was I felt depressed. Not only was I suffering from imposter syndrome but I just felt empty.

31,"I've always acted on my impulses, and in the moment it literally feels like my judgement is clouded, everything is blurred, and my focus is focused on one thing and one thing only.

True, you might say that's an incredible thing. For instance when I have an impusle to study, I end up going at it for hours and being the most productive I have ever been.

But the down side of this, is being rash when it comes to more personal matters. I have always rushed into relationships because my feelings take over my logical thinking and my body. I have always been the one to run around, jumping from one person to the other out of a need to constantly have new stimulant and change. I have been that person that spends money irrationally, then regrets it two minutes later.

I can feel my life slowly creeping into the same old pit I struggled so much to get out of, but I do not know how to slow down the momentum of it all. This is terrifying me. 

Is the solution to go cold turkey on everything? Is the solution to take a week off and not interact with anyone? Is the solution to keep this going? Is the solution to never express my frustration to my friends and loved ones?

35,"I posted this on r/college because I thought maybe it would fit better there considering it‚Äôs regarding the topic of college but since they technically don‚Äôt allow rants I guess I‚Äôll post it here in case it‚Äôs deleted. 

I know that dropping out is a legitimate option, and lots of people do it. But I feel like if I drop out I'm just giving up. It's not like I've found a perfect job or career for me where I don't need a degree and drop out for that reason. I'm just a 2nd year college student. I only work at a grocery store deli weekends only because otherwise I'm a full time student. But I really don't think college is for me.

I was forced by my family to go into college under the idea that if you don't go to college you'll be stuck working at McDonald's the rest of your life. I know that idea is a bunch of bullshit because there's plenty of people who have led successful careers without going to college. I wanted to take a gap year after high school because I didn't feel I was ready for college just yet. But my mom said no, and forced me to go anyways.

That first semester I majored in architecture. I thought it was what I wanted to do; I had an interest in buildings, and after previously looking over all of the majors my university offers, that was the only one that stood out to me. Come the end of the semester, I had stopped going to my architecture studio class. I felt left out my members of my studio group. Everyone was making things much better than I was. I had no real will to continue in that class anymore.

I ended up dropping that major and going exploratory the next semester. That's when I discovered a new major coming from a satellite campus that had just expanded to the main one, where I was. It was an animation &amp; game design major, which focuses on 3D modeling, animation, digital design, etc. I figured since I like video games and computers it might work out well for me. That's what I've been doing this semester, and I'm starting to feel the same way as I did my architecture class. I don't feel like I'm into it. Everyone else in the class is making things much better than I am. I still have a good grade-- I think the professor must grade based on whether you do the work, not how good you do it. But at this point I'm just half-assing my assignments. I don't feel like I'm actually learning anything.

Some people go to college because they want the ""college experience."" Yeah, well I haven't had that. My first semester I was in a dorm room by myself (by choice; thank god I didn't have to share with someone). I thought I was going to reinvent myself after high school. Back then, I was quiet, not sociable outside my small circle of friends, and never talked unless spoken to or when I needed to for class. I never did any clubs, never went to sports games, school dances including prom, etc. I was never interested in any of it (I actually couldn't go to prom anyways because you needed a date, but I didn't want to go anyways).

Well, I didn't change in college. I never left my room except for class. I didn't do clubs because I went home on weekends (I lived in a dorm, but home was 50 minutes away, couldn't have my car though). No one ever really came out of their rooms on my dorm floor. I never made any friends and barely saw the two I found out also went to my university from high school. I mainly stuck to talking with old friends online, which is really what I always did.

Then COVID happened.

We all got sent home in March. I was so glad, I hated living on campus. My fall semester I made it so it was all online, otherwise I would've needed to pay for a dorm room to literally be there one day of the week for a class I was previously scheduled for that wasn't online for that one meeting time. I did the same thing when I scheduled for spring. But because everything is online, I feel like I'm learning nothing. Well, for most classes I prefer to do it online because they're bullshit core classes that need not exist and I can just google the answers to. But with my current 3D modeling class, even though I watch the videos my professor posts and follow along, I still feel like I've learned hardly anything at all.

The same goes for a Java programming class I have to take. I was never into coding and am only taking it because it's required for the degree, but even though I follow along with the videos, I feel like I learn nothing. Well, maybe I would if I read the textbooks. But I cannot be made to read 40-50 pages per class each week of nothing but text. Hell, I can hardly read story books, I am so burnt out of reading walls of text.

I'm just feeling like maybe college isn't my thing. But dropping out and not knowing what to do with my life isn't my only problem. I'm not in any debt-- I haven't taken any loans to pay for college. It's all been paid for via FAFSA and my mom. She's pretty well off, owning her own company. I don't know how much she makes, but it's enough to cover what FAFSA doesn't and still buy a $50K Ram here, turn around and trade it in on an $85K Lincoln there, etc.

She's paying for my college, and expects me to go through and finish it. If I dropped out, it would absolutely piss her off. I can't imagine what she would do then. Essentially she would've wasted $20-some thousand by now (luckily because I'm not living on campus, all of my classes were covered by FAFSA this semester). I don't know if she would expect me to pay it back, which I sure as hell can't do. Also, back when I dropped out of my architecture major, I didn't tell my mom about it. I figured she'd be furious. The day I went home for winter break, she asked me how everything was going, I just said ""fine"" like usual. But she knew. The day we went back, she said, ""when are you going to tell me that you dropped out of architecture?"" She was mad about that, and on top of it that I didn't tell her. I can't imagine what she'd do if I fully dropped out of college.

And then there's my dad. I haven't lived with him since he divorced my mom when I was 3. He sometimes visits for a couple days or a week or two per year since he's busy with being full time in the military. But recently when he came to visit in August, I told him about my major. He was so excited and supportive of me taking it, saying how it was the future, one of the biggest upcoming industries, etc. If I drop out, I'm going to extremely disappoint him. Not only that, I'll disappoint everyone in my family to the point where I'm pretty sure I'll become estranged.

I just don't know what to do. I don't feel any motivation to keep going through college. But if I drop out, I don't know what to do. I don't want to disappoint my whole family. I don't know how I can go on. Nothing seems to interest me enough to make a career out of it. And of the things that I do have interest in, either you can't really make a career out of it, it's very high risk, or unrealistic. I like video games, but what sort of job can you make out of it? Streaming? I already know I'd be a bad streamer, and if my mom saw me drop out to do that, she would kill me. The only other stuff I regularly do is watch TV shows, movies, or Youtube videos, and of course I can't make a living doing that. I like cars, and if I could do anything I would like to try and design cars and manufacture them as my own brand, but that's unrealistic for someone like me to do. The only thing I have left is maybe writing. I've been wanting to write a story for a long time now, coming up with tons of ideas and whatnot. But hardly any authors become successful, and it's not something I can just bank on happening.

I don't know what to do. But I'm feeling ever more so each day my time in college is just a waste of it.",14Nov2020,1

39,"As the year of Unus Annus about to end, almost 20 minutes until they're gone forever, I just want to say what I've learned.

Unus Annus is just the beginning. Preparation to make you be ready for the real world. We know that Unus Annus, from the beginning, will end soon. It's something that- is unlike real life, most of the time. The timer is invisible. Yet the clock is always ticking. Loved ones could be gone in a surprise, Plans could get immediately canceled, You can't always prepare yourself. 

Sometimes, You just need to be ready for whatever's going to happen anytime and prepare yourself. Because who knows what's going to happen. Don't procrastinate

It's odd that most people really care about things when things are almost over. You always think you have time, so you'll say you'll do it later. In life, you always think that things still take a lot of time, that time is always there. But the thing is, you don't. You never know when the end is coming. And because of that, it's important to treat every hour as your last hour, because although we think it's not true, who knows when that thought becomes true.",14Nov2020,1
40,"I'm a pretty nonconfrontational person, but there was something about this person, the way they just name called and absolutely gas lit (is that the correct term?) the HECK out of the person they commented under. Now, in my opinion, hates a strong word, but that person comes wayyy to close to that line I draw. So basically, I wasn't defending the original commentors point of view, I was just tell them that screaming at others over their opinions is wrong. Of course they came at me, but I think I handled it pretty well! I was just passive aggressive enough to make them get their titties in a twist!

41,"I'm an introvert with some level of social anxiety for sure, although never went for a diagnosis. I had previously struggled depression, anxiety and self doubt which got better as I faced successes in my personal and professional life. I work long hours, and even in my weekends, I prefer to work on upskilling myself. I have started to enjoy my own company and I prefer spending time by myself alone. The only other people that I don't mind spending some time is my girlfriend, or 2-3 of my close friends.

While I've never been much of an outgoing person, recently I've noticed that I have started resenting being in happy groups during festive or celebratory occassions. I've subconsciously started to become hostile towards happy people in my speech and behaviour, and get annoyed that they get to be happy. That said, I've things going good for me right now, and don't really have anything to be resentful about other's happiness. I'm making myself even busier in order to avoid spending time with my parents and friends and even I have to be around people, I remain aloof so as to not start resenting them. I'm in my mid 20s right now and I'm afraid that if I continue this way, I'll become a sour, unhappy person very soon.",14Nov2020,1
42,"Hi all, i am 33 yo this month, on the 23rd November, and to tell you the truth, i dont care about anything anymore, i am like i am gonna be 33 and my brain goes ""yeah big woop, everyone can be 33"" it s my first post in reddit, as a serious post , i think i posted some posts about some games before when i was trying to start a youtube channel. well i am not even sure it s the proper subreddit for this, but i think i need help and have noone to turn to, my parents already have three other children younger and each have their own shit. so i dont want to bother them, i dont really have freinds, well some on internet i consider friends, but no-one close enough to meet and talk. 

so here i go:
i dont care anymore. not about myself, or my future, i work eat and sleep. i dont have much money and i dont really care much for saving or anything, yeah i used to want to save and get a decent pc rig, was happy when the 3000 series and the new amd came up these past months, but now i really dont care much for a new pc.
i work 2 jobs, they are very easy and pay well and to tell you the truth it s the only thing that makes me wanna get out of bed, i get to talk to customers in both jobs via phone and face to face and i love that, but then i also started not caring much for this too. i dont have a girlfriend and i meet many ladies of all types and kinds everyday due to work, but i dont seem to even want to engage them for anything beside work and that s it, it s not that i am shy or anything, i am decent at picking up girls, but nowadays even if the girl is super hot and throws herself at me, i am really not interested at all. i used to want to have kids, not so much now.
i really dont care for anything anymore, nothing brings me joy and nothing make me sad, i used to get scared of some ghost vids on youtube, dont feel a thing anymore. i still laugh at some funny vids here and there but it s getting to be very rare and far between. here is the kicker, porn doesn't do it for me either watch 5 sec then i go ""ah who cares"" zip my pants up and turn pc off. same for hentai or anything really. a girl literally flashed me a month ago in a club and i wasn't fazed (hot body and all, nothing)
am i what they call asexual now . i though i might be gay, nope any other dick beside mine make me wanna throw up. i smoke cigarettes, now i do it just out of reflex, didn't buy cigs for almost a week now, not even craving one. 

what s wrong with me.

43,"I(F) have feelings for my friend/coworker(F). I've been working with her for a little over a year now and we've gotten to be pretty good friends. But as we've started working together more and more and getting to know each other, I've been coming to the realization that I have feelings. I like to be in her company and it's something I look forward to when I know she is working on a day that I am. I think about her all the time! When I'm driving to and leaving work, and when I'm doing random things. She is always on my mind. She's someone who you meet in your life and you automatically click with; someone who you want to keep in your life. And this is something I've taken notice of from the beginning. I'm an introvert and I like to be alone; I enjoy it. I like to be in other people's company from time to time, but spending time by myself is something I prefer. When I'm with her though, It's like the same feeling I get when I'm alone. I am comfortable, I am 100% myself, and I am really happy. When I'm with her, and when she's talking about anything, I look at her in awe. 

 Realizing this is frustrating, I'm a lesbian and she is straight, and I can't say anything/I don't want to say anything. I don't want it to be weird between us because I genuinely love being around her. I realize that now that I have these feelings I'm in trouble. And I just know that even when we go our separate ways she will be one of those people who will randomly pop up in my head. Even if it's years from now, I know that I will randomly think of her and wonder and how she's doing.",14Nov2020,1

51," ^(Since I can't post a rant on) /r/rant^(...)

Oh look, yet another theophobic, profanity-laden screed on your Facebook page. How amazing of you, that makes your third one this month. It's too bad you have never, not once in your pathetic life, turned your literary energies to *anything* but a continual eulogy of your supposedly-misspent youth at the hands of your ""oppressive"" parental units.

Except...you were *never* oppressed. You literally do not know the meaning of the word, nor could you define it if your worthless life were hanging in the balance. The fact that your parents insisted you participate in the relevant religious holidays and events instead of letting you play Super Mario all day is not some past evil that needs to be reconciled. CPS did not need to take you away from being ""indoctrinated"". You do not need to ""advocate"" for any children who are ""in my position right now"", as if you had the *faintest* idea what is and is not good for a child.

So your parents made you learn Hebrew, so the fuck what? If you were Hispanic, you'd be whining about them making you learn Spanish. Try thanking them for at least giving you a useful life skill in the midst of their religious traditions.

So you had to go to the synagogue instead of sit at home playing Halo. *Boo fucking hoo, poor little you*. Newsflash, ***boy***: since the dawn of time, children of all religions the world over have been upset when mommy drags them away from playtime to sing to Buddha or Jesus or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The difference is that most those children GROW THE HELL UP.

**You** clearly haven't. Neither have any of the members of your circle-'o-losers Facebook group, one of whom posted about being banned from an incel website *for complaining too often about his past life*. Let THAT sink in, if anything can get through the battleship armor that is your skull.

And no, for the last time, I will not join in your oxygen-and-data-wasting diatribes even if we were once childhood friends. I'm sure that in years long past, i too would have rather read comic books than the Bible on Sundays. But I quit *bitching* about it before I even graduated high school. Partly because I had developed the mental capacity to understand that parents, within reason, have the right to make their children participate in their cultural/religious heritage.

I won't even bother to tell you about the job you didn't get after the HR director took a look at your social media profile, because I know it wouldn't do any good. You won't learn from it, you won't take down your text-diarrhea or even make them private, you certainly won't try to reconcile with the parents *who you are going to sorely miss one day.*

If your parents had been the Jewish equivalent of the Duggars you would have some genuine reason to complain. But they weren't. Not even close. And the fact that you keep making new Facebook accounts to get around being blocked is an indicator that you know *you are being digitally told to shut up with good cause*.",14Nov2020,1

I heard a lot about Kyle Rittenhouse being a murderer etc and I just went with it but when I looked it up and found the video, I'm not sure what the exact issue is? I get that he obviously is a white supremacist, he is also probably a terrible person (although he's young and probably influenced by his surroundings but that's a different topic) and all that. But I'm referring specifically just to the actual so called ""murders"". 

He is walking around with an assault rifle like a dick, which probably is illegal as a 17 year old, but then the demonstrators start rushing him yelling ""get him"" and he get's tackled, and then proceeds to only shoot the people who are an immediate threat to him, and then surrenders to the police immediately. 

I mean I'm not defending him as a person at all, or any of his choices leading up to this, but I can't see how it's ""stone cold murder"". It would be more understandable if the demonstrators only walked up and verbally abused him or something but they physically tried to tackle him.

Smiling and laughing hideously at my peril. There was nothing that I could do but be paralyzed by the fear. I felt a strong sensation in my guts, a tingle at first but then it grew, becoming more and more solid, more defined. And before I knew it, I started to convulse and my head felt light. Everything was spinning around me, like a horrible and personal storm that has come to claim all that made me feel happy and comfortable and leave me with utter despair. I began to hear screams of millions of strange voices. Some humanoid-like while others more horrid and strange in the most exquisite yet terrifying way, all screaming in pure terror and agony. As the world began to break, mold, and form and break again. Dark shadows began to emerge, their eyes with glowing light, with malicious intent. I could feel their despise and utter distaste for my being. Their eyes did not have any eyes but empty and hollow sockets, where dull light shone like the end of times. They stripped me naked and left me with nothing to protect. Their smiles, with that gigantic of a grin, such animosity, and evil intent radiated through them that made me vomit in my own mouth. Their maniacal laughs, taunting me over and over for my worthless and unwanted existence. Their mockery that my life is nothing but a fatal error of existence and I should end it rather than prolong it. My birth has given nothing but pain and misery to this world and by ending myself, I would rid this world from a leech. A leech that cannot give anything in return and only suck the life out of everything it latches onto. All at that moment I could ever ask for was an end.

70,"This is a throwaway account because I am too afraid to share this in my main account. I am sharing this out of frustration and the built up anger and hatred I have on life and myself right now. Needless to say, this is going to be long. I don‚Äôt know whether I need someone to console me or advise me or just bash me for screwing up life so much. 


I am a male of almost 30 years old now. I have been screwing up my life left and right up until now. Every time I do something good, I end up doing something bad twice as much. I was born with a few defects in my eye. No I‚Äôm not blind. I can see barely and struggle a lot to read and as a result, I never learned driving anything. I can say that I didn‚Äôt have a much guided childhood life. I was never that attentive in school and found myself doodling or daydreaming most of the time. I never did the assignments and often ended up getting punished. My parents are not even close to perfect. My brother grew up as a responsible adult just because he grew up under the care of my mother‚Äôs parents. I was also left with them for a while. But I hated there and returned back to my parents where I can do whatever I want. 

In spite of everyone‚Äôs warning, I quit school at 13 and spent a year at home doing nothing but fooling around. I worked at a departmental store where my dad worked for a couple of years before my dad quit and we moved to a new place where we bought a house and settled down. I was 16 at that time. My father asked if I wanted to go to school and I said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. So he let me help him take care of his shop. 

After a couple of years, my brother who now have finished his degree in engineering and started working came to us. He assessed my situation and decided that I am not going to have a very good future if I stay that way. I didn‚Äôt argue because at that point I was starting to feel the same. So He helped me finish my schooling and get a high school diploma. I actually enjoyed this time attending classes and was very keen in getting things done. I worked hard and got very good marks to shocking everyone including myself. I then finished higher secondary exams and came out with even better grades. 

I was 24 when I finished my schooling in an improper yet fair way. My brother brought me to my grandma‚Äôs house and made me join Chartered Accounting which is said to be one of the toughest courses in my country. 

I didn‚Äôt question any of his moves as I had no proper vision of my own future. I was like a leaf that fell on a stream going wherever the water took me. I passed the Foundation level with decent marks. But I knew it was due to the heat of the moment and it was easy to pass with my knowledge of the high school stuff.  I was very much appreciated by my family and joined the next level. That‚Äôs where things started going back to chaos. II found I getting distracted and daydreaming one more time. I forgot to mention that I am an introvert and not very fond of people in a large gathering. But still attending all the classes helped me to a certain level. Furthermore, I started to realize that I didn‚Äôt even have a bit of interest in the field of accounting. I failed in my first attempt. I lost the respect I earned from my brother and family up until that moment. I worked hard the second time. Not because I loved it or anything. But I can‚Äôt stay back when my fellow classmates and friends were moving ahead. Also the constant bashing I got at home. I cleared the second time. 

After that, I had to do the practical training at an accounting firm of three years.  I tried a few places and realized that I can‚Äôt stand the profession. I quit from the firm and stayed home trying to focus on what I actually want to do. But the bashing from my family once again and my grandma‚Äôs constant worrying words were driving me insane. I started hating myself for the first time in life. I felt depression building up severely and even contemplated ending my misery at some point. But I was too much of a coward to even Do that. I felt like I am going insane. I hated what I did and didn‚Äôt know what I want to do. 

But I didn‚Äôt stop looking for the things I love. I realized I like to be creative. My mind was always inclined towards working on the creative stuff than logical. I liked to write stories for a long time. I wanted to make something out of it. But I didn‚Äôt know what to do as my qualifications are hardly related to anything I can present to become a fiction writer. Moreover my family was stubborn in making me a chartered accountant as I have already finished half of the course. It was until my uncle found a place where I can‚Äôt quit. I had to go out of compulsion and also due to the fact that I don‚Äôt have the spine to say that I hate the profession. Out of frustration I broke my old computer the first evening after work and consequentially destroyed any work I had written up until then.

I spent the next three years everyday hating myself waking up and going to do something I hated. I barely did the minimum and even made a lot of mistakes due to my carelessness. My boss was one of the kindest to let me go easy on even the gravest blunders I did at times. I wasted all the time I had in life. My hatred for this field grew stronger. But I was not focused on future. I just wanted to get that over with just like I always did.I didn‚Äôt attend any of the classes for the final exam during the three years. I took every chance to postpone things as long as I can. 

I finished my internship over a year ago and stayed home trying to study. I did study for the first few weeks. But soon I found myself hating everything to do with this course. I started looking for what I want to live a simple life on my own. But I couldn‚Äôt get anywhere.  I was about to write my exams in May. But it was postponed like everything else because of the pandemic. My exams are now confirmed for the end of this month. I haven‚Äôt touched the books for something that requires a year of work. I certainly know I am going to fail miserably. I would hate my life more if I passed. Because I would then be in a profession I can‚Äôt stand for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt want to have an arranged marriage or have a family and raise kids at all. But my family wants me to. But no one in my family knows anything of this. All they were thinking that I will clear this exam and go to a job so that they can make arrangements for my marriage finally. I did not learn much if anything at all from accounting or my internship. 

I screwed up the entirety of my teenage and youth life with so little to take away. I hardly took care of my physical fitness even though I feel insecure about it among other things.  I sit here in front of my computer sobbing on a festival evening when everyone else is happy. My family is expecting me to become a man finally standing up on his feet. I want to be on my own too. It is hard living on someone else‚Äôs money knowing that I don‚Äôt worth anything to anyone. My anxiety and depression has never been strong. I looked up on every other way to have a career. I don‚Äôt see a future right now. I feel like I am standing at the edge of my life right now. I am scared of my future and right now People who knew me have often said that I am smart in academics. They say I achieved a big thing coming this far. But I feel I came all this way in the wrong direction.  Right now, I feel like there could never be anyone as ignorant or stupid as me in life. The last thing I want to do is anything drastic. I do wish I could live a peaceful life earning something that would cover up my needs and some savings for future. But right now I feel like I'm nothing but a loser. I hope I would get a heart attack and die this instant. 

TL; DR: I have screwed up my life in every way that‚Äôs possible. I am afraid of future and wish I would just seize to exist.",14Nov2020,1

Anyways, what I wanted to say is this:

I've been lying to myself that I'm okay and not worrying about this but tbh im fucking panicking inside. I know i'll be able to tackle the situation in a calm and collected manner, without stressing so much and that probably I will be able to bring the level down in a few months with self-control and discipline and all. I just know I will, cause I can self-control pretty well. But still, It's like this, no matter what diabetics do, how much exercise they do, how well they eat, the diseases always affects their body in a drastic way. I know cause my close relatives have been affected. I also know that it means early death. I have NO PROBLEM with early death, but it feels like (I know it's absurd to feel this way with a disease that's not even fatal and is very common) but it feels like life will be very different and difficult from now on. I'll be a slave to diet plans and medicines and insulin and shit. My lifelong goal has been freedom and peace. And if I get diagnosed, freedom is out the window, taking peace away with it. Yeah, I know, Happiness and peace come from within not from external circumstances and it's all about the mindset blah blah. But let's be real, life's gonna be very different from what I imagined and planned, and that's a fucking blow.

I'll have no problem with acceptance, positivity and managing stress, I know it in my heart that I'll do good, and handle it very well. But still, a lot will be different, maybe I should emrace this change and understand that it's out of my control and that I could've done nothing to change it. I have to accept that this is how it is and move in with my life with peace and happiness.

ive spoken to some people about certain worries i have as well and a common thing they have to say is ""well it sounds like theres a deeper psychological issue here..."" but how is it that im not even aware? how can i be more aware of such things? i really want to help myself but being completely oblivious to my own inner thoughts and feelings really isnt helping. i considered going to a therapist but this doesnt seem like a serious issue, im not battling any serious mental disorder... so i dont want to put the financial burden on my parents for me to go to therapy.

The last time I had a breakdown that was in public. Thankfully it hasn't happened again, but I still think about it. I was out running errands and my last stop was a shop I've been to so many times. The staff are very friendly and I was quite comfortable going there. Struggling with being social and having anxiety got the best of me that day. I was completing my purchase and the girl that works there gave me a free candy they had at the counter. Nothing bad happened but that simple act of kindness hit me hard. I just barely made it back to my car holding back tears. I got in, took a moment to breathe and then went on my way. Well I was about 30 seconds into driving away and I decided to flip the radio on. My flavour of the month song came on almost instantly and like a huge rush of emotions I just burst into tears. I couldn't help it. As stated nothing bad happened. I was overwhelmed by the simple gesture of receiving the candy and all I could think about was how much I appreciated it. I was at a stop light and someone next to me saw and I felt like such a freak. I still can't find a reason why that happened to this day. I still think about it. I feel embarrassed from having been in public when it happened and that someone saw me. I can't listen to that song now without being instantly reminded and even choking up a bit. Wtf, brain?

Yah it was embarrassing to talk,

as it was a difficult task.

It started with his HEYY! I said him too.

I didn't knew him, neither he knew me,

Like I felt a nice connection,

as he wasn't sounding creepy.

I was feeling all alone, as I didn't know anyone,

And all were unknown.

Slowly we talked, slowly we met,

Together we sat, and the more we text.

He helped me out when I needed the most,

From sharing seats to sharing toasts.

He made me happy, he made me laugh,

He helped me in maps, I helped him in crafts.

He cared for me, he stood with me,

And I was happy the way I used to be.

More calls-more chats all goods and bad we solved at our own, all ups and downs we handled with grace and about everything we were assured about.

All day and night he was all in my mind,

Well! Do I need any reason behind?

Later he proposed me with all true words,

Though I found no faults but respect from girls.

I rejected as I wanted to know him more,

He told he'll wait until I'm all sure.

Even through all rumours or lies, he made me smile even when twice or thrice.

We spent a good time and shared a great bond, and made each other more strong and strong.

With all those efforts he proved he was a good guy, that won't stopped me to give it a chance,to give it a try.

He was happy, and I was too,

As we together were happy, strong and true.

0 conditions, 0 complaints,

I was his favorite, he was my main.

Everything was perfect, everything was great,

Together we studied, together we ate.

I LOVED WHEN I DIDN'T WANT,

I TRUSTED WHEN I WAS WARNED.

somewhere btw i heard he wanted to over it all,

108,"I saw a post where the OP angrily complains about the stereotypes of Asian martial arts esp unarmed combat esp Japanese katana styles and Kung Fu being the best in the world and far superior to any Western style and the assumptions many Westerners have when meeting Asians that he is an immediate badass who can defeat pro boxers and military, etc. He points out examples in Bruce Lee movies where any Asian not named Bruce Lee is often shown as being far inferior to white people and losing to them and how its only Bruce Lee's superhuman hero who ultimately defeats the Russian strongman or destroys the Italian Mafia all by himself. He also quotes the Ip Man examples where a master level Kung Fu fighter loses to an Australian boxer and dies as a result and how plenty of anime/manga like Rurouni Kenshin shows European armor and weapons being superior to Samurai equipment or at least equal enough no to immediately be shattered by a single katana blows and Western fighters defeating Samurais.

I'll avoid martial arts specifically in this discussion but it does make me ask............... Is popular media really responsible for common historical misconceptions and offensive group stereotypes, an other false info of that nature?

One example is how American entertainment esp TV and movies always gets attacked for showing all Hispanics esp Mexicans as brown and Latin America as a whole as being a criminal hell hole esp Mexico where dark skinned inhabitants are selling drugs and other crimes of that nature............. Except this ignores that............ Practically all top list Latino stars are light skinned? I been a fan of Ana De La Reguera ever since I saw her GORGEOUS face of a Goddess in Nacho Libre and she's quite white. Even in roles where she is tanned, her complexion is that of a typical Sicilian (in other words Southern White Europeans when they get dark from tanning). In most roles she's pretty much similar to your average run of the mill Chinese person's yellow skin and in some of her roles she's so very much as white as milk (which is the case in the aforementioned Nacho Libre). JLO might be yellowish in some roles but she's undoubtedly light skinned and Salma Hayek looks caramel brown in some roles and shading but when she's in the sun she's white passing (as seen in Desperados) and in most appearances in film and TV she's olive. She actually does appear as white as your average American in various points in her life.

And a fair number of media showing Hispanics as criminals are made by Latinos or even filmed and released in a Latin country originally. The first movie in the Mariachi trilogy (which Desperados is part of) was initially released in Mexico and had an all cast of Mexican citizens including the protagonist being played by someone of mostly Irish ancestry with pale skin and green eyes and its a typical ""Mexicans are drug dealers who need to be stopped"" movie. The head boss of the crime organization is a white Creole and almost every drug dealer and criminal hitman in the film is dark skinned.

So just by the simple fact Hollywood movies have light skinned Latinas as common stars and feature white Hispanics even in their movies and TV shows also has white Mexicans and other Latinos (as seen in Beverly HIlls 90210 had a Mexican actress as a guest who was so white she's fairer than most of the exclusively white cast) make me doubt the common attack popular media is racist because it create stereotypes. Hell even Fox News shows pretty white South American politicians frequently in world news and a few times had fair skinned Mexicans and Cubans as news caster despite criticism from liberals, SJWs, and other Leftists complaining its a hotbed KKK level racism against ""brown people"" called Latinos and Hispanics. Hell not just that, Fox News at a few times had interviewed white passing Iraqis and other Muslims and even honored some Pakistani war veteran of America as a cover story and even when stereotypically brown people are shown starting riots or stuff in the Middle East, there's often a light-skinned participants in these violent acts including women who are whiter than your average American.

Another example is the common stereotype of all Vietnam War vets being rapists, murderers, and baby killers and other stuff. That they were super racist and loved killing Vietnamese who are often shown as being worth less than a dog. Extreme rightwingers and pro-Domino Theory conservatives often attacks Hollywood and News Media for always siding with the hippies and being anti-American and having a bias of showing communists as saintly good guys in Vietnam................... Except movies like Platoon show it as very grey. Many people who bash Hollywood forget that two Vietnamese girls were save from gangrape by American soldiers in Platoon who threatened to shoot the rapist GI with their M16s. In the Deer Hunter, the Viet Cong are shown torturing American POWs and playing a horrific game of Russian Roulette. Apocalypse Now shows the brutal Colonel Kilgore helping a dying Viet Cong with water and easing his wounds before death and praising his valor despite being very ruthless and ordering a napalm strike just prior. John Rambo isn't shown as a babykiller but as a broken vet with PTSD and also is a very heroic person who saves civilians.

I can list so many more examples of how popular media not only contradicts stereotypes and dispels popular misconceptions but even the specific fictional works attacked for creating stereotypes like Platoon often dispels them completely or shows lots of grey (which Platoon does), at minimal how nuanced the topic can be unlike popular stereotypes.

So I really have to ask.......... Should popular media really be blamed for negative stereotypes and historical misconception? Its just too common to see on the internet too many blogs, tumblrs, Youtube vids, and what not rant heavily on about how popular media is full of BS and evil because they create stereotype and the stupid masses blindly believe them. But from what I'm seeing in movies and TV too many contradictions to popular myths and so on exist. So I can't help but wonder if the source of offensive misconceptions like Americans soldiers fighting World War 2 by themselves and no credit given to the Allies is not popular media like Fox News and Hollywood and other media but a completely different source? Just to add another example more, plenty of movies in WW2 like the Big Red One and Sahara shows Americans being rescued by Free French Forces and fighting alongside British soldiers or Dutch Resistance and other insurgencies. Medal of Honor games had a few missions where you are with a British commando who helps fighting the Japanese in some missions or French Resistance giving you supplies and drawing the enemy away to allow your escape. The Sahara movie was basically a coalition of troops from all the Allied Forces defending a building from a German divisions and the surviving American played by Bogart humbly credits all his non-American friends including an African Muslim who died in the battle as being the true heroes and not him despite being the survivor. And plenty and plenty of more stuff I can put in.

So is daytime TV along with movies and other popular media really to blame? For common stereotypes like Roman soldiers being completely useless outside of formation in single combat (easily disproved by HBO's Rome and Centurion even though the latter shows a Roman army being beaten by barbarians) and deathless love that ends Happily Ever After in Marriage (if I make a complete list of romance movie that defies this such as Audrey Hepburn's Roman Holiday, I'd end up putting a book)?",14Nov2020,1

I think I‚Äôll need to stay in the US for another 2-3 years to get the green card. However, I haven‚Äôt enjoyed my life since I graduated. I don‚Äôt have many friends, don‚Äôt have any family there and I‚Äôm single with many failed relationships. I feel depressed. I‚Äôm doing therapy as I‚Äôm trying to get better at myself and hopefully one day find a partner. 

Right now, I‚Äôm back home in Colombia for a couple of months while the pandemic gets a little better. I feel so much better cause I have my family and friends. I have considered moving back permanently but I have never dated anyone from here (not even when I used to live here - until age 25). I never liked Latin guys (neither physically nor their personality). I fear if I stay here, I‚Äôll end up alone as I‚Äôll never find someone here. Also, if I decide to come back to Colombia, I‚Äôll have to say bye to my chances of getting a green card and living in the US. If I ever regret coming back home, I would have lost my chance of residency in the US and lost time in the search of a partner. 

On top of everything, I‚Äôve always dreamed of living in Europe (I.e. Switzerland or UK) but I have never actually lived there. I lived in France for 1 year when I was 18 and I liked it. I could give up everything in the US and Colombia and try to get a job and move to Europe. But it seems too risky - I would be alone like I‚Äôm in the US without friends and family, I would start my residency process all over again, and maybe I won‚Äôt even like it. It‚Äôs also not guaranteed that I‚Äôll find a partner there either. If everything goes wrong and I hate it there, I won‚Äôt be able to go back to the US and If I go back to my home country in Colombia, I would be very old to find a guy in this society (average age people get married is 25). 

I feel grateful I have options but at the same time, I feel the pressure of getting older and potentially ending up alone if I make the wrong choice (and I panic just thinking about it). What should I do? üò≠üò≠üò≠",14Nov2020,1

121,"I have made some really fucking stupid choices in my life and now I am stuck in retail. I cannot find anything better. Okay let me rephrase that: I can find better jobs but nothing that I think I could actually handle. I have no transferable skills besides housekeeping and I'm just not a smart person. I really don't want to do housekeeping but it might be the only think I have left. 

Last year I was feeling so hopeful and I was working on losing weight but I honestly don't care any more. I don't see the point, I just don't see things getting any better.",14Nov2020,1

123,"I dont even know how to collect my thoughts for this post. Things that i never questioned before now feel fake and otherworldly. My house, my room, my friends, my parents, my old highschool, my car, the grocery store, my various musical instruments, everything. What is this? I‚Äôve grown up around all these things, why do they all seem alien now? I feel like I don‚Äôt know anything, everything i‚Äôve never thought about or taken for granted seem like strange creations.

124,"Hi, I have 14 years old and I am just accepting that I have white cell lymphoma cancer due to a tumor in my neck, this was diagnosed on October 21 and everything happened very difficult and heavy during those days, I stayed somewhat positive but now I realize that I am just beginning And my hair is falling, I did not imagine that that would lower my self-esteem so much and I felt uncomfortable when I put on my first wig and I felt and I feel that I should isolate myself because I was ashamed of what my friends or family thought and another part of me said that there is no other option and that the most important thing is health, I would like to be positive all the time, I do not know if it is the effect of all the medicine they have been giving me and it has a lot of effect.",14Nov2020,1

127,"I've read articles, watched videos, and even looked amongst Reddit to see what others have to say to other posts, but they all say the same, ""go out and do something fun,"" or ""try a new hobby,"" or at least something along those lines. I've been planning on getting a job to get money, which was what I was hoping would ""cure"" this boredom. I could get more art materials, I could start buying parts for my love of building and programming robots, and so on. These are things that I'm very passionate about, but I haven't been able to do said things because of the lack of funds. But then I turned the right ol' age to get a job, but then my aunt kicked my grandfather out, and now he lives with us. He's very sick, and so someone has to watch him to make sure nothing bad happens. Since my parents have work, it's my job to stay here all night with him. I even had an interview scheduled, but I had to cancel so I could be home. So that's where I am now: I'm burnt out, exhausted, bored with life and I'm unable to do what I want to do. I can't even buy books, and we aren't the richest family, so we rarely get to indulge on things for us. I don't know what to do. Since I don't have the resources to do anything fun (I can't even play games, since he sleeps in the living room, where I unfortunately decided to put my PlayStation), it makes life feel like endless work and no play. Is there anyone out there that can help me out?",14Nov2020,1
129,"There's this girl I used to know and we were really close friends for like a year and a half. We hit it off instantly and basically started talking every day from day one. Thanks to her I decided to go to therapy and I'm still going and it has been great for me. We both changed throughout the course of our friendship due to our proximity with each other. 

It's been 11 months since we mutually decided to stop being friends because our relationship was unhealthy. We parted on good terms, something that was new to me at the time, and as I write about her now I don't feel the anguish and sadness I did when we stopped talking. I do feel gratitude for her having been in my life and us sharing loads of great times.

I made a conscious decision not to delete her contact from my phone though. Even though I was never going to contact her again, having this gave me some comfort at the time. Now, as I don't grieve the end of our friendship, I decided to get rid of it as it felt cumbersome to have it. I did it and felt a heaviness in my chest I didn't expect.

I don't want to contact her again. I'm a different person from which I was a year ago and she most likely has changed a bunch as well. I'm fine with where things left off. It still crushed me a little inside to push ""Delete"" and I don't know why.",14Nov2020,1
131,"What is a ‚Äúbaizuo‚Äù, you may ask? I‚Äôm sure some of you may have heard of this Chinese epithet and some may have not. Nonetheless, I thought it was interesting that there is a word for it:

&gt;BaizuoÔºàÁôΩÂ∑¶ÔºåWhite LeftistsÔºâis a popular Mainland Chinese term coined for a specific subset of Westerners who are despised by most Chinese for their pretentiousness, hypocritical behavior and an overbearing sense of entitlement.

&gt;Baizuos are mostly characterized by their heavy use of political correctness and double standards to covertly advance their own material or emotional interests at the expense of others, while claiming otherwise from a self-assumed superior moral position. Some are truly non-malicious, but are too naive or lack the worldview to provide useful opinions or solutions to real societal problems.

132,"I admit to having a checkered past with relationships, people and life but in no way do I want it to impact my future. I try and help people out and try to be a good guy but at the same time I feel lost and that no matter what I do, I'll only be seen as an failiure who'll never amount to anything and a dissapointment. This is why I hate attending family gatherings and Christmas as I usually find the disingenuousness of it all to be nauseating and the looks of disappointments in their eyes as they think another Groundhog year has gone past for me. The fact I like a drink and am a smoker as well as being well into my 30s and single doesn't help.

I also suffer from erratic moods and flipping the coin mood wise. Initially I can be mild and easygoing but if one thing perturbes me (namely someone's mannerisms or tone) I'll feel an onslaught of anger and malice. I never show these desires in front of people anymore but when alone, I'll go apeshit and lash out physically at what I can... (Objects not people). And then I'll feel so saddened and guilt ridden that I'll briefly ponder suicide before stabilising and back to easygoing.

I am currently seeing an psychiatrist who seems to think this all points to BPD.

TL;DR: I'm terrified I'll always be seen as a failure, have regular violent mood swings, am frustrated with the lockdown and media scaremongering and the worst thing is I can't stay in a consistent mood.",14Nov2020,1
133,"I've never posted in this subreddit, but it seems appropriate to post here.

My cat Rick was my neighbors' pet until they left her with us when they moved in 2017. She was a sassy lady and required such minimal maintenance. She was an outside cat and roamed our neighborhood like she owned it. I go to school on the opposite side of the country, but I'm home because of COVID; when I got home in March, she plopped down in our front yard and meowed frantically at me until I pet her. We think that she was hit by a car, but there's no way of knowing. I'll miss her infinitely, as will our other cat Becky, who doesn't seem to know what to do now. Thank you for reading this if you did. I'd like to see your precious pets, to brighten my day.",14Nov2020,1
135,"Then I wouldn't be an ugly alcoholic, undersocialized man 

I could wear things that attract people, things that feel good and things that make others want others
