1,"My whole life, people have told me ""szaba, you get attached way too easily! You can't open your heart to everyone and everything and expect to come out unscathed."" This is true, but it shouldn't be. Attachment - and love and friendship and family values and loyalty to those values - are at the core of humankind. We need to feel attachment to others or we fucking die.

I was starved of affection as a child. My parents were emotionally distant, only touched me when necessary, and generally regarded any of my needs as a nuisance. I never felt wanted or like I belonged. I didn’t know what that was like, to feel like you have a home. Now imagine my joy when I met other kids, made friends, had attentive teachers at school. For the first time I got to know what it was like to belong somewhere. My friends were my family. I protected them, fought tooth and nail for them, loved them with every fibre of my being. Was that wrong? No. Did every single friend I ever made leave at some point? Yes.  

It was with great sadness that I realized, somewhere in my teens, that nothing was permanent and that the only constant in my life would be me. I made peace with it. It hurt like a motherfucker, to know I’d always end up alone, but that was okay.  

And then I fell in love for the first time.  

We lasted a good 2 years, far from the lifetime we’d promised each other. It was unthinkable to me, that people could just ... break up with each other and move on. I really meant it when I said “forever”. He didn’t. That would become a theme. Each time I fell in love, I meant every word I said. My promises weren’t hollow. But one after one, just like friends, lovers went. I started to feel just a little bitter. Here I was, pouring my heart and soul into each and every relationship, and what did my boyfriends do?  

 “Can’t hang tonight, gotta play Xbox with the boys!”

“You are really annoying.”

“Your neighbor is sooo hot!”

“You just live too far away, I don’t want to drive 30 minutes to see you.”

“Work is exhausting enough already, I don’t need a complaining girlfriend at home.”

“You can’t even cook what I asked you to, I told you I don’t eat vegetables!”

“What’s with all the hugging? Man, you’re annoying. Didn’t you parents love you enough?”

“Happy birthday by the way, I’ll be having dinner with Mary tonight sorry love you.”

“I want my ring back, you don’t deserve it.”  

“No one will ever love you. You don’t even know what love is.”

It wasn’t that they were all jerks when we started dating. But over time, they all turned into three-headed monsters, and I found myself crying into my pillows at night more often than not, wondering what it was about me that made people walk all over me at the slightest hint of “feelings”. I was honest, spoke my mind, caring, smart. Why was I so hard to love? What was wrong with me? Why was it always me that got attached, while the other person maintained some sort of distance and was often gone before I’d had time to even entertain the notion that they might not care about me as much as I cared about them?  

Simple. They cared too. But they didn’t go through what I went through, and for them, leaving someone they cared about was hard and uncomfortable, but it wasn’t devastating. They weren’t leaving their family behind, just someone they’d known for a few months or a couple of years at most. It wasn’t comparable.

I met someone, a year ago. He was supposed to be different. He didn’t promise me a lot, but what he did promise, he kept. He was grounded. Mature. I’d never felt so loved, so accepted, so at home.  I was fiercely protective of him. He was family. And then, he went and fucked his best friend’s fiancee on New Year’s Eve. He didn’t even say “I was drunk.” He told me about it, laughing the whole time, “you should have seen everyone’s faces when we nearly did it on the dance floor!”, and then he showed me a video of them, on said dance floor.  

His best friend called me later that day to apologize. He asked what I was going to do. “I don’t know. He made a mistake. I don’t want to lose him,” I said, blindingly oblivious. “Are you going to call off the wedding?” “Yeah,” he said. “She’s a bitch.” We had a chuckle. It sounded so simple. Call off the wedding, call her a bitch, move on with life. I don’t know how people do it.  

I still don’t know. It doesn’t hurt any less now than it did the first time.",24Aug2020,1
2,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

6,"My mom likes to know if I have social media so she can follow me, so I made sure i'd never tell her I had Instagram. Well cat's out of the bag. She fucking asked for my phone and instead of telling me how to make Instagram private, she wants to do it herself.  She then proceeds to make an account I don't use often private and says ""Do you know this person?"" ""Do you know what person?"" I had to unfollow all of my other accounts that I wanted to stay private from her so she won't harass me in making it private. She discovered the other and logged into one actually but I explained I like to post content which means Art. I really want my mother to stop treating me like a child and let me think for myself. I'm working 8 hour shifts at a job that has me mentally exhausted and My parents won't let me quit. Seriously, I have to ask them if I can quit a job -\_- Is there anything I can do at this point?",24Aug2020,1
7,"(TW) About half a year ago I was sexually assaulted by a dear, close friend of mine. Let’s call him Allen. Our group of friends basically sided with him after I told them what happened. Even though Allen hurt and betrayed me worse than anyone ever had, they downplayed what happened and made excuses for him. One friend told me “at least you weren’t raped, it could have been worse,” and went on and on about how “Allen is a virgin and didn’t know what he was doing.” They pushed me to make up with Allen in order bring the group back together, causing me to have 2 public breakdowns. Even after all that, no one batted an eye. I eventually cut them all off and blocked them on social media. 3 years of friendship, over, because I know what’s best for me.

That was 3 months ago now. I’ve been doing really well without them, moving into a new apartment and getting a new job and everything. Then I broke down again this weekend. I was so angry I sent several scathing messages calling out friends who were involved and I felt had hurt me. I then self harmed for the first time since adolescence, and, in a manic rage, rode my bike all the way to Allen’s house. I knocked on the door, not knowing what I’d say or do. His brother answered, telling me Allen had gone to our mutual friend’s house. I rode there, returning to reality as I arrived on the doorstep. Nothing good could come out of whatever was going to happen.

So, I slowly walked my bike home, crying and baking in the sun. Am I going insane? Life be so cruel.",24Aug2020,1
8,"So, my face is asymmetrical (obviously everyone's is), but it's especially asymmetrical. My jaw is uneven so that even my speech is asymmetrical (a plastic surgeon pointed this out to me). I look honestly gorgeous in my mirror image (I've been told every time I'm on FT how I attractive I am, but not as much in real life). I'm struggling to come to terms with this. It's like my own living hell honestly, that the only person who can see myself for how I feel about my looks on the inside is me. The rest of the world sees a less attractive version of me. It's hurt my self-confidence so much, I spend hours a day looking at the reverse image of me from my webcam to the point I think I have body dysmorphia. I've tried my best to fix my asymmetry with a plastic surgeon, but only with fillers, and still no luck. I'm in my own mental prison.",24Aug2020,1

I’m not a very confrontational person, so quitting a job was my worst nightmare. But I told my boss I was handing in my two week notice, instead of letting me quit she basically convinced me to stay by making me question my decision of switching jobs. I really don’t want to work there anymore, but I didn’t have the balls to tell her it wasn’t because I like this new job better or I don’t like working at my current job, it’s because working with her isn’t good for my mental health. Her management style is aggressive and sometimes passive aggressive, and that’s fine, she can manage people however she wants I still respect her and like her as a person, but not as a boss. I dread every shift I have to work there even if it’s only 5 hours, I hate it so much. My new job is a much better work environment for me. 

Since I couldn’t give her the real reason I wanted to quit which is: I hate her management style and I hate working with her because she terrifies me and it’s not good for my mental health. It was easier for her to convince me to stay since I couldn’t give her valid reasons.

Plus, it’s retail, and they take it way too seriously sometimes, which in a way I get, but also if I’m not making commission I should have to sell my ass off like I do. 

(A small disclaimer of what my job is like: I don’t make commissions but I have to sell my ass off, constantly going from person to person and talking to people constantly for hours. The hours are weird and in the middle of the day. The store is really small and it gets extremely busy and crowded which is extremely stressful. I’m just not built to work there anymore.) 

I’d been wanting to quit my first job since before quarantine, but I figured I’d stick it out and see if I liked it better after a break; news flash, I didn’t. The only reason I’ve stayed so long is that I love my coworkers so much, I’m great friends with a few of them.

Now that I have two jobs I’m gonna be working basically everyday, which is way too much for me, so I need to leave one or cut back on hours on one. This is all very new to me and I don’t know how to navigate this situation.

I start my new job tomorrow and I’m terrified I’m gonna hate it. I’m hoping I love it tho and I don’t have to dread going to work anymore.",24Aug2020,1

11,"I know this is a little bit of a weird question. I am currently enrolled in an MBA program where I take classes in the evenings after work. Because of this setup I have not had the need to take on any debt to pay for my school. However, I was just reading that the most likely presidential candidate has it in his economic plan to cancel $10k worth of student loan debt. Normally I would never make a decision like this based on the potential for some policy change in the future. But just thinking about the numbers, I think it might be a good way to go.

If I were to take on $10k worth of student loan debt and wait for let's say a year in order to see if the policy goes through, that would cost me a net $330 in interest expense (4.3% interest rate vs. 1% I currently make on cash). However, it could potentially save me $10k. So if I think the possibility of the policy going through in the next year is greater than 4%, it seems like the best decision would be to take on the debt and wait to see what happens.

I've never taken on student debt before so I don't know exactly how long it takes for an application to go through. I was thinking of maybe waiting until November to see how things work out in Congress as well as the White House to see if it makes sense. It seems like a strange thing to do, but I think the logic makes sense.",24Aug2020,1

So now I'm going to a private school that is K-12, so I'm just going to be plopping straight into 9th grade, with only a handful of other people that were in the same boat as me. I'll have no connections, no relationships, and no knowledge of the school before I go, while a majority of the students there will. I'm not terribly anxious, which I'm somewhat surprised by, but I'm certainly not pleased about this situation. Covid-19 has really screwed me over this year.",24Aug2020,1

15,"I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I be myself, and I get friend zoned or guys only want to have sex with me. I’ve been working on myself, and have been finding happiness in where I’m at but I still long for that affection and love that comes with relationships. And that sense of security. Whenever I talk to a guy, and I think it goes great, it just doesn’t. 
Last person I’ve found myself interested in likes someone else, and sees them getting into a relationship soon but still wants to be friends with me because we have a “connection”. Even though he has admitted he might get feelings for me, he still thinks he can see me as a friend.

17,"I (19F) am getting very obsessed with wanting to be in a relationship. I’ve never been in a relationship. The urges only started this year when I found out the guy I wanted got into a serious relationship with someone else, and suddenly all my friends and even family are in relationships.

I used to love being single and enjoying my own company. Now I wake up full of loneliness and sadness. Like everything around me seems dark, nothing is fun anymore. I feel like I’m missing out on something. I don’t get to go on amazing dates or have endure amazing sexual activity.

Going on dating apps seems like anxiety or even just trying to date. I so desperately want a relationship that I just start thinking about it with the guy I match with. I find most guys ghost me or don’t even want to meet let alone be in a relationship. 

I feel like a pathetic loser. I’ll never find love. Girls get into relationships so easily, be single for 6 months if it doesn’t work out, and get with the next one. Must be such an amazing life. 

I struggle with loving myself. Because I got really obsessed with said guy in the beginning, because him and his gf seemed so much better than me. They actually have happy lives unlike myself. He knows that I was formerly really obsessed with him to the point his gf’s friend attacked me telling me how amazing their relationship was, how much better she is than me, and how I should move on because “he don’t want me”. 

I have had thoughts of ending things. Because I’ll never be good enough for anybody decent. I just don’t know what to do anymore.",24Aug2020,1

20,"My dad used to be pretty cool when I was age 9 and younger.

However...when I got into my pre-teen years, I got moody. As is normal for someone going through an awkward phase. And I sometimes would make rude or inappropriate remarks. But instead of handling it in a mature way, he'd angrily shout and insult me right back.

Like...it's hard to think of a specific scenario since it was so long ago, but here goes.

Dad: Hey son, how was your day at school?

Me: \*rolls eyes\* Ugh, can you please not talk to me right now? I'm really not in a fucking good mood.

Dad: Hey, don't you talk to me that way you worthless motherfucker! I'll take away all of your fucking privileges!

Yeah...it's fucked up, but that's my family dynamic. :/

As I got older and older though...it got worse and worse.

And as I eventually came out as bisexual, agender/genderless/non-binary and shit, he got even more angry and more aggressive towards me. Going as for as even pushing me to knock me to the ground, and giving me hard open hand slaps to the face, even when I still had my glasses on.

I can't really deal with this anymore. I already was an adult at 18. I'm not a whole year older than 18, I'm 19. I'm getting closer and closer to death, and I can't deal with all of my dad's bullshit and negativity. I plan to move out before turning 20. Get a job at Publix or something, as well as a roommate or two.

As for my mom...she's actually really nice, and my dad argues a lot with her too, but doesn't hit her since she's female. My mom said she doesn't even know why they're still together, but she's afraid to leave him.

For the record, this is not completely one-sided. My dad is an aggressive asshole, but I am one too. Before he gave me those hard open hand slaps to the face, I tormented him a heck of a lot. It was something like.

Me: I'm bisexual and I will go on dates with other boys whether you like it or not! You may biologically be my father, but I don't consider you my daddy! You're just a sexist, homophobic, racist asshole, whose entire life and existence is worth absolutely nothing! Nobody likes you, nobody I tell you! That's why you got zero friends, and all of your friends left you! You're better off dead! Heck, I would even kill you myself if I could!

Dad: \*gives me like 5 hard open hand slaps to the face\* Do you wanna get hit in the face bitch? Is that what you want? Look at me, I'm bigger and stronger than you. If anyone dies, it will be you, motherfucker. And for the record, you're the worthless one. I used to be a computer engineer. What the fuck have you done besides play video games all day for 19 years? The world frankly wouldn't miss you if you died. \*slaps me some more\*

Yeah...incredibly unhealthy relationship, and probably makes all of you uncomfortable just reading it, but I felt I needed to write and post this somewhere.",24Aug2020,1
21,"My friends and coworkers (by friend circle was linked heavily to my work circle) started verbally abusing me and I was too shy to fight back.

22,"The 21st century was surely a turning point of our lives in so many ways. With the rise of technology, we humans began to grow more independent and living in small groups again. Technology has also changed our habits of reproduction and procreation. We're aware of what this is at a very young age thanks to the internet. 

I like many other underachieving guys have started masturbating in my early teens. I first came across porn at the age of 10. For over 10 years now, it has become a terrible useless habit.

Maybe there is something beneficial that comes out of porn. It can teach you how to prepare for the real thing, yes. It can help train to avoid things like ED and premature Ejaculation by practice but we all know noone ever really watches it and masturbates for ""training"". The problem isnt about getting horny. 

The problem is realizing that you have access to virtually any ideal body type doing anything you wish to see on the web. That knowledge brings about an urge to simulate yourself into ""having sex"" at the end of the day it feels like you've fried your brain all for a few moments of joy. I've been in a few sexual relationships but when they're out of the picture, boredom kicks in and I want to ""access the library"". 

I'm tired of it. Nothing productive comes out of it, I'm just stuck in agony of being single and I know the reason I'm going to stay that way is because of porn. I wish I could have that part of my brain erased and just never think of it again, instead enjoy the actual act with my partner in the near future. What can I do next? Shut off my wifi purposefully as punishment?

Just wanted to rant about how fed up I am at 24 giving into this carnal pleasure that has ended up taking away my true potential from the thousands of hours spent since my early teens to where I am now.

Most of the guys in my class are in their early 20’s and I’m definitely one of the slowest and worse at exercising. But here’s the thing, I can’t give up. I have applied to literally 100’s of jobs beforehand and have not gotten any calls or anything despite follow ups and such. I felt as if my life was stagnant and I wasn’t going anywhere at all. Fast forward a few years and here I am. It took a long time to get in the position I am at now and it’s slipping through my fingers.

This is very heartfelt, im actually crying a little when writing this. 
So i have been talking to this amazing girl for over 1 and a half years, everyday. 
It was a long distance, oh boy we had alot of fun 😭. I loved her and i still do. 
Last night we got into an argument about something really stupid, in got to the point where she wrote in Capital letters. But after that fight she weirdly wrote me “Goodnight 😘😘”
I tried to write the same 2 minutes after she sent that messages, it was not delivered, so i guess she shut off her phone. She did not Block me either (whatsapp).

Idk What to do... my mind is fucking everywhere. I did only sleep like 3 hours tops.",24Aug2020,1
38,"Hello everyone, I hope that everyone is well despite the challenges that the current pandemic has presented. Having just finished my final exams for school, I have found the time to reflect upon my life as I head to college. However, over the course of the past month, I can’t help but feel disappointed with my social life I had as a teenager.

My friendship group which I had throughout school pretty much stayed the same. However, over the course of high school, I felt as though the connections I shared between my friends slowly evaporated and the only thing that was holding us together were the many years we were friends together during our childhood. 

I am quite an ambitious and outgoing person, and I love to socialise. However, my friends are not, and would much prefer to stay inside all weekend (not that there is anything wrong with that). I suspect it was our different personalities and interests which led to me feeling ‘tolerated’ by my circle. I remember last year finding out they had a separate group chat without me. Additionally, our conversations at school never really got anywhere as there were lots of awkward silence. Towards the end of high school, I simply felt as though I didn’t fit in my with friends, and that the only thing keeping us together was the number of years we were friends as children.

Although I tried to establish new friendships with my peers in my later years at high school, by then I found it was too late, as everyone had already formed their friendship circles and weren’t willing to open up to new people joining. Every weekend I can remember texting, inviting or asking to come along to social events or gatherings held by my classmates, but unfortunately I was never invited. As a result, during my time at high school I felt as though I never really belonged anywhere.

However, I still lived my life, in which I played sport, had a part-time job, spent time with my family and went to the gym. Yet, I still feel regret that I didn’t have a strong friendship circle and go to events such as music festivals, the cinemas or just hang out with my friends on weekends.

I understand that I have college and the rest of my adult life to look forward to such events, however I feel as though I have wasted my teenage life by not doing these activities sooner. I feel sad and admittedly jealousy going through my class mates’ Instagram and Facebook photos of them spending time together

Is it easy to make new friends at college? Is there any advice you would have? 

Thank you in advance.",24Aug2020,1
39,"TL:DR: To keep it as short as possible. I’m basically saying that I think I have issues that cause me to be slower to react thanks to my mom being on meth for a short time when she was pregnant with me. 


As the title says I’ve always been slow to react. I don’t know if it happens so much anymore (I didn’t know this happened until I was told in all honesty), but as a kid, and according to what my grandma told me, it could take up to like 5 minutes for me to respond to someone. 

She told me that one of my elementary school teachers told her that it had been happening at school. She asked me a question, but I just continued doing what I was doing and she thought I was ignoring her. After a few minutes I responded and scared the crap out of her. 

I always thought it could be because my mom was on meth for a short time when she was pregnant with me. 

My mom got ran over when she was two, and it caused back problems that carried on her whole life. So when she was 13, she started doing drugs without my grandma knowing about it. My grandma told me she didn’t even know what meth was until someone else told her. 

Apparently one of my family members had been giving it to her and doing it with her... but anyways. 

When my mom found out she was pregnant, my grandma had to lay on her every day and stop her from doing meth. My mom broke my grandmas fingers multiple times, and now she has everlasting hand problems, but my grandma did get her off about a month into it. 

Both me and my mom nearly died when I was born. The doctor was stuck in traffic because of roadwork that was happening for the 2002 olympics, so no one was able to do what was needed. 

My mom nearly bled to death, but they ended up pulling me out, though I do have a large scar on my face from where the doctor cut me. 

I know that I have dyslexia from my mom, as well as deformities in my nose, but the doctor said it shouldn’t cause me problems. 

My dyslexia isn’t like what people normally have. It’s more like writing sentences backwards, or putting letters from other words into another one, etc. I did used to write my 5’s backwards, I don’t understand why that was the only one lol. 

I know that my nose hurts all the time and blood often gets dried up in places where I can’t blow it out so I have to rub the bridge of my nose, along with other things in hopes that the pain will go away. 

I can move my nose up and down though, which I thought was always weird.

My girlfriend and I known each other for 8years.
She has severe depression. I promised her I won't leave when her mental illness act up. But she has become more and more agressive towards me.
She would say something like, ""you're useless, you can't help me, you are not in this trouble together with me. I don't think I love me.""

It all started a month ago, when her pet passed away, since then she's crying so much, and attacking all other people around her, especially me. We're in long distance. And due to covid situation in my country we can't meet. She told me she just wanted a hug. And I couldn't do it for her. I feel really sorry for her.

She changed so much after her pet passed away, and what make it worser is, her family member and her went to fortune telling when her mental illness acting up, and the fortune teller tell her that her life will be real bad, her future husband would beat her, and not going to work, and is very poor, she has to work for 2job to keep her and her child away from starving, and now I fucking lost my job, she totally believe in that fucking fortune teller now. And is afraid to continue living, the mother fucking fortune teller made her even more suicidal now. And I think she even want to break up with me. I'm so fucking tired, I did everything for her, I gave her everything I had, she just can't see it, she didn't feel me love, not at all. 

She's so cute when her mental illness doesn't act up.... She's my favorite person when her mental illness doesn't act up, so precious, fuck depression, fuck those who make her depressed. Fuck I love her so much. I wish I could fucking take her depression away, fuck myself who can't make her feel secured.

I'm so afraid,what if she really committed suicide, I live far away from her, I can't do anything about it. Even though i stopped one of her attempt before,I have no confident to do it again.

43,"Firstly, you shouldn't even be reading this—and this is the one thing I do judge you for—I'm not the one with your name in my mouth and if you feel insulted by anything I siad that's a reflection on your own self esteem.

I don't compare myself to anyone, particularly other women. Your goals are not the same as my goals. We're not in competition. I don't need to feel above others, I'm actually quite happy with myself despite my flaws. I certainly don't derive my self worth from my looks.

On the other hand, princess Kayla: you hated me on sight, sized me up and felt insecure, and then when you found out my age and accomplishments lost your damn mind. A finally warming up to me drove you so nuts you quit. And you know damn well u never did a thing to you. You couldn't even stand to be in the same room as me because someone might find me more beautiful. How sad. Deny it all you want, I don't speak to you and I don't speak about you; you can't say the same of me.

Now C, ask yourself why princess Kayla doesn't have a problem with you. You know she did the same mental equations looking at you as she did looking at me. 

I don't think I'm better than anyone else, that's not even *the way I think*. I might feel threatened by a down-on-their-luck PhD, but even that's doubtful. I'd just be happy to have someone who might want to talk to me for a change.",24Aug2020,1

45,"I know this title sounds weird but it’s something I’m genuinely wondering. All my life I feel like I’ve been my own biggest obstacle. It’s like my mind works against itself. I’ve ALWAYS struggled with confidence and being comfortable with myself. Too scared to be disliked and caring too much what others think.

I just moved onto my college campus as an 18 year old freshman. I want this to be my new start. I want to overcome and believe in myself and not be filled with so much self doubt. Stop comparing myself to others or worrying what they think. 

I recently read this Dr. Seuss quote that I related too a lot. He wrote, “I'm afraid that sometimes you'll play lonely games too. Games you can't win 'cause you'll play against you.” That’s exactly how I’ve always felt. I’m always going against myself. I’ve always been afraid to stand out. I’ve also been afraid to be disliked. I always just wanted to blend in. I never have liked getting attention. I feel like it’s gotten to a point though, where after trying to blend in so well for so long, nobody recognizes me or cares about me. I’ve always been lonely.

Anyways I just have had this cloud over me it feels like, and I hate being in a constant battle with myself because it’s not a battle I feel I’ll ever win doing it this way. I could really use some advice. I really want a positive college experience and to start fresh after some bad high school years.",24Aug2020,1

- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bits to me about how much she smells.

60,"Sorry this is so long but this is the first time putting these thoughts down and out there. Throwaway account because you never know who’s lurking. 

We have been friends for about 10 years - meeting in high school. We are the only two of our friend group who stuck together after school but, I feel like that’s the only thing keeping us together as friends or why we even remained friends. Anyway I’ve been doing a heap of self reflection and I think I don’t want to be friends with this person anymore. I never realised how much they affected me negatively. 

When our covid lockdown hit, they refused to hang out with me because their parents were high risk. Which is TOTALLY understandable. I had no issues with that. I mean I shouldn’t have even asked in the first place because duh, lockdown. But then they admitted to me that during lockdown they were going to a persons house and sleeping with them, which is someone who they had only JUST started talking to. The sleeping together part isn’t the bad bit. It’s the fact that they’d tell me they didn’t want to see me to protect their parents but would go and see this other person, who they only just met, no previous history, to hang out and sleep with them instead. So they really didn’t have their parents best interest in mind, in my opinion. Plus I don’t like the fact they lied to me saying they were strictly staying home. 

I spoke to them about how my partner and I want to buy a house instead of renting and they went very sour on me, trying to say it’s a big commitment (which we are aware of) and that it’s not smart. They also have told me they don’t like being around my partner and I because they think “couples are gross” but they’re the type of person who LOVES everything about relationships. My partner and I are hardly PDA unless we are in private because we know how uncomfortable it can be hanging with a couple that CLING on to each other. It makes my partner feel like shit because they think they’re the problem. 


I have started to notice that they copy a lot of the things I do as well. I put up a few photos on social media and the following day I saw that they put up similar things. At first I didn’t think anything of it. But it kept happening. I eventually asked my partner what he thought and he said it was obvious that they got their idea from my posts. I’m aware of the phrase “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery” but is there a line that’s drawn? I know they are my best friend but I feel like I anything I do is just going to be mirrored by them.  I feel like they honestly don’t even know who they are and I have tried so much to help them find who they are and it just doesn’t seem to work. 
Whenever they get excited about anything, I always put 110% into my reaction and be excited with them because hell yeah! Positivity! But when it comes to me, I get a “haha that’s awesome.” Or I won’t get a response. 

When I had a very bad depression episode, I opened up to them about it and didn’t even respond to it. It wasn’t until they found out how bad it got they called and said “I guess we better hang out and see what issues you’ve got going on in your head.”

These are only a few of the things I have wrote down. But I feel like I’m overreacting. But at the same time, I have been friends with this person for over 10 years. I’ve been slowly trying to ease them out of my life, and they don’t seem to notice too much. I just feel so drained and I’ve confided in my partner and another close friend of mine and they both aren’t big fans of this person purely because of how they treat me and continue to treat me.

68,"Why do you think I’m not able to make friends in college?

I transferred to a school closer to home. I live offcampus.

Here’s what I’ve done to try and make friends and how it resulted.

I joined an improv club and went to a meeting. It was obvious that everyone knew each other. I didn’t really participate in the activities and didn’t talk to anyone much but it was my first time. After I joined them to eat and talked a little bit and then they left and went to hang out And I didn’t go with them. I saw them on campus a few days later and each time I saw one of them neither of us said hi and just walkEd past each other. I didn’t go to any more club meetings

I play basketball almost every day in the gym in between or after classes. I see a lot of the same people but rarely talk to anyone. Sometimes I interact or chat a little bit about the game. I’ve met a few people through this When I play really well and they ask me what year I’m in and if I want to play more. One person invited me to intermural team and I said I would join but they picked up someone else at the last minute. Sometimes people say I will text you when we play but that’s never happened yet.

Sometimes I work in group projects and one time I kind of liked my group we would chat about other stuff besides the project And they would sit next to me in class. But we never became close. Usually it’s like this with groups for me, just chatting but never hanging out or anything. Not talking much to one another after projects done and never seeing each other again.

I did an acting class and while some people seem to know each other and talk each other during breaks I just went on my phone Or I got coffee. Didn’t really get to know anyone, and although I worked with a couple scene partners, We just did the assignment and didn’t meet up and didn’t get close. They were girls so maybe it was harder to make friends?

Finally I met one person playing basketball who was super friendly When he realized I was in his class, and I ended up helping him study and tutoring him basically. He gave me a ride A couple times and invited me to go to an NBA game. We ended up not going and even though we texted a few times and met up to play basketball a couple times things fell through and we stopPed talking.

I’m not in any clubs or activities, I don’t live on campus I don’t have any roommates, I go to school and leave after my classes are done. Except I actually play basketball a lot And even though I meet a lot of people playing I don’t really talk much and it hasn’t led to any friendships.

73,"For clarification, I'm 15M and this is a throwaway account. 

My mom is an alcoholic, for starters, and just this has been heavy for me during the few years I have been living on this earth. When I was around 10 I heard my drunken mother say she was willing to kill my father with an axe if she had the chance. This was before my understanding of alcohol and it's effects. My mom has been good at hiding her problem, but as years passed I finally understood why she always screamed and acted angry and sad at my dad right after I went to bed. Mom also finally undestood that I understood her problem, and everytime she gets drunk now, I get scared and sad, and when I'm around her while she is drunk I try to avoid eye contact, and when she asks questions I answer as short as possible, so for this reason, I guess she thinks I hate her. 

We also have a dog (our previous dog died last summer, and we got a new one, which has been significantly harder to take care of). Since my mom doesn't have a job, and I go to school, and my dad works; mom's alone with the dog in the daytime. 

Skip to today. I came back from school, and my mom told my dad that apparently it's been too hard for her to take care of the dog, and she wants to send him back to the breeder. She knows I'm a huge dog person, and that I love the dog, but she can't take it anymore, apparently. 

While I went to give the dog some food, they apparently thought I went on a walk with him, so my mom started ranting all about how hard it has been, and she doesn't care what we do with the dog, as long as she doesn't have to see him anymore. Then she said: ""\[Son\] is going to hate me for this, but he already does, I don't care, it's the same shit for me""

A while later they noticed me crying, sitting by the dog in the cage we've built for him outside. Mom and dad came outside and tried to calm me down, and mom was like: ""it's ok"" like I hadn't just heard her say she didn't care I hated her, even though I don't, I just get extremely sad when she starts drinking. 

I don't know if my mom actually hates me, or if it was just something she said because she was angry. She wasn't drunk either there (I've become really good at telling when she is drunk or not).

80," 

In my old school, there were more than a 100 students per batch with 4 sections of approx 25-30 students each. In grade 4 I was in 4-B. The Class I wanted to be in was 4-A. Five classmates teased me by using my fears against me. Three guys would take advantage of me because I was too soft. I would lend them papers even if they wont allow me to borrow their stuff because I felt I had to please everyone. They broke my ruler 2 times one time and I didnt tell them off. I knew this had to stop. However.........I was afraid to stand up for myself because I felt like I would be hated by people if I report them. I didn't want to be popular or anything....I just wanted to be in good terms with everyone and not receive hate. I don't like the cold look people give when they hate me and I didn't want that. There was a seatplan in my class and I was between two of these guys. I felt like I was in the wrong section and wanted to change to another class but the school doesn't allow that. Because of a grade 4 nightmare I became a try-hard at making friends grade 5 and I got alienated cuz no one likes a try hard. I eventually switched schools at grade 6 where the bullying stopped.

As I grew up I realized I will never be liked by everyone. There will be people who will hate me for no reason or badmouth me when I give equity. I reported someone for plagiarizing my work when he initially asked me If I can send my HW to him for ""Guidelines of How to write the paper"". Not only that I argued with an adult one time when he cut me in line. I even gave some of my friends the harsh truth when they needed it. However at times I am constantly reminded of Grade 4 and I hate it and feel guilty about it. I will always be with Jerks but I will give them what they deserve even if they will hate me for life.

TLDR: I was afraid to tell on people who would take advantage of me and tease me because I didn't like getting hate and giving me the cold look. I feel guilty of not standing up.",24Aug2020,1

83,"Hi reddit. I am a 39 year old dude. Never married, never had any children. I had a rough childhood, with a lot of physical abuse. I have never really been succesful in anything, i did no sports (parents didn't allow me), i was never competitive among my peers, i basically grew up like Peter Pan. I feel like i have spent my whole life for absolutely nothing. Just wasted it. And now it feels too late for anything to be honest. My will to carry out any task is gone. I feel like an empty shell, void of any humane sentiment. I do not cry, i do not laugh, i sometimes fake it, to make others happy. I don't really enjoy anything. I can even say that i don't ""feel"" anything. No sadness no joy, no pity. I can watch a horrible event taking place with a complete straight face. I am completely detached. I have a couple hobbies, but i swear to god, i do not even enjoy doing them, i do them just because they make the time pass without me noticing it.

If you had asked me what my biggest achievements in life were, i'd probably have no answer. And i am 40 fucking years old right. That is lame, i know. English is my second language. I learned it mostly by myself. If that counts, maybe yeah, here is an achievement for you. I have always been good at fixing things, i could probably have learned mechanics very easily. But none of these talents of mine has found any utility, nor have i been able to improve on them.

I had a few girlfriends. My romantic/sexual involvements started very very late in life, my first experience happened when i was older than 30 years. I was a virgin until that. Now, i don't even want to have sex. Recently i had the chance to have sex with a woman whom i liked for a long time. She is an absolute beauty. We were naked and she was on top of me. For the love of god, i couldn't have an erection. Not because i have an erectile dysfunction but my mind and body just refused to do it. We had a long foreplay session but i just could not get my body and mind to that natural ""animalistic"" state. I just didn't want to have sex. It felt horrible.

Shortly, my will to to do anything is just gone. I fucking want to shrivel in a corner and wait for death. WTF is wrong with me? Why can't i feel anything anymore? Is this physiological or pscyhological? What kind of doctor should i go to?",24Aug2020,1

I’m so ashamed but it’s a genuine problem that is becoming out of hand.

91,"# An Open Letter to a Former Friend

It’s been almost three months since I decided to cut ties with you, and today has been the first day that I didn’t second-guess that decision.

You see, within an hour of waking up this morning, I had already watched a video of yet another unarmed Black man being shot in the back by a police officer, seen all the racist assholes come crawling out of the woodwork to suggest that he deserved to be shot seven times in front of his own children for daring to turn his back to a police officer, and heard from a score of armchair quarterbacks who have never faced oppression in their lives smugly opining that rioting is the wrong way to react to oppression. The same old, tired bullshit that I’m sick of having to deal with.

But I realized that this time, at least I wouldn’t also have to deal with *your* bullshit. When I took to social media to express my feelings on the matter, I found myself breathing a sigh of relief that you wouldn’t see what I was posting.

I was relieved to realize that I wouldn’t have to deal with your insensitivity, your “just asking questions,” your playing Devil’s Advocate in a conversation that I didn’t ask to have. I’m glad that for once, you won’t have the opportunity to react to my pain, anger, and fear at seeing injustices happening to people who look like me by attempting to discuss “Black lives” as an abstract concept.

And this is the thing that I don’t think you ever really understood; this is the thing that I’m angry you’re allowed to walk away without understanding; this is the thing that I don’t feel I should have to explain to someone who purports to care about me and my well-being:

**To me, the conversation surrounding police brutality against Black Americans is not an abstract philosophical conversation.**

It’s me waking up in the morning and wondering if this is the day I’ll be in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong color skin.

It’s my mom calling me every time she hears about police activity in New York City, because she cannot safely assume that her middle-class, well-educated, well-behaved daughter was not assumed to be a threat by some trigger-happy cross-burner in a blue uniform.

It’s my husband seeing on his local news app that an unidentified Black female was snatched from a protest by men in an unmarked van and wondering if his wife is coming home alive that day.

You accused me of ending our friendship over politics, and that made me pause and wonder if I was overreacting. Maybe I was just too hot-headed in my frustration at seeing my people murdered time and again without any consequences for their killers, and I unfairly took that out on you. I wondered if maybe, once the situation calmed down, I’d look back and see that I was too harsh in cutting you off.

But now, as I for the first time process my feelings on a shooting without having to worry about the conversation we’ll have later- now I realize that I did the right thing by ending a friendship with someone who looks at what just happened and considers it a time for political debate.

I am not in the mood for a political debate after one of these police shootings. I am angry. I am scared. I am saddened.

I don’t need someone to ask me for an explanation of why these feelings are justified, as you do.

I don’t need someone to use me as a sounding board for opinions they’re afraid to express for fear of sounding like a racist, as you do.

I don’t need someone to argue that there are “good people on both sides” and that racism is just a distraction to keep them from hearing one another, as you do.

I need someone to be a friend. I need someone to understand how I feel. I need someone to empathize with me. I need someone to be an ally when I try to stop this from continuing to happen. And the things that I need are things that you’ve shown, for whatever reason, you’re not capable of doing.

**The fact that you continually treat the very idea that “Black Lives Matter” as a reason to start arguing about political affiliations and hidden agendas, instead of hearing it as a plea from your Black friend to not have to live her life in fear, is exactly the reason that I’m happy to stop calling you my friend.**

I won’t second-guess it again.",24Aug2020,1

I just got invited to be a bridesmaid at my close friend's wedding which is taking place in October. I would be jumping with joy if this was happening in 2019... or 2023. But now I will have to decline, even though I really, really, REALLY want to go. Arrrrgggghh.

Where I live in Europe nobody seems to believe in the coronavirus anymore and (judging by people's insta stories), everyone is out partying or vacationing. Meanwhile I have been pretty much a recluse for the last 6 months. Am I the only one who's insane enough to follow the rules? Am I a hypochondriac?

No job, no social or personal life, no achievements, nothing. This event would have been the one good thing happening to me in 2020. (Or?)

At the same time, I am scared because an event of this size is bound to be high risk, and I can't gamble the health of my family (with whom I live at the moment).

100,"Today I've come to the sad conclusion that I've unfortunately reached the lowest point I have ever been in my life. 
Let me give you some context as to what's going on:

- This year, I am entering my Senior Year of High School. I live in Canada, and here, the marks you earn during your Senior Year are the marks that Universities use to choose whether you are selected into their programs. Hence, if I get my act together now, I can get into Canada's most prestigious universities.
- Particularly, there is one university I specifically want to get into. It's the best one in Canada for the field that I want to get into. What's special about this university, however, is that they basically have entrance exams you need to do well in for you to get into their programs. This is another thing that I have to worry about. And if I get my act together, I can study hard for those entrance exams and do well.
- Also, I want to get good at some hobbies. And once again, if I get my shit together, I can get better at those.

Here is where the bad part comes.

Recently, I have been in a complete rut:

I've failed to get any productive studying done. I've got some done, but not nearly as much as I would have wanted.
I've been trying to quit porn since May of 2019 with little success. I've used porn to cope with feelings of stress, incompetence, and loneliness. I feel that porn makes me even lonelier and also gives me brain fog. The bad thing is that I've been relapsing extremely often recently (usually weekly). And whenever I relapse, I get really depressed and fail to do any work for the next couple of days -- I feel it's just overall terrible for my mental health as well. Additionally, since I relapse and get lonely, I start thinking about my girlfriend who I broke up with 3ish months ago. That doesn't help either :/

And to top things off, I have no social support. Throughout my earlier years of high school, I had a WAY bigger social group that I could talk to about stuff. They could support me when I needed them. And I could talk to them about usual life stuff too. It just made life a whole lot happier. That's all gone now though. I've tried to get help from my remaining friends that I haven't lost, but they either don't care or ghost me. It just makes this thing a whole lot harder man.


I know things could get worse, but in my eyes, I've hit rock bottom. I'm not looking for pity. I'm looking for solid advice. I have this great opportunity to get everything I've ever wanted in life. But my porn addiction, a lack of self-discipline, and a lack of social support has really led me astray from my goals.

""Call the police."" ""Run away, homelessness is better than where you're living"" and other things seem to be the only answers to some of these most shocking and desperate posts I see. And SO FUCKING OFTEN, the poster can't/won't do these things. So they come to the conclusion that it just has to keep happening and they won't even try.

Unfortunately a week ago my gf and I got into a major fight and we broke up, life seemed such that with the trajectory we were heading she could've been the one. I was devastated but 5 days later I had to take the GMAT as I was planning on applying for Business School. Unfortunately I bombed that and that plan is in tatters.

Today I got laid off after working 4 years (straight after college) in a high stress environment where I was often overworked, underpaid and under appreciated. Unfortunately I stuck with it because I am on a work visa and need the job to stay in the US. I considered myself intelligent and maybe it just hurts my ego more than anything that they want to cut my position and move it to India (Ironic cuz I am from India) 

Ive lived in the US for 8 years through college and my job and now I have to uproot my entire life and move back home, I dont think it makes sense to pursue my relationship cuz US-Canada LDR was hard but Asia-Canada would be even harder.

2 weeks ago I was excited for what the future held - Staying in an apartment with my girlfriend, picking out furniture together, applying for an MBA so our future would be bright and comfortable. 

In 1 week I lost my girlfriend, my job and my future. I have to leave behind everything I built here because my company that is privately owned wants to save my salary when the owner earns $60M in EBITDA.

I took everything I had for granted, complained when I had it all and allowed that to get the better of me and lost my girlfriend as a result. 

I hope to go back home, take a sabbatical and recover emotionally from this and come out a better person. As part of that I want to learn to appreciate what I have , love and cherish my friends and family and do everything I can to be a better person and work towards a good life. 

Thank you to those who have read this far, bless y'all and take care. 

Goodbye and God Bless America.",24Aug2020,1

117,"I often feel the same way everyday, just normal. Trying to achieve the best most day and constantly trying to improve myself. However I can recall to specific moments in my life where I felt so confident I could pull anything off. Usually it seems to be after a painful struggle to get out of somewhere hard (life crisis, existential crisis, a moment of self acceptance). However those moments never last, but it still seems like a possible self I could achieve. I personally think it might be a sudden spike in hormones like testosterone.

119,"I just got a text from someone who I think is very cute and who I feel very comfortable around. Since meeting on Tinder we've been on two dates (hangouts?) that have both gone really well. The text I just received indicates that they're free this weekend, which is really great news, but now I don't know how to respond.

Up until late middle school I was a greasy, weird kid. I didn't have that many friends and all the time that I spent on 4chan and similar communities did nothing to help my social development. I was bullied some about this (the biggest incidences being the two times when these popular girls asked me out as a joke) and that really crushed a lot of my self-esteem in regards to relationships.

Fast forward to my early 20s and I still find myself struggling with being romantically or sexually forward. This brings me back to that text. I find myself really wanting to respond with 'okay cool, wanna come to mine thursday after work?' and then, if it feels right, making out or having sex or something of that nature. But this is exceedingly difficult for me. Even just typing out my intentions makes me feel like a fucking weirdo. I think my internal self-image in respect to sex and relationships hasn't changed that much since I was younger. I still feel like a greasy, weird kid who nobody would ever want to touch.

She later moved in with him. When that happened I was devestated. I stated to meet other women while being with my son as much as possible.... Then she tried to come back and tell me she cared about me. All the while still hiding shit from me. I tried my best to still love someone that was insane and didnt care for me or anyone else. Well then i was convinced her getting pregnant again would solve these problems... Almost 15 years later I can tell you all so much more crazy stuff if you want to know.

Learning to love myself wasn't easy for me to do.

When I was a child, I was emotionally sensitive and curious, able to entertain myself for hours by just thinking in my head and being imaginative. I suppose you could say that I grew up ""normal"". I am the oldest, my sister is the middle child, and my brother is the youngest. For as long as I can remember, my mom did not have to work since my dad supported us by working and we lived pretty well. I came from a small town, and life was ""simple"". My two best friends were my neighbors, and I am fairly certain I spent more time with them throughout the day than I did at home. My neighbors were an old couple, both were at least 70 years old at the time. I will keep their names private, so I will call them John and Ruth. John and Ruth were basically my family when I was young, and at a very young age I started to question everything, and John always had an answer for me, but he never said ""I don't know"" when I asked a question. Ruth was the same exact way, but of course, she had given me a more motherly perspective of things. I grew up with this and learned a lot from both John and Ruth. John had passed away in 2010, he was 83 years old. Ruth is still alive today, and I visit her every chance I get when I return home.

The ""John and Ruth Story"" plays a huge part in how I grew up and viewed the world. At the time, my life was perfect. I was still very young and happy, I was able to talk about anything with literally anybody. As a kid, I was very social and happy. I would strike up conversations with strangers in public when I went out with my parents. Time was different then, life was good. All of that was about to change in the next few years.

My parents never argued in front of me as a kid, if they were to argue, they would do so behind closed doors. If I was to come in and interrupt, they wouldn't shout at me and they would stop their argument and tell me to go and play outside or go ahead and read a book because they were ""having a talk"". Looking back at this, I had very loving and supportive parents, everything was almost *too* good. Fast Forward to 2008.

I won't go into too much detail in describing 2008. Not that it bothers me, but 2008 is when my parents decided they were going to get a divorce. By this point in time my mom and dad were arguing nearly every day in front of us kids, and my mom would often bring my sister and I into the middle of it all. My dad rarely yelled, but my mom often pushed my dad to the point of yelling. A few days before my parents would ""officially"" sit us down and tell us about the divorce, I vividly remember my parents arguing. It was unreasonably loud (mainly due to my mom) and I remember telling my sister to go to our room and to not worry about mom and dad and to not be scared. I told her ""it's what grownups do"". I stayed in the living room, watching my parents bring the argument into the living room and seeing my mom shouting at my dad. As a kid, it was paralyzing to watch and hear all of this unfold around me, my world was crashing all around me. The night that my parents sat my sister and I down to explain the divorce was an emotional time. My parents sat next to each other and my mom told us ""Your dad and I are getting a divorce, and your dad is going to be moving out tonight"". My stomach dropped hard, and my sister started crying and went to our room. I couldn't move from my spot but I started to tear up but not exactly cry. I asked my mom why she was kicking dad out, and she really couldn't come up with a clear answer, and I remember looking at my dad and seeing him trying to force a smile as he was tearing up. I rarely ever saw my dad cry, and I said ""Dad I don't want you to leave, I love you"". My dad told me that he was going to be close by after he leaves and that he will see us soon. After my parents official divorce declared by the court, my mom ended up getting custody of us kids, and we would be able to see our dad every other weekend and we would have half of the summer with him. I'm not sure if this is important to the story, but my dad was also required to pay child support.

Being in 5th grade with newly divorced parents was very tough for me. In my head I was already blaming myself for my parents not loving each other and I put the pressure on my shoulders because I felt that I didn't do a good enough job of holding the family together. My mom soon began to fill my head with lies about my dad and his family, and how his family is evil and doesn't care about anyone but themselves. As a kid, I didn't know how to really handle all of this. On one hand I wanted to keep my dad and his family happy, and on the other hand I wanted to keep my mom and her family happy. I wanted everyone to be happy, like how we used to be. I wanted life to be how it was, but that wasn't the reality of it. I wanted to see my dad constantly, because he had moved in with my uncle who was only a few blocks away from us. I remember asking my mom to visit my dad and to see my uncle and she would repeatedly say no because ""it wasn't our weekend with him"". I began to hate myself even more, because I wasn't asking to see my dad just for myself, I wanted my sister to see him too but she was a very shy child and wasn't upfront enough to ask for something so me being the big brother, I would ask. The reason I began to hate myself was because of so many failed attempts at trying to see my dad and getting shut-down by my mom, and I saw myself as failing not only myself but my sister as well. I couldn't understand why I couldn't do things correctly.

Not long after my parents had separated, my mom started dating a new guy and introduced us kids to him very early (to keep names private, I will refer to him as Greg). I did not like Greg, because he was not my dad. I remember telling my dad about Greg and how I did not like him, and how my sister didn't like Greg either. My dad took what I said and more or less said ""That's how life is, but I will *always* be your dad"". I tried to understand what he was saying, but at a young age I couldn't really put it together at the moment, so I just went with it. When my dad's family started to catch wind about my mom now dating Greg, things got ugly. Every time I would go to see my dad's family I would always hear the family bashing my mom and Greg, and whenever I would go to see my mom's family I would always hear them bashing my dad and his family. It went on like this for a few years and amidst all of this, my mom let Greg move in with us. With everything going on, I began to retreat into my head more and more because I couldn't accept my failures and keep anyone happy. I lost myself in all of this and I didn't know who I was anymore.

In 7th grade, my mom and Greg moved to a town about 10-15 miles away from where my dad lived, taking us kids with. This resulted in me moving into a new school and having to start over with making friends and all of that. I won't mention too much about my dad and his side of the family because it's not really relevant. I was still able to see my dad and all that. But anyways, sometime between 7th-8th grade my mom and Greg had gotten married, and I became more and more irritated with everything. I'm not sure where it all started, but I began to notice that mom and Greg were ""broke"". There were times that the power had gotten shut off due to my mom and stepdad not paying the bills and my mom would tell us not to tell anyone. I remember doing homework by candlelight and sometimes not eating because of my mom and step dad. There were times where the water would get shut off and I had no choice but to keep my mouth shut since my mom would tell us to not tell anyone. There was one summer where it was extremely hot and humid outside and my mom had mowed the lawn, my sister and I were outside playing and mom had told us that we had to rake up all of the excess grass in the yard to make it look nice (mind you our yard was roughly 4-5 times bigger than a normal city lawn). So, my sister and I went and started that and the whole time our mom was yelling at us to work harder and would frequently remind us that we aren't moving fast enough. Well, in the midst of it all my sister and I had became quite thirsty, and we went to our mom asking her if we could take a break and get some water. My mom yelled at us and told us no and that we hadn't worked hard enough to take a break and get water. My mom and step dad had jobs, and still went to work every day, but money management wasn't their strong suit apparently. I started to hate my mom and ignore my step dad as I grew up in this environment because I felt that it wasn't something that a kid should have to deal with, to me, it was unfair to my siblings and I. My mom became increasingly toxic as time went on, and she began to drink more and more and taking her frustrations out on us kids. She never physically abused us but emotional abuse and verbal abuse were something that I experienced every day. It became a daily thing for my mom to call my sister and I into the living room not long after dinner and she would yell at us starting at 7 p.m. and it could last a few minutes, but most times it would last until 12-2 a.m. and this frequently happened on school nights.

Most times she was drunk, but there were times that she was sober but that didn't change what we had gotten yelled at about. My mom would yell at me and tell me how I'm never going to be good enough due to my grades in school, and I used to go hunting every fall but she stopped me from doing that because my grades weren't good enough to go hunting. She would tell me that my dad doesn't love me, and he is only using us kids to get back at her, and how he's the most horrible person on earth. She would tell me that I never do enough around the house and how I'm not prioritizing anything in my life. I remember telling her that I wanted to go into the Army and become a soldier, and she told me I would never make it because I am too sensitive. The list can go on, but I wanted to point out just a few things. Usually when mom would yell at me the way she did, Greg would also be present but wouldn't say anything to defend me, the most that he would do was sit there and watch everything unfold, and then intervene and basically reiterate what my mom was saying although he did not yell. As a kid, I knew what was going on was extremely irrational and wrong but there was nothing at the time that I could do to ease the situation.

Between 7th grade to around 11th grade (when all of this was going on) I remember going to my dad and telling him about all of this and I almost felt bad for doing so. My dad literally provided everything for me and picked up my mom and step-dad's slack as well (in terms of emotional support and financial support for us kids). Throughout the years (7th-11th grade) I would tell my dad that I wanted to move out and leave that place and move in with him and he would hear what I have to say and he would try and remain neutral because my dad never really bashed my mom and her family in front of me. In 11th grade, I decided that I had enough of mom and Greg and that it was time to move out and move in with my dad. If I'm not mistaken I was around 16-17 years old. (Also at this time I did have a pickup truck that my Uncle on my mom's side had given to me for my first vehicle).

The day before I moved out of my mom's I remember telling my very close friends about it and asked if I could stay at their place if things were to go badly and they all agreed and said they were all a call/text away. I thanked them all for this and I told them I would get in contact with them if the situation called for it. So, I had a backup plan to a backup plan and I was all ready for the next day when I wanted this to all happen. Fast forward to the next day and I am sitting up in my room trying not to mentally break down as I am planning this all out. I grabbed my backpack and another bag and I had put my supplies I needed for school and a few pairs of clothes in both of them. I grabbed my truck keys and closed my eyes as I was facing my closed door knowing that my mom and Greg were downstairs and my brother and sister were around the house somewhere. When I closed my eyes I told myself that I had to do this, and that I had to go through with it no matter how hard it is. It truly broke my heart knowing that I would be leaving my brother and my sister but I told myself I am the big brother and in my head I knew that I had to make an example out of myself. I open my door and start walking downstairs, heading for the door. As this was happening, mom and Greg saw me walking out and my mom had asked me where I was going. I froze. In my head I could explain everything in such detail I didn't even know if it was really me thinking all of it. But, the adrenaline of the situation had taken over and all I told them was ""I'm leaving for good"". I opened the door and walked faster and faster to my truck, but before I could make it my mom was already behind me yelling for me and Greg was standing on the deck watching this all go down. My mom instantly started crying and asked me where I was going to and I told her that I had enough of her and Greg and the way they live is nowhere near acceptable to anyone, especially us kids. My mom had immediately showed anger and started screaming at me and telling me that I'll never get anywhere by running away from my problems and as she was doing this she started to step closer and closer to me. I didn't really know what to do, so I opened up my truck door and tossed my backpack and bag in the passenger seat and shut the door and locked the doors with my key fob.

After that I started to walk away from my truck as my mom continued to yell extremely negative things at me, most of which I had heard already but until this point in time I had never lashed back and I had accepted what she had yelled at me for in the past, even if it weren't true. Now, I was about 20 feet away from my vehicle and my mom was begging me to answer her and tell her what I was doing. My voice was shaky but I told her that I needed to get away from all of this and I am moving in with my dad, and that it would be better for me there. She immediately lashed out and called me a pussy and told me that ""you are just like your father"" and a lot of other hurtful things (this was just what I remember most from this). I didn't let her finish her rant and I interrupted her and I said ""don't you get it? After all of this time it's still not clicking with you? You don't see the damage that you and Greg do, you guys think that everything is perfect when deep down you are literally destroying the lives of us kids. Before you come at me sideways and beat me down to nothing, maybe look in the mirror and fix your mistakes before coming at me like you are."". Of course, my mom didn't want any part of that and her mood changed almost instantly which was also very eerie. My mom is shorter than I am and she walks up to me and in the middle of it all somehow stopped crying and asked me ""how are you getting to your dad's?"" to which I replied ""I'm taking my truck"". She said to hell if you are, did you forget that you are a minor and your truck is in Greg's name? As soon as you leave this property in that truck we are calling the police department and reporting it stolen so let's see how far you get. Now, in my head and me being me I almost wanted to chance it and risk it all. But, I told her that I'll just have dad pick me up then, because I know that is completely legal. I also told her that if she were to interfere that I would call the police department on her for abuse and neglect. So, I called my dad and at this point I'll admit that I was crying on the phone to my dad and in between cries I had asked my dad if he can come pick me up from mom's because I finally stood up to her and I told him that today was the day that it all had happened. My dad told me that he would be there in 20 minutes and I said okay I will see you soon. After I had hung up my mom walked back inside the house and I had realized I forgot something (I can't exactly remember what it was) so I walked up to the house and opened up the door to go inside and I realize that Greg is standing there in front of me. He had asked what I was doing and I told him that I forgot to grab what I needed and he yelled at me to ""get the fuck out of his house"" and I yelled back stating that ""out of all of the times you had your chance to yell, this is the time you decide to?"" and he walked towards me and at that moment I realized that I'm not going to get what I needed so I walked backwards until I was standing in front of the doorway and at that moment Greg had slammed the door in my face. A few minutes later my dad was in the driveway waiting for me and I had gotten into his car and told him everything.

About a month after I had left my mom's house, my sister also moved out and moved in with my dad as well. My sister and I are close, and honestly I don't know what I would have done without her (to this day). I'm sure she feels the same way but in her own way, but to me I felt like we were all a family again (with my dad). I felt bad leaving my brother, but he was so young at the time that we didn't really connect as well as my sister and I considering that my brother is 10 years younger than I am, but, I still love him either way. Also too, I didn't want to drag him through the dirt just because I wanted him at dad's with all of us, I wanted him to grow up a little more first and I wanted him to formulate his own opinion on things. Once all of the dust had settled from this, I decided that it was time to reflect on how I felt and such. Honestly I didn't feel like the ""victor"" nor did I feel that I had ""won"". Even though I had taken myself out of the situation, the damage that was caused had honestly shook me at my core. I began to hate myself more and more because I didn't want things to go this way, and my past trauma had came up and I came to the conclusion that if I had just made everything right in the first place, none of this would have had to happen. This was my mindset for a long time, and it began to eat me alive. I tried to cope with it all, so I got into drinking and smoking weed and those types of things. Although I didn't really party, I knew I could drink until I blacked out to try and forget everything, and smoking weed had helped me finally relax and loosen up. I did this until the end of my senior year but it quickly had to change because I had ""signed the dotted line"" and enlisted in the Army as a tank mechanic.

About two months after I had graduated high school, I got sent to Fort Benning, Georgia for my basic training. For those who know about Benning, I did not go to Sand Hill. Instead I found myself at Harmony Church and I ended up completing basic and Advanced Individual Training (AIT) there and had gotten sent to Fort Hood, Texas for my first duty station. To summarize quite a bit, I only served 2 years and 7 months of my contract and I never had gotten the chance to deploy. I was already a salty Specialist, and to add the cherry on top I ended up getting medically discharged from the Army due to an incident at NTC (National Training Center) in California. Long story short, I was a ground guide for a newly promoted Sergeant (SGT) and he was a very good friend of mine. Initially I wanted to drive but he of course said no and I just had to come to terms with it all. Anyways, I had made it through the box (which is a 2 week ""combat"" simulation or call it what you will depending on your MOS), in which I was maintaining tanks and also a recovery specialist on the M88 crew. Now, since everything was basically said and done at this point in time, we had to turn in our vehicles at the rail head so they could be transported back to Fort Hood. Here I am ground guiding my SGT and we were following another one of our guys to the area because they knew where to go. We were turning in our up-armored humvees and everything was going smooth. (Also I am not superstitious by any means but in my left chest pocket I had carried a Polaroid of my grandfather from when he was in Vietnam because it made me feel comfortable since he had passed away in 2017). The ground guide for the humvee in front of us was putting out some weird hand signals for his driver and he had went out way left to signal his driver and my driver misinterpreted the situation and thought that the ground guide in front of us was signaling to him. My driver had forgotten I was in front of him and I heard him floor the humvee. I've honestly heard it all where people say ""why didn't you move?"" ""why didn't you turn around?"" and the list goes on but really if you ask anyone anything about the past, they'd probably agree that they would have done things a little differently. Honestly, it didn't click in my head that he was actually driving right away because I hadn't moved so where would he go right? Well, before I knew it the humvee had hit me in the back and in that moment I realized what was going on. Since it had rammed my lower back it caused me to fall forward and my adrenaline kicked in instantly so I couldn't feel from my waist down. As I was falling, I also realized that it was all happening so quickly that I didn't think to get out of the way so both of my feet were pinned under the tire. I was now on my stomach and feeling my bones break in my boots due to this up armored humvee running me over. I didn't yell out, scream, or cry. I just laid there and truly watched my life flash before my eyes. When my life was flashing it went back to when I was younger and happy and mainly dealt with my siblings and my dad. It was so bittersweet and I remember having this overwhelming happiness and almost a euphoric high from seeing all of it. But as soon as it started it was over and I had realized my driver had stopped driving. The humvee was on top of my ankles at this point and before I knew it, he started to back up and I could feel my bones being crushed and broken now a second time. Once he completely backed off of me, I did not hesitate to crawl away as far as I could because I knew I didn't want to do that again.

I finally sit up and look at my feet and ankles and reality started to set in. None of the bones had broke the skin but you could see that the way my bones were broken had caused the boots to look almost deformed. My driver comes out panicking and says ""I ran you over"" to which I replied ""no shit"". I did my best to maintain my sense of humor because it has definitely pulled me out of some dark times. Anyway my driver had helped me up and since my adrenaline was still surging I started to walk with my arm around his shoulder. As I was walking back to the humvee, I was looking at my boots and watching the bones move around in them and honestly I was dumbfounded at how I had survived. My SGT told me to stay in the driver's seat real quick as he went out front to talk to the other driver and ground guide. I pulled the picture of my grandpa out of my chest pocket and it was dirty and bent here and there but I thought to myself and smiled because I couldn't shake the feeling that he was there. My driver had came back and told me that I had to drive the rest of the way to the rail head because he didn't want to radio up and report this incident yet. I just agreed because I wanted to get out of there and the adrenaline was starting to wear off and the pain started to kick in. But, with two shattered feet and two shattered ankles I made it to our destination and long story short my SGT got on the radio and reported the incident and before I knew it I was at the hospital on base getting evaluated and all of that. The doctors had told me that they can't do anything due to the amount of swelling and they didn't want to risk anything on my end because of that. So, I shit you not they gave me some pain medication, a wheelchair and crutches and told me that they will be in contact. I had gotten brought back to the tents at NTC where I stayed for a week with still no word on surgery. They had bandaged my feet and ankles and had put me in two air casts and I was taking all of the Oxy and Percocet that I could handle. At the end of our unit's rotation, they ended up flying me back to Fort Hood where I had my surgery. The surgery took roughly four and a half hours and they ended up putting two plates, an endless amount of wires and 12 pins in my left foot. They didn't want to do surgery on my right foot because they didn't want me to be completely immobile so I just went along with it and honestly my left foot was definitely worse than my right.

The surgery ended up a success but the doctors told me I would never walk again due to the severity of my injuries and I just agreed and went along with it but in my head I wanted to die. At this point in time I was 20 years old and I was told that I wasn't going to ever walk again by some health care professionals. For the next 5-6 months I was at a very low point in my life, I began to eat and drink liquor constantly and frequently mix alcohol and percocet together. I began to abuse the medication, sometimes taking 10-12 percocet a day at my maximum. I saw no future for myself and I figured that my life was over at this point, because up until the incident I was trying hard to get away from where I came from and now with this, it was like a reset button on progress I couldn't save. I was extremely suicidal but never truly told anyone because in my eyes no one needed to worry about me more than they already do. I was just hoping that one day I'd take one too many pain medications and just ""slip away"". One day when I was in my room alone I told myself to shake this mentality once and for all, so I told myself that I was going to learn how to walk again, I was going to force myself. Well, I took four percocet pills and got up on my walker and told myself to walk with it. In all honesty, I had forgotten how to walk so I looked up a YouTube video on the motions of it and followed that. That same day I was walking. I could not believe myself because not even a week prior I was just wanting to commit suicide and forget it all. Long story short, I began to walk again and eventually stopped taking pain medications and also had no withdrawals which was very surprising.

I ended up getting transferred to another unit about 6-7 months after my injury so that I could rehabilitate and enjoy my life a little better not being in a line unit anymore. It was a good unit for the most part, and I had met many people there that took me under their wing and helped me in ways words can not explain. When I had gotten to that unit, I really didn't think of my injuries anymore and I thought that it was all in the past because well, what happened had happened already. But, that's when the flashbacks started, and the night terrors as well. In this unit you also get set up with the VA before you discharge so that you are already good to go before you leave. I would talk to the VA about all of this going on and when they did my evaluation they said that I had: PTSD, Adjustment Disorder, Chronic Pain, Arthritis, Anxiety, and Depression. The last two diagnosis were nothing new to me but everything else was and it was an absolute disaster. I began to lose sleep day by day and I became extremely irritable and even more depressed. After I had discharged from the Army, things kept getting worse. I started to drink more, and I was a very angry person back then. I'm not sure why people stayed around me because really I couldn't even stand myself. I had really bad panic/anxiety attacks and I started to dissociate daily. Suicide became relevant in my life again and I remember bargaining with myself and just trying to talk myself into it but something unknown always stopped me. Looking back on this I am glad I didn't go through with it, because I would have missed out on many things in my life, so I am grateful every day that I am alive now. I won't say things are 100% better, because well, I'm not the ""old"" me anymore. But, I can walk and drive, I can jog and all of that good stuff.

Now I'm going on 22 years old and at this exact point in time, life couldn't be any better. I slowed WAY down on my drinking and these days I hardly ever drink. There's a couple of times I'll get a little too drunk but nowhere near what I used to do. In fact, I'm trying to quit drinking as a whole because I don't enjoy the feeling anymore so that is my current goal with that whole ordeal. Also too, I stopped being religious back in 7th grade and I didn't really believe in anything until I was around 18 years old. I picked up on becoming spiritual and being on that spectrum of life. Now, I meditate, astral project, lucid dream, give myself tarot readings and oracle readings, and now I am just trying to connect more with the divine. Since I started practicing these things a lot more recently, I can't really pinpoint the last time I was anxious or depressed. I can't remember the last time I had flashbacks or night terrors. Honestly life is so amazing right now, and the funny thing is that I've come to terms with everything negative that had happened in my life and switched everything around to really just channel positive energy. I finally love myself and I am going to keep going on that road of loving myself and those around me in hopes that I can pull someone out of a dark place and help them get on their right path as well.

I wrote this story to try and inspire those who are going through a tough time and see no end in sight or even if you are having a bad day I want to try and break you out of that. Know that no matter where you come from, whatever negativity has come into your life, or where your mindset is, you can grow and work on becoming the best version of yourself every single day. Some things in life aren't easy by any means but that doesn't mean you should flat out give up. Try to challenge yourself and create a better version of yourself for the sake of YOU. Although some aspects of life may be out of your control, you can always move up in any way you choose. It doesn't matter what your belief system is, or your religious views, we are all here to learn and grow and I hope that I can help someone with their life by writing this out. Honestly, writing this out helped me a lot with working out trauma and negative aspects in my life and I hope this can shed some light in some way, shape, or form. Stay safe and love one another.

150,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

I’m 6ft tall and thin and lanky and she’s very pretty tbh",24Aug2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having a very difficult time recently and my mental health and will to live has taken a drastic nosedive. Nothing seems to be working and I feel like my life is out of my control. Day one of being in the shelter with my kids I've already killed three roaches and a bedbug. I’m really really really struggling and something needs to give.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to go (climb through the window) to “my” house. The house that for nearly 20 years brought me peace,security, and calm. You know that feeling you get when you are homesick and just want to sleep in your own bed? The phrase “it feels so good to be home” is what I’m desperately seeking. The familiar smell of “home” as soon as you walk through the door. I wanted to bottle up a little of that and get a few whiffs. I was so sure that going into that brick ranch on Vista Drive would be my cure all.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it was wrong and I know I shouldn't have invaded their privacy but prior to today I thought their privacy was my privacy because one day they would wake up and realize what a huge mistake they made. I was wrong. It didn't take long to “snap out of it” and realize this was not my home. Sure the same tan oversized sectional that had a permanent indent of my ass was still in the living room except the indent on my favorite cushion was gone. Sure the same family pictures of the people I spent nearly 20 years with were on the wall including a few new ones. But I was missing from them. Do you remember growing up when you would get your yearbook and if you had a falling out with a friend you would scribble their picture and name out? That is what was done to the pictures of which i was previously in, except it was done with photoshop, not sharpie markers. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I pulled away I started uncontrollably full body sobbing. I wasn't crying because they painted over my growth chart on the door frame or because they wiped every last bit of my existence from the house. I wasn't crying because it no longer smelled like home. I constantly made up excuses as to why they cut me out of their life and ignored me anytime we were in the same place. Maybe they didn’t recognize me. Maybe they have vision loss and can’t see without glasses and they left them at home. Maybe they switched phone numbers and my texts don't ever go through despite being left on read. I was full body sobbing because I realized that I will never have another Christmas in that basement with my family and I'll never know why. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been trying to get through recent life altering events as best as I can. I’m trying to be strong for my kids and not be angry that our current living situation has bugs. I'm trying to get help where there is none so that I can get a place again because I had a creepy landlord and had to move. I'm trying to believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that one day soon life will go back to normal and I can go back to living a fulfilled life with my babies. How do I keep going after losing the one thing I was hoping for and hanging onto? Hope is one of the most dangerous things to lose. I feel like the grieving process just started because while I'm ignorant, I’m no longer in denial and all hope for a future with my family is gone.",24Aug2020,1
