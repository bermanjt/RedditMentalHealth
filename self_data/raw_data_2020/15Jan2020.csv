2,"I'm either sad and self loathing


Having anxiety about death and expectations

Or thinking up situations that would make people sad, and being sad that they probably happen. They're all weirdly specific too.
 

Ex) some young kid getting bullied and having his favorite toy that was a gift broken. You know how fucking traumatic that would be for a kid?

Or shit like that bad inner feeling both parties get when someone doesn't like a gift, with one person sad that their gift wasn't enough and the other appreciating the gesture but not loving the gift


The ladder two are once a week-two weeks, but just make me feel shitty

7,"Positive thinking is the single most powerful energy that directly shapes our world and the reality we experience. Because *the way we see the world creates the world we see*, it is important to fill the mind with positive, wholesome thoughts that inspire hope and growth. By conditioning the mind to think with positivity and open-mindedness, we eradicate the negative, harmful and stress-inducing conditions that cause us so much pain and suffering.

Consequently, we create a pleasant, joyful and meaningful world that we can share with others. Below are three essential qualities that make up the core of all positive thinking minds. They are

\- Thoughts of gratitude

\- A mind of resilience

\- Thinking beyond oneself.

10,"Made a throw away account to post this experience. i was stalked by a Demon or some kind of negative energy for 5 months. Now this happened back in 2011 so my memory might be a bit hazy since it was so long ago, the only people ive told about this is my mother long time ago and my cousin more recently but that will come into play later. Ask my questions about my experience if you wish.

&amp;#x200B;

It was April 2011 and i was 15 going into 16. I suffer from depression and anxiety today and back then is when they started to manifest so back then is when i first started to feel these feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

My cousin said that maybe feeling depression for the first time is what summoned this ""thing"" due to the aura of how i was.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot remember when i first felt it but i'll outline what it felt like and how my senses knew it was around/where it was how it moved about and my minds eye could almost see what it was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

It was an overwhelming feeling of dread, tension and negativity as if i was in danger and i could feel it around the room. 

I would see its shadow at night. The way my house is there is a street lamp outside so some light comes in through the closed curtains and thats where i would see its shadow moving across the room. I know some of you might be saying it couldve been someone walking past outside but i assure you there was no sounds at all it was dead silent and it would just move very slowing accros the light bleeding in.

&amp;#x200B;

I was lying in bed one evening and suddenly my sixth senses would feel it enter the room or manifest its presence and i would feel it move around the foot of the bed and around the room. My eyes couldn't help but be drawn to it so i was looking in the directions and following it move. This would happen regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

Even doing business in the bathroom i felt it watching me and i felt very uncomfortable like someone really was watching me. In the shadow i would be scared to close my eyes when washing hair because my nerves where going that something bad would happen in that vulnerable state.

It would shake the bed at night too. Not violently but still noticeably.

&amp;#x200B;

This thing would also follow me everywhere I went to visit some family 5 hours away and it came with. I remember feeling it going around their house at night while everyone slept. The house had an upstairs and thats where it would reside when everyone was awake mostly. I remember sitting with my back turned again the front door and i felt it standing out in there just watching all. The feeling and vibe was so bad i had to move chairs so i could see where my back was turned as it felt like it would pounce any second from behind.

&amp;#x200B;

Eyes closed at night trying to sleep i would see these very scary demonic faces in my vision or minds eye i guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Few months later i went away on summer vacation in August to see more family and again it followed. The house we were staying in had a separate room i would feel it in there moving around and peering from the door.

&amp;#x200B;

This ""thing"" finally went away by September, i didn't feel anything or it and everything has been normal since then. Haven't felt anything like it since.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time i did get more interested in hauntings and demonic entities purely so i could understand this thing and what to do. It never did anything like move objects around, cause disturbances or harm anybody or me thankfully. The reason for that i believe is because during my research i found that the best way to combat it is to not pay it any attention because they feed of fear.

&amp;#x200B;

So i never did anything to try and show it i was scared of it, i never told anyone about during those months and i never once tried to tell it to make itself known or agitate it. No blessings or cleansing of the house either.

&amp;#x200B;

And thats it. I sincerely hope i remembered everything or the good stuff at least and i hope you found it interesting. Also ask me questions if you want, your questions might even make me remember some more details",15Jan2020,1

Mine is :-
So my gf said that let's meet at the metro station (train station) (we always meet there) so i can walk with her to her school , she said I'll be there @7:15 A.M and i will wait till 7:35 , i reached at the metro station at 7:22 AM she was not there so i waited till 7:35 and then i decided to leave and go back home and i decided to not go from walking i decided to go from the metro (Train).

So i got a ticket to my home station then i got to the checking area where they check bags and shit i had my bag with me because i said at home I'm going to take classes (in india you can't have a relationship if your parents are strict) then i putted my bag on the X-ray machine and then i realized i had my vape (Electronic smoker which is illegal here) in my bag but i was too late i walked slowly to the guard who checks us with a security scanner. Then he checked me then i waited for my bag to come out of the x-ray machine then i saw the other guard that checks the stuff in the bag passed through the x-ray machine he looked at me and said ""what's inside""?

I said ""Books and energy drinks"" the guard said ""Open the bag"" (ngl my heart was like jumping around at the time my hands were shaking like crazy) then i opened my bag very slowly i showed him my Books then he said ""no , there is like a powerbank or something"" i said ""it's energy drinks"" and then i showed him my energy drink he readed ever single fuckin' word on my energy drink and then he said ""you have a power bank like thing what's that"" i was scared so I thought i should tell him the truth so i said ""yes it's a vape""

He said show me so I pulled my vape from my bag he looked at it for like 5 second and then superior guard that was sitting a lil far from us shouted ""What is this?"" To the guard i would've shitted my pants if the guard didn't suddenly said ""Sir it's a perfume"" and then looked at me and asked loudly so the superior guard can hear ""It's a perfume , right?"" I said ""Yes it's a perfume"" then i got my bag with the speed of the light and walked very fast.

I was feeling like they will shout from my back hey come here so ran ,then i got on the metro and i was smiling like crazy that I'm safe and i got home and i was feeling like a drug smuggler at that time and i remember i was smiling and laughing a lil bit all the way home. I still can't figure out why the guard asked me that is it that he wanted to save me or just he doesn't knew idk. I'm glad I'm safe and home.

It all started in my sister's wedding! I was really suffering from a midlife crisis as I still had no clue on what I really wanted from life. I have always been someone that all my friends seek out when they are in need of help and understanding what their concerns are as well as empathising with them just came naturally to me! I wrote a stand up routine at my sister's wedding and I was nervous as hell before I went to do that! Stage fright coupled with thoughts on what all my relatives would think and even the thought of stand up at a wedding all felt strange but I had made up my mind ! I wrote the content and refined it over time and noticed a part of me that I never knew existed ! Content writing! I have had my fair share of poems and articles but I had always written as a way to understand myself but this was different!! 
My stand up was awesome and I just had to try something with this!! I clenched my fists and started thinking about what I truly want and where can I really provide value and that's when a topic called ikigai came to me ! I thought I could write.. I have always been interested in philosophy and self improvement.. maybe this way I could learn more myself and share my experiences with the world !! And maybe people might like it as well!!

My social anxiety is bad to the point where I only have a few friends, and I hardly see them because of my anxieties.  The place where I go to school has a shortage of mental health care, so what I'm provided is few and far in between no matter my efforts.  Although I'm not suicidal, I am consistently depressed or going through hard manic episodes.  With that, I just have no idea whether the next semester should happen or not - I have hardly gone to classes lately but I'm terrified of leaving campus for a more permanent break.  Living with my parents is my only other option, but my mom suffers from mental illness that makes it difficult to live with her.  

Should I take a semester off, get therapy, and improve my mental health to go back Fall 2020?  Risking a tense living situation with my mother, working part-time, but regularly seeing mental health care professionals and close friends?  Or should I just stick it out and go through with the next semester?  Which would mean I'm risking further damaging my mental health, but still solidly continuing my education?  Either option has risk and reward, and honestly the thought of moving back home is terrifying.

34,"The past year has been dedicated to self-development, healing, and search for inner happiness and meaning. Because of that, I purposefully stayed single and tried to avoid relationships as they are only distractions away from my goals. 

Towards the end of the year, I met a man while I was studying at Starbucks and he was working on his laptop. I started seeing him more often in the cafe and we eventually exchanged contact information. Our text messages were basically essays. We had so much to talk about. 
He waited patiently for the semester to end before he asked me out because he knew I was dedicated to my work and studies. 

We get along really well: he’s so kind and respectful. He’s very thoughtful and only wants to see me happy. He will go out of his way if I need something. He’s so happy when I’m around him. We could talk to each other for hours on the phone. He allows me space when I need it. He’s extremely intelligent and fascinating to listen to when he becomes interested in something. He has expressed that his intentions are long term and he hopes this is something we both agree to accomplish. He’s even been planning future trips for us. Finally...someone who I feel comfortable and safe being around. 

But I don’t think I’m ready for it. I’m not ready to give up my independence and freedom. I’m barely understanding how to love myself and have embraced my newfound independence. I’m so scared that I will fall back into my codependent ways. But at the same time, I can’t help but to feel like I discovered a unicorn. A part of me doesn’t want to let him go. He’s good in so many ways. I am lucky. However, I can’t find seem to let myself give him my full heart. I’m too curious about the world out there and what it has to offer and a relationship seems like it would limit those opportunities.

45,"I got fired today from a job. I’ve worked for a week and a half at the place. At first, I thought it was reasonable, since I wasn’t really doing a good job and wasn’t meeting deadlines. But when discussing with relatives, they say that it is equally the fault of my supervisor and the workplace. I really need some input to see whether I should be beating myself up over it or what I should take away from it. During the period of time, I made four mistakes (that I know which contributed to the final decision). 

&amp;#x200B;

1. On the first day, I was ordered to create a file for evidence and correspondence for two people. I was ordered to follow an already made chronology document to get the order right, as they wanted me to do it chronologically. So, I searched up the names and compiled the documents. However, what I didn’t realise was that they wanted me to print out all the documents in the folder, as they were all related two these two individuals (one of them was the client). I think it was my mistake for not clarifying properly before starting the task. Because of this I wasn’t able to complete the task by the second day, which was the deadline.   

2. Another problem I had with the aforementioned task was when I was ordering it chronologically. I was ordered to follow the chronology document which had dates for documents. I did so and ordered it accordingly. However, some had the date of receipt of the document instead of date it was created (these could differ drastically). I ordered it based on dates on chronology. I did end up asking about this at the very end, and found out to order them on the creation date. But, by then I wasn’t able to properly do it as I was following the chronology and I was already past the deadline.
3. I wasn’t able to meet a deadline for a task which was scheduled to be completed an hour after the email was sent. It was a simple formatting task where I was instructed to number  paragraphs. I encountered troubles logging in, as I didn’t have the password, but after that I started the task. I finished it off and asked my supervisor to check. The supervisor instructed me to change numerous things like justifying the text, moving things around as they had been moved when converting the files, making small changes to spacing as some paragraphs were spaced a bit more or less after the conversion. I wasn’t able to implement these changes on time and was thus not able to meet the deadline. The boss said that they completed it in less than 5 minutes. I am a bit sceptical that these minute details were needed or that it required this level of detail, as I don’t think these changes could have been completed in that time frame. The supervisor was CCed so they knew about the deadline and they would have known if these were needed.
4.  When ordering chronologically, I used the date on the front of the email or report after being reprimanded for the chronology document. However, for some emails, they wanted me to order it by the date the emails were initially sent instead of by the date on the front, as they were just forwarded these emails. So, the important date was the date which the initial correspondence between parties was sent.   


These were the mistakes I made during the past 7 days. Were these mistakes reasonable? I need some feedback from an external party, as I’ve been feeling mixed. On one hand I feel like I could have been more competent, but on another hand, I felt like I wasn’t taught well. This was in a legal role, for people still studying at university.

48," Hey I tried to post this in r/unpopularopinion but it got removed immediately fsr. 

I know Ill get hate for this, but I think if we look at our current situation, we are not able to save this planet or at least life as we know it now. People who deny climate change are being elected in countries that were thought to be the leaders in bringing progress to the problem. Its an impossible thing to force people to stop eating meat. Its an impossible thing to ban plastic. All while the sea levels are still rising and the world population explodes. The refugee crisis Europe experienced is nothing compared to the amount of people that will have to be evactuated when coast cities will flood. Natural disasters will only increase and more people will suffer from that.

Further, people dont realize that the shipping industry produces waaaay more CO2 than all the cars in the world combined. The major problem are not the cars, its the big cargo ships burning oil so that we can order some tech gadget from amazon.

So yeah, I think life as we know it has an expiration date. You might not agree but I think its a fairly comfortable thought once you accept it. Just sit back, grab a drink and watch the world burn.

Just felt like I had to get it out there. Cheers",15Jan2020,1
49,"I'm 35.  

I have a bachelor's degree in psychology.  

That's about it. 

I've never had a job that paid more than $40,000 per year, and that's HIGH.  

i've never had a job that didn't make me totally miserable (retail, sales). 

I recently quit my job and enrolled in a tech program at the local community college.  

All my classmates are 18 or 19, fresh out of high school. 

They are all smarter than me and have experience in the field either from working part time, having an internship, or doing some special stuff in high school. 

The ones who don't already have jobs are now getting them thanks to their previous knowledge and experience. I applied to the same jobs listing my bachelor's degree, management skills, etc, hoping that maybe SOME employer out there might want someone with less experience, but more maturity, work experience, etc. I didn't even get invited for an interview.  

The more I talk to these students the worse I feel. I ask them how they learned all this stuff already, who taught them, etc. They learned in middle school/high school from their parents, or from part-time jobs that their parents encouraged them to pursue, or taught themselves online for years as a hobby, etc.  

When I was in high school I barely got through because my parents beat me and my brother all the time and never taught us anything. My brother and I got kicked out of high school at different times for poor attendance, got into drugs, got into trouble, etc. 

So whenever my classmates at community college tell me about all the amazing things they did in middle school and high school to progress their careers all I can think about is how while they were doing all these great things and learning a bunch of things, I was getting the shit beaten out of me by my dad and doing drugs with my brother and a bunch of shitty people we met and getting in trouble with the cops. And now I'm getting older and older with zero career options besides going back to retail like a schmuck, hoping to god that this community college thing works out. 

I can't get any financial aid since having  bachelor's degree disqualifies me. I'm paying the whole thing out of pocket with the money I've saved up from my shitty jobs. If this doesn't work out I'll be totally broke with TWO useless degrees instead of one (the bachelor's of psych from a decade ago and an associate's of networking tech) and I'll have to crawl back into some shitty retail job again while the world passes me by.

59,"This is probably going to sound pathetic and narcissistic but here goes nothing. I (21F) was average looking at best in high school, boys didn't like me, I was insecure and all I wanted was to be more attractive, so I made it happen. 

Over my senior year of high school and the years following I lost weight and toned up, cleared my skin, re-did my hair, got veneers to fix my gappy teeth and started dressing and changing my look to suit my features. Everyone who knew me before these changes remarks how much I've 'glown-up' and how insane my transformation was. I went from a 5-6/10 to what my friends say is a now 9.5/10. 

I'm not gonna lie, there has been some great things to come from becoming 'traditionally' attractive, but I also feel like it's now ruining my life and I don't know what to do. 

To start off with, my friends. I've lost practically all of them over the last year and it has nothing to do with my personality and they've admitted that. One of my best friend's boyfriend made one too many inappropriate remarks about me, so she now avoids spending time with me over fear her boyfriend is too attracted to me. Another close friend has become paranoid her new boyfriend will follow suit if I spend too much time with them too. I was basically relegated to hanging out with my single friends, but I started to notice them going out without me more and more. I confronted them about this and they told me that when they're trying to meet boys and I'm around I shift the attention away from them and they feel ignored and therefor bad about themselves and the way they look compared to me, and that they can't help their jealousy. As for my male friends, well, those with girlfriends don't like that they're partners are so close with me and see me as a threat. Aaaand the single ones - only seem to be interested in one thing with me these days and it's not friendship. 

Although I understand where all of my friends are coming from, I used to silently resent my more attractive friends out of jealousy, it still sucks. I'm not purposefully trying to cause any problems, and they know that, and have apologised for cutting me out but they feel they have to for themselves and their relationships. 

And then there's work. I landed an amazing grad job after finishing college last year and my job involves a lot of face-to-face with the company's clients and potential new ones. Just recently we were super close to closing a deal with a huge new client, an amazing opportunity for the company and we were all so excited. Then I found out my boss rejected the deal and wouldn't tell me why. A co-worker did but, apparently my boss overheard the client's reps making numerous perverted comments about me and my boss decided it would be best not to make me work with them. 

I know it wasn't my fault but I feel awful that I cost the company maybe our biggest deal ever. Then my co-workers told me that it wasn't the first time something like this had happened. A client once didn't renew a contract after he'd asked one of my superiors for my personal number and they had declined to give it to him. Another time a client apparently remarked to my boss that they believed I was only hired as eye-candy for them, and my boss decided not to do any more business with them after that. I love my job but I genuinely feel like I'm hurting the company I work for if my looks are causing a problem with multiple clients. Part of me wants to ask for a demotion to a desk job and part of me is scared I'll get let go because I'm more trouble than I'm worth. Part of me also wonders if I was just hired as 'eye-candy' and if landing such an amazing job did have more to do with my looks, or if working my ass off at college for years was a waste.

Overall - I'm 21, I have almost no friends and no social life, I can't make a genuine connection with anyone because guys just wanna sleep with me and to top it off, being too attractive is actually hurting my career. Should I just make an effort to look worse? Is that fair? I finally feel good about the way I look but I can't enjoy it because it's sending me backwards in life. How do I make new friends that won't be threatened by my looks? I know this is such a stupid problem to have and I'm sorry if this all sounds pathetic to you.

61,"  My thoughts are kind of everywhere so I'm sorry. Recently I've had some, what seems to be repressed memories coming to light and I'm completely freaking out about it. I legitimately don't know if this is normal or not so please please tell me Im wrong and that Im overthinking this if you think I am.

   
 

I have a few male first cousins, and I am extremely close with all of my first cousins in general. They are all like brothers and sisters to me, and I am one of the youngest out of them all. I remember these things happening when I was younger but only recently did they resurface...For simplicity's sake, there are 2 cousins involved. There is **A** who is 29M this year, and there is **M** who is 26M this year. I'm 23F this year if it helps.

   
 

When I was in middle school (grade 8), **M** and his family had traveled from the home country to move to my country permanently. We all had separate rooms, and I had my own of course. The odd thing is........I distinctly remember several nights where I woke up thinking someone was in my room but went to sleep. But then one night, I very clearly remember waking up and looking at the mirror across from my bed. I thought I was crazy but I saw a reflection of a guy. I panicked a little and quietly said ""...Who is that? ....papa?"" Silence. Then I asked again who it was and then realized with confusion it was **M**. The weird thing was that he was completely crouched over, hidden at the foot of my bed. The only reason I saw him was because of the mirror. I asked him what he was doing cause I was confused and he didn't say much, just said he was ok. I was worried thinking he was sick, and he wouldn't get up. I asked him several times if he was ok, did he need something, was he feeling unwell, Why won't he get up? That one stuck out....he would NOT stand up. He just said he'd get up in a minute but for me to go back to bed. I was so.....confused. But I went back to sleep and I forgot it ever happened. But recently it came back up and I......Am I crazy? I can't imagine any reason he would have done that except.....yenno...masterbating I guess? It makes me want to vomit to even say that but his behavior was just so.....odd???? and the fact that he refused to stand up or get up, he was so evasive and seemed a little panicked when I had awoken. That makes me wonder about the other nights I heard someone in my room and I......was it him those times as well????? And was it really just innocent? But what reason would he be in my room in that position, HIDING FROM ME and REFUSING TO GET UP at 2:00 in the morning???

   
 

The other thing that I think triggered this has to do with **A**. **A** is not married and is a bit on the awkward side. He's got a lot of pressure on him and he's a good guy at heart but.....there are things he does that I don't know if it's normal or not, but makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Idk if im overreacting and I just need to understand. It started around highschool. Whenever id go over if no one was around and he would come into the same room as me (often the kitchen) hed give me a hug from behind......but hed always push me into the countertop. It made me extremely uncomfortable to have him that close and....well, I mean, his whole front was on my whole back if you get my flow and it made me feel weird considering we arent super duper close or anything. Or, other times, he would give me hugs but seem to linger for a bit longer. Or, at times if I come over I'll go to his room to say a quick hello and give him a hug but if no ones around sometimes he would pull me down onto his lap. The thing is, this was very prevalent for a short while, as in, he did it all the time when I came over or he came over to my house....Then it stopped for a while when I went off to uni.

   
 I think what triggered all of this and the panic I'm feeling about it is, just 2 days ago **A** had failed a very important test he needed to pass for his career. He was super glum and I and his sister (my cousin) had decided to surprise him with some food and drinks he likes to cheer him up. When I came over and said my hello, he was in his room. Immediately......he pulled me down onto his lap and held on to me. I felt acutely uncomfortable and just sorta did that thing where you smile and laugh and change the subject and sort of just did my best to stand back up and tell him to come down cause we had a surprise for him. I'm 23, and he's 29.....this can't be normal right?

   
 

I just have this nagging nasty disgusting feeling I can't shake. I can't stop thinking about these incidences over the last few days and its been triggering a bit of a depression because....it can't be right????? It's not like they were molesting me....were they? Am I overthinking this? I literally want to cry because this is driving me insane.

   
 

It's driving me mad. I need some perspective here and I don't know if I'm crazy. There are more incidences like these, and id love to share but I just don't know what real and what not anymore and I want to cry. Please help, I dont know where else to post this",15Jan2020,1
62,"For years at the bus station there has always been a dining area and a large table bench for people waiting for buses to buy coffee and food and wait for their bus since I live in a cold weather area.

Recently I came back after a few years and went to the station and see the DD still there but dozens of chairs completely removed and only some empty tables. People are now sitting on the benches where people used to put their food.

Finally an older cleaning lady came by and I asked her what was going on. She responded in a nasty tone “There are no chairs, too many homeless people sleeping in them”

I was incredulous, not only to how spiteful this “solution” was but also to how ass backwards it is. I said to her
“These people sleep on the concrete streets, what does having a chair mean to a homeless person they just want shelter from the cold”. 

She didn’t acknowledge my statement and said “Gotta keep the homeless people out”

In fairness,  since I last went there it looks like barely anyone was there, so their ridiculously spiteful and heavy handed approach to deal with homeless people (instead of other effective measures like a security guard) has tanked their own store volume although I doubt they care, since I believe the area is technically just an extension of the bus station.

63,"I discovered Buddha and his teachings in 2009 when I was 19. This same phase is where I discovered cannabis, mushrooms, and LSD. Over the next decade, I got fully immersed in learning everything I could about the Cosmos and Dharma and striving to live in harmony with it. I learned about meditation at the Tibetan monastery in my city, it happened to be partnered with a major university nearby for neuroscience research.

My journey spanned across space and time as I studied the ancient world and tried to integrate it into modern life through creativity, service, and entrepreneurship. Around 25, I started to apply the 80/20 rule to my life every year and started to shed possessions, relationships, ambitions, vices. It's interesting how 64% of the total value comes from 4%.

By 27.5, I wasn't drinking beer or smoking weed and barely eating meat or processed foods. I was able to consolidate my life down to a backpack and a briefcase. It was liberating in many ways. Around this time, I went to an ayahuasca retreat and start to shed inner weights like resentments, fears, trauma, repressed emotions. I also started to see just how subtle the ego was in it's constant manipulating.

At the end of 2018, after a few months on the road exploring the National Parks, my grandmother had a stroke and I helped take care of her. In her final days, I saw first hand the things that inspired Buddha to leave the palace behind: aging, sickness, death, awakening. I started to realize a lot of things in a deeper way but felt Buddhism was not for me because it has become another -ism full of dogma. I still study Buddha though, funny thing is that he wasn't 'a Buddhist.'

In 2019, I began to study the connections between different civilizations and find the common ground. I met many characters in my travels clinging to concepts, identities, and ambitions. They reminded me of my younger days where I thought salvation was out there. I got into a routine of waking up at 5am and noticed 'time clutter' start to disappear. I noticed social media had much less appeal to me because it caused more suffering than joy, even reddit was losing it's appeal.

After another month long roadtrip in August, I revisited ayahuasca and got the message, 'You are the Way'. I went to a meditation retreat in December and the teacher started his first lecture with the same message: 'You are the Way.' That brings me to the present moment sharing this journey and what I've learned with you. I hope this message finds you well and helps you on your journey.

I dunno maybe the text just sent in the wrong order it’s happened before but I also felt like maybe it wasn’t. I dunno. I feel hurt. She’s probably the only friend I had left I felt comfortable talking to and now I feel like a chump and like I should keep self isolating further into books until I’m alone and have no one left to hurt me.

70,"A lot of men (not excluding myself) complain/have complained that chicks only want guys that treat them like dirt. Maybe this is true to some extent, but when I look at it, these women choose these guys because even though they may be assholes, they are men. 

Big muscles, rough hands, facial hair, what makes a man a man. Most guys that complain that these women who choose these manly assholes, tend to be the ones who carry the most bitch non manly tendencies. 

The only thing manly about me is my penis size. Every woman I’ve been with has praised me for this, however, I’m 21,  5’10”, under 125 lbs, have pubic hair for facial hair, and my arms look like two sticks you break off a tree. But hey at least my aesthetic is cool.  “You’re a boy, not a man.”

My last girl and I got into an argument, she says that no woman would ever love me because I’m a boy not a man, I’m ugly , anorexic blah blah and I forgot what else she said but it was just senseless babbling. She also admitted to only using me for what I could provide on top of giving me an STD. God, I love life. 

I believe her on the part that I will never be loved. Every girl ever has cheated on me except for my very first girlfriend when I was 16. I feel damaged, and they say damaged people attract damaged people. I however only wanted to give what I feel I never had. Love, and if we could achieve happiness together, then I’m all in. 

It never seemed to work. The relationship would be fine until I find some text from a past ex, baby daddy, or who tf ever. I’ve been dumped, had an ex fuck some guy she wanted to fuck, then she called me back over for sex and getting back together that same night. He did not satisfy her apparently. I learned eventually that I was being used to financially support her and pleasure her which I didn’t mind, but she lied to me about everything. And actually “though nothing of me”. Idk what goes wrong. It seems like everything is okay and then some other guy comes out the blue and boom, I’m cheated on. Why? Wtf did I do? Why not DUMP me? I even asked several and their reply was “idk.” “I’m stupid” “I’m sorry ..idk” . I asked why did I deserve this, “idk.” “Idk” “you don’t “.

I’m so sick, of everything.

I will never be loved, this is okay though. I don’t want to kill myself anymore either it’s kinda old. I don’t cut anymore. My only option is to become a man, but honestly, why participate?  I am sure it would feel better physically and mentally to upgrade how I look. But after hearing and experiencing everything I went through in relationships, I am drained. And tired, I don’t even desire a person next to me anymore and I trust absolutely no one. I hate myself and all I can think is, “if only I was a man”

People treat me like a child and talk to me any kind of way bc of my physique and boyish face but my voice is super fucking deep. When I see manly looking men, I see them getting treated with the upmost respect and attention. But bc I look 18/19 I am nothing lol. 

I feel like I am losing my mind. I feel like everyone is out to hurt me. I made a reddit post on a diff account a few weeks back saying i was having thoughts of suicide transitioning into homicide. I was seriously going to act on them but someone sent authorities to my house (thanks, i guess). I was in the loopy hospital for bout a week or two. Nothing changed. 

I will he spat on , used and abused and ppl will try to instill fear in me. This will go on for the rest of my life, unless I take a stand. And lifting weights won’t cut it. I am angry. I feel cheated out of life, why is everyone targeting me. I understand that I look like a bitch, but why must you weaken me more. 

I am afraid bc I’m having homicidal thoughts again. I just want someone to talk to, the fucking mental institution didn’t help. No one listens. This world doesn’t care o have any compassion.

read romance novels that [as a kid] seemed so lurid with all the heaving bosoms and longhaired shirtless guys on horses. 

was a nurse that served during WW2 (where she met my g-pa), and remained a nurse her whole life, retiring in like the mid-90s. 

liked to spray paint her white keds bright gold, and always enjoyed a good sparkly headband.

country western/line-danced at the lake highlands rec center for like, ever.

picked me up from and watched me after school everyday while my mom worked. 

was the designated nurse for our whole fam if anyone was sick, and her cures DID involve campbell’s chx noodle soup, saltines, sprite and rainbow sherbet. 

taught me how to play poker, and we used cans of pennies for bets. 

would babysit me during the day in the summer and would monitor me while I experienced all my momentous pre-pubescent pool moments [you know like how the drain will suck you in if you get too close so you watch your back, or when you meet a cute boi who shows up most days you do and you develop a crush only to lose all touch w him once summer is over, and now it’s like the old lady in titanic for whom leonardo dicaprio only exists in her memories].

never lost her MS accent, and ate slower than anyone I’ve ever/will ever meet.

is beautiful, and loves her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren w all her being.

74,"This disease of perfectionism seeps into everything, but the most pressing is what should be my passion: fiction writing. Years ago I could blast music and just type away, even if the material was cringe-inducing shmuck. There was satisfaction in just doing it. 

After suffering through multiple years of mental illnesses, I had hardly written anything. In 2018, I crawled out of my depressive, suicidal rut. In 2019, I began to entertain the idea of writing again. And I did. The short story, in my humble opinion, was utter dawg shit. On top of that, I wasn't writing at a  pace I felt comfortable with. Trying to run a marathon before I've learned to crawl. 

I also wrote a memoir and finished it last year as well. Which was a little bit better, yet easier, as I was writing about my own life, and didn't have to imagine the lives of fictional people. 

Years have gone by, and each year I would have idea after idea, and now they've all filled my head to the brim. It's chaotic. On top of that I have false starts, which sounds normal for beginning authors, no? Thing is, I don't believe these are the ""This just doesn't work"" kind of false start, but the ""I'm not applying myself because I am not confident enough, oh, and I just got this new shiny idea!"" kind of false start. Couple this, with my exceedingly high standards for myself, and you have one hell of a procrastinator. I don't know which to start, which ideas to meld and which to keep separate or if I'm even creative enough to do these things. 

It's frustrating. Maddening, to be honest.",15Jan2020,1
76,"So this post probably doesn’t make much sense and probably more of a rant, so I apologize and I don’t think anyone cares enough to read it, but damn. I’m an ugly 20 year old female.

Everyone in my family is attractive, but me, not so much. I have all deformities. My nose is skinny but seems big in my opinion and has a large dorsal hump while my entire nose bridge is clearly crooked and leans to one side which becomes much apparent in photos with strong lighting. Sometimes I wonder if the guy who whipped and smashed a basket ball into my face when I was younger is the reason it ended up like this, or pure genetics. Guess I’ll never know.

My smile even with braces fixing it up is awful, better than before but still 💀 cause my mouth seems tiny and the teeth don’t seem to widen, so yeah, I look quite ratty, literally. Think of a beaver x rabbit x chipmunk hybrid but human, and terrifying.

My cheekbones “seem” to be quite high, or I think they are, I can’t tell but it makes my overall look worst, because of how puffy my cheeks look and with the combo of the small teeth, it’s terrifying. To top it all off, I clearly have a recessed chin.

I’ve lost weight, about 15 ish pounds, I still have more to go, from 145 lb to 130-135 lb at 5’4 ... Even with all that weight loss, I question myself what’s the point of even trying to drop to 115-125 because of how *deformed* and ugly looking my face looks and even if I lose weight I don’t think anyone will be paying attention.

I think the worst part of it all though isn’t really the loneliness, and self-awareness that I’m ugly, but more so the fact that I won’t be able to accomplish the dream of mine to actually become an actress. I genuinely love film and acting with all my heart and wanted to pursue it but I’m so messed up looking that I doubt any casting director would even look my way without thinking it’s some sort of prank.

It also is quite ridiculous that my family talks crap about me, treats me horribly and pushes rumours that I’m a lesbian to my younger siblings because I’ve never dated. The only reason I’ve never dated is because no guy has ever approached me, hit on me, flirted or had a crush on me. Even through high school, I did get make fun of several occasions and blocked and unfriended by a guy I had a crush on who found out I liked them. 

I won’t lie though, I don’t go out much these days. I only got one actual friend. I don’t go to bars, or clubs, not in college and I don’t bother with makeup unless it’s mascara but overall my skin is decently clear. 

It sucks how I can look pretty and attractive in a Snapchat selfie and video (I don’t use filters.) But, whenever some takes a picture of me, or use my actual camera I look deformed as hell and nothing like I did in my Snapchat selfie.

Gah, there goes the dream. Guess I’ll be single forever but meh.",15Jan2020,1

91,"

Recently I lax out my appearance, manners and socializing. I also cease feeling guilty for not trying to achieve a better life. Generally, I feel more okay about myself and worry less, but I have less relationships and spend a lot of time playing guilt-free. 


I (25F) has been feeling more tranquil these days. If I must, I can divide my course of life up until now into 3 periods:
- 0 - 19 years old: unrecognized depression, ptsd + various mental instability. Always need to achieve something, feel rushed, worthless and unseen. Always strive for validation from outside.
- 19 - 23 yrs old: emotionally ruptured and crippled. I broke down when my dad died, therapist uncovered childhood trauma. I regressed into a mess, no family, no friend, no job, no money, no hope, no belief, no self esteem, no nothing. I couldn’ leave the room, and i couldn’t socialize with people.
- 23 - 25 yrs old: secured a job, worked on my mental health, lived independently and grow. Realized the toxic tendencies in my life, cut people out. Still felt worthless.

In the most recent period, I constantly felt like a failure, a bum. 
If I don’t do anything that contributes to financial/health/networking purposes, I felt like shit. I know that they are the values I internalized from my family of origin, I know they are not healthy for me in this period of life, yet I could never feel at ease with myself. I never felt that I was enough. 
I love manga, I also read a lot. Movies are also so wonderful. So is working out and hiking. 
Yet whatever I do, the excessive urges to network, make money and make myself pretty didn’t leave me alone. I can’t face anyone without a full face of makeup, yet I pick at my face ~75 mins a day. I hate the way some people make me feel, yet I can’t get to serve the tie or speak up for myself. Even when I read or watch movies or just be, the sense of wasting time and worthlessness didn’t leave me.

But these days, I:
- have my annual acne break out which is horrid. I turns me from a clear face into degree 2 acne and hyperpigmentation. Yet I’m quite okay with it and go to work with just sunscreen.
- play 7 wonders and read manga ~5 hours a day with joy, as opposed to guilt-ridden.
- believe that I can do generally well into my elder age
- think that I don’t need to be exceptionally beautiful, successful or rich, and that’s quite okay. 
- if I think about my family (which happens most hours of a day), I feel like shit. But when I don’t, I feel content.

Generally, a higher ratio of my day contribute to entertainment, and anxiety/depression goes down by 1/2.

I don’t know if that’s better or worse. And I’m not worried about it either.",15Jan2020,1

98,"I am a mildly-successful-for-my-age 24yo Eastern European guy that in the last couple of months feels what I think is an all-time low. I am super close of losing a great scholarship and on top of that, I have to pay 2500€ because of not respecting attendece as it was a condition of those money. Literally maximum 30 days away. 

Doesn't matter how much I read, I use it for mental masturbation and thats about it. So I need some guys to scream at me that I am a bitch.

I am currently studying with a scholarship in Spain (a university that I wanted &amp; worked to get here), exams are approaching and I am dead-beat ignorant and I'll probably fuck my prospects in terms of scholarship and have to get a 400€/month job in Eastern EU to survive.

Background on me: 24 yo guy, engineering degree, had scholarships all my student life, won international contests in engineering, made money with affiliate-marketing, attractive, with a bad relationship with my family (which is, mom and super-old granny, no cousins), no good friends, pretty good with girls, pretty bad with people in general (so I am not sexually or financially frustrated). I am just super shitty about my life in general, started smoking and drinking morning till noon, Burger King and Coca Cola are my life (on top of good ol' Marlboro or Lucky). 

I had a stressful last year, had to learn a lot to do my diploma project,had to win a contest that got me to Asia for my 2nd time, had to do an internship at a great corporation, to manage my online blogs, to balance my great ex-GF and myfamily who absolutely unrealistically hated her. I think I've reached a burn out.

Fast forward I am in Spain, absolutely don't care about the school (and I really wanted to get here), I have friends visiting me tomorrow all the way from the other corner of Europe and I really don't feel like doing anything socially. Mom is visiting me because she doesn't have other option to see Spain. I know this is gonna be a shit storm. And she stays for a fking week.

My eating habits and lack of doing sports made me a tiny-bit fat, my sleepless nights make me fall asleep in the bus on a daily basis, my asthma doesn't work well with the almighty pack of cigarettes, my online business are not receiving their updates and I am not earning anything. I am still thinking about my ex who I broke up with because I didn't want to commit, I do not have the energy to date here. Funny thing is that part of breaking up with her was mom, and after I did it she didn't stop to throw shit at me, really no improvement. My mom is a sad, unloved, underappreciated, hateful, not smart, woman. I think she is part of the reason that I avoid getting emotional with girls.

I can not stick to any scheadule I create, I tried apps, paper stickers I just say fuck it everytime. I meditated, got jogging, taking long walk, changed nothing. I have nobody to talk to about how I feel and I'm not paying a shrink. Strictly because I've been to 3 as mom made me because of various retarded reason, and they've been shit.

99,"Sorry about the rant, I'll try to keep it short.  I'm in my mid 30s, I've been trying to get a job in the field my degrees are in for the better part of a decade now.  After 6ish months of unemployment, I've pretty much been working as a janitor since grad school.  Finally got an offer for something in my field about 2 months ago, so of course I took it.  I've been depressed for a long time, for years all I did in my free time was search for and apply for jobs.  I went to as many career fairs and did as much networking as I could, but that didn't seem to help me much.  I don't have any hobbies or anything, haven't done anything fun since 2014 or so, I don't have any friends, and my family think I'm a complete failure. Thousands of job applications, 1000s of rejections over the course of years kinda lends them some weight.

So anyway, here I am with the first real job offer I've ever gotten, (it's for the govt, which I'm pretty sure I only got the job because I'm a veteran), I should be happy, and I was actually looking forward to it. But now that I'm here, it's a horrible fit, I'm the youngest person by almost 2 decades, it's horribly slow paced, and I have no real supervisor or direction.  I'm bored out of my mind, which I know all things considered isn't really much to complain about, but I was hoping to actually be able to do something with my life.  I'm sick of feeling worthless, and sitting around with nothing to do for 8 or 9 hours doesn't help.  Also, I'm now in a deeply bible belt area, which I'm not used to coming from the north, and I don't really know how to fit in here culturally at all.  I've been by myself so long though, I guess this isn't really much different for me.

101,"(So this post is basically about my mom and how I need help, I'm on mobile so any formatting errors or typos happen I'm sorry also there will be a TLDR at the end)

So my mom is am antivaxxer and just seems to despise anything that has to do with vaccines or just doctors. Since I was like 10 (I'm 13 going on 14 now) she has been telling me that vaccines are horrible, and you'll die from it and that if vaccines are so great and prevent disease then why are there still outbreaks? Which I started to believe up until I was 11 and got my own phone, and that if when I started to do research.

Since then I've known that she was lying and now I've moved from NYC to Virginia because she didn't want to vaccinate me and let me into school. And I'm sure if I'm not allowed to school here we're gonna move again and I'll have to leave friends again. She says that there's unborn babies in vaccines and monkey and horse blood in it, and that there's also led and Mercury in it and that the doctors give us 20+ shots to kill us.

I've spoken against her when I was 11-12 and she says that I have mental illness because I don't agree with her. She's also racist and just toxic in general. I'm a female POC and she never lets me go outside because I'm a girl and it's ""way to dangerous"". But she'd let my brother go outside even though some lady was trying to kidnap him because he was alone. (He's only a year older than me) She won't let me hang out with boys or stay over at my friend's house because their DAD is there. Like do you want to kick him out of his own house?

She says that people shouldn't have mixed kids and that if you're black you should stay with someone who's black, and if you're white you should die. And she always shames me for my friends and says, ""You have too many white friends. I hate bringing you over to their house."" 

But another thing is she was vaccinated until she was 18 but won't speak about how she's alive and didn't get polio or the measles, or how she didn't get any side effects. And she'd focus on people who had side effects instead of all the people in her life that are walking around living and healthy and doing things with their lives. She'd trash people behind their backs for vaccinating and call them stupid. 

She had split from my dad when I was 2 because he ""wasn't a gentleman"" and ""didn't open doors for her when she was pregnant"" even though he is very strict about being polite and respectful and disciplined us on that. And when I didn't believe that she said he was a dead beat and abusive, but my dad has emails and messages of proof on how he just wanted to see me and my brother. We've only seen him about 2-3 times a year for a week max. And any birthday money or anything we'd get she'd take from us saying that ""he owed it to her"". 

I always thought about asking my dad to vaccinate me but I don't know if he's also antivaxx because I barely get to talk to him. And every time I think about leaving I feel like I can't because my 4 other siblings would still be with her and I only have like 2 friends I could stay with for a little while. Even then I don't wanna go because she came from an abusive household and I feel like that's why she acts that way, but at the same time I don't because she always talks about not wanting us to grow up like she did. 

But she still makes us grow up like she did, especially when I was 6-7 and I drew on a wall and she slapped me and threw me at the ground. And only after about 3 hours of me in my room crying she said, ""Hey I'm sorry now can you stop crying?"" And not to mention my stepdad, but that's a story for another time.

And I'm wondering if this is a form of Stockholm's, as I've read somewhere that kids usually have it in situations like these to cope for it. And it just makes my anxiety worse and worse.

If anyone has any suggestions or info on what I can do please tell me, and if any Reddit readers like EZPZ, emkay, Chris cross, TimTamTom or Rslash is reading this you YouTubers helped me relax and find a few moments of entertainment and peace

A broken home is something you’re used too in a sense. I mean, your parents hated each other. They made each other miserable. But they didn’t leave. And you’re the one that suffered. You grew up believing being unhappy in a relationship was normal. By 14 you were in an abusive relationship with a person your parents allowed to live with you. It took you 3 years to get out of that. Your brain said “I hate you,, leave, please just leave”, but the only thing that could come out of your mouth was “I love you, please don’t leave me, I’m sorry” and you didn’t understand why that was happening then, but now as an adult you can see your parents so much in that relationship it sickens you.

You want a little you so god damn bad, you have since you were 12. But you know the relationship you’re in now, it’s not one that you’d bring kids into. And it kills you. Kinda. I mean, there are parts of you that think “do I really want to bring kids into this world” and you try real real hard to convince yourself that’s the reason you don’t have kids.

Staining so deep.. like the bruises from *my day* that ended with xrays and court dates.

How do you explain to a 6 year old she can't call you mom anymore?

What's wrong with me? 

Why does it hurt? 

Is it the comfort I'm aching over? Is it a grieving process from the days- months- years of work to watch it fail, over and over?
The blood- sweat- tears- Sacrificing and ripping your own heart out to put it in their hand and let them feel the love they'd never had?

The hospital visits. So many. To many.
Our babies. Death wishes in action. Accidents. Psych stays. Possessive brutality. Why be sane when you can be stupid?

So much to clean up, I take a nap instead of starting. Overwhelmed.
So much work to magic eraser the stains that are embedded. I don't own a sewing to kit to stitch up the wounds. Will nail glue piece together the relationships that were dropped from a second story window? 

Everyone thinks about the 6ft elevator ride.
Everyone thinks about running.
Everyone thinks about a dose of numb it.

How to feel alive again when you're not even sure you're alive.
What do I like now?
Can I be what they need, or will I continue to fail?

Also, pain doesn't give a shit about grammar.

114,"I... I have friends that I am trying to be close to and I have been pretty open with them but.. I just want something so simple, but it makes me feel so selfish! I just want hugs.. and cuddles.... I just want that close affection and care! I want my friends to care if I am being a bit distant from them, if clearly I have some sort of issue going on! I want them to wonder where I am if I have all of the sudden left them.. to go hide alone and on my own..
I just don't know what to do anymore.. I just wanna go hide somewhere in the dark and maybe cry.. why does it hurt so much for me just to want some affection and closeness...",15Jan2020,1
115,(18m) Recently I’ve been told by a lot of people that video games are for kids and that I need to quit and get serious about my future. I am a junior in college and usually have play 2-3 hours a day and it hasn’t affected my grades. If any thing it serves as motivation to continue to get good grades. Is it ok to play games past childhood or should adults quit and pursue real matters as I’ve been told?,15Jan2020,1
116,"What is it like being spoiled? To have others care so much for you that they give you things and such easily..
What is it like being the one that everyone cuddles and hugs? Knowing that you don't have to give the affection because it is always given to you..
What is it like being a receiver instead of a giver? Being able to have others give things like affection and gifts to you...
What is it like knowing that people really and truly want you around.. that you matter to them..
What is it like having friends who actually try to be around.. try to interact with you.. actually care about you and shows it..
What is it like having friends who know that for you.. not giving affection is like neglecting or just.. in a way hurting the friend.. makes them feel like they don't matter.. that no matter what they do it won't fix anything, you still will be unimportant.. unneeded..
What is it like having friends that go over to you.. that make it so you don't always have to go to them.. to where you feel at least a little bit wanted..
What is it like not having to feel like the only way you matter to them is because you always offer advice to them or a listening ear if they are having a hard time.. is it sad that that is the only way I seem needed..?
What is it like being a person that people are actually attracted to.. instead of being hated and disliked..
What is it like being small enough that you can sit in someone's lap and be cuddled.. cared for..
What is it like not having the feeling like anyone at any time could be speaking bad about you.. and not only that but you would probably believe what they were saying is true...
What is it like not having the constant thought running through your head of the fact that you believe you are shit.. that you are a horrible human being who doesn't deserve anything.. that you are a selfish needy bitch..
What is it like not having the feeling that you are worthless.. 
What is it like not having to deal with putting on a different persona everywhere because you can't always let people see how you really feel.. how much you are in a way hurting..
What is it like not feeling like you are always being selfish if in a conversation it leans towards you.. feeling like you can't get the help, advice, or affection you feel you need from them because it would be selfish of you...
What is it like not having the feeling that.. no matter what.. you are just replaceable and that in the end.. none really cares.. you don't mean anything to anyone.. you are just a useable person that can easily be disposed of..
What is it like not feeling like.. like.. you kind want to die but you can't.. so you just.. harm yourself in several ways.. make it so you can't truly ever be happy...",15Jan2020,1

120,"I say I don’t care what people think about me, and for the most part I really don’t

But I still delete tweets if they don’t get enough likes to satisfy my ego 

I have about 5,000 followers on twitter and my *good* tweets get anywhere from 200 to 1,000 likes 

Before, I would be happy if a tweet got 10 likes. Now, if a tweet only gets 10 likes I feel embarrassed and delete it 

Social media will never satisfy you and make you feel validated. Material things will never be enough to make you happy 

The only way to fill the void within yourself is to fill it with more of yourself. Nothing else will permanently make you feel fulfilled.",15Jan2020,1
