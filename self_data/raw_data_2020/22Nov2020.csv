0,"I have no idea what to do. She’s been struggling with mental health, me too. We’ve leaned on each other a bit through this fall semester.

Just Monday night, a friend of hers got shot during a senseless sneaker sale gone wrong. She was understandably wrecked about it, wishing she’d hung out with him more, etc. But she’s been rolling through it. 

Now tonight she tells me she’s panicking. I tell her it’s ok, breathe. She tells me she doesn’t even want to go home from work because home doesn’t comfort her, she doesn’t want to see her mom. She has a good relationship with her mom, she’s just sort of losing her mind at the moment. I try to console her but not tell her what to do. Tell her I’m here for her, etc. etc. 

Next thing I know, she now tells me she’s “going into the woods” to “clear her head” and stuff. Ok, sure. I can get that. 

She then tells me that she’s going to turn her phone to airplane mode while she’s there. I said, “ok, I won’t bother ya.”

I get a text a little while later that says “if anything happens you were one of my good friends.”

I’m like WHAT?? She goes “I have to do what’s right.” I send her some messages about how I totally understand feeling on the brink of insanity, she just needs to breathe through it and go home to her mom even though she doesn’t want to. Mind you, we live far away and I don’t know where she is at the moment.

My last message, saying “you being gone will cause others pain, not relief” hasn’t been “delivered.” I guess she’s on airplane mode. 

What the EVER LOVING FUCK do I do??? I’ve been drinking and dancing around my apartment with my boyfriend, cleaning up around here and eating some food. Just some good Saturday night chillin. And now I feel responsible for this girl’s mental health, meanwhile idk where she is and we have zero friends in common. 

I’m upset. I’m nervous. And to be honest, I’m also sort of fucking *pissed*. I went from having a fabulous time to now thinking that I maybe partially responsible for a suicide that may happen. I can’t contact her. I am just stuck in limbo. 

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. I just need some comfort, I guess. What the ***FUCK***, y’all.",22Nov2020,1
1,"Just bombed my AP Macroeconomics test and AP English essay (80s on both). I don't know what the fuck I can even do at this point. I've been acing all of my classes back when I actually attended physical classes. Now, I don't get jack shit in two of the four AP classes I'm taking and it the teacher can't even do much to help. The cherry on top is that the past 3 SATs I've signed up for have been cancelled and now I'm at the end of the fucking rope. I can't take the college admission test, my AP grades are going to go to shit, and I feel like a fucking disgrace. I've gotten 3 horrible migraines in the span of two weeks and I feel like I'm just beginning to break down. This online schooling is turning my brain and health into mush. I don't even feel like a person any more. I just feel like some kind of machine which can't preform its intended purpose anymore.",22Nov2020,1

2. Stops him from hurting the country any more. He's trying to do a bunch of childish maneuvers right now to hurt Biden but he's even been asking stupid stuff like ""is it a good idea to nuke Iran?"" WTF?

3. It adds to his ridiculously awfl legacy as the absolute worst president in history - he's done to the name ""Trump"" what Hitler did to the name ""Hitler""",22Nov2020,1
4,"I feel so immature. You know the feeling when you do something and it remembers you of yourself, but younger and sadder. And it makes you feel like you keep being the same person. Even when you try so hard not to be, sometimes you even feel like you are actually evolving; Well by reading his diary, I afterwards felt like 12 again. A total setback.  
 Honestly, reading some scrabbles of him was not even bad. We drifted apart and our interactions changed for the worse. By reading them it showed me that we think so alike and that he is not only the cold person as he comes across lately. I know he is going through some shit, as we all do as afraid, soon to be, grown ups. And by reading his short handwriting I realised that I owned him to be the one who dared to start the conversation about how we changed.  
   

Those scrabbles where 3 years old and laid between his old school books, I was honestly not looking for them. Reading those was already very very very debatable. 

But then I got full stupid and searched for his recent stuff. Those where coherent writings, as the others were just little pieces of thoughts. These were on the other hand very personal. I robbed him of his mysteries, also of mine. Because I read shit that was totally not relevant to me, but was about me and a girl who had a crush on me. I didn't know. He wrote about how he loved her, but was conflicted if  it was *lovelove* or *friendshiplove*. How he had his first sexual interaction with her and how nice it was. And I felt so so sick, this was his and I robbed him. Because he wrote how he decided not to tell us because that would eliminate the change of me and this girl to maybe get together.   
 This is not relevant, because I never knew until now and knowing this will not change anything, it doesn’t make me longing for her. It happened some time ago. Time didn't stand still. I think her feelings for me then, aren't relevant anymore now. Those go away. She has now a boyfriend for some time. It doesn't make me feel like, shit if had known, what could have been. I didn't sense here feelings towards me, with a reason. So me not knowing, was how is was supposed to be.   
I violated his privacy badly, it was his experience he chose to keep for himself. But somewhere, I get so proud of him, how he liked it, how he is proud that having this sexual interaction didn’t change their friendship. Btw, this is not the reason why we drifted apart, we were already on weird terms. So it is not by reading it, al pieces came together, the contrary actually.. It was not our story, it was his.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel stressed and reckless, but I guess this is the price I have to pay by being a stupid kiddo who stepped over the line. First cautious and then I kept walking further away from the line until I fell of the cliff.  
 I will not allow to make it worse, I'm conflicted by knowing this things, but that's on me, and it's on me to let it go. I promise to try to rethink this on my own and to not to discuss with anyone else. I guess this is my way to send the promise out in the world.",22Nov2020,1
5,"I don’t want to get into much detail but I got into a drunken argument with a guy I like a few days ago and we haven’t talked since. I feel like it was mostly my fault, I was a bit emotional, and I think I came off overwhelming to sum it up. I absolutely want to apologize but the fear of being rejected or feeling even more shame afterwards (along with my social anxiety) has caused some delay.

9,"I wasn’t sure where to post this but it’s been on my mind a lot lately and I just wanted maybe another opinion to clear my very cloudy thoughts. TW for sexual assault obviously but no details. 

When I (F20) was young(7/8) my older brother sexually assaulted me. He is 2 years older than me, but was also very young at the time(9/10). I didn’t understand what was happening at the time, although I did tell him to stop at least once- he didn’t. 

We’ve never spoken about it, I have no idea if he even remembers and it didn’t truly impact me until I was about 12 and realised/remembered what had happened. I don’t know how to feel because I don’t know if he even knew what he was doing beyond childhood curiosity, does that make sense? Should I be mad? Do I have the right to be mad or should I forgive and forget? Is there anything to forgive in the first place because he was so young? Did he have any idea what was truly going on?

The reason I wonder so much is because I was sexually assaulted when I was 15 by a much older stranger and I view that experience extremely differently- it disgusts me much more and impacted my life a lot (I have been to therapy about it and made my peace with it). 

Honestly idk what I’m aiming to get from this post, maybe it’s above Reddit’s pay grade but thank you for any advice you may give.",22Nov2020,1

11,"my life is pretty shitty at the moment, and I just really need to rant about all my problems to someone. If I don’t express my feelings soon, I think I may just explode and have a mental breakdown, which could lead to me hurting myself severely or possibly taking my life. Many of my friends have been distant from me or ignoring me. And I’m certain that the ones im still close with will be way too concerned and tell people about it (in hopes of getting me help). Which I’m not ready for yet. That’s why I need an internet friend to have as an outlet. If you are interested, please message me. Please note that I will probably talk about sensitive subjects.

13,"Since my mom doesn’t know how to drive, we have never owned a car while I was growing up. Idk why it took me this long to finally get one after being old enough to do so either. I told myself that I didn’t think anyone would be willing to teach me when I was 16-18 yrs old since I didn’t really think much about driving at that time. Then, I went away for college in a city where you could go to any place by feet or bus. You could even go to other cities in the Bay Area via BART. I thought that there was no point in driving during college. I do wish I knew how so I could had gone home more often since it was only a 1.5 drive. I wanted to give my mom a campus tour so she could admire the beauty that Berkeley has to offer, and show her around the city. When I moved back to my hometown, I was focusing on school and work even though I knew it was important that I needed to know how to drive. 

Honestly, I got scared of the concept of driving, being out on the road, and somehow making a mistake that will end up in an accident. I became lazy about it and kept pushing back on the learning. I just felt like I wasn’t ready for it and wouldn’t be able to do it. I kept thinking ‘if other people are able to do it, why can’t I? Why are you so afraid??’. I really hate asking people cause I always feel like a hassle and bad that they take the time and gas to give me a ride. I also don’t like having to depend on people for it either. After having the courage and finally deciding that I am ready, I took driving school and had my driver’s test yesterday.

21,"Hi all, last time I posted here it was quite helpful reading some of the community’s response. So thanks for that. 

I just wanted to talk about random stresses I get and anxiety which gets my heart beating and heavy breathing. 

So generally I am fine, I’ve just graduated from uni and even got an internship. But like in my free time I don’t do anything productive. I don’t have any interests and I generally am laid back and can’t care enough to do things. See that’s fine too. 

Things that stresses me out a lot is my parents mostly my dad. He is a tough and unpredictable guy. Recently, there’s a lot of things happening to him, at his work people are not behaving properly with him. When this happened he gets me to write emails as his English is not soo good. I wrote a couple of emails which were a bit harsh and his company gave him a warning letter but his problems were solved and people stopped bothering him. 

For the past few years now, everytime he calls me or messages me. I get a heart drop and an anxiety rush. Feels a bit like when you’re home alone and someone starts knocking on your door loudly and you don’t know what to do how to feel how to react. 

I am not sure how to handle this. I’ll give another example. Today he just got an awkward message on his phone and he’s like what does this say and it said something about striptease girl, and It was so awkward and I had the same anxious feeling. 

I don’t know how to control that. I will probably always live with my parents as that’s in my culture. But I can’t take these random stresses. It’s ruining me mentally. Sometimes I just feel empty. I’m home alone all day, got no passions and or motivation to do anything. I feel these random stresses and stuff is one reason for it. Feels like subconsciously these things are bothering me and stopping me at every stage in life. 

I want to know you’re thoughts on this. I am not sure who to talk to what to do. I feel like I don’t have time for myself as I am always so concerned about my dads problems and family situation. I don’t care enough for myself. I don’t even buy myself stuff or go anywhere . Feels like I’m mentally locked.

I always feel so glad to live in a time with so many amazing things happening in the world, but it’s also overshadowed by what I can only describe as a “Fear of Missing Out” on the things that will happen in the future.

26,"I still don't have too much information about how it happened and I really don't know if I want to know more. We'll call him 'P', referring to the first letter of his nickname. P and me, we knew each other since we were very young, I think since we were four years old. We were neighbors, we grew up together, we went through many good and bad things together, we went out all the time, and although we had our differences, we always tried to get along as best as possible and we even went on trips together several times, sometimes I with her family or vice versa.  I came to consider him my 'best friend' so much so that I told him some intimate things about me and he told me his very personal things.  We had friends in common ( of importance for later ). He was almost six months older than me. 

if I remember correctly, about three or four weeks before it was my 18th birthday one of those differences that I already talked about got so worse that P and I fight physically. Since then we had not talked to each other because we had this bad and stupid habit of when we fought, neither he nor I spoke to each other if the other did not apologize first. It was like seeing the pride of who collapsed first. so we don't talk to each other and ignore each other for the next few weeks before my birthday. I was going to celebrate my birthday at my parents' house with a reunion of my family and some other close friends, but since I did not want to continue in a bad mood about what had happened with P, I crossed the street ( we literally lived in front of the other ) and I went to his house, knocked on the door and told him that, although I did not believe that I was the culprit that started the fight, I wanted to apologize because it was my birthday, a special day for me, and no I wanted to celebrate my first day being of legal age, angry with him and as an act of good faith I invited him to my house to celebrate. in brief, He did not accept. 

We argued and again we almost fought physically but we behaved and let it go but we were still angry with each other. after that day nothing was ever the same between us. we left the last strong fight in the past but it was as if our friendship could not stand up properly. I do not feel and I do not think that this was caused by that strong fight but yes by a set of so many problems that we had over the years, the great weight of it ended up falling on our friendship and destroying it almost completely: we almost never didn't get together anymore and when we did, it was too much uncomfortable, nothing as before. We did not talk about new things, everything was about past experiences. 

It was as if we no longer wanted to share things about our lives so that the other would know, our differences became stronger and stronger, not too much to fight but enough so that everything became to much uncomfortable between us. Little by little we went from being the biggest friends and loving each other to only neighbors with whom we did not get along at all. P was the one who blocked me on twitter and then I in response, as a kind of 'counterattack' I blocked him on facebook, in my phone calls and on whatsapp and every time a friend in common asked me about him, I avoided answering or just limited myself to saying things like 'I don't know' in an uncomfortable way so that they would know that I no longer wanted to know anything about P. and apparently P did the same with others. And that's when our friendship ended for ever, after the blockades, we never got together or talked to each other. Our friendship was absolutely destroyed, reduced to ashes.

During the following years after the blockades, the destruction of our friendship also affected the friends in common because at least on my part, I felt as if they were no longer with me as before or as if when I shared things with them will matter a lot. So from one day to the next I stopped talking to them and they were the ones who did not block me, but they did remove me from social networks. That didn't matter to me because those mutual friends were already more like very distant acquaintances so 'the impact' of their actions didn't hurt me. 

In the years that followed, before we both moved out of our parents' homes, while we were still neighbors, p and I completely ignored each other. My mother tried to make me understand that I shouldn't let go of a friendship as deep as the one I had with P, but she really didn't know the thousands of things that led us to that enormous social distancing so I just limited myself to having a little conversation now Please ask him not to get into this situation between him and me.

we graduated from our universities, got jobs, and were eventually able to move to other parts away from our parents' homes. I found out that P graduated and got a job because my mother and P's mother were neighbors who had a good friendship, so to speak. Despite this, I didn't know where P had moved and I wasn't really interested. I moved to an apartment that my parents previously rented but that now gave me as a graduation gift.  Until recently, thanks to an inheritance, I was able to buy my own house. ( I do not know if this is necessary for what I tell but I have included it anyway in case you think it is relevant). 

I never knew what had happened to P's life ... until today.

I received a phone call from my mother, crying and clearly distressed, telling me that a close friend of P's mother who works with my mother, found out that apparently P was going out to dinner at a restaurant when some bad people, most likely some kind of drug traffickers who were preparing to assault all the restaurant's customers, met P with his friends outside that place. They resisted the assault and apparently P was in the stomach and killed in that place. I don't know what happened to his friends, maybe injured or killed, I don't know.

I don't know how to feel, I have a storm of emotions flooding me right now. On the one hand, I find his death exciting and something like satisfactory as a kind of karma for the strong physical fight that we had (I am spiteful and a kind of heartless/emotionless unlike other 'normal' people) but on the other hand, I feel something that I have rarely felt, what others call 'empathy'? or true 'bereavement', I don't know how to describe it but it's like pain and a strange feeling of emptiness, as if all the good things that happened with P made me ache for his death, I don't know what I really feel. There will be no funeral as before because due to the pandemic only the ten relatives closest to the deceased can get together. But even if funeral services could be done like before, I don't think I would go, or I don't know, I don't know how to fucking feel.",22Nov2020,1

33,"Sorry, it’s gonna be a long read. I’m not sure and I apologize if I’ve made any mistakes to formatting, etiquette, and such. Here goes.

I can’t remember when it began, dating back to when I first moved to the US when I was 12ish(?), but it has resurfaced not so recently. This feeling of being jaded like all the time, the feeling of this black hole within your physical body and spiritual (emotional?) body, like something’s always pulling parts of you deeper into the hole that you can’t get back. Like there’s a black filter on the screen looking at my everyday life, and in the center is where is gets darker. The emotion that’s connected to it isn’t sadness, exactly. It’s just constantly there and it’s heavy but I don’t know how to drop it off briefly to give myself some rest.

I don’t understand what’s going on and it’s so exhausting all the time. I don’t think I’m depressed or have anxiety, I’m not sad or worried all the time; I just have worrisome thoughts about things at times. I know this because I find things funny and I still laugh when something is funny, but rarely do I really laugh and find things funny anymore. It’s like I’ve seen humorous things too much and I’m no longer affected by humor. And I know this because sometimes when I mess and joke around with my sister I still laugh and I feel fine. But afterwards I “sober” up and feel it all again.

A part of me thinks that I’m just getting sad and getting weirded out ‘cause I’m 23 going to be 24 in just half a month and like others around my age I see people wondering whether they’re in the “right spot” in their lives. And perhaps that’s true but I can’t tell because as much as people say that it’s still super early in their lives and that it gets so much better later on in their 30’s 40’s, etc. I can’t bring myself to believe in that for some reason.

Let me give you some context on some reasons why I think I feel like this. I’m currently still in college, I was in community college for 3 years, already 1 year more than like everybody else. And then I took another year off just having a part time job, before transferring to a University. I major in Communication Studies which is, let’s face it, not exactly easy to find a job with, even if I finish my degree. I look at my sister having a good job doing super well, able to treat herself to things that she likes, even though I know she works hard. And then I recently like many others noticed the youtuber Dream, and I loved his videos on youtube I thought they were really fun and entertaining. And then I dove in and looked at how he came to be so big, I found out that he learned all about the youtube algorithm, networking with other people, and coding/software developing different things. I became inspired to try to do something similar, since I used to be sorta good at another video game that is a big moba. I looked up on how to do these things, editing videos, streaming, choosing music to play so I don’t get copyright struck, and then it dawned on me. I’m not good at anything, like at all. My sister is good at her job, working at a tech company, Dream is good at coding and YouTubing and he’s only like 20 years old. People all around me are good at something, and they know that. I’ve got nothing. I had the video game that I used to be good at, but season just ended this year and I didn’t even reach the rank that I regularly reached previous seasons. Granted my internet access is messed up and I didn’t have internet service for the last 2 weeks of season but I had opportunities to do it in those 2 weeks because I went to a place with wifi early during the days.

Furthermore, while I realize that the friendship that Dream has with his partners and his friends may very well be staged because they’re on camera, I find it to be very pure and loving and close knitted. Their bonds and relationships with one another are so strong, and then I look at myself and realized that I don’t have anything like that. This is part of the reason I was inspired to do something like youtube or streaming as well, so I can be assimilated and have the bonds like they have with each other. I haven’t had a super strong and close friendship since I was a kid and my family aren’t exactly the talk about your feelings kind. While I do have close friends right now, it feels weird for me to call them like that, even though I know they hold me in very high regards. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I haven’t tried to form serious and close bonds. I just can’t for the life of me uphold the relationship and have a stable, consistent friendship.

I’m still a completely functional human being; I do my papers and work for class, I eat, I drink, I read, I play video games. Sometimes it’s easy to hide it, but other times it’s hard. But there’s no purpose anymore, there’s no destination, no end goal, no objective. It’s like I’m waiting for the next season of a canceled show.

I used to remember myself getting excited and hopeful at things like Halloween and Christmas and holidays and days off from school. Now I just shrug and say “eh” to things. I picked up fatalistic/suicidal ideation humor because I thought it was funny, but now it stuck with me and I’m like??? Sometimes I wish time would stop and I could just sleep for 5 days, or just straight up stop existing and be erased from memories so that nobody would be hurt. I’m like indifferent to the thought of death/nonexistence. Like I don’t wanna die, ‘cause that’s scary, but I don’t wanna live either. Am I just lazy and not willing to put in the work? Idk

36,"I grew up moving a lot, and never really had the opportunity to explore any interests outside of gaming. I have a decent console collection and spend a large amount of my time gaming.   
I recently got out of a relationship where we both bonded deeply over gaming since we were long distance. I’ve been avoiding being in my room altogether just because I don’t want to be around my Xbox, it’s still raw and just feels like gut punches.   

I think in the end this will probably be a good thing, since I feel like I’m wasting my life a bit only having one hobby. I don’t know what hobbies there are to try that are inexpensive or how to even explore those during covid. I used to love photography but I don’t want to go out due to covid. I used to do calligraphy, and would enjoy going back. I gave up on cross stitching and sketching because I was just too self critical. I’d like to try crocheting.

37,"We've been together for almost 2 years now and have been long distance for a little over a year. It's been hard but the visits kept us going. With coronavirus, it's been really hard, but the hardest part is her parents. 

They are controlling to say the least. We're both early 20's with bachelor's degrees and they are not ready for her to be an adult yet. They don't let her access her own money, so she can't buy a car, or have a lot of freedoms people her age have. Every visit we have had has gone through them and been shortened as a result. It's extremely stressful for both of us. 

Recently, we asked about visiting again because it's been about 9 months now, but they wouldn't even listen to us. It caused us to make a plan where I come get her in my car (11 hour drive) and sneak her out at night to come live with me. I have a good job and stable living arrangements so we thought it would be fine despite some doubts about how they would react. Well, I came to get her yesterday, and after arriving from the drive, we talked for about 10 minutes and she decided it wasn't right so she went back inside and I left. I tried proposing other options but out of fear of her parents, they were all shot down. The entire drive home it was all I could think about. It's been one of the worst days of my life. I'm writing this just after getting home. 

I later found out her parents caught her as she snuck back inside, and now they're monitoring her and want us to break up (they have since the beginning). We can't even text each other unless it's on an app because they are watching. 

I've asked for space for now because I have so many terrible feelings about this situation and am in a really dark place right now. I love her but with the grip her parents have on her life, it will be impossible for us to have any semblance of a normal relationship. I'm so hurt by how everybody has treated me, and I know she must be too and I want to be there for her but I can't. 

I have so many mixed emotions about what has happened, because there is a lot more to this than what I have written. On one hand, I just want to return to how things were before we attempted this stupid plan, but on the other I am so angry I wasted two whole days driving that I don't want to forgive anybody. In a way, this is the worst thing that could've happened because we both suffer the consequences of the plan but never even carried it out. 

I want to scream. I want to vent to somebody. The thing that made me the saddest was when I realized the person I would vent this to is her, but her parents might end us. There are so many things I want to do or say, but I know I would regret them. I can't stop thinking about this. For the first time in years I just feel totally lost and don't know what to do.",22Nov2020,1

43,"I am so lost. So very lost. 

It is hard to put my finger on any one wrong turn but here I am. Maybe it was the accident that damaged my brain. Maybe it was not getting help with the crippling and all-consuming depression that has ravaged my life and any hope of success. 

Maybe it was the failed marriage to a profoundly broken person. Maybe it was the subsequent loss of my career (I was in military chaplaincy and divorced is sort of the end of the road for that in my denomination). The hardest part is that I finally belonged somewhere, doing something that mattered and doing it well. And I was happy! Every day I woke up refreshed, with a mission, knowing that I was right where I was supposed to be, doing good things that helped people. 

All gone with the divorce. The really shitty thing is she figured that once we got married I would give it all up for a regular 9-5 civilian job. Not that I knew that...

So restart from scratch. Financial ruin. Remarriage. Still battling (poorly) a profoundly renewed and invigorated darkness. Had a baby. He came out sick (he is good now for which I am thankful everyday, but had to have major surgery early on). Wife has a chronic illness and started chemo recently. 

She complains, always has, criticizes me at every turn. She cares for me but the relentless negativity is like being bludgeoned. 

I can’t seem to get my head straight. I am so angry all the time though I usually keep it to myself. Once every 2-3 years I have a bad hour or so, yelling and all that, done with the negativity and condescending attitude towards me. I am smart too, I have advanced degrees - don’t talk down to me or dismiss me. 

Today was a bad day. I hate it. I hate myself. I despise my life. 

Nothing can seem to cure me of this thing. Meds don’t, counseling doesn’t. And here I am typing out a random wall of text that won’t matter. It is persistent and resistant to any and all treatment. At this point I would take electroshock.

The one bright spot is our son. He is the light of my eyes and the joy of my soul. He is the reason I continue to live.

I don’t know what to do. Just keep slogging through life getting older until the day I don’t. 

Work a job where I excel through sheer force of will but in which I find no fulfillment. Be a decade behind my peers after having to restart from scratch. 

I just want to stop. Just stop hurting. Stop being hurt anew. But I can’t. Sigh.",22Nov2020,1
44,"At some point in your life, I’m sure you’ve wondered what your purpose is on this earth?

Your mastery.
Your unique gifts.

You must have the courage to live your truth.

No one can do it for you.

that shine—
is your purpose.

✨ What is your highest excitement or inspiration of the next moments? Go do that thing! It will connect you to your soul!

49,"Two years ago, I felt a sort of defusing of empathy beginning from October/November.  I've always assumed it to be me rationalizing my severely depressed state away. And when I say severely depressed, I've progressed through a most bizarre gradient. Suicidal and wept every single night tinge. Contemptuous neuroticism tinge. Lying down all day and doing virtually nothing tinge (most sustained one.) Would weep after waking up tinge. Dear god, what wasn't there of. Fortunately, I had just transferred to a boarding school in 2016 and the academics were FAR SIMPLER than in my former school so I was able to function well and do moderately fine despite of being incapable of doing work at home. And these depressive states frequently coexisted. 

I've always felt as if the overarching depression wasn't truly rationalized, rather postponed. However, with an aggregate of a more apathetic variant of depression that managed to numb me to a point where lay opportunity along with acquaintance of a circle celebrating callousness; depression ultimately petered around early 2019. Initially, apathy and anhedonia were prevalent but I established a greater sense of self esteem and with some charlatan engagement and reading after two whole years of torpor, I was able to be quite content and driven to some degree. It was only uphill from there. I was in high school now so I had merely a B average as I'd often omit both classwork AND homework for most of my freshman year, something that made my mother weep. I did manage to cram revision before the night of testing. It was also around this time that I scored a measly 96 in an 'easy' IQ test, Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices so my friend's opinion of me became piss poor (Please don't bash the validity of IQ tests in comments, not the intent of my post). He told me I shouldn't study STEM because it wouldn't be realistic and that I should pursue business. Which disheartened me but gave me the spite required to launch noted interests. He had then told who has been my bestfriend for a good year now, that I 'was very wealthy but not very bright'. For some time, I was maimed and upset I couldn't pursue interests I've had since childhood as shallow as they may be. Ever since I knew what a job was, I'd always aspired to be a 'scientist' but hell, now I can't even become an engineer. Regardless, that's when I suspected my cognition to be faltering. My concentration was poor and my attention span was the same as when I was depressed: reading or watching anything was a chore.

I didn't mind eventually. I was rising. My interest in physics took fruition after me being intellectually cessant for a fair bit. The emergence was a tad dilettante, with me merely reading books of concepts and scribbling notes, taking great pride in such rudimentary processing. I attempted to read a bit about genetics too, but I found it intolerable past 70 something pages. I was exhausted of reading all of the physics concepts and not actually knowing what physics truly was meaningfully, so I decided first I would enhance my mathematics, something I was better at than most in my class yet not the best. Astonishingly, I did give the AMC10 in the ninth grade and managed to be third in my school. That gave me a motivator, that perhaps I am not inept as I've been told by my friends online. But again, that rationalization had resulted in a severe loss of empathy and no compassion left. It never reverted no matter how well life went for me; whenever it showed signs of such, some external circumstances would stomp on it and send it back where it came from.

Regardless, the friend had been on a hiatus for so long that his prominence was null at that point. I can't even remember what math I did when I finally became productive in the tenth grade, some multivariable calculus was touched upon but again like a dilettante I skimmed too little of too much. I learned of limits too, something I was never taught when I learned differentiation and integration via very rote means. Trivial and all, I can't disagree. I always lacked the conscientiousness to establish something meaningful. It was only around April and May that I tackled set theory and binary operations, getting to groups. There was plenty of uncertainty and some struggle but I appreciated the subject and was eager to compromise my dignity. I had to do math. I didn't care. I looked for summer programs since I had all As bar a C in Art and a B in Careers, in hopes of going to a US university. I found one for the most revered university in country, but given the admission fee, it felt as if they'd take anyone in. I applied anyway. There was a problem set and I solved all but one of them (more directly on number theory), though I don't know to what success. That was around the end of May, when I halted pursuing modern algebra due to growing demotivation as a consequence of menial chores that my unemployed brother and mother could do any time of the day. I am quite sensitive to environment and my mother's yelling cannot be blocked by even noise cancelling headphones. I had no room, I had to study in the living room since my boarding school was closed for quarantine and I had to stay in my brothers' apartment with my two brothers and mother. Though the causality of the horror could be attributed to when one dawn, my mother returned weeping. My brother did something, yada yada. And then as she sobbed, she told me something chilling: ""Sometimes I just wish I could kill him and then myself."" She did scream often about how she wished to kill me back in my depressive years, but it was always heat of the moment rage. But devoid of anger, it felt too real... I just gave up on everything and decided I'd continue in June again. I may have been apathetic and all but I felt unsafe that the person I sleep beside to every night has such a wish because his actions violate familial prestige.",22Nov2020,1
51,"Currently I’m in the military. Before the military I had a life of abuse, verbal and physical, manipulation etc. My self esteem was absolutely shit and my voice was taken literally and figuratively.

All of that prevented me from being “normal” and in a way, from turning to the bad crowd. 

I joined the military in hopes of a new life and for a bit I did get that opportunity. My past has caught up with me and I’m currently being medically discharged. 

It’s not simple stuff type of thing, it’s the life long disability. To be honest I’m not sure in what ways it’ll affect me, I know it will but not exactly sure. I know they’re trying to take my license but imma fight to keep that.

58,"I was recently dumped and have not been taking it well. Despite having had several serious, long-term relationships end in a range of ways, I've been hit harder than ever. I don't want to dwell on those details; it's just context. Yet, and always later than I would like, I realized-and am actualizing--a distinction that I should have been making: satisfying desire vs affirming love. 

I love my ex unconditionally. I don't mean that in a delusional sense--there is no complete loss of self-respect. But I also desire my ex more than I have anyone else. 

N.B. I made serious mistakes, and it wasn't until after my ex had already taken me back that I fully understood exactly what I had been doing wrong. When things were great, things were perfect. When things weren't so great, I emotionally/mentally abused him: I always had to be correct and had a ""rational"" justification, so *therefore* I *must* be *right*. It took losing something so rare to see how wrong I was. I don't blame him for anything. 

So when he wanted no contact, I struggled with those two intense reactions, affirming my love and satisfying my desire. Every part of me wanted to fight it--I didn't want to grieve someone I care about so much. To grieve so easily would belie my desire and commitment. But to object would belie my love and respect. I attempted to do both by seeking contact with complete recognition of it as a lack of respect and with a request to do everything I could to amend. 

The pain of losing so much over-powered the desire to affirm my love and respect. What I didn't see was that I don't value desire and love equally. My desire is vain, and vanity is the most insidious offense. Who am I to ask for anything at the expense of whom I love? And to be honest, this post is in some ways the last bit of my desire wanting to be satisfied, wanting him to see me as something more than I can request, but I hope it helps more than it hurts.

tl;dr if you love them and what you want hurts them, don't want it, no matter how painful or difficult it may be.

To start, I'm underaged, went on a dating site and met a guy. I went on it because I was bored and lonely in the pandemic. There is nothing I can say to justify these actions, and I feel so sick to my stomach, and so guilty I let this happen to me.

We're not in love, but over the last few months, we've grown to be quite good friends in the sense that he tells me about his life, and I talk about mine candidly (replacing the names of my friends with fake aliases). I've also spun a few stories out of thin air to sound more interesting. I know it's wrong, but I'm attracted to his humour, and he's attracted to the girl whose face and personality I created.

I know he could get into a lot of trouble if anyone ever found out he was flirting to a minor (no nudes/fraud occurred so it's legal for me, but not for him), and I realize that what I did was extremely selfish. I strung him along under a fake image and continued to do so regardless of the fact that the situation could put him in danger. The thing is, he has no idea I'm fake. I'm such a pathological and obsessive liar that he, someone who considers himself to be quite good at discerning between truth and false, fell for my lies. 

I think the natural correct response would be to admit the truth and face the repercussions. I've tried so many times, but I'm so terrified of doing it that I chicken out. Another plausible reason is that I'm somewhat emotionally attached to him. Can go days without speaking to him, but ultimately spend said few days thinking about him or wishing we were speaking. Which is hard because I also don't want to admit the truth because I don't want to lose him. Which again, is selfish.

70,"I feel a deep, inert disconnection between my body, my reputation, and my desires. Everything about who I am and how people perceive me feels totally detached from who I'd like to be. It feels soul-crushing.

I am a 14-year-old, intellectually gifted, Sephardic Jewish-Czech boy with Asperger's Syndrome. Every adult and teacher I've ever known since elementary school loves me. ""Brilliant,"" ""genius,"" ""talented,"" etc. It can be flattering, yes, but sometimes it feels alienating.

A couple months ago, I was sick, and didn't attend school for a few days. My science teacher told me that his class was basically collapsing while I wasn't there, because no one else would give the same long, detailed, articulate answers I give. No one would raise their hand or answer questions, so the class was hardly functioning.

I guess people also seem to think I look handsome or beautiful, although I don't see it. Every girl I know fixates on my brown, curly hair, every boy I know seems pissed that I tower over them, and apparently I have really good facial hair and an idyllic jawline. But god, I fucking loathe just about every aspect of my body.

I hate how large my skull is, yet small my face is. I feel like my skull looks like a lemon, and I hate how big my hands are. I want to be clean shaven and wish I didn't have facial hair. I really want a vagina and breasts, and a plump butt.

I despise my skintone. I wish I had southeast Asian skin. I wish my hair was long, flowing, and black, as opposed to puffy, brown, and curly. I wish I could dye my hair partially pink and wear girly clothes like skinny jeans, overalls, Converse shoes, Vans, boots, heels, leggings, denim shorts, tutus, dresses, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, jewelry, etc.

Every adult in my life, from teachers to my father, expect Einsteinian levels of intellect out of me. Since a relatively young age I've held an interest in world history and later philosophy, geopolitics, and economics, so now I'm expected to be a Nietzsche-esque thinker. At fucking 14. And I've had these standards imposed on me for years. I just want to have fun and feel normal.

At 14, I still possess an attachment to toys, cotton candy, sweets, carnivals, plushies, and video games, although I push it down and pretend to be mature. All I want is to ride a big, inflated hoppity hop ball or play with Pokemon cards while watching Adventure Time, all while being a pretty southeast Asian girl.

I have a plan to manifest these desires. I plan on going to college after graduating high school in June 2025, and studying education, atomic physics, world history, philosophy, and possibly microbiology and nutrition studies at my local community college. Then I plan on getting a job as a history teacher at my local schools district.

Before graduating from high school, however, I plan to start working at AMC Theatres or some other local company hiring and start saving money to move to a more Liberal area when I'm 24 or so. But how can I feel better about this psychological disconnect I'm experiencing presently, until then?",22Nov2020,1

I don't think I've ever liked my body ever since I realised I was fat.

I do try to exercise more nowadays but I can't get where I want to be because of my living situation. I feel really pathetic not being independent enough to make the choices that can drastically change my body and boost my own confidence. For validation I've resorted to posting nudes here and although I do get nice comments, seeing how other the other girls look just give me an insecurity spike. I don't even know the point of posting those nudes. At the end of the day, I still hate the way I look. Idk I just feel really shitty lol I had Cheetos for dinner a few nights ago and today I had Oreos for snacks...... none of those will help me with my body yet I just fall into a cycle of snacking when I feel stressed.

I do not really like it. I see the aging... the slightly overweight... the bags under the eyes. Even if it's just my hair falling the wrong side... I can see every imperfection at all time.

I found out yesterday after removing the aerator that the sink wasn't that bad, the aerator was just never in correctly and wasn't fully sealed. It's also abysmally filthy. And I'd have continued drinking from it had my best friend's boyfriend not mentioned that my town's water is pretty gross according to an article he read and that a filter might be a good idea. So I bought the filter. Unscrewed the aerator. Almost puked. And I have clean water now and the taste difference is so vast. Yesterday was the first time since moving in that I turned by faucet on and the water just......went to the sink...not all over the back or the counter.

84,"   So I (22m) met a girl (20f) on tinder. We were casually talking, slightly flirting from time to time, then moved conversation to messenger, did two online dates and were basically vibing. Then she told me that she has a boyfriend, that she's verry sorry, she should have told me earlier, but used tinder only for friends till now. Even if there is something between us she doesn't want to break up with her boyfriend for now. She asked me if I want to stop talking to her. I live alone and there is a lockdown in my country, I need friends so I said that I'm okay with doing something together from time to time.   


   And there is me starting to think that I'm in the wrong, as I still kinda have the thought in the back of my mind that she will break up with him and I feel pretty bad about it.  


   Then we met in the park, as everything else is closed, got totally wasted and had great time, like really great time, untill now I connected so much only with one person in my life. But it's still cool, we are really becoming friends.  


   Then she came over to my place and it was a little bit different, once again got wasted (yeah I know) and we were vibing on my balcony. Then went back inside, turned on some cool music, danced, sang. When I was walking her home, she got touchy, she also said that she was feeling awful (cuz of her boyfriend) and I made her feel awesome also she showed me her nudes on her phone which got me really confused.  


   Now we text a lot, it's super weird like she is flirting and also sending photos of her boyfriend just after that. I know that It's fucked up and I should give up, it's unfair to the guy too if she breaks up with him because of me. I just can't let it go for some reason. What do you guys think? I need some perspective. Is she putting me on the hook?",22Nov2020,1

Only a few minutes later I felt like trash. How could I say that to my parents? I apologized to both of them minutes later, my dad was ok with it but my mom just ignored me.

87,"I am not sure if this will help everyone with recurring depression, but it might help someone so I will share this knowledge I came across a few years ago.

When I was depressed the second time, it was a whole lot harder than the first time. You will start to think life is pointless if this will just keep happening. So I did my best to research to find my answer if this is the case forever. Turns out, it is.

But it taught me what I call the Cycle of Life, it is from a youtube video that I am not sure if legit, but it helped and that is what matters. It is the idea that in every change comes depression, the cycle goes like this:

Change &gt; Depression &gt; New self &gt; Change &gt; Depression &gt; New Self...

It helps to get the idea to embrace depression as it is your body and mental state's way of adjusting to this change. After going through that down point, you will form a new and better you. Of course this will happen again once a new change appears but you will be ready because you expect this cycle to happen again. 

So whenever you feel like your depression is killing you, it might be killing the old you. Listening to what you truly want may help to heal faster, but it takes a lot of time as all things that are worth it. So hold on honey and find your way to keep on healing :)",22Nov2020,1

I traveled, alone. What's the point if you never have someone to share your life and activities with?

I know I'm not pretty, never have been, I went from being ugly when young to okayish thanks to sport, but for what? My hair is getting gray and my body isn't desirable. I asked men out when I was in my prime because I wasn't approached, did so again later when I decided for to get out of loneliness for the 100th time.

It never panned out, on OLD or in real. I'm not enough to be considered romantically and I hate it.

It could be small stuff like ""remember when your tights ripped while at school"" or stuff like that.

And the same government that has been refusing to raise the minimum wage, that has allowed companies to move production overseas and take away jobs, that has fought tooth and nail against Medicare for all and environmental regulations, that has been giving the rich tax breaks and bailouts... is now telling us, after a year of lockdown, that we cannot see our families?

106,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm really proud of my progress in handling a breakup.

He broke up with me on the 7th of September, 2019 and till the end of May this year, I was crying about it because he was seriously my everything. I really thought I would marry him and have two children and live a happy happy life. After he dumped me, I wanted to work hard at my job just to become wildly successful somehow and then get him back. Weird logic. I guess I watched too many movies or something.

It was also during the end of May that I started following the Korean group, BTS, and honestly, I never looked back after that. These guys taught me to start loving myself and look for happiness within myself. They taught me to try and find a job I actually love and become successful, instead of settling for the job I have now, just because it pays well, even though I hate it. They taught me to find new hobbies (something I'm still working on because I really don't have time for anything) and travel and enjoy the small things in life.

My friends think I'm obsessed with BTS, but I'm just happy that I have a positive influence on my life thanks to these 7 guys. I hardly think about my ex now. 

It's a huge improvement, considering that last year, even during the beginning of this year, I would wake up crying in the middle of the night, because I was angry at him in my sleep/dreams. I was so damaged back then. I had a very loud and angry fight with him over the phone this March after a brief 2 months of us being civil to each other. He blocked me after that, and our mutual best friend also cut me off. It was very upsetting because I thought I had found my best friends for life. You know, those friends you make in college that you have for the rest of your life, sharing news about weddings, kids, jobs, spending holidays together, etc. 

But now I don't think about him at all and don't worry about who he's with or whether we have a chance again or anything like that.

I happened to remember him because it was his birthday today. I woke up in the morning to see a mutual friend post a happy birthday post on her Instagram story. I was a little miffed because it was right in the morning, but I put him out of my mind by listening to the latest BTS album. The whole day passed and I forgot about him easily. While talking to a friend about HIS breakup, I remembered again that it was my ex's birthday.

For a brief moment, I wondered, ""Should I text him? I'm friends with all my exes now because I took the first step to being friends with them. Maybe I should put this matter to rest because I don't have strong feelings towards him any more."" Then it occured to me that I was probably still blocked. Then I wondered whether I should send him an SMS. Then I thought, ""Nah. I'm not THAT interested in being friends with him.""

I'm over him, that's for sure. But maybe not to the extent of putting in extra effort to be friends with him. If our paths cross one day and we have to be civil to each other, I will. If he chooses to be civil to me, I'll accept that and consider the hatchet buried. But till then, I'll just be content with the fact that _I_ know that I'm over him. That's enough for me.

I know this was long and maybe you didn't read it. That's ok with me. I'm just proud of myself, tbh. To be at this stage where it didn't matter to me whether I was friends with him or not is a stage I never expected to reach. The journey felt so long and looking back, it was indeed, very long. BTS helped me pass the time quickly and productively and I'm just sad I didn't stumble upon them earlier because then I could've gotten over it faster still haha!

To those who are still reading and wishing they could speed up the process as well - you know what they say about how time heals all? It's true. You know how they say, ""Find a new hobby""? It's true. You know how they say, ""Invest in yourself""? That's also true. Doing new things and caring for yourself and your happiness distracts you from the pain and the time it's taking to move on and it's such a healthy way to move on. That need to pick up new things to do needs to come from within you, however. And for me, to even get to the point of wanting to improve took a long time as well. I hope you have an easier time of it.",22Nov2020,1
107,"I struggle with mental health issues which is compounding on me with the current state of what is going on. I know there are many worse off than me and I can’t even imagine their worry and suffering. So far behind on utilities that I can’t even think about the numbers without overwhelming anxiety. Had to spend money on appliances that just couldn’t hold on long enough...refrigerators and washers aren’t cheap nowadays especially as a blue collar worker just starting out in life as a homeowner. Being a homeowner was one of my biggest goals in life I was finally able to achieve with the help of my late grandmother. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself losing what I worked so hard to achieve. I just keep getting kicked while I’m down and I’m worried that the services that I was told to be in contact with will end up falling through, it would just be par for the course at this point. I promised my wife that I would provide for us and give us a good life but I feel like I’m becoming a failure. I’m quarantined from work until I get my test results back which is a huge blow to us as our little savings got chopped 90%, which was the money we scrounged up trying to pay back the escrow account so we wouldn’t have to spread it over a years of payments which would just extend our financial burdens. I want to be clear that I am NOT reaching out for any monetary charity or pity, I just need some emotional support which is hard to get outside of my family because well, therapy appointments cost money too. Getting kicked while I’m down and/or getting knocked back to square one over and over is just taking a serious toll on me.

108,"I apologise in advance, I'm finding it really hard to put these feelings into words. I need internet strangers to help me out, because my friends don't understand how I feel.

Context:

I met this girl through a school friend and we went to the prom together. She lived 200km away until this year where she moved to goto university in my city. I've known her for 2-ish years, however we've met in person less than double digit times. She says I'm her best friend and to be honest, she's the only one who listens to my problems so I would say the same. I know everything about her, and by everything I mean EVERYTHING, every little issue she has (she was in a traumatic accident and has counselling cos of it) and she tells me a lot of things about that sorta stuff.

I think she's amazing, really great personality etc. She has really bad mood swings though due to depression and can be impossible to talk to sometimes. She usually doesn't talk to me for like a day a week, but in my mind she makes up for it by funny etc in the other times. Most days she can disappear for a couple of hours at a time, telling me she's not on her phone etc, but she's out with other people and posting stories, viewing stories etc.

She never ever ever asks to meet up with me. As I said before, we met up less than 10 times since I've known her. When I ask her if she thinks we're close friends she says of course yes even though our friendship is purely online, despite now living in the same place.

I've confronted her before about visiting my city and cancelling plans with me very late in the day by saying it was as if she didn't want to see me and she got really offended.

Any other friends I've told about these issues suggest that she is using me for something (I don't know what????) and that I'm being treated terribly.

But I can't let go. I can't physically force myself to do it. She knows so much about me and I know so much about her. She has lied to me before by suggesting she was doing things or busy when I know for a fact she's ignoring me. But I can't let go, because she means so much to me and I feel like I have nobody else to go to.

I can't tell if this is her being cynical or if she genuinely doesn't have the feelings to deal with friendships. She has lost people in the past who accused her of being unthoughtful etc but I understood it because she's diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, PTSD. I don't know if I can let go as I'm afraid this is just how she is and she might do something (shes been suicidal before).

I really don't know what to do. Others have suggested I need to go to counselling for some sort of dependency issue, but I don't know.

I apologise if this sounds like ramblings but my mind is genuinely completely fried from this, I need help and need people to hear what I feel.

I tried to make the promise in order to force myself not do the tiring compulsion. Using fear of God to help fight ocd. I tried to cancel the promise but I am not sure if it was canceled or not.   what if other Gods accepted the promise?     That created an obsessive fear of napkins. Many times I repeat to non-specific Gods stuff like that I never plan on returning home to get napkins. I repeat it because I am afraid of a misundestanding. Today, I was thinking about my ocd and was tired having these thoughts. Tired of being afraid. I was trying to persuade myself not to worry any more!  I think, I randomly thought that by being exposed to fear (napkins) will make me feel better. So, randomly, some thoughts without my will popped up in my head with images of getting napkins. I am worrying a little because I am not 100% sure that these images were 100% without my will. What if for a second I decided to get napkins in order to break the promise and expose myself to ocd fear? I cant undestand if these thoughts were 100% without my will.

The cool decisive breeze that lifts and swirls

Leaving trails of snowflakes with the image of a twirl

Now approaching joyous feelings

The hope of each and every boy and girl

Release your reservations

Open the door

'Tis the season of wondrous magic

The twinkling stars become a slowly falling pattern

As stars do shine like dust in twilight

The days now hold the same much nearer

Awaken from your hibernation

Each day an opportunity not known before",22Nov2020,1

118,"I feel really insecure about my pussy, i have big, dark, wrinkly lips protruding out. A lot of guys have pointed out as well, like ""you got big lips"", and stuff like that and i have also seen guys getting disappointed seeing me. 

Even I dont like the look of it, this has been my newest insecurity, i mean always did not like it but it getting pointed out is really hitting me.

How should i deal with this? Should i work on self image issues and try to be confident about it? Or should start saving up and get it surgically fixed?",22Nov2020,1
119,"Long story short, I recently moved to California where I started horse riding lessons. Problem is, my trainer seems to not give a shit about me. She moved facilities in early October (right around the time I started lessons), taking a short break while she got things settled, buy resumed teaching on the 12th. Said in her newsletter that she had a limited number of spots open for lessons the first week but, and I quote, ""if we can't get you scheduled the first week back, you will *for sure* be in the second week.""

Well, here we are in late November, and I haven't had a lesson in two months. It's been six weeks now since she's resumed lessons, and she hasn't reached out to me about getting a lesson scheduled. I texted her on October 22nd and asked if she had space for me, but her response was that one of her horses had been struggling to adjust to the move, so she was short a horse while she helped him cope, and as such was having to juggle people around and would try to get me scheduled soon. Totally get that. What I don't understand, though, is why she hasn't been keeping me updated at all since then. October 22nd was over four weeks ago, and even short a horse, I can't imagine why it would have taken this long to schedule me a lesson. At the very least I feel like she should have texted me or kept me updated as to what was going on, just so I could get a better idea of what was happening and when I might be able to resume lessons.

The final straw, though, was what happened yesterday. I messaged her on Facebook, explaining that I really needed to know when I would be able to start lessons again, as I'm in the process of registering for spring semester classes at school and need to know how my extracurricular schedule is going to look come January. I saw plain as day that she had ""seen"" my message, but here we are the next day and she still hasn't responded, even though I asked her to please get back to me with an answer as soon as possible. The real kicker? I noticed that she was active on the app at least a few times since I sent that message. So she's been on this fucking app several times since yesterday afternoon when I messaged her, and she still hasn't gotten back to me.

Should I just dump her? Maybe telling her straight up she's got to start treating me like more of a priority, or I'm taking my business elsewhere? I've tried to be as patient as possible through the move and everything, but I'm starting to feel ignored and hurt. Frankly, I probably would have left a lot sooner if there were other riding opportunities in my area, but there just aren't. So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place here.

Oh, and I forgot to mention that my last lesson, which was scheduled to be around late September, just before the move, was canceled by my instructor. What's frustrating is that I had paid for the lesson in advance, and she never refunded me. I've sort of let this go, just figuring I'd remind her for my next lesson and apply the money there, but obviously, that next lesson hasn't even happened yet. So I'm so torn about whether to demand my money back and *try* to find someone else–even though, as I mentioned, horse opportunities in my town are essentially nil–or stick it out, keep waiting, and just let her keep that money for my next lesson...whenever it ends up happening.",22Nov2020,1

I don’t know what the fuck’s going on with me. I’ve always been pretty introverted, but in maybe the last couple of months it’s went way beyond that. I think it might kind of be a mix of mild depression and social anxiety that’s making me like this. But I basically don’t want to talk to anyone, ever, or do anything or just fucking deal with people at all. I don’t have the energy and I can’t bring myself to it. I work retail and every fucking shift feels like an eternity. It drains me. I honestly just don’t enjoy being around anyone anymore.

During lockdown and stuff I’ve made almost zero effort to keep up with friends unless they keep up with me (they do message me still, but it feels like so much effort to reply). I say the bare minimum to my parents, and honestly all I ever want to do is sit in my room and read a book, watch tv/a movie or play a game. Sometimes I just want to sleep. Sometimes I don’t want to do anything at all. Every time I talk with someone now I find some fault with them, something rubs me the wrong way, and I just fucking hate it. Outwardly I’m friendly, easy going, and you’d never guess this, but I just really want to be left alone for what feels like forever. 

I realised how bad this had got today when my sister came to visit with my nieces. My niece who’s 4 years old wanted to play with me literally all day, she loves spending time with me goofing off. I love that little girl, but honest truth? I fucking hated spending time with her today. It was draining being happy and friendly all day, playing stupid games, all I wanted to do was go up to my room, play games and not talk to a single soul.

When the day ended I expressed to my mum how drained it had made me playing with her and she called me out on it and got really pissed off at me (unfairly I think), saying I should be grateful my niece loves me so much to want to be around me, that it would break her heart to think I couldn’t be bothered with her and that she doesn’t understand where my head’s at and I could just tell she was disgusted that this is the way my brain’s been working. While I think people should be allowed to want alone time, she has a point more generally.

Like what the fuck has happened to me? I somehow just don’t want to spend time with literally anyone. Even my little niece, who just unconditionally loves me and thinks I can do nothing wrong, who would never judge me and just wants to spend time with me and play for a little bit, even her I don’t want to deal with. I don’t want to keep friendships going, I don’t want to have to put myself out there to date and have people judge me, I don’t want to have to work everyday with the general public who bitch and moan. It’s all so overwhelming, and I feel like the worst person ever for feeling that way. Most of the people in my life just want the best for me and all I can see is their faults, find reasons to dislike them and not talk to them, and instead of wanting to connect with the people in my life I just want to isolate myself and hide the fuck away from everyone and everything, and in my brain it’s fuck anyone who tries to interrupt me being alone forever.

It scares me that I’m like this, how this lockdowns showed me how comfortable I am with literally never seeing anybody in my life. It’s made me realise I don’t need them, that in a lot of ways I prefer being completely alone, and I feel like an asshole for it.",22Nov2020,1

124,"We were best friends in high school and were super affectionate all throughout and even though my first major boyfriend who was also his mutual best friend. Like admittedly we were always all over each other and snuggle like puppies. I always felt more comfortable around him but he was always brutal with me when I was so dedicated to me ex and “followed him like a dog.”

I’m getting married to someone else and never thought he got away. It was a weird thing to hear.

I definitely wanted him to make the move when we were kids but he never did. I’m also glad he never did cuz I know how he treated his exes. I mean we were just friends and he physically and emotionally abused me. 

Like I know there was violence because the librarian was one of the faculty I was always hanging out with and she asked about my bruises. But I can’t remember the physical abuses. But I know they happened. It’s weird how memory works like that.

He’s the scariest person I know. I asked him to make sure my stalkers see the street if they try to crash my wedding and he was happy to oblige.",22Nov2020,1

Sometimes I wonder how dogs see the world. We only get a few glimpses at their mind, like how they get exited about getting belly rubs or eating some food. But what about when we’re not around? A few years back i used to have a german shepherd and he would stay 24/7 in the backyard, so that meant that for at the very least, he spent 2/3 of the day by himself. It was a big backyard so there was never an issue with it but I wonder if he ever got scared of the dark and couldn’t sleep, if he ever had any dreams and fantasies, perhaps even some aspirations? I suppose a dog’s mind is simpler then a human one, but it’s still a mind nonetheless. It is possible, maybe even probable, that dog’s think more then they let on.",22Nov2020,1

127,"My dog had a surgery on his throat. Afterwards he was just fine. The next step of the surgery was for the veterinarian to take him home for a night or two and monitor him. The vets wife was actually the one who """"monitored"""" him. This is the part where he died. 

He threw up, and since he had just had surgery on his throat he ended up suffocating to death. He died an extremely painful death and suffered greatly in his last moments. This pains me to think about.

When the vet called me, he said that if they knew something like this could happen, they would have been more prepared. But why where they not already prepared for this? Dogs do tend to randomly throw up. They should have had the equipment ready, or whatever they needed to save his life.

For the past week and a half I have tried to be understanding and calm, but just now I am starting to get very, very mad at these people for not providing the proper care and supervision over my dog.",22Nov2020,1
