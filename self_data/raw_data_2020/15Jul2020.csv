0,Obsessive and suicidal thoughts are going through the roof,15Jul2020,1
1,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it. 

I drank a lot of water yesterday and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal? 

◾️◾️◾️I’m down to 11.2 now  and my face looks wayyyy larger than ever at all I was thinner when I was last that weight :/",15Jul2020,0

3,"Hello all! 

I’m considering moving into another room in my house but the walls are just awful. Like the wallpaper is ripped off in some spots and I’m considering buying some wall hangings/tapestries but I’m not sure where’s the best place to buy some. 

Any advice for online or offline purchasing is appreciated.",15Jul2020,1
5,"I’m interning at a company as a software intern and I’m in my 2nd to last week out of 8 weeks and I cannot get the program that I was asked to implement to work correctly. This company’s code libraries have almost no documentation and the new storage technology that they’ve asked me to integrate into the program barely has any resources or references about it since it’s so new. I’ve been in communication with the devs of that tech, but I feel so stupid when I ask them things that other people seem to know how to do off the bat (and they don’t know that I am an intern). 

Since everything is virtual I’ve been struggling to ask people for help because my higher-ups definitely have bigger issues to worry about and virtual meetings to be in. I‘m trying my hardest not to overwork myself this week, but I feel like I’ll regret it if I don’t push through. But at the same time as I’m working, nothing I do is helping. And since the storage tech is new, my higher-ups also don’t know any better than I do. I’m going to be entering senior year and I feel like I should have been able to do this. But right now I’m stressed and I feel like a failure.",15Jul2020,3
6,"I'm usually very happy to help my customers, but this one karen ended up breaking me and causing me to get angry.
I'm afraid that I'll lose my job and won't be able to find a new one. My supervisor will only take the customers' side (even the lies she told in front of me.) so defending myself is out of the question. I might just call out tomorrow so that they don't have to deal with me. 
Sorry for ranting.",15Jul2020,3
7,Increasingly disgusting and exploratory porn to keep me in the house and quarantined because I tend to dislike watching TV alone.,15Jul2020,2
8,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",15Jul2020,0
9,"I recently lost my iPhone X in an 18 foot tall wall of straw.  Each bale weighs a 100-200lbs, it’s energy draining to climb, the farmers aren’t planning on moving it until later this fall, there’s cracks at the top of the hay that go all the way down to the ground and are hard to see because the loose hay is blocking it, you can easily get stuck if you go down one of the cracks, it’s hot, metal detectors will ruin the phone, can’t move the bales, and my phone is dead with the ringer off.  And there’s also a couple hundred bales of hay total.  Finding my phone isn’t the biggest deal but it would be helpful to be able to get some money out of it after buying a new one.  I’m not sure how to provide a picture or anything, but if you have any ideas on how to find or reach it, give it a go.  Again it’s not the biggest deal but it would be great if someone could give a suggestion or something I didn’t think about.  Thanks!",15Jul2020,4
10,"So many post, so many people. Everyone is fighting some sort of battle. The world is crazy now, everyone is standing for something different, some standing for something similar. But with everything going on, it’s important we all take a second, take a step back, take a deep breath and be grateful we have the life we have. I don’t know who needs to hear this, but I hope you get something from it. Life is about gratitude. And I’m reminding myself to be grateful! Have a good night everyone !",15Jul2020,5
11,"I'm actually good, life is good, I'm working, making enough to maintain my life and save a little cash. I work out every day, play guitar, talk to my friends, I'm doing life pretty well I think. Its odd though, whenever I get home, all the joy leaves my body, it starts in my chest, a cold numbing feeling slowly running through my body and mind. It gets hard to smile, hard to feel happy, hard to want to be alive. It's odd, it only happens when I get home, or if I'm alone for a prolonged period of time. Idk man just kinda talking to the world cause I don't know anymore.",15Jul2020,3
12,"I suffer anxiety and regularly very strong depressive episodes.  Whenever I could afford, I've went to therapy but couldn't keep it going because it was expensive.

I was recently fired and now I'm unemployed with too much free time and I can't deal with my head. It's exhausting and because of that I can't understand how can I heal myself by understanding that the anxiety and depression are a part of me. Right now I only wish to remove that side of me but isn't gonna happen. 

How can I accept this side of myself  if at the same time hurts me so much?",15Jul2020,3
13,"The people who insist that ""naturally skinny"" people really just don't eat that much annoy me. I ate a ton. It wasn't unusual for me to have two hot pockets, a whole totinos pizza, a whole bag of chips, and a couple of bowls of cereal in a day. I also was not active at all. 

Now, at 30, I have to stick to a strict 1200 calories a day diet to lose any weight. And I'm more active now.

I don't know how my body burned off those extra calories when I was younger, but it definitely was.",15Jul2020,7
14,"Awhile ago I ended up back home with my parents.  My younger sister had a falling out with a roommate a year ago and also ended up moving back into her old room.  I helped her move out, rented the moving truck out of my own pocket and allowed her to put her things in my storage unit, the monthly rent on which she has never contributed a dime.  

She is a classic narcissist, lives and dies by the validation she receives on Instagram, is the baby of the family who has never had to work for anything or take responsibility for anything, refuses to take medication for her bipolar disorder and has not held a real job for over 3 years.  She is a viciously angry, vituperative, explosive person who thrives on chaos and drama.  For the past 15 years, every time we have a disagreement, she has been physically violent with me, emotionally and mentally abusive; when we lived together she has come into my room and destroyed property, she has thrown rocks at my vehicle, punched holes in my doors, has threatened to get on social media and tell friends of mine horrific rumors about me, has blackmailed me with personal and embarrassing information about my past, has been abusive toward my children...I could go on and on.  She’s a terrible person and my shaky mental health has worsened considerably in the past year of living with her.  My mom consistently enables her disgusting, immature behavior as she has her entire life, saying nothing in the name of keeping the peace.  My mom is scared of her.  

I just signed a lease on a new place and move out in two weeks!  It feels so vindicating, especially after she laughed in my face and scoffed that I didn’t have the money to move out of Mom’s.  (Guess who’s been saving money and who’s the unemployed one?) I told her I’m getting all of my stuff out of MY storage unit and will no longer pay rent on keeping her stuff so she needs to collect her things and get her own unit.  She will no longer be permitted to see my kids.  I will no longer let her use me as her personal taxi to run her myriad errands about town, as she stiffs me on gas money and disregards my personal time on my days off.  I will no longer cook and clean for everyone while she sits around on her unemployed ass playing games on her phone and contributing nothing to the household.  I will no longer pay her doctors bills or for her asthma medication, while she goes out and spends her means on tattoos.  I will no longer be at her beck and call as she treats me like steamed garbage.  This is a 30 year old WOMAN I’m talking about.  

Everything about being in her presence makes me feel low.  There’s a thick tension between us even when we’re getting along...just this uneasy feeling of, when is she going to snap on me again?  She’s desperately unhappy with herself and I feel she strives to make me feel the same way.  So negative, always complaining about others, refusing to just lighten up and enjoy life.  I have come too far on my own mental health journey only to continue allowing her poison to flow through my life.  I have to protect myself and my family from her toxic drama.  It’s surprising how easy it was for me to just decide that once I move out, I want nothing further to do with her.  It’s as if I shed a thousand pound burden off my back.  I’ve already blocked her everywhere to avoid her hateful texts and awful comments on my social media.  Once I move out, she won’t know where I live.  She won’t see me or my kids.  I’m just so done with her.  I have a close friend who I call my sister.  She is more of a sister to me than my actual sister.  So I’m not losing a sister.  It honestly feels like I’m getting a cancerous tumor removed.  Just so freeing.  I feel a lightness of spirit that I haven’t felt in a long time.  

Thanks for letting me vent and get this out.  Feels good.  We don’t have to put up with anyone treating us like garbage just because they are “family”.",15Jul2020,9
15,"Right, so long story short, I am a big fan of star wars, and so is my younger brother. We’re constantly talking about it, and discussing theories and blah blah blah. Anyways, today my mom overheard us, and she got really angry at me, saying that I need to grow up and stop acting like a kid (I’m 17 btw) My mom is like a very strict Christian, and I love her, I really do, but honestly, I wish she wouldn’t get so negative. Yes, I like Star Wars, probably a bit too much, but I don’t criticize her for her likes, so why is she criticizing me for mine? We got into a really bad argument, and now we’ve been avoiding each other ever since. I know it seems like a stupid thing to get into an argument about, but it’s just really frustrating sometimes, because this happens constantly. Anyways, if you read this all the way to the bottom, thanks I guess, and yeah. Any advice would be appreciated.",15Jul2020,1
18,"Work went well today. I worked hard and got a lot done, even though we were down a man. 

But more importantly, our lead mechanic is leavbing for vacation tomorrow. And the boss man is letting me lead the rest of our current job on a million dollar home. Even though I've only been doing this for 6 weeks and the other guy working with me (claims to) has 4 years experience. My hardwork continues to be noticed and appreciated! Doing the hard thing is paying off!

But EVEN MORE important is the fact that I am excited for tomorrow. Normally I would be so afraid and anxious and would probably ask the boss to send in someone else more experienced who I can follow behind. But instead I stepped up and learned as much as I could and set out a plan for tomorrow morning. Normally I would run from responsibiliy, especially if it's unexpected. Yet here I am, gladly using my free time to prepare for tomorrow morning. I am so glad for this oppurtunity to prove myself. I have to make sure I don't let it slip by!! I will do the hard thing and work my ass off tomorrow morning so I can prove to my boss that i am ready for more responsibility!!. I will do the hard thing!!

Day 2 of worsking out. Today we did back and biceps and I am bushed. Still don't have a concrete routine yet, but anything is better than nothing. It was hard to workout after spending 8 hours outside working hard AF in the heat. But I did it anyways. I did the hard thing!

Day 2 nofap/noporn!

I'm not going to rent a place for my business. At least not right now. I'll start sending out messages to past clients to see if I can get between 6-10 people in for outside classes. I'll also look into cheaper indoor options, like renting from the local park, or maybe renting a gym from one of the local schools. I will start classes in september, so I need to send out emails this week.

Will be taking out first 125$ for CC debt this friday.

In addition to a workout routine, also need to look into a really cheap vegan diet. Even if it tastes crap and is the same 2 dishes over and over, I don't care. As long as it's cheap and easy.

19,"I made a new Reddit account so that I could post anonymously. As you can see from my comment history this account became a lurker too.
Don't think I've followed any subs yet, maybe I have. Either way I'm not interested.
Anyway, today I trawled through my Reddit feed like I would my main account and well this place sucks.
So many serious issues have been made jokes of and it's disgusting and what's it for? Karma. A form of fake validation because everyone wants to be the coolest. 
I don't think I'd have cared this much if the comments weren't given awards and 7k+ upvotes. I saw this over multiple subs, just to clarify. Its vulgar.
And don't get me started on that person whose grandad passed because his mother brought covid back from the church.  If they start acting out those atrocities then by all means don't give them the validation. Their point was clear, so don't hijack their granddad's death for karma. Even it was a troll post, have some humanity. 
Rant over. I'm leaving Reddit and you should too.
Yes, I'll check back on this post to do my last bit of lurking but that'll be it.

21,"I worked really hard during college to be able to get a good job when I graduated, and I was successful. However I spent a lot of time thinking about if this is what I want for the rest of my life, and if I should continue with it. 

I had the opportunity a few months ago to apply to a program to go into another country’s military and to serve for about 2 years. I would be losing out on some hundreds of thousands. I’ve always wanted to serve and live in this country, it’s always been a huge dream of mine. 

But for some reason I keep going back to the money. I know money is not everything in the world but it helps. If I work the job for 2 years and save up money, I can move to this country, but I lose the opportunity to go into the military. 

I’ve been seeing this guy in the other country and I really feel like he’s something special. I could never ask him to wait for me for 2 years, even though I would wait for him for a year if he asked. If I go now, I can live my dream two years earlier and I can see where things go with him. 

If I go in two years, I can save up money and potentially transfer to the same company there but I lose the military and the guy.

22,"I come off as a sweet, timid, shy, rule following, non problematic girl 

It confuses me because I know I have good morals and I never want to hurt anyone. I never lie, come anywhere near hurting a friend, manipulate, cheat/steal

I’m just kind of nervous around new people and when I get to know people I open up more! It makes me confused about who I am on the inside

People say things like “your 90% angel, 10% devil”

I come off as sheltered and I think that’s because controlling parenting and growing up in an insanely sheltered home town. I know when you get to know me I become funnier by not thinking as much and just saying stupid things I[19F] guess. 

From what people have said, I know don’t think I’m as nice when they are close with me but it consumes me because I don’t seem to do anything morally wrong or wrong and am there for all my friend. I don’t insult friends or give backhanded compliments 

I’m never brag and when people compliment me I brush it off or give them a compliment and stay humble

I shown the light on my index and thumb and there is a little squirming ant just a few millimeters long.  

This was a new experience because I've never picked up an ant before or been bitten on the cock by one.

It's really bad.  Super uncomfortable kind of pain.  

Then I turn my room upside down looking for more ants.  I don't find any.  What I think happened was the ant was on my pants from earlier and I put my pants on the bed.  So I'm never putting my pants on the bed again. Lesson learned.

31,"Today is my cake day.

Before I start I will say I know how stupid this all is. I’ve always known how stupid this all is. If anyone can learn from this, I hope you take a lesson from my despair. 

A year ago I created this account. The reason I did was because I felt like my life was beginning to crash down.

I’m 27M,  a bisexual male, out to very few, who has struggled for the most part finding a connection with someone I want to spend a lifetime with. As much as I do like women, I’ve never made a connection as strong as I have with a guy... 

My male best friend of the past 5 years has been the person I have spent most of my time with in the past five years. Sexuality wasn’t something we discussed. I knew deep down he wasn’t like me. I knew he liked women and he’d never really done or said anything to make me believe he could be into men, but I held out hope and denied a lot of warning signs. 

In the five years we’d been best of friends. He and I would holiday together, camp together, talk and hang out basically every day. We lived with each other. His parents divorced and we toughed that out together. I felt like we were closer than just two mates. We had no sexual encounters or intimacy. Shared a bed a few times, shared a shower a few times, but nothing more significant. Never anything sexual. Never kissed him, only hugged him whenever I could. 

He never had a girlfriend, never had any girls come around. I knew he was on tinder, girls threw themselves at him, but he just wouldn’t really act on it. I never saw him with a girl. 

He’s 25, very attractive, it just never made sense to me that in that whole time he wasn’t ever with girls. I thought maybe deep down he was a bit like me and didn’t really give a fuck about girls and relationships. Maybe deep down he just liked our relationship. He’d talk about the future that included me, a property, ambitions, travel.... 

I hoped that maybe he liked me back but was too scared to act on it. I think he knows I really like him. He’s acted in some ways some times that’s implied that I think he knows I want to be closer than just mates. But I know to respect the boundary... 

Creating this account; a year ago we went on a trip. A different one than usual. To a party city... it was the first time I ever saw him with a girl. It shook my whole world. We were dancing at a night club and then I turned around and saw him wrapped around some girl... I remember watching like it was a car crash. I couldn’t look away, but it was horrific... dramatic I know... 

I created this account because I wanted to stay in that fantasy world I’d created where he just didn’t really give a fuck about girls. I went into subs asking questions about all sorts of things. Asking other guys if they’d had similar experiences with friends.... just so I could clinge onto a small hope he could ever love me one day... reddit was Where I could pretend the reason he never dated or got with girls was because he was happy with me and our relationship. I knew that was all too good to be true, but I kept denying it.

As the months drew on, I worried more and more. Tried to make sense of everything, knowing well that it didn’t matter what I did or noticed. Reality was that his life wasn’t going to spent with me. He’d find a girl and make her his eventually. 

As the year drew on, it led into summer in December. We went on another holiday together. In my mind I kind of knew it was the last... things would change. I cherished that trip but nothing happened, as usual... we just had a great time and saw a lot of sights. No cuddling, no breakthrough moments... just two mates hanging out.... 

I’d sit up at night worrying about how I’d react when he got an actual girlfriend. How I’d feel, how I’d react... it make me sick inside...

As Covid lockdowns approached in March of this year... he started going out more without me. Started to party more... without me. I felt like he was trying to get away from me a bit. It hurt me, but I could kind of see it coming. I felt like he was looking for something I could never give him.... 

One night, he came home and for the first time in the entire time of knowing him... he had a girl with him. He was all over her and my heart sank... I thought maybe it’d be a one off... but it became every week... the same girl... now she’s his girlfriend.

I’ve tried to be happy for him. I’ve tried to pretend I don’t care when she’s around. But every time I see her with him and they’re close. I die a bit more inside.

I cry a lot more now in my own time than ever. I can’t think of anyone else.

I know that I have to move on and that in reality he was never mine. I am trying to be happy for him... but it’s so hard when I can’t tell him how I’ve felt and how badly I hoped that maybe he was like me. 

I feel like an idiot, so I don’t need any reminders. Not expecting comments of support... but if you’re reading this and you’ve ever seen a life with someone you know deep down will never eventuate. Tread with extreme caution. This past year has been the hardest of my life. My whole world has broken down. Even though all of this was a fantasy I knew was ridiculous... it felt like the only hope I clinged onto.... 

I am slowly finding my feet again. But I keep having the same dream. I’m lost at a hotel where I know nobody. I looked up the meaning and it means I’m lost in life. That’s how I feel right now.

My best friend means everything to me. I still love him. I don’t obsess over it. But every now and then when I’m alone I just think of all the good times in the past. I know I have to move on from this. But it’s hard.

My cake day is not a happy day unfortunately. But reality has had its way with me, and it’s probably for the best...",15Jul2020,3
32,Why does it seem like everyone else is cool with being lonely? I've seen a lot of post where people say being a loner is awesome almost like preaching it. I deleted my social media about two years ago and ever since then i've been lonely. At first it was cool just enjoying my own company but as of lately its starting to get depressing. It kind of sucks not having friends in real life and im not the type to chat with people on the internet like discord. When i meet new people it never goes anywhere so I always catch myself trying to go back to old friends but it doesn't seem like its right thing to do. Basically my social life is wack. I hate being a loner it feels like everyone made a deal to purposely avoid me. Does anyone else feel like this??,15Jul2020,2
33,"Before Covid happened I was in a really bad place emotionally. I’m about to finish grad school and was extremely stressed about the process of finding a job. I have an eating disorder, binge eating like crazy to deal with stress and anxiety. I had put my life on hold to finish my PhD and couldn’t think of anything else. Then Covid happened. Job prospects annihilated, everything I worked for so hard for the past years seems to be worth nothing. The first weeks were hell, I was scared to death for my elderly parents and everyone else really. Whenever I had to go out of the house to get food I felt pure terror, looking over my shoulder all the time afraid of other people on the street. To escape the stress and the isolation I started chatting someone up on a dating app. Didn’t think this would go anywhere, we were in quarantine, I had never seen this guy before. But we kept talking. And then we started having phone calls, then video calls, and suddenly we were talking every day and sharing our worries and hopes for the future. We grew really close, and I felt like I was opening up to him in a way that I have never allowed myself to do. Maybe it was the deep sense of isolation that pushed me over my usual limits, I don’t know. But we developed a deep bond. Once things eased up we started making plans to finally meet. I was anxious! What if it didn’t work out in person? You can’t fully predict how you will physically react to somebody. We met. It was simply wonderful. There were a few hiccups here and there - adjusting to a new person in a weird situation where seeing someone is not as easy as it used to be. But we managed. We talk about everything and I trust this person deeply.
We’ve been together since and we decided to move in together in the next few weeks. I’ve never been happier with someone. The awful situation with Covid somehow allowed me to get past my own fixations about delaying happiness, and now I also don’t feel so stressed about work anymore. Things will work out eventually. For now, I’m happy to be with this person. I don’t know how I would have endured this without him.",15Jul2020,1
37," Just as the title says: I wish I wasn't white. There are too many reasons to recount them all, but here are some nonetheless (listed in no particular order). For context, I am a gay twenty-five year old white male living in the United States of America, specifically the Pacific Northwest.

1. **Privilege**. I received innumerable privileges due to being a white person, especially a young, white male. But I'm still a failure. I desperately wish I could have succeeded with all these privileges; however, I haven't. And it exacerbates my sense of failure to know that, despite these privileges, I still failed. These privileges weren't deserved or well-used; please let someone else enjoy them.
2. **Culture**. I acknowledge that every culture casts its own shadow; nothing human is perfect. But the culture I belong is rooted in the systemic oppression of others-- an oppression that continues to this day. At Thanksgiving I'm reminded of the cruelty towards Indians, at Christmas I'm faced with the imposition of religion; I'm connected to landmarks of white but racist homesteaders; my career (paralegal working in cases relating to the Civil Rights Act of 1964), my apartment (low-income unit in previously segregated Black neighborhood)-- all are owing to the wake of this system oppression.
3. **Shame**. I understand some people will especially cringe at this point, but I cannot avoid it. I am an incredibly sympathetic individual, steeped in my feelings for others. If I see a homeless non-white person, my heart aches for them and I want to apologize on behalf of white people for the injustices they have surely suffered. If I hear of a non-white single parent, I am brought to tears at the humiliation I have from other white people I know of who will rejoice at the misfortunes of that parent.
4. **Features**. I have a full, red beard with bright, blonde hair, in addition to pale skin and blue-gray eyes. I find every race attractive and I have happily dated men from a diverse range of racial backgrounds, such as Black, Hispanic, Asian, and white men. But for myself, I have always desperately desired to look different than I do... thick, straight, black hair; beautiful, chocolate-colored skin; deep, brown eyes, etc. I look at the mirror and I see a familiar face that can be overwhelmingly spotted in every crowd here: white. I'm not special, unique, or remarkable. Just your average Joe of the Pacific Northwest.
5. **Community/Belonging**. This is the most lengthy reason so I have saved it for last. I have never felt a sense of belonging to being white, my ancestry, the culture, my community. None of it. By contrast, I have known quite a few Hispanic friends who felt similarly about themselves in this regard, but even they took comfort in watching soccer with their family or eating their abuela's tamales-- sometimes, they even felt pride from their associations with these comforts. I am sure what I am about to say will come with countless personal exceptions, but I have observed that non-white communities have a greater connection. They have more siblings, nieces, and nephews; they are closer to cousins, uncles, aunts, and the friends who are also within those non-white communities; they have family birthdays, family-owned businesses, and family events. That isn't to say white people don't have these same things, but in my shallow experience, they are far less significant and frequent than in non-white communities. Moreover, that also isn't to say that having these things is a key to happiness. I've heard of many a miserable non-white family. But these things are important, at least to me. And for me, I have been hopelessly and helplessly without a community or sense of belonging. (For further context, I don't speak to any of my family due to a long train of abuse and neglect.) And in some hypothetical scenario, even if I were to finally begin to find a community and sense of belonging in, say, Kenya, I would still always remain an outsider because I am white.",15Jul2020,1
38,"  I’m at my (19F) dad’s place right now, to stay for a couple weeks. I “went to bed” two and a half hours ago, and I’m tired, I’m incredibly sore, just burned out (heh), but I just can’t fall asleep.

 The fire started in the bathroom, around 5 PM today. Apparently, the fan that we haven’t used for years, was really faulty wiring, and the plumber (brother in-law) who came earlier that day turned it on while he worked and didn’t turn it off after. No way he could have known, nobody blames him and nor should anyone. 

 Meanwhile, I was in my room, adjacent to the bathroom, reading a book. I knew he was supposed to come in that day, as the water wasn’t working. So, when the lights started to flicker in my room, I thought that he was here working on things and idk, maybe they were just doing that. It wasn’t unusual on stormy days, but it was happening a lot. Maybe after this chapter I’ll go check what’s up.

 A few minutes later, my brother yells, “the toilet is on fire!” and opened my door, and smoke flooded in. I turned off my lights as I left my room, yelling there was a fire to my little brother on the other side of the house, who, oblivious as always just thought the smoke was my mom cooking, as he was on the other side of the house. On my way out of my room, I saw the bathroom with the toilet spewing flames, and the wall behind it starting to go up too.

 My mom, who was already outside, heard my brother yell and went for the fire extinguishers, two little cans the size of a water bottle, to see the damage. She gave the cans to my brother to use, and got onto the roof with the hose to get the roof wet, probably the most flammable part we could reach. I helped turn it on, and called 911.

 It was almost twenty minutes until they got there, everyone was out of the house, but I couldn’t find any of our four cats, two barely old enough to be allowed outside. We grabbed what important things we could, our computer towers, and the game consoles, no wires or anything. I got my purse which had my wallet. I was going in one last time before the smoke got too bad before they got there, at least three firemen with a big hose. It was definitely time to go, I was already doubting if it was a good idea to go back.

 So we sat outside, in the hot summer sun, on a day we didn’t even have water, as our house was pouring out smoke. A neighbor had joined in to help earlier, now telling my mother to let him know if we needed more help. But as time went on, the firemen worked, and the smoke slowly dwindled and stopped.

 I’m not sure how long it took to be cleared for us to go back in. It felt like hours, but it had to have been at most thirty minutes after they showed up. The entire time, once they took over, my brother and I were cracking stupid jokes. How we had almost gotten the new internet set up. That I’d have an excuse for a new wardrobe. Things like that. Of course, time was taken to look for the cats, but we were fairly certain they would be fine. Mostly worried about the little ones, but we thought it likely they were under the house, and the fire was mostly at the top. 



 Then, we were cleared to go inside. Most of the house, was fine. The side with the bathroom was obviously the worst, but ten feet out of that, the only damage was the insulation moved by the firefighters cutting a hole in the ceiling. My room, directly connected, was a horrible mess in the doorway, but a tarp was covering the entrance, and the view, very deep. But the burnt, blackened insulation and now-charcoal was in the way of even stepping around it, so it wasn’t until the majority of the living room was cleaned and the path secured that anyone could get in.

 Everything past the tarp was 90% fine. My bed, which had been against that wall, had been pushed aside, drenched, covered in ash and puffs of insulation, but my desk and my shelf beyond, looked untouched. My papers, on the shelf, still balanced in stupid arrangements, usually falling the minute I tried to grab one sheet.

 But the bathroom was obviously the worst. But, didn’t have nearly as much value to me, call me heartless. The tile needed to be replaced already, and the bathtub was self cleaning! But the toilet was just black, and our plumbing undoubtedly gonna be back up. The fire from the toilet was the fan cover, and a bunch of wood and debris burning. Don’t know how we didn’t hear that, come to think of it.

 But we worked. This time, actually for hours. My brother in law and both sisters came and helped, mostly putting shredded insulation and wood into bags and chucking it outside. My room, which visually had more stuff in it than the much larger living room, was a much quicker clean because most of the insulation was intact, coming in those big bales one could just fold and bring out. 

 There wasn’t nearly as much water on the floor as I expected. That’s because the insulation acted as a sponge. There was still a lot of water, sure, but it seemed that most of the fire, the initial fire in the toilet was the majority, and the firefighters just had to put out the startings of a much bigger fire, the frameworks of the building. It seemed, that we had done everything that we could have to prevent a huge disaster. We were all glad of that. Very little regret was had, for what still was a major, stressful event.

 And now I’m here, at my dad’s house, with my brother. My sister had been staying with my other sister, and my younger brother went with his father. My mom stayed behind. I understand why, but I’m still worried. We have chickens to feed, we have confused and terrified little cats we finished rounding up. Her room was on the exact opposite side of the house, and while there would be no electricity until an electrician came out, the plumbing in the second bathroom was fine, we had water stored that could be used to refill the toilet after flushing occasionally.

 I got here five hours ago, I want to say. My dad knew we would be coming. I took a shower and actually had to wash myself properly. Not just rinsing important areas with soap as usual, but scrubbing myself down of ash on my feet, in my hands.

 And now I’m on a couch, alone in the first floor of my dad’s house, everyone else upstairs. The room I’m in doesn’t even have a door, just a changing screen in front of the hallway. I thought I would sleep easy with how exhausted and sore I am, but now that there isn’t anything I should be doing, nothing to help with, nothing to wait for, I keep coming back to earlier.

 I’m not crying, that hasn’t come, even though I’m not trying to resist them. But I feel as though I should be. Hopefully writing this out will help. I still feel exhausted but that might not equal sleep. I just want this day to end, so that I can be one day closer to coming back and help to rebuild. That won’t be tomorrow, I’ll be incredibly sore. Maybe not the next either, I’m already having a hard time just walking. But the next for sure. I don’t know what’s planned, but I’m going to be there to help. It’s the least I could do.

 I miss home.",15Jul2020,3

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

42,"its my 17th birthday today :) none of my friends have greeted me and im pretty sure i just want validation really. my family always remembers bc my dad and i share a birthday but also bc well i live w them lol.

up until this this year i typically wouldn’t want too much attention bc, well, i feel selfish mentioning it and it kinda reinforces my belief that no one except my immediate family rly cares. stupid too prideful stuff ig. last yr i was at the honeymoon phase i guess of my /post-mental-ward suicidal recovery/~ so i honestly didnt mind as much. as for now though, i know my mental health has gotten worse so rn its pity party central lol.

i have like 3 friend groups n very active group chats and i always try to remember and greet ppls birthdays even if they say they dont care bc i feel theyll at least appreciate someone remembering. but even though i think this mentality is kinda petty, it would be nice for one of those 50ish ppl to remember :/

the only other person whos ever consistently greeted me was my very first friend from kindergarten and even though we dont talk too much now weve always tried our best to greet each other. but idk now bc its only 1 am and yk covid. 

im in this council gc for a club ive been a part of for three years now, and they were deciding on a new date for virtual team bonding and the president, who just so happens to be one of my best friends, pitched todays date, and then asked me why im unavailable wednesday. i was upset, but i didnt want to make them feel bad in the group call, so i just said its my dads birthday. (which ive probably mentioned to everyone that we share a birthday bc its like the one fun fact about me besides “oh ive been 2 mentow hospitow/ looney bin”) 

also yesterday it was my friend’s birthday and i was on a discord call w a couple others in that group when i texted the lil starter happy birthday message in the gc. on discord someone asked how i remembered and i literally said its bc its the day before mine. and they said “wait tmrws ur birthday? 🥺” in that type of tone. hell that person was literally online a while ago, so now ik they saw the time and forgot. 

i understand why and how people wouldnt greet me right at 12, BUT i can literally see that people are awake and im getting gc notifs and ik for sure that at least 3 people heard me and are aware from yesterday. 

i can make up plenty excuses for myself about them not saying anything, like for example ik my aforementioned best friend/club president isnt the type to remember or have a good sleep schedule, etc etc, just so i can feel better about myself. yet at the end of the day ik its probably bc i dont open up enough to build solid and lasting relationships with people who care enough to simply remember my birthday. that’s honestly just my depression talking but it still stings.

ik this is long and hefty but if you read all of this i would really love to read a happy birthday message even if its from a complete stranger, even if its a basic lil “hb” so if any of you kind strangers come across this and just so happen to read it all, even though its not my place to ask, i hope just someone, please, just simply do that for me. thank you",15Jul2020,2
45,"I’m having a tough time letting go of this girl I was in a relationship with. We didn’t end on a horrible note which makes it hard for me to hate her. Sometimes I listen to songs and immediately think about her. She is on my mind almost everyday. There are so many things I miss about her, and it makes me sad. 

I talk to her sister once in a while and could never be mad at her mother. It feels like I’ll be connected to her forever. It was hard for me to erase the pictures of us on my phone. I have them saved somewhere in a cloud I don’t look at often instead. I still have her on my Spotify and Netflix plans. I can’t even delete the playlists I made for us.

There are reminders of her all around me. The spot where we had one of our first kisses is a street over from where I live. We once fooled around at night in a car down the street from the University I attend. A ice cream parlor was next to us, I visited it two days ago. I still have the bible and journal she gave me. There is that one little art piece she made for me on a flashcard on my wall. The shirts she bought me are in my dresser. I wear them sometimes, and got rid of a few others. 

She represents so much goodness. I see her face in my head. They’re like flashes of moments we had together. I wish things could’ve been different between us. I hate having my mom ask about her and me avoiding a conversation about why we don’t speak anymore.",15Jul2020,0
46,"This was written the first days of quarantine. Just before I went into isolation. I wrote it while thinking about how a couple girls complemented me in an overtly sexual way. It made me uncomfortable, so I started worrying about it. So far, I've avoided so many things I wanted to do, places I wanted to be as a result of that.

So here is a poem that basically says, ""Bryan, stop thinking things will be sexual. Go do stuff. Life is for living, not for worry.""

Into the ocean, glowing brighter than before, no more

You are this singular emotion as the ships depart from shore

Let not the field of angels be feared as less than gods

Abundant hope defies your clarity of bonds

Into, through, before this fading memory dissolves

Undue is all the hate that divides, left unsolved

Creating this decision for you to avoid

Deny yourself this, keep away from that

Undermine the denial you choose to cause

Never defy your own indecent laws

Within this there is reason, late

Interest in ghosts who tempted fate

I am real, just as are you

When these fences fall, and the moment is through

Shall we see this, be this unending series of moments

Life cries for us, opening it's eyes for us

Where there is a beginning, an end, shall it be equal in kind

Don't fight the things you see in all, falling through your mind

Creating a force worth fearing, there is so much more in these places we find

Understood a remembrance, this dance is something to cherish, not decline

Yet, still, for all time, will it be, not for me

I know not who you are, you are too far from my mind to care

This is not solitude, hope, within a cross to bare",15Jul2020,2

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

Than COVID hit and we where out of school. I also gained a lot of weight leading to school shouting down. After a month I remembered I had this girl Ig so I dmd her and she responded in less than a minute. We talked about stuff but this was shortly live because she stopped responding to my dms. She even blocked me on Ig. I Blame it on how I messaged her so much as this was my first time doing this with a girl.

55,"Hi Reddit, I'm just posting my thoughts and feelings that have neen storming my mind recently and I needed somewhere to write it down and get some insight into my thinking. For context I'm a 28M, who recently had a first date with a stunning 29F.  We're both well educated individuals with careers in the medical field. I can say for sure her career is certainly starting to take off and well... mine has been hit and miss recently and I'm still figuring what I'm ultimately going to be doing. Personally, I do not have much dating experience and am generally a shy individual, which I felt was in direct contrast to her experience.  This is a throwaway account and I've made the details as vague as possible for obvious reasons. 

I thought the date went pretty well and we did talk about a lot of common interests i.e. music, travelling, food etc. Generally, I thought we had a good time although I did feel like the date did end a bit prematurely as she had to rush off to meet others (completely understandable). Afterwards, I started to reflect on the date and the topics we discussed and also some of my own life tidbits, here are just a few:

\- I think my view of relationships has been skewed by movies and other such media in the past. I think I've grown up that I need to be completely indebted to the person I'm going to be with and in essence madly in love with them. I'm starting to see that this is not a healthy view point to pursue and its taken me a long time to realise that I should try to live for myself and not entirely for others. I know this has certainly been the reason why I've been so heartbroken in past relationships when they haven't workded out and I questioned it when I felt I was so devoted to the other person. 

\- As I stated before her dating experience was significantly more than mine. One red flag that I may have picked up on was that she spent a significant amount of time talking about her previous relationships DURING the date, which again (trying to be a mature individual) I didn't really get her to explore these further at the time. Subconciously though, I think it tore me up a bit as I couldn't but help compare myself to these past individuals who were a lot more older, financially more stable and had more life experience. My friends have weighed up on this a bit and have told me that it's never a race, but again it does take a bit of time for me to get over something like this. 

\- You could say that my date was (rightly) proud of her achievments in life and she defintely worked hard to get to where she was today. On the other hand, I felt as though (in comparison, once again not healthy and yes I'm going to work on it) my achievements/career were not that glorious in comparison. Again this means nothing as we both have very different career trajectories but it's just something that nibbles again at the back of mind - 'could I have done my own life a bit better? Could I have put in a bit more effort?'. I think personally, this is a bit different for those who are dating someone in a completely different career. Ultimately, I know I have a longer, winding road to climb to reach similar levels to where she is going. 

\- Everyone has their own shit. When you're dating, you usually only see the best/good of that individual upfront. It does take a bit of time to get past that see what kind of stuff they have going on in their lives. I think again I do get a bit disheartened when I seen someone so well put together and I'm sometimes fidining my life is a mess in comparison. Linking again to my limited experience, I've never been in a realtionship where I've seen the otherside of an individual with all their issues (the relationship usually ends before we truly start opening up) so I've become a bit disollutioned with this as it constantly feels like my life is in flux with everyone I meet. My friends are slowly helping to get over that. 

\- We did discuss during the date about the future and other stuff. We both had anxieties about a competitive career in the future and the possibility of starting families in general. I felt that whatever she did, she would accomplish because she had a sensible head on her shoulders and was pretty fantastic at whatever she did. I wanted to say to her that she didn't have anything to worry about but I kinda felt I was trivialising it a bit. To be honest, what I really wanted to say was that I would be happy and excitited to be part of her life as she makes her way. 

\- We did get onto what we wanted from a relationship and romance was a topic. I said that I was sort of a lost romantic in the sense that I wanted to pursue the little sweet romantic times in life (for example, having a cheeky/passionate kiss in the mornings or when she isn't expecting it, suddenly having little romantic dances/waltzes in the evening to take the edge off, cooking her favourite meal after a hard day). Those were the experiences that I wanted to live for that would ultimately blossum into meaningful relationship. Obviously this isn't all there is to a relationship (i.e. making compromises and family issues as well), but I for some reason really put emphasis into the little things. We'll always have work to do and there will be good and bad days. But I felt that it was these romantic moments like these are what would help me get through the days and bad periods. I kinda got the feeling from the date that it wasn't appreciated enough and that really disheartened me. 

\- I had been an extremely jealous indivdual in the past and it has never ended up well for me. I've tried my hardest to never revert to that type of person again, but at times I do feel I do get the short end of the stick in relationships. 

Sorry for the long rant. I kinda felt I had to get it all out there before I overthought stuff or my heart burst. I did message her about being interested in meeting up again and I have been put on hold =/. Not the best outcome, but I am glad that I did go out on a date (it's been long overdue) and by doing this I have leveled up in my emotional maturity. I just wanted to get some insightful feedback from the reddit community to see if I'm complelety out left field or I should keep going with these lines of thought.",15Jul2020,1
57,"I miss waking up everyday excited and filled with energy because life was awesome

I miss being overly amazed by videogames, movies, and cartoons

I miss seeing my parents and feeling the warmest and safest feeling in the world

I miss hating nights because everything turned scary

I miss the old internet where no one was famous and we were all stupid kids

I miss going to my dad's office and playing flash games for hours on his computer

I miss the weekends where my dad took my sister and I to theme parks, golf and bowling

I miss spending all weekdays evenings with my nanny (r.i.p) when my parents were working

I miss my grandma's hugs feeling so overwhelming

I miss getting excited to see my cousins on christmas

At some point in life I remember everything started to change. When my younger borther was born I started hating my mom, and because of the fights we had, I started loosing the trust I had with my dad. Videogames and cartoons started to feel empty.

Our method of ""enforcement"" is to post a sign on the door stating they are required, but we are not allowed to tell them to wear one. I'd say 65 percent of people do NOT. Now, we are allowed to tell those who are playing the gambling machines to wear one. Do not ask me to explain this logic. Whenever I ask those people to wear one, I am met with groans, political rants, etc. In 2 cases I got cussed out. I just want to know what people gain from being this way.

I (24M), like many all over the US and possibly world, have been laid off for months. I am a Geotechnical Engineer and we were hit very hard with all of our jobs being canceled or pushed back, causing layoffs. Then, as more work is awarded to us, the clients keep pushing the work back. So... it's been since mid May since I worked. I went from working an average of 50 hrs/week and constantly traveling to being home all the time. Don't get me wrong, I love being able to relax (or so I've convinced myself).

Well, I've been showing several signs of depression for several weeks now. Actually, come to think of it, I haven't felt right since my grandfather passed away in the beginning of January but I always struck that up to the grieving process. Now it doesn't feel like grief.

It feels cliché to say this, but now I just feel like I'm drowning. As if I'm swimming and get my hand to about 2 feet from the surface and the surface extends away from me like in the movies.

67,"I was going to meet up with my boyfriend In LA and we were gonna do some hiking. I took off 3 days from my job, and I had this trip planned for MONTHS. 1 week before my trip My manager is fired for basically giving away free stuff, and we get a new manager who’s first day is my last day before my vacay. She asks me to cover the weekend and I tell her no, she should check the calendar we keep. I was the Assistant Manager so I knew a lot, and I finished my shift and said bye to my work girls. 

On the trip, my boyfriend got stopped for a random search. He’s ambiguous, although Hispanic, he gets profiled as some sort of middle eastern often. And I was terrified. It turned into a funny story. So when my coworkers asked about my trip I tell them about the search. 1 girl references the legal marijuana laws in California and I said hey, if we got stopped for that, It would’ve been worth it, but nope just regular old islamphobia around a Hispanic man. Considering we live in Texas. We laughed and the new manager came out and said we need to calm down and jokes like that weren’t funny. It was obviously funny because we laughed. 

I come in the next morning and she’s there to tell me that due to my inappropriate behavior with staff I was fired. And I immediately thought, no you’re just upset I couldn’t work on the days I had off and I came back from a good time, which is weird. And she said yes it did set a bad taste in her mouth, but weed jokes at work are not tolerated. But there were no customers in the store, we were just closing up so it was weird. 

This happened years ago, but it pisses me off everytime. And Texas is an at will state so for all I know she probably just fired cause she didn’t like my look, who knows.",15Jul2020,0

Okay, eventually someone was going to find it but still.


Let me give some details.

I'm a man
I have a dildo
The male G spot is in the ass so it's natural to only try.

I have had it for quite some time and today I think...I THINK my mum found it.

I was out with my brother today for a out 3-4 hours and my mum was going through a deep clean. I keep my dildo under the box my fan stands on. When I came back my box with the fan on had moved back so she could clean. Now I've moved the box and it doesn't make any noise on the Inside. Except since I know it moved I can't help but think she saw it.

Keep in mind I know for a fact she saw my condoms because she cleaned in that area too. That one I'm okay with because that's natural. I guess now all that's left is to try and get over the fact that she may or may have not seen the dildo. Because if she did, that's awkward on my half not knowing for certain if she found it or not.

Since the box doesn't make noise from the way I moved it, I don't think she did. But on the other hand, she may have taken the fan off or lifted the box to move it. 


From what you've read. Does anyone have any advice to maybe tell if she's seen it or how I can get over thinking she's seen it. Believe me, this type of thing never bothers me and I don't ever feel awkward literally ever. But this time I guess this time it's different.",15Jul2020,1

I have never seen anyone on a ventilator and I'm sorry to anyone who had to bear with that. 
I never thought I would ask a nurse ""Do you think she can hear me?"" and get ""You'll never know sweetie, you never know"". 

I held her hand and told her it was me, and she started to move and shake. I asked her to stop and she calmed down. I'd like to think she could hear me, I know there's a chance it's reflexes, but it makes me happier with the thought that she heard me. 
I said my piece to her, promised to care for her kids, I cried my tears, I said my goodbye. 

Later that night, we were anticipating her other relatives coming from out of state. They were on their way to another state for another death on their side. Around maybe 1am, I woke up to my mother crying and she and my other cousin simultaneously awoke and got the call that she was being moved. 

We met my cousin's (in hospital) at a hotel. We sat outside and saw a few people my age (20s) hanging out at a bonfire. Not to long after, we're rolling up some weed and an old man in hawaiian attire with a cane came and sat at a table across from us and the other group. He didn't say anything, but looked at the fire and the kids. He left not too long after and came back. We didn't say much about him but we noticed him. The kids were getting up to leave and we took their place at the bonfire

THE EXPERIENCE 

As we're sitting at the bonfire, smoking, reminiscing about the times we shared, even though she wasn't declared dead yet. When the guy came back the second time, he had a couple of bouquets of wilted and dead flowers. He was just saying things like ""Y'all look like my family!"" and just looking right into my mother's eyes saying ""those eyes those eyes"". We weren't mean or dismissive at all like one would on a regular occasion, but it just felt like he was okay. He laughed and chatted for a few minutes and then he quietly placed one bouquet of flowers by the fire and quietly walked away with his flowers and cane. 

It was about less than 10 minutes later we got the call that she went into cardiac arrest and they were trying for 20 minutes. She died at 3:20am.

It wasn't until this morning when the sun came up, I thought about the idea. 

I honestly feel like it will help me greiving, this experience.

My question is simple enough- basically what is the best way you have discovered things you don’t like about yourself and have managed to correct them?
In specific talking about behaviours or patterns of thought that you don’t like about yourself.

To give a bit of context: 
I’ve been single for roughly two and a half years (after a hard break up) and this has been a period of positive transformation for me. I’ve learned to enjoy life and myself a lot more, including my own company, and am generally a lot more relaxed and happy about life.

Very recently I started going out with someone, and after the first time we went away together I could almost feel like a switch going off, and I somehow started reverting back to the old me being in a relationship and recognising previous behaviours- being more nervous, and stressed, less easy going, and I felt like I wasn’t the best version of myself. I really hate this, and it’s clearly down to me and not the other person. 
It’s taken me a long while to find someone I really like, who is exciting to be around, and I hate to think that I can’t be the version of myself that I like and have worked hard on, around him.

TL;DR how have you learned to correct your own behaviours that you don’t like?",15Jul2020,1
80,"This is an exchange I had with an apparent big-wig at the agency (who I didn't realize who he was, oh no! ::eye roll::) that they want to have a special meeting with me to talk about our ""core values"" about. A law changed or new protocol for who we're paying to ""service"" our families is going to be implemented, and they encouraged questions about what a 15 minute primer video was telling us. My direct supervisor thought nothing of it and just said she hopes I don't lose my shit and go out on bad terms. It should be easy enough to discern who's talking, but I'll break each question's back and forth with a line.

--------------------

**How much are we going to paying in ""per diem"" verses what we are paying in billable hours today?**

That depends on several variables.  The idea with Family Pres is that we’re moving to a more intensive approach to service delivery for these families to not only prevent removals when we can, but more quickly and efficiently move the case to closure and the family to life after DCS.

**I know what the idea is, but I don't know to the degree it's an informed idea, and unfortunately this doesn't answer the question.**

---------------------

**What happens to individual therapists or smaller outfits that DCS trusts and works with that might not have the ability to address every concern a family may have even while they are really good at doing what it is they are currently doing?**

All of our community-based providers are still available for other case types.  For IA’s and in-home CHINS cases, you will need to select one of the contracted Family Pres providers.  For existing cases, they can continue with their current services but after June 1 the law requires us to utilize this new service.

**So a case worker retains their small outlet, puts in a FPS person anyway, and that doesn't immediately conflict with one of the opening training slides that it's supposed to simplify a seemingly complicated process? I got feedback from a small therapist who said she would not even be able to bid to be allowed to be a vendor unless she hired an unsustainable amount of people to provide for services she currently doesn't.**

---------------------

**How do you construct ""better measure the impact"" of each provider's work? Are there surveys? Are they self-reporting? Are we starting an auditing leg? What are we comparing their metrics to to denote that it is ""better?""**

We’ll be able to gather a number of different data points such as intensity, model effectiveness, etc.  More importantly we’ll be able to see which providers are investing the time and resources in each case and track the outcomes of those cases (removal/closure/extension).

**I don't understand this. What constitutes ""intensity"" and ""model effectiveness?"" I'm still confused as to what makes an FPS referral a better equipped to track what we're doing. Do they have better software? Training in data collection? We don't know already when we're removing, closing, or extending a case? If we can't open a case unless their is a substantiation of abuse or neglect, what is meant by a referral must be made to FPS in any in-home CHINS or IA even if there is not a substantiation?**

If a case exists that is either a in-home CHINS or IA, a FPS referral is required to be issued according to the new law.

**​I understand there is a new law. I think the slide was confused in its phrasing, because a case is predicated on a substantiation. Unless the law has changed something to do with the circumstances and an FPS referral is to be put in anyway.**

---------------------

**How do we ensure providers are documenting their evidence-based model any better than we currently are? Is there a roadmap for each model that we can follow along? Is it predicated on individual perception of progress or perhaps family testimony?**

Central Office will help monitor the delivery of EBM’s through regular audits but providers are also required to document required fidelity measures in their monthly report as well as maintaining their certifications to provide those models with the model owners themselves.

**This is the ""who,"" but not the ""how."" The company I was working for was required to document as well, and whatever they were documenting was not accurately reflecting what they provided. Them being pressed on how to justify their billing would have gone a long way to help families and kept money out of bilking hands.**

-----------------------

**Concrete assistance must be paid by the provider ""when necessary"" like a heat bill in the winter to prevent removal. Who's determining when it is necessary?**

You, your supervisor and the Family Team.

**The video says the team decides, otherwise a removal would be necessary. If the provider controls the purse, is it hard to imagine they'll get creative in arguing for how the child doesn't need removed? How does this not incentivize providers to hang on to cash by insisting families move, access shelters, or under and falsely report?**

Many of our partner agencies have long-standing relationships with the State and for their agencies to remain solvent, most wish to continue those relationships.  Again, we will be able track a variety of data points, including when and how concrete assistance is being utilized.

**Why would DCS cede that decision making process with the allocation of funds for families they likely have more familiarity and history with and no financial incentive to downplay?**

If you or your supervisor identify a need that requires the use of concrete assistance funds, it is the expectation that (within reason) would occur.  You are still the manager of the case and if you run into concerns like these, please report them to me immediately.

**I suppose the practical reality of this will play out one way or another. Some of our long-standing agencies do a consistently ""meh"" to ""terrible"" job as it is and still get paid. I don't know what they've done, nor gather from the collective coworker conscience that they deserve even more money.**

----------------------------

**A good portion of this video describes our job. If we're asking providers to identify safety concerns more comprehensively than we are currently, and to call the hotline if they are unable to get a hold of someone at the office, are we not just adding an unnecessary barrier to addressing the concern ourselves and acting in a timely and organized manner with regard to our caseloads?**

Well, we’re not.  Providers understand their mandate and responsibility to report any concerns.   If a safety concern is identified by the provider, they are required to report that immediately by phone. This does not necessarily mean that a new report will be generated, but rather the information was communicated to someone at the county immediately.

**Why are we shifting the burden and removing the impetus to develop ongoing relationships with our families?**

I’m unsure how you arrived at this conclusion.

**If we're not understanding our mandate to ensure the safety of children, why are we believing providers are doing any better or trusting we have the capacity to recognize when they are doing so? As an assessor, the amount of new reports that get generated because we fumble around with pretty straight-forward means of accounting for what we already know does not give me reason to believe new reports won't get generated. I arrive at the conclusion that we are shifting the burden because instead of paying case managers to case manage, it sounds like we're mandating fledgling to tolerable service providers get paid more to do what were explicit descriptions of my/our job.**

------------------------

**Is there anything consolidating providers speaks to that could not be better accounted for by better organizing and distributing work loads at the individual county level?**

I’m not really sure about you mean by this question, but one of the ideas behind Family Preservation is streamlining service delivery.  We know from years of feedback from families that multiple providers increases confusion and duplication of those services. ​

**Things I've proposed are the making of unannounced home visits by assessors with less on their active case load, the distribution of menial paperwork tasks to designated people, the auto-filling of paperwork ready to print, and concurrent database search-ability to free up hours that can be spent with families or traveling.**

Ok

**Feedback from families will tell you perfectly inadequate case managers were their favorite or that someone who worked tirelessly to keep a family together hates them and did a terrible job. If you're going to solicit feedback, you need to ensure that those families weren't just being handled by a disorganized case manager, aren't reporting from areas with a lack of services to begin with, aren't experiences a mental or practical barrier that would keep them communicating with those providers, and were being properly referred in the first place. If you're basing the idea of changing the law solely on ""families thought this was confusing,"" that seems incredibly short in its analysis of why they may say that. My questions suggests that if you better train and equip case managers, by actually organizing what the expectations are, better oversight, and things we apparently can't take for granted and have lost even the conception of, you don't need to redirect money to someone else to do a worse job.**

-------------------------------

**As someone who has filled out ""monthly reports"" as a visit supervisor, I can tell you I was encouraged to use catch-all language that suggested they had trained me to do this comprehensive level of engagement I was in no way trained to do. As well, it was never expected I should learn or ask how to get to the level required to properly address the needs, and I was reprimanded for raising my concern for our inadequate standards. We still contract with that agency, leading me to believe our oversight is exactly zero, yet we plan to shift the responsibility even further to service providers?**

I’ve attached a helpful document that we utilize to help FCM’s understand what they should be seeing in monthly reports as well as what we should be including in our referrals to providers.  It’s unfortunate that you have this perception, but I’m hopeful when you review monthly reports submitted to you on your cases that you are mindful that case plan goals are being addressed and examples of progress/lack there of are being documented.

**I'm in assessment, I'm just relaying my first-hand, albeit anecdotal, knowledge of a company that bragged about its increasing access to drug-riddled families and their willingness to hire anyone to send into anyone’s home to collect.**

----------------------------

**Cases should be referred for 6 months, ensuring the provider a paycheck even if the family only needs 3 months of an I.A. or something as specific as a payment one month in times of crisis?**

We will rely on our Child and Family Teams in concert of course with our partner agencies and relevant participants to be familiar enough with the clients and their progress to understand when decisions about the direction of each case need to be made.

**It said 6 months was *required*. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. If that 6 month period conflicts with the wisdom of the team, who wins?**

---------------------------------

**Parent enters detox, kid is with healthy grandma environment, but don't close the referral, because provider is now incentivized to tell grandma kid needs their lowest cost already hourly-budgeted service or some broad family planning and monitoring. As long as there's a kid anywhere at any level of DCS, I bet they're going to have an identified need, real or otherwise, that keeps the referral open, no?**

I would point you to a few of the answers above.  If partner agencies “game” the system that would negatively affect their ability to receive future referrals and contracts with the State.

**In theory it would, but I don't know how it does currently, and I certainly don't know how it would when they squeeze out smaller outlets and we become dependent on them to an even further degree.**

-------------------

**Make sure new kids are added to the referral, because who knows the kind of expensive baby-specific specialists it will need that the per diem needs to make sure it accounts for! Generational abuse means we can keep them on the hook for life!**

I’m not sure this really needs a response, I would direct you to our Practice Model and your supervisor if concerns like this become an issue.  I hope this is helpful!

**I'm inferring the direction I've watched places like Centerstone go in handing out flyers with 36 different services they provide arranged like a bad power point, and when you drill down, they're lucky to have 2 therapists with availability that doesn't stretch 3 to 5 months out. Now, one of those 2 therapists is going to call themselves or certify themselves as also a *specialist* at something like ""moms coping with treating a baby with withdrawal"" and insist they need to be involved at their specialized rate.**",15Jul2020,0

92,"Hello Reddit,

I hope you are all doing well during this pandemic. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for the past few years, which seems to have gotten worse recently. I just wanted some advice and tips on how I can improve myself:

I suspect a combination of social anxiety, anxiety in general, overthinking, and mild depression have contributed to why I feel this way as of late. I overthink every scenario and possibility, to the point that it’s become a comforting habit. When I overthink, I get anxious about what I’m thinking about. What I don’t overthink, I get anxious that I’m not overthinking and feel like I’m missing out on something. This severely interferes with my ability to stay present, as instead of actually staying present I spend time wondering how I can stay present and find myself not present at all (if that makes sense). I worry about the past, the future, the present... just about everything. It’s like my brain looks for “the next thing to worry about” whenever I’m at peace.

This has recently been the case with my friends as well. I always feel like all my friends secretly hate me and talk behind my back. No hard evidence of course, but anytime such as when they don’t reply for hours I immediately think they are talking behind my back. And recently I found myself not even being able to joke around with them: whenever they jokingly tease me, I know for a fact it’s because we’re close friends and not directed towards me genuinely. But i immediately get defensive and start analyzing why this friend may have said something like that, when in reality he probably didn’t even think about it at all during or after saying it.

I really want to become a better person and achieve inner peace, which is fleeting and short-lived at the moment. I plan to start meditating and practicing mindfulness, along with exercising. But I was wondering if there were any mental tricks/advice/habits that have worked for anyone who was/is struggling with something similar.

Thank you, and I hope everyone has a wonderful day (:",15Jul2020,1

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",15Jul2020,0
94,"I'm a full-tuition financial aid scholar in the most prestigious private university in my country. I come from a dirt poor family. My mother is a housewife and my father earns $5000 a year. Recently, I received an email from the scholarships office that I have multiple reports against me regarding the selling of fake IDs and fake medical certificates, as well as indirectly threatening a student. I have not done any of the aforementioned accusations. I never sold fake IDs or medical certificates. I do not recall threatening another student in any form. This has completely blindsided me. 

I'm scared because I did make a fake medical certificate two years ago when I was a freshman. I jokingly posted on my Twitter account that I was willing to make one for anyone for a small price. My Twitter account is private, and only has five trusted followers. It was a digital personal diary of some sort for me.  I am scared that someone from my circle betrayed me and reported me for it. 

I never submitted a fake medical certificate to a professor. I never sold one to a fellow student. But the fact that that Twitter post existed is enough to incriminate me. I'm in danger of losing my scholarship. It would bring me so much shame. Knowing my mother, she'd have a nervous breakdown. I'll be disowned. I would have to drop out and lose the bright future I once had. 

Worst case scenario, I lose my scholarship. My university has a ridiculously high tuition fee that working part-time wouldn't even cover half of it. I'm thinking of prostituting myself to cover the fees if I don't get expelled. My other option is committing suicide, which I am leaning to right now. At least I'd still have my dignity left if I did that. It just sucks that I have to live such a short life. /Sighs.",15Jul2020,1

96,"As a child I watched my parents divorce, both remarry then both get divorced again. It made me never want to get married and I held strong on that for 30+ years. Then I met her. The first few years were pure bliss, I bought us a house after only 9 months together. We redid that house and sold it a couple years later which allowed us to buy our dream home, which I now spend my nights redoing to sell also. Except this time it isn't to upgrade again, it's to move to a tiny soulless apartment by myself. The last couple years we have fought more and more. We got married a little over 4 years ago because she really wanted it and I wanted her to be happy. I thought what can it hurt, we already made it 6 years without barely a hiccup. So we had the fantasy wedding any woman would dream of. Then we got home from the Honeymoon and life returned back to normal for 2 weeks. I woke up and saw it, a positive pregnancy test on the bathroom counter. Something we didn't even think was possible for health reasons. I was terribly non supportive during her pregnancy and drank constantly. Despite that she remained by my side and gave birth to my beautiful child. Being older first time parents we were both scared but made it work. However the stress of being parents among other things has slowly divided us. I failed so long ago to see what I had with her and got way to comfortable. Being stuck in the house together for lock down was the final nail. Now it is ending. We are selling the house and moving to our own apartments. To say I am broken is beyond an understatement. I have suicidal thoughts constantly, if it weren't for my child I would probably have done it 100x over by now. I have no friends where I live, I have no hobbies or anything of the sort. She is my only friend, my best friend. To see her on the phone laughing and smiling while talking with her instantly found new interests while I 1,000 yard stare at the wall where our wedding photo used to hang is dehumanizing. I feel empty, scared, alone and broken. The thought of sitting in my future apartment, by myself with nothing and no one to talk to is a reality I am certain I cannot face. I am cherishing the days before she leaves and the for sale sign goes up but after that, I fear for myself. I know I am not the first to go through this and it makes me wonder how so many people do it. It is the worst pain I have ever felt. The only thing even keeping me going is the fact I have someone who depends on me to teach them and raise them and make things better when they go bad just like I wish someone could do for me right now. Instead I just cry, every day sometimes for hours. I try not to do it in front of anyone, I just sit here at my desk hoping no one walks in. There are obviously a lot more details but this is probably getting way to long. I don't even know why I am sharing it, we all have problems. So if you read this far, thank you. I hope you have a wonderful day.",15Jul2020,1
97,"My parents just dodged a major bullet.  Despite having every risk factor in the book between them, they seem to be recovering from their COVID infections.  They both spent a week in the hospital, and for a while it was indeed very scary.  But with the wonders of modern medicine and their immune systems, they managed to pull through.

I talked to my mother today and she kept talking about how blessed the family is.  She gave credit to all the people who've been praying for their recovery.  

It was a little too much for me, y'all.

How can one not know that there are a shitload of people who have died all over the world, despite their family and friends praying extra hard for them?  And there are even more people who will suffer for the rest of their lives from COVID complications who also had a team of ""prayer warriors"" working for them.  Prayer may or may not work for 99% of problems, but it doesn't seem to be doing a damn thing to stop COVID. 

I told my mother this and she conceded I was right.  I bet she thought to herself that I was yet again being an atheist hater, but I wasn't being a hater.  A hater would say something negative to a religious-soaked opinion just because they thought it was stupid or silly.  I spoke up because I thought my mother was being very tone-deaf and insensitive.   I just wanted her to slow her fucking roll and be cognizant that saying you are ""blessed and highly favored"" is bragging.  It's not something a person with a humble spirit would say. My mother personally knows people who were just as prayed up as she is but they succumbed to COVID.  How does she think their loves ones feel, hearing her bragging about how blessed she is?

COVID don't care how religious you are.  The good are getting taken out just as much as the bad are.  So if you get sick and survive, just say you're lucky.  There's nothing blasphemous in telling people you lucked out.  Maybe God did spare you, but you don't have tell people that.",15Jul2020,3

Now I turned 21, and I did a full 180, Im way more social (when I can), open to a lot of things, I basically been growing up this last two years more than ever, keep going through things that hit me hard and depress me, but I always take something from it, and I can turn it into a positive, most of the time is learning about me, and what I like and I don't like.

Still figuring things out of me, is actually pretty cool and confusing, learning to not get attached quickly (hard thing to do when I feel lonely) through this lasts dates Ive had.

The last one hit me hard, she was perfect, still trying to comprehend the reason why she couldn't go on, but I gotta speak to her, want to give her some space, I think we were going to fast.

107,"TL;DR My elementary school was abusive toward the student body and actively tried to dumb everyone down. Independence and creative thoughts were discouraged, students were physically abused on a daily basis. Around the same time I had a ton of home life stuff going on. Topics of suicide, depression, and sexual abuse. No details on the sexual assault. 

This is my rant in order of things that happened to me/things I witnessed while there. The school has since closed but I know those teachers are still around. This is the early 2000’s. Story rant 

Among the things that happened, kids were dragged down the halls by their arms, I  the librarian grab my wrists and hit them against the table a few times because she was frustrated with kindergarten me not knowing the “proper” way to type,

When I was in Kindergarten, I loved to read. And so when I was taught, I learned quickly. It was something I excelled in and while wandering the library, I found the Animorphs series. I also found that weird Magic Attic Book Club series thing. Whatever it was, I was immersed. I could understand what was being said and I must’ve been standing there awhile. The next thing I knew, the book was taken from me by the librarian. She grabbed my arm and took me back to the “box books” (Dr. Seuss etc.) and told me I had to read those. 

Now being a kindergarten girl who was raised by her grandparents to find things that interested me, I looked through them all and found every single title mind numbingly boring. When I found myself back in the fifth grade section, the librarian grabbed me again, tossed me in a chair, and put that Green Eggs and Ham book in front of me. Said I had to read that, take a Star test on it, and then I had to go to the next box. 

To this day I absolutely despise Dr. Seuss. 

First grade I was sitting in class and the teacher was talking about how to spell cat or something. It was boring and some movement caught my eye. It was spring and there was a robin outside the window. I hadn’t seen one yet that year and so I found it neat to watch. I already knew what the teacher was explaining so w/e, right? No, I was yelled at to pay attention. Which, fair enough. I listened, but my eyes wandered back to the bird and how pretty it was. When I glanced back up my teacher was standing in front of my desk like a giant angry blob and grabbed my upper arm. She yanked me out of my seat and dragged me to the hallway. I saw her glance to make sure my peers were watching when she tossed me against the wall and got into my face. “Do you want to go to the office?” 

I shook my head. 

“You wanna go to the office?” 

I shook my head again. 

So she dragged me to the office. This teacher did it often to students. She must’ve been angry when I didn’t cry because she tightened her grip and twisted my arm a few times to get a reaction. When I got there, the lady in the office glared at me and I was thrown into a chair. I then was sent home for looking at a bird. 

And that was the beginning of the worst years of my life. After that day, my classmates started to bully me. It was just little things at first and so I remained oblivious until third grade. Around that time I realized that my parents were never coming back for me. My teacher had a special vendetta against me too. I’d turn in assignments and she’d throw them away, then hand me a new sheet and yell at me for not doing it. She made me take every book we had in the class home with me in my backpack. My locker and desk were literally spilling over with assignments I had to do. I was rejected as an idiot by my classmates, told I wasn’t good enough to play their games, and if I wasn’t the punchline in a joke, they didn’t pay attention to me. So I stopped coming to school and I don’t even know how I passed that year. 

Fourth grade was a blessing and a curse. My dad died in March and the teacher was extremely anti bullying. She listened to everyone and my school life wasn’t that bad. It was pretty good all things considering. We moved to a house that came with ten acres. Only downside was my grandma letting her son and his boys come in. I was physically, sexually, and emotionally assaulted by the oldest boy. Whenever I went outside, he’d frame me for something. And so I stayed inside my room and I became massively obese. I only left to go to school, eat, and to use the bathroom. Same year was my grandpa starting his decline with dementia. I was diagnosed then with chronic depression. 

Fifth grade was downhill. My grandpa got worse. He was still hanging in there, but my grandma was tense and had an affair. Then would commonly ask me what I thought of the affair. My cousin still lived on our property and the abuse continued. Me gaining weight made me the bullied kid in class too. It felt like I was struggling to do basic tasks. I just couldn’t handle it all at once. In an attempt to remedy this, my teacher got the *brilliant* idea to assign my classmates as my “babysitters”. which basically was to stand over me and watch me fill out sheet after sheet of class work. When I tried to tell her I was being bullied, she said she’d “look out for it”. When I tried to go to the lady in the office, she glared at me and told me (I directly quote), “It’s not my problem, go away.” I tried to tell my grandma what was happening but I was waved off and nothing ever happened. My grandpa was too far gone to really do anything. And then the principal himself called me into his office and told me that if I didn’t get my grades up, “I’ll take you away from your friends and your family and you’ll never see them ever again.” 

After my first dog died, I couldn’t do it anymore. I tried to kill myself repeatedly after that. I’d stand in the kitchen at 12-3 am with a knife to my throat, crying and begging for it to move. I begged for it to make everything stop. To make me feel okay again. But it never did. 

I failed fifth grade that year. The next class I was put in was much better. They didn’t bully me, but the damage was done and emotionally I was dead. A few screaming kids got dragged down the hall by the first grade teacher but it was all w/e by then. It was normal. 

Sixth grade went by uneventfully. The teachers sucked. The band teacher refused to let me switch from flute to percussion(I had terrible asthma, eventually convinced her by leaving the class and coming back.) everything was fine until my grandpa died. He was everything to me. He was what kept my little world spinning. A week later my dachshund passed away, followed by an entire litter of kittens. 

Grandpa died May 16th. And when school started and I was in seventh grade, my grandma met a new man and picked me up one day. I didn’t have a chance to say goodbye to anyone, put my stuff away, grab my things, or even return my books. She picked me up, gave me a bag, and everything that I didn’t put into that bag was later stolen/sold off by family “friends”. 

Middle school was terrible. High school was mostly terrible. The school success worker got me charged with truancy for missing four days over the school limit. I was on probation for year, manipulated the judge to the best of my abilities, and got off scot free with nobody checking up on me ever again. 

I graduated high school a year early and got a presidential award. I’m 20 now, and I’m still depressed. But realizing that I wasn’t alone in the world helped me exponentially. I made a ton of amazing friends, I’m the leader of a D2 clan, and I’m taking care of my grandma. It still hurts, but I’m mostly able to move on now. I have no contact with my family, disowned my emotionally abusive mother, and I’m working on myself a little bit everyday. I’m broken, but I’m going to be okay. 

I just really needed to get it out there.",15Jul2020,1
108,"Happy hump day! We're in the middle of the week, and we're also in the middle of the month! July is Parks and Recreation Month, so our BPH blog theme is getting men to safely go out to the park for the benefit of their enlarged prostate health. 

BPH is the medical term for prostate enlargement (it stands for benign prostatic hyperplasia). As men get older, their prostate gland grows larger in size. Due to a man's anatomy, the growth of the prostate gland can interfere with urinary health as it pushes against the bladder and squeezes the urethra, making it more narrow. This could translate into frequent urination but with a slow urinary steam! These symptoms are uncomfortable, embarrassing and frustrating for some men.  

Practicing social distancing, wearing a face covering and practicing proper hygiene (such as not touching your face after touching surfaces and washing your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds) can be your key to taking a walk in the park. Walking, jogging and swimming have been cited as good physical activities for older men to partake in (when practiced safely) to help maintain weight, reduce stress, and reduce the risk of excess weight gain, a risk factor for aggravating BPH.   
The greenery is also relaxing for the mind, as men who have BPH may sometimes experience frustration and depression due to struggling with the symptoms. A comprehensive wellness approach is commonly used for men with mild BPH before considering medication and surgery. Other forms of wellness may include traditional Chinese medicine ingredients like astragalus for an immunity boost or the consumption of soy in the diet so that men can consume protein with less fat contents. Some men may also try supplements. If you are looking for a supplement that has been clinically tested for its efficacy in supporting men with BPH, read the clinical trials study on UMOOZE.  
This Parks and Recreation Month, we want more support in men’s health and wellness, especially when it comes to BPH!",15Jul2020,3

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it. 

I drank a lot of water yesterday and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal? I’m down to 11.2 now  and my face looks wayyyy larger than ever at all I was thinner when I was last that weight :/",15Jul2020,1

122,"I got through my first year of college as a psych major but never really felt any real passion for what I was doing. At least I don’t remember feeling passionate or anything similar. In March I moved in with my long distance boyfriend bc dorms shut down and I didn’t want to go back home. It’s been great living with him and we’re really happy together, but I feel like I’m going to disappoint him by not having any clue what I’m doing with my life. Basically I made the decision to transfer to a really good school just a few minutes away from his apartment (we plan on staying in the city for a while + he’s finishing his degree at another nearby university). I was fairly certain I wasn’t going to be accepted, but I ended up getting in. I feel like shit about this. My boyfriend says he’s supportive about what I choose to do with my life and he’s very patient with me since I am a few years younger than him. Even then, I feel like if I don’t go through with this decision then I’ve had him help me all for nothing and there will be tension there. I feel bad for wasting his time like that. And it’s not just my boyfriend who I fear disappointing, but my mother and older sister too. My mom is constantly telling me to do what makes me happy, but at the same time says I need to finish school. My sister just became a doctor and is now working at a top hospital. She’s also pushing for me to finish school. I don’t think school is for me. I keep going back and forth on this and I just feel so confused. Before I made the decision to transfer I was thinking about jumping into a job and taking a break from school. My boyfriend was very supportive of me potentially getting a job I was interested in, but pressure from my mom and sister to first finish school swayed me more so. The thing is, I don’t think I care for the social sciences, definitely not enough to be studying anything specifically related to psychology for the next 3 years + grad school. I think about this every day and it’s weighing on me. My transfer counselor emailed me a week ago for fall registration and I haven’t written back. I haven’t even done a single thing I need to regarding financial aid like submitting FAFSA and the CSS profile. All I did was pay their $200 enrollment deposit.

2. **Culture**. I acknowledge that every culture casts its own shadow; nothing human is perfect. But the culture I belong is rooted in the systemic oppression of others-- an oppression that continues to this day. At Thanksgiving I'm reminded of the cruelty towards Indians, at Christmas I'm faced with the imposition of religion; I'm connected to landmarks of white but racist homesteaders; my career (paralegal working in cases relating to the Civil Rights Act of 1964), my apartment (low-income unit in previously segregated Black neighborhood)-- all are owing to the wake of this system oppression.
3. **Shame**. I understand some people will especially cringe at this point, but I cannot avoid it. I am an incredibly sympathetic individual, steeped in my feelings for others. If I see a homeless non-white person, my heart aches for them and I want to apologize on behalf of white people for the injustices they have surely suffered. If I hear of a non-white single parent, I am brought to tears at the humiliation I have from other white people I know of who will rejoice at the misfortunes of that parent.
4. **Features**. I have a full, red beard with bright, blonde hair, in addition to pale skin and blue-gray eyes. I find every race attractive and I have happily dated men from a diverse range of racial backgrounds, such as Black, Hispanic, Asian, and white men. But for myself, I have always desperately desired to look different than I do... thick, straight, black hair; beautiful, chocolate-colored skin; deep, brown eyes, etc. I look at the mirror and I see a familiar face that can be overwhelmingly spotted in every crowd here: white. I'm not special, unique, or remarkable. Just your average Joe of the Pacific Northwest.
5. **Community/Belonging**. This is the most lengthy reason so I have saved it for last. I have never felt a sense of belonging to being white, my ancestry, the culture, my community. None of it. By contrast, I have known quite a few Hispanic friends who felt similarly about themselves in this regard, but even they took comfort in watching soccer with their family or eating their abuela's tamales-- sometimes, they even felt pride from their associations with these comforts. I am sure what I am about to say will come with countless personal exceptions, but I have observed that non-white communities have a greater connection. They have more siblings, nieces, and nephews; they are closer to cousins, uncles, aunts, and the friends who are also within those non-white communities; they have family birthdays, family-owned businesses, and family events. That isn't to say white people don't have these same things, but in my shallow experience, they are far less significant and frequent than in non-white communities. Moreover, that also isn't to say that having these things is a key to happiness. I've heard of many a miserable non-white family. But these things are important, at least to me. And for me, I have been hopelessly and helplessly without a community or sense of belonging. (For further context, I don't speak to any of my family due to a long train of abuse and neglect.) And in some hypothetical scenario, even if I were to finally begin to find a community and sense of belonging in, say, Kenya, I would still always remain an outsider because I am white.",15Jul2020,1
127,"For the past 4 months I’ve been in quarantine, I finished school in March so I’ve had no school work to do and I’ve literally just sat on my phone and watched Netflix and YouTube FOR 4 MONTHS. I feel like I missed the part of growing up where I learned to entertain myself and it’s got to the point where the only thing I want to do is use technology and scroll mindlessly. I cannot push myself to do anything whatsoever. I’m not depressed, I just have such a short attention span and also absolutely no desire to do anything at all. This is so dumb but can someone please explain to me how to exist and entertain myself on a daily basis instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media.",15Jul2020,1
128,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it. 

I drank a lot of water yesterday and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal?

132,"Lots of therapies led up to it.

Two weeks after that, the person I was seeing cheated on me. 

Two weeks after that happened my mom died unexpectedly. This is obviously the biggest thing on the list.

Two weeks after that I accidentally fell into a relationship with someone with borderline personality disorder (If I'd understood polyamory was about feelings I wouldn't have let her seduce me). This lasted about five months and really fucked me up.

About a month after that started I was hit by a car while riding a Bird scooter. Multiple sprained limbs and some new facial scars.

I contracted Covid-19 in mid March. I don't recommend it. It's been a fucking roller coaster since then and I'm still too fatigued to do much of anything other than (barely) work from home.

I'm a huge extrovert who needs physical affection to function. I haven't visited with anyone or been touched in any meaningful way by another human in about four months.

133,"I had met the best group of people on dead by daylight about a year ago. Well we all bonded pretty well cause we had family issues. I really bonded with this girl (let's call her J) we talked slot about our days and our problems. She felt like a little sister to me, gave me something to live for (I was heavily contemplating suicide before I joined the group). Well a few days ago I got arrested for battery. So I basically spilled my guts out to J. I was scared about my future worried that I'll never make it in the military. Last night we fell asleep talking and today she completely ignored all my messages. So I went around the group asking around to see if she's okay and one of the guys (C) pretty much told me I need to stop crying to her and be an adult and get help. They helped so much by just listening to me.I got mad and blocked him. Then said goodbye to J and blocked her. I messaged her a few minutes later begging her to not be upset with me. Im honestly seriously contemplating suicide and I've been crying nonstop. I don't know what to do. I'm alone again.

He constantly forces my sister and me to do arbitrary shit and has fits if we don’t do them. idk where to go.

136,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",15Jul2020,1
137,"Im sorry but I need to just vent😪

The past few months have been very unorganized for myself. Being careful with Covid-19, finding work, and just taking care of my future. I do not want to live with my family anymore as I am basically done with them and they have done a horrible job raising me and holding me back. I need to leave New York but I need to get my money right. I did get a job at AppleBees. I gave it a chance but I didn’t really feel myself there and didn’t really click with anyone there. I wasn’t going to force myself because it would have made my mindset and health worse. Believe me, I can handle hard work I’ve done it before. 

But My gut told me I couldn’t be here and made my choice. However, at the time my best friend was hired there too and was excited we were going to work together but I had told her beforehand she had got hired I wasn’t going to stay long and I was thinking of leaving. I left, and she was disappointed with my decision and told me they were all good and stuff. It disappoints me to but it was my decision and choice. Besides, I am currently a Foreign Exchange trader and I wanted to work on that for a bit. I felt she was mad at me and I didn’t contact her for a couple of days.

I told her I needed time away because I felt she was mad at me. She tells me she wasn’t but it’s whatever and says it was childish because I kept posting on Instagram during my time away. Mind you, as a Forex trader apart of an investment group, it’s my job to bring in more people and launch on social media so we can all profit. 

Now i feel it thin between us now. I don’t know if we are still friends at this point, she’s like my other sister. Now it’s messed up. I’m saving up the best I can to leave this stupid place. I barely get any good sleep because I sleep in the living room rather than my own room because of my idiotic lazy fat biological brother plays his stupid games. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone else and at this point I have no one. Life is sort of a mess at this point for me😞",15Jul2020,1

139,"I've suffered from depression for over 10 years, I've had better moments and worse moments. Tried different medications. I've been in therapy for two years now and it has helped a little bit but not significantly. 

I think my family doesn't think of me as a family member. I don't think my parents care. I don't feel like my friends consider me an actual friend. I hate my body, I hate how sick I am. I've suffered through cancer and it brought several different physical issues with it, I feel like my body wants me to die.

Lot of things have happened in the past few years, including a death of someone very important to me last year, I thought I handled it fine but I think in reality I just worked so much at my job and volunteer work that I had no time to think. Covid definitely made things worse because I lost my job and all the volunteer work I participated in has stopped for now, so it's mostly me and my thoughts. Which, I'm trying to think in some kind of a positive light. I don't have a chance to escape myself so maybe I'll be forced to work on myself. With the death of my friend and my physical health and bad relationship with my family, childhood traumas etc.

But every day for a while now has felt like a torture, everything sort of feels like I'm in a dark pit and I can't see anything and it's so cold.

I'm 25 years old and I think I amount to nothing. I'm nothing, I don't know why everything feels so bad. Medication doesn't help, therapy doesn't help, I don't know are things gonna get better. I'm trying to hold onto hope so bad but right now it keeps slipping away.",15Jul2020,1

Now, I have a system to deal with this. I know push most men away, in some sort of self-defense, and it has worked excellent. No more trauma. Just the usual stares from cars and so on.

But I started to make friends with this guys, who I've only met one time. And while we were talking, he was suggesting that I should masturbate on my restdays (from training), from out of nowhere. I have absolutely no idea of what hos intentions were, but now all the trauma from the past is just rushing over me. And I feel so ashamed. Why is it always the victims that carry the shame? Even defend our abusers. ""I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt me"", ""He probably thought I wanted it"".

Sorry if this is all a little bit sloppy, this just happened and I sincerely don’t know how to feel or what just happened.

I had a shouting match discussion with my mom because for the last few weeks I’ve felt that my sister (18F) has been consistently treating me poorly and not respecting me, and while I tried to play it off, today was my breaking point and when she said something I responded and my mom heard I did and the discussion insued.

And look, I am not here to discuss who was right, we both said mean things and that’s not the point. The problem started after the discussion I went in my room started venting to my best friend, and while I was doong that I started feeling really bad about myself, about how I am a failure and how I don’t really deserve the respect because compared to my sister I do absolutely nothing, then I got scared of oversharing with my friend and told her I needed to be by myself, and I started to feel lightheaded and wanted to die, and I pushed my head in the pillow as to not breathe (which I know is pointless because one can’t kill themselves like that as far as I know) then I felt really frustrated and started punching myself in the head and then I felt worse because I felt like I was faking all of that to get attention, and I just wanted to rip my face real bad, and It was the absolute worst.

I don’t know what happened, I don’t want to call it a panic attack because I still feel like it wasn’t real or like if I was faking it for attention (but also I didn’t want anyone to see me like that) and I just needed to hit myself, I couldn’t control it.

I don’t know if this is the right subreddit for this, but I don’t feel comfortable talking about this with anyone I know as I don’t want to worry them, so if any of you got any advice or know what I felt I’d be really grateful, and if you can’t help me then it’s okay, i feel this post is really dumb, sorry.
