Threaten me. Throw a temper tantrum, try to dox me. If any of you actually could, y’all would have done so years ago.

Stalk my account, hire people to investigate and downvote me. When this account gets too dramatic?

I’ll eventually delete it and make a new one like I’ve done for the last 10 years. 

Why do you care? I’m a grandmother am I really that much of a threat to y’all?! What you can’t take a little advice or encouragement? Don’t like when I talk to confused little girls and tell them they don’t have to comply and if they need help to seek me out?

Sorry bout your bad luck son. Next time don’t be rapey or a creeper. It’s not rocket science and women are not commodities. No matter how awesome you think you are. No matter what pill you think you swallowed. 

But keep hating. 

Because clearly it’s working for y’all right? You’ve got a girlfriend that wants to gift you this year right? Your family suddenly decided they were no longer scared of you right? Everything is Golden right?

Or are you just bitter because you turned out to be a psycho and no one wants anything to do with you?

You should know that’s how I’m spending my holiday. 

Alone. Marked as a psychopath. But please. Keep antagonizing me. 

I’m sure you’ll be fine.",24Dec2020,1
1,"The way Keanu Reeves's character plays a ghost living in your head makes me think it's a very plausible afterlife.  I'd believe that if a ghost could come back to the material world, they'd need to find some sort of brain to host them in.  It's maybe unfortunate current ghosts don't have the ability to impose their image an as augmented reality you can see; they'd certainly get a lot more attention that way",24Dec2020,1

5,"When we compare the present life of man on Earth with that time of which we have no knowledge, it seems to me like a swift flight of a single sparrow through a banquet hall on a winter's day. After a few moments of comfort, he vanishes from sight into the wintry world from which he came. Even so, man appears on Earth for a little while, but of what went before this life or what will follow, we know nothing.

—a beautiful parable about life I think about often and wanted to share.
Here is a bit more information about its origin if you are curious. It was first spoken to an ancient king over 1400 years ago and still speaks volumes to this day.

6,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

One instance she said she booked me in for a practice interview and I just looked down and nodded and she said annoyed ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ when I didn’t mean it like that 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

💡She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


◾️I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence. And she seemed very moody about it at the time tbh",24Dec2020,1
7,"It’s a devastating realization but it’s true. No one cares about the problems or feelings of others. I feel like crying, screaming, punching a wall or all of the above at the same time. In the end it doesn’t matter though. It will change nothing and no one will bat an eye.    
    
I got in the habit of venting here on Reddit or on discord or something but what does it do? I am wasting other people's time and my own as well. If they are nice they will tell me nice words but those words don’t make me feel better. It doesn’t matter.    
    
The People trying to help me will forget about me. They will go back to their loved ones and live their life. One person they don’t even know being miserable doesn’t matter.    
    
I don’t want to sound ungrateful or anything I appreciated those people trying to help me or give me advice but I just had this sad realization that in the end people only really care about some very close loved ones (if at all). If you are not in that circle then you are alone. I feel alone but why should anyone care? There is no reason. You shouldn’t. You shouldn’t even have read this post and if you did then I am sorry for wasting your time.",24Dec2020,1
8,"It’s a strange but good feeling knowing this is my last evening in my 30’s.  I know 40 is meant to be over the hill, or a full fledged adult, but to be honest I still feel like a 20 year old, despite the fact that I’ve now reached that milestone twice over.  Hell, one of my earliest memories is my mom’s over the hill party, and now here I am reaching the same milestone.  I, who still relates to the characters in the American Pie movies, and see them as recent... yet I also just watched a high school virtual production of one of my friends kids- who I held when she was 8 hours old.  It’s very surreal.

Part of the deal with being born on Christmas Eve is that you share your birthday with everyone else’s Christmas celebrations, so your day is never fully about you, it’s about spending it with loved ones, while everyone is at their happiest.  And the gifts, they are flaying in every direction, with everyone being told how much they mean to everyone.  People ask if I ever feel cheated out of a birthday, but I don’t see it that way.  I get everyone at their best.

Thanks to COVID, most of the day will be a LOT more low key this year, spending time with my children, capped with the usual reading of The Night Before Christmas. To be honest, I am really excited for tomorrow.  Because it will be even more focused on them than usual.  On top of that, this is very likely the last year they both believe in Santa, which makes it that much more special.

Anyway, like many of us, this milestone that I always knew was coming is finally here, and thanks to COVID, it’s not what I was expecting... just a reminder that just because things don’t go the way you planned, it’s not a bad thing.

Anyway, I just wanted to put my thoughts down.  Thanks for reading the incoherent ramblings of this immature old timer.  I hope you’re doing well.  Have a great *insert your holiday here*",24Dec2020,1
9,"I know how important this runoff is, but I had been putting it off because I was busy. A nice young woman came to my door and asked if I had a plan to vote. I lied and said yes to get her to go away. 

Later, I was thinking about how I had lied and decided to go get it over with. The process took ten minutes at the county library and then I was out with an “I voted” sticker.

If you’re going door to door in Georgia telling people to vote, first of all I applaud your bravery. Secondly, keep doing it because it is working!",24Dec2020,1
11,"TL;DR: Meet yourself where you’re at, start small and build, and mistakes are part of the process - learn from them, adapt, and strive to do do better next time 

At the beginning of the year, I set out to find, challenge, and grow myself. That, as I’m sure many can relate, didn’t happen in any of the ways I expected. 

But one thing that did happen and that I *did* do was reprioritize my health and well-being - something that I’ve neglected for the bulk of the last 6 years or so. Strava, an exercise tracking app with social media elements built in, released a personalized year in review of the activities and exercise metrics for its members. And I’ve gleaned 3 insights from my data:

1. It doesn’t matter that my stats aren’t as impressive as many of the more advanced and pro athletes out there. Going from completely sedentary to running multiple 5Ks and 10Ks within a year is something to be proud of. 

2. Cliche though this may be, it’s important to start small and build. At the beginning, my main commitment to myself was to wake up, lace up my shoes, and make it outside. That’s all. Things naturally progressed from there when longer walks turned into short runs, which turned into more frequent runs, which turned into an automatic weekly routine of running between 10-15 miles a week. 

3. It’s okay to mess up and miss a few days, weeks, or longer. In August and September, my progress began to diminish as I fell into a slump and let myself make excuses until I stopped running and working out altogether. 

Today when I anxiously opened Strava and reviewed these stats, I remembered my commitment to myself at the beginning of the year and recognized the insights I just listed above. 

And then I went for a (short) run, because it’s never too late to start from the ground up, start again small and rebuild, messing up is okay - so long as you learn, adapt, and strive to do better next time 😊",24Dec2020,1
12,"I guess I want to know if anyone else feels like me?


My boyfriend has had a bad habit of being dishonest about his exes and past flings, tbf we met each other when we were 20 so he was quite immature. I haven’t lied about a single thing and quite frankly I think I hate liars but he had a bad habit of telling white lies. The only good thing is that he confessed them. For the first two years he only confessed because he got caught but for the last year now he has come to me by himself to admit lies he has told. Now these are not big lies but small stuff like, “I actually hooked up with this person that I said was only a friend” or  that he got a lap dance at a strip club in college everything he has lied about has been stuff from his past so that’s good at least Idc because it’s small things but it’s really annoying to be lied to. And I know this could potentially mean that he could lie in the future but I just don’t care.

Idk if I’ve gotten used to being lied to but I’ve just always known I was going to marry rich and have a better life. I think I’m okay being lied to as long as I get a better life. I get treated better when I’m with him (I live in a hugely racist and classist country) and his status / whiteness makes my life a bit easier and I don’t want to start over. I also have grown to love him a lot I think he is the love of my life but sometiems
I don’t respect him because he has lied about unnecessary stuff but we are still young and I think I can grow to respect him as we get older. 

For some reason I don’t think he would cheat but if he did I would just be mad which is an emotion I’m okay living with since I’m pretty comfortable with being mad . (My parents are abusive so I’ve been angry my whole life ) but I am also convinced that I love him. But reading everything it would seem like I don’t care or live him enough to care but I do care I just also believe that life just isn’t fair to me and I’m okay if he did those things to me in the future.",24Dec2020,1
13,"My best friend of 10 years has ghosted me. About a year ago, right as she got out of an abusive relationship, she moved in with my boyfriend and I. We asked for no rent, and let her use our cars whenever she needed, we only asked that she find a job and save money to get herself a car and to save to get her own place. Well, she did get two jobs and was busting her ass working and saving money. But during this summer she met a guy at one of her jobs and completely fell for him. I was really happy for her, although a bit nervous because I knew nothing about him and because of her history with abusive men, but from the few times I met him he seemed nice. After she met him she started skipping work to spend time with him. Sometimes it was just a shift, sometimes it was a whole week where she would just give away shifts/call off work to be with him. Eventually in the beginning of November she totally disappeared for two weeks, wasn’t home and wasn’t working, and never replied to any of my messages. I knew she was with this guy, but to not respond to a worried friend and to miss that much work??? I was really concerned..eventually she came home while I was at work one day, and my boyfriend texts me saying she’s at our apartment packing all her stuff. He asked her where she plans on going, and she said to her moms. Well I asked her mom if that was true and of course it wasn’t! She ended up going wherever the hell that guy lives. And since then, she hasn’t responded to me, and completely blocked me on everything. I’m really hurt and sad and lonely. She was my best friend and I thought I was helping her get past a bad relationship and helping her start on a better path towards a better life. Now it’s been a month and a half since I’ve talked to her and I have no idea where she’s at, and neither does her family. I know she’s a grown ass adult and her decisions are hers alone..but I’m still worried. And I’m fucking hurt. Like how could she just ghost me like that after everything I’ve done to help her? I don’t know what to do. Everyday I hope she messages or calls me but it never happens and it feels kind of heartbreaking honestly. Like what could have caused this? I feel like I need closure. I have NO idea what could make her disappear like this &amp; just ignore me like this. The only reason I know she’s alive and okay is because I use my boyfriends Twitter account to see if she tweets, since she’s blocked me on there. It just sucks. I really miss her.",24Dec2020,1

17,"And some Christmas cookies. I work at a country club and I just thought about how much food we’re gonna toss come end of the year since we’re closed for the first two weeks. Had a prime rib special tonight. Leftovers just get turned into French dip meat, and we have too much of that for how slow we were. 

Marcos brought Christmas cookies his wife made, they slapped but we were too busy for anyone to enjoy. Take home as well. 

Since I’m off tomorrow and Christmas I told chef that I wanted to bring home some leftover prime if there was some. For my roommate and I. Flat lie, I don’t know the last few days I’ve been thinking of this “council of vagrants” that hangs out around the local art studio adjacent to my apartment. Good bunch, always say hello as I pass to my car, they don’t ask for anything. 

Anyway I decide to bring home about 50oz of prime rib, a good ass amount of veg succotash, and some mashed potatoes for those boys.($36.99USD for 10oz of prime and a portion of each)I snuck hella plastic silverware in the bag so my coworkers didn’t suspect. Got the cookies. Those boys deserved it more then those rich dicks. 

I didn’t just give them the food, I hung out for about 3 minutes in the 30f air. I made great conversation with those boys. I told them maybe a little much, that I ODed on fent, and kinda spiraled this last year. On top of my credit and medical debt my hours are slashed (thank Christ I’m employed in this field) with the pandemic. But ever since this overdose and this subsequent motorcycle accident I was first on scene on I’ve wanted to be a better man. 

I’ve looked into volunteering, started reading again, and journaling. Shit I’m only 21 in four days, the world is still mine and I wanna make good in it. 

Sorry to ramble, I’ve just thought about how shit of a year I’ve had with moving to a new state, love and loss, addiction and overdose, then making anew(not fully sober yet). I saw a bit of my dad and my older self in that group of men, I wanted to let them know I notice them. I care about them. They aren’t fucking strangers to me. 

Although with my past actions and the way I still currently live I may not be a net good on society I know I’m not a net negative. And that’s what matters.

I know that when I go to my car for the next few weeks I’ll be greeted by a bunch of fine ass genuine gentlemen and I’ll be able to make good conversation with them.",24Dec2020,1

22,"I met this guy and I thought he liked me, I knew he was a fuckboy, I tried not to catch feelings because I knew I shouldn't, when I did i tried to deny it to myself and others, and then when someone else came he started ignoring me and went for her, I tried to brush it off and pretend I didn't cared as I saw him do and say the same things he did with me. 

Then suddenly this week he dropped the other girl and started acting with me like he used to, he started using the cute nickname he used to, took pictures of me, then his friend (who's also my friend) told me that he said that he wanted something serious and wanted to stop playing around, I acted like I didn't cared.

Today he kept acting like he liked me all morning, then as the day went on he started to come back to the other girl until I was completely ignored once again, then suddenly I realized that he gave me a little hope and then ripped it off from me all over again. 

Then I stopped pretending, I'm not okay, I do care, I did caught feelings for him and I feel so stupid that I let this happen to me when I knew from the start, but I couldn't help me, somehow he caught me and I couldn't stop myself. 

The worst part of this is that he doesn't even care, he never did, I knew this since the beginning, people warned me but I went in anyway. When he's near I feel all my senses getting numb, I hate it and I try to fight it but I can't think straight.

I know this is mostly my fault, but I'm just so hurt right now.

24,"This one is more targeted toward fitness (also posted on there). I'm 28, male, 5'8"" and 150lb. I was moderately active before this, going to the gym 3-5x a week where I did push/pull/legs, typically one or two compound movements followed by accessory lifts where I lifted between 10-20 reps for 3-4 sets. Diet was/is relatively clean, as I mostly eat ground chicken, brown rice, peanut butter, eggs, 2% milk, wheat bread, and shredded cheese. I'm on anticonvulsants to control seizures.

But now I'm worried that I am not going to be the same ever again. Earlier this month I lost consciousness on the interstate. I went off the side of the road, down a hill, and into a tree at 60mph. I was in the hospital for 8 days.

The seatbelt saved my life, but it also tore my abdominal muscle on the left side. Like ripped apart. It had to be surgically pieced back together. Also had to get 6 inches of my colon removed. Incision was made in the middle of my stomach - scar goes from about an inch above my bellybutton to an inch below it. I'm also in a leg brace because of a hairline fracture in my right kneecap, but that is minor and will heal up soon.

Now, I won't be able to go to the gym for at least three months, but I'm worried sick. The doctor said I'll lose about 30-40% of my abdominal strength on my left side, and that it's always going to be weaker. Also, I'm way more prone to hernias now. There will also be lots of scar tissue, too.

My main goals are to look good to the point that people notice I'm fit, and to be able to perform in bed with my GF like I did before the accident. I want to be in good cardio shape, but also have good muscle mass and definition.

Questions:

What routine or training style should I adopt since I'm at risk for hernias now?

How worried should I be?

Has anyone else had experience with working out after surgery on completely torn abdominal muscle tissue?",24Dec2020,1

Why do we hope? If a pattern glistens before me so bright and so often, am I a fool to believe next time would be different? Or is it its light that blinds me to reality? 

I ramble, I rant...blue, so fucking blue. Again I thought there might be a “you”, and it’s come to light it isn’t true. No. I envy even the grass where you stood, though beneath you it laid, at last the veil frayed and so it is, I am no good. 

And yet again has come the time, the time to celebrate, and so blue we wonder what is our fate. 

All the joy we wish to truly feel and share...but with cold breezes and a sudden scare...comes the call of the void. Shall we allow it to guide us to the sweet liberation it sings...or is there a veil that, too, hides what it brings?

I told him I’d get to work when my mother was asleep (she was making noise and I didn’t want any of it in the video). Normally I wouldn’t do something like that. I’m not too happy on the way that I look and I hate any sort of picture of video of myself, but I love my friend and I thought I’d help him out. I spent about an hour filming myself reading the whole story and another hour sending it to him. At this point it was about 1 am and I had to get up early for my dentist appointment, but I didn’t care because I was happy for helping a friend out. 

In a group chat containing him and myself, he sends the video. I was really excited to watch and I was waiting for myself to appear, but I don’t. Many teachers, students, and even people who hadn’t even gone to the school were included. People appeared in the video more than once (including himself 3 times!) I don’t know why I wasn’t included. I don’t know what I did wrong.

I think it’s a silly thing to get upset over, but I can’t help it. Just makes me think about why he didn’t use it. Maybe because I looked terrible. Maybe because my voice sounds weird. Maybe because he doesn’t like me enough to add me. It just hurts a lot to work on something for a friend that’s no use.",24Dec2020,1

I decided to go on a 6 day camping adventure to a nearby mountain pass. But when I came back, I was really constipated. The lower amount of water i had been having everyday must have been the cause.

The nearby pharmacy isn't stocked with laxatives so I just drank as much warm milk as I could and waited a few hours before attempting to clean out my system. I decided to just go for it; force it out no matter the pain of which there was a lot. 

A big lump began to come out and it felt real spikey but I pushed on. 2 minutes of that and I felt like I was losing consciousness and darkness surrounding my vision until finally the big dry lump left my body.

A wave of relief rushed all over me and I expected the darkness in my vision to go but it just kept getting bigger and I could no longer see. It was pitch blackness. I touched my eyes to make sure they were open and they were. I just couldn't see anything!

I cleaned up and tried to look for my phone but couldn't find it. It was the scariest 10 minutes of my life. Then my vision started to come back. I could see faint red light, then red and  orange, then other colors and shapes in my living room. Then finally everything. My vision was back and completely normal.

Im 21 year old and from iran.

I dont have any friends and im full of word's. I just wanted to empty myself
First of all, im a waste of energy. Ok im going from the beggening. I was 10 years old. I was having so much good grades. Untill i got to 15 years old and went to high school. See there in iran you go 4 years in ""dabestan دبستان"" and then 3 years to ""rahnamaii راهنمایی"" and then "" dabirestan دبیرستان"" so i clears that, i was a good boy in dabestan the i got to rahnamaii and my father got cancer. I was so depressed. I was 14 years old that i got into ciggarets. I had so many friends there. The main problem was im sooo sooo white. In iran everyone looks at you like if youre gay if youre whiter than a white wall. So i was getting harrased by my friends. And i break up with them. I turned to teryiak idk what you call it in the english i think you tell it black tar. (man idk how to explain myself im fucking this up) so i used black tar for 3 years. And i was 17 years old now. With just 1 bad friend and bad body i was like a stick ( 170cm and 45kg) (oh i didnt tell you that my father took medicine and cured hes cancer after 6 years) so anyways then one night i was going home then 2 men jumped on me one of them was my friend ( i was with him for 4 years we were best friends idk what happend) he was the only one who i trusted, so they jumped on me and take me somewhere and raped me. Then from there my life broked. I had so much anxiety and stress and so many more things. I just locked my self in home and never got to school anymore. I was at the end of rahnamaii. Idk if im telling the times correctly. I locked myself in home for about 2 weeks after that happend and i needed black tar. I couldent go outside i was so scared.

I don't think anything would say as much as me saying that I haven't even been able to make a friend since I was 9. Lost all of the ones I had then too. (Guess people don't like Orphans? It'd be nice if it would be said)

I was wondering how to be Confident, and if everyone/anyone can be Confident. But I ask also specifically for shittier people; if they can still be as good/as Confident or anything as a better person. (Let's say, since it's true, that I'm pretty shitty. If I said that I'm socially slow, small, poor, a half-Orphan, ugly, the child of a Rapist and a bunch of other things, you'd be disliking me, right?)

Clearly I'm not really the same as too many, and that my type's probably not all that Confident. (about what, should I be? Really good at being shitty?)

How can I be as good as better people? How can someone shitty think they aren't lesser? What's actually making people better? (It's probably just that they aren't slower mentally and have less problems, isn't it?)

How do you be Confident? How can you? What does it matter if you are if there's more Confident people. around? Honestly I feel pretty shitty &amp; I love how nearly everything that makes me that way are things I can't do anything about. (so I'm permanently shitty?)

Someone, that isn't as good, couldn't really be as Confident, yeah? How can I not suck so much?

Also, even if I was confident and had some better qualities, I'd still likely lose to anyone with less problems, or is better looking or something, wouldn't I?

TL:DR ; I'm pretty shitty, and pretty sure I'm not the type that really is Confident or anything good. How do I not be worse than Cheaters and everything? (they're able to get into relationships, I can't say the same for myself)",24Dec2020,1
42,"My ocd is about making deals with Gods or promises to Gods as a way to fight ocd compulsions. Since I have ocd fear of Gods, I use this fear by making promises to Gods in order to force myself NOT TO do cd compulsions. The fear of Gods is stronger than the fear of NOT doing an ocd compulsion. So, I am forced by my anxiety to mak promises to Gods that I will NOT do the compulsion and I ask for punishments/curse in case breaking the deal by DOING the compulsion.

For example my ocd is telling me to rearrange the books. I do not want to rearrange them but I cant ignore my ocd. So, I try to find a way to make ocd stop giving me anxiety for not doing the compulsion. So, a promise is being made to Gods about not rearranging the books. A punishment/curse is asked in case breaking the promise. The fear of the punishment/curse is stronger than the fear of the compulsion. So, using this fear, I am forcing myself not to do the compulsion and the anxiety for not doing the compulsion is gone because the fear of the punishment in case of breaking the promise (by doing the compulsion) is bigger than not doing the compulsion.

I do not want to make these promises and sometimes, I end up worrying because of HYPOTHETICAL promsies. I cant remember if I ever made a promise about something and because my weapon against ocd are these promises, I worry if I ever made a promise about something and then, forgot it. Sometimes, by doing something that I want that happens to be the same action with the compulsion or something similar, I worry that I may be breaking the promise. Just because what I want to do happens to be the action of an old compulsion. For example, if I want to rearrange the books like a normal person ( no ocd) I will worry because in the past, I may have made a promise to Gods about never rearranging the books (because that time the compulsion was about rearranging the books)

So, I feel like I am trapped in my daily life. For example, I may want to watch a movie and I will start thinking that in the past, I may have made a promise to Gods not to watch that movie because ocd was telling me to watch it as part of the compulsion. So, the usual trick may have been used ( promise not to do the compulsion) in order to fight ocd. And since, I was able to fight my compulsion with the fear of the promise/punishment/curse, days later, I may want to watch that movie like a normal person and not because my ocd is asking me to watch it. I find myself worrying that by watching that movie because I want (like a normal person) I may still, be breaking the promise to Gods.

I have told Christian God (and because Christian God maybe is not real, maybe other Gods heard me) that I do not want to make these promises. Ι told Him ( or Them if they heard me) that I would only, mean a promise if I validate it by doing the cross sign 3 times.

My ocd learned the trick of the fake promises. One day, I tried to make a fake promise and ocd kept giving me worries for not doing the compulsion because it knew that the promises are fake. So, I could not use the fear of promises because I knew that the promises are fake and do not count. Maybe I was forced to mean the promise for some seconds, and tried to validate it by doing the cross sign but I stopped at the second time and canceled the promise.

Now, I am not sure if I ever validate a promise by doing the cross sign 3 times, if it will count or not. Even if I make the cross sign 3 times and try to mean the promise for some seconds, deep down, I do not want to make it. I am just, being forced by my anxiety to make a real promise (since the fake ones do not work)

Everyday I worry in my life. The reason I worry is because I have a fear of a specific punishment from Gods. That specific punishment was asked some times, as a punishment in case breaking the promise. (with or without the cross sign)

That specific punishment is invisible. I mean, it cant be seen. Its maybe something similar as if someone asks as a punishment to be always, unlucky in his life. If he breaks the promise, he cant know if the punishment/curse ( unlucky) happened or not.

The punishment that I fear is being transformed to something ugly but being unable to see it. I do not want to say a lot of details about it.

So, the reason I give much attention to my ocd story (promises) is because I do not know if Gods accepted the promise. Someone has a fear of germs. He washes his hands. He can persuade himself to stop worrying by not washing his hands. He sees that he is ok and maybe worries less. (he has witnessed that his ocd is wrong)

In my case, the punishment is invisible so I cant stop worrying. You will tell me about Jesus but my ocd doubts a lot. So, I cant say to myself ""relax Jesus knows"" because Jesus maybe is not real. What if there are Gods (not from a religion) that do not care about my ocd and accept these promises?

How can a therapist help me and convince me that the invisible punishment did not happen/will not happen or that Gods do not accept those promises?

Can you please talk to me? Can you calm me down? Can you share your experiences? please do not just, tell me to go to a therapist. Talk with me.",24Dec2020,1

44,"I know 2020 isnt over yet but I dont jave anything interesting happening between christmas and newyears so fuck it. Lets go over my year because why not?

I came in to 2020 with a job that was supposed to be amazing but ended up being absolute shit because of the people I worked for/with. I ended up being fired via ghosting when my boss texts one day end of January ""We need to talk, can you meet today?"" And then never responded to my messages. So I spent just over a month in this depressive slump, unemployed, trying to find a job but never finding anything that interest me. Not even as a gap job. In and out of interviews that didnt go anywhere :/ temp agencies never help me long term, I also seem to find a job elsewhere. Like I'll go to a dozen agencies, fill out the same paperwork for health and safety and whatever to then be told ""We'll be in touch"" then they send me to a place and I dont even make it a day. Sometimes less than an hour. Other places I'm hired by the company directly. I went for an interview at a place that made armoured vehicles which sounded like an amazing opportunity problem is the language barrier between me (With a stutter) and the mix of Serbs and Indians. Other part of the problem is the way it was managed, I could tell day one it wasn't going to last for me.

I had one place that was local call me and offer me a job, good pay and I was gunning for this job and then after getting it, day one, my gut tells me (An hour in) that this isn't it chief. This aint the place.

The day prior to that was my birthday and I had the girlfriend over for dinner with the family and everything was great. Next day I walked out of that job and then the girlfriend came over and the 4 words nobody wants to hear ""We need to talk..."" Shitty right? Day after my birthday, I get dumped. Shit came out of nowhere, no hints or anything. Needless to say that depressed the absolute fuck out of me and I'm still working on that. 

Next day I started at another company that wanted me and I believe this was the better choice in every way. The work environment is fantastic, it's a small family run business, I get to work with my hands, I get to plan my hours some days, they are more than willing to work around my schedule, I've explored more of my province this year than I have my entire life. One day we drive 30 minutes away, next day it could be 4 hours away who knows but it's always different, always interesting. I've always done well in small family companies. They treat the employees right. At the start of the pandemic in March/April I had only been there for a month if that before the province went on full lock down for a couple months while the government figured out a plan. Now my company had to shut down and I was fully expecting to be let go because of this. Instead I get 4 cheques, 80hrs pay on each, pre dated. Enough to get me through the 2 months off work. They didnt have to but they did! Really helped me out. I'm making good money right now, finally able to pay off my bills. Loving this company.

Behind the scenes, despite my post-breakup depression and a pandemic, I figured I should try and get back out there in the dating world even though I was totally not over the edge. I'm still not. It'll take more time. I didnt date much but I managed to find a couple ladies for a casual, physical relationship (FB/FWB) it's not meant to go anywhere of course, it's just a distraction and I could really use one. Also I needed a friend too. 

Months go by and nothing interesting happens. I work the same job, drive the same car, still not over the ex, fucking depressed because of it (still) and I'm still seeing those 2 women for FB/FWB. I also got in a lot more camping and hunting this year which was nice. 

 Right now I have my christmas shopping done, I have my biggest bill nearly paid off which is a huge weight off my shoulders. In my current state of not being over her, I have made a christmas gift, mostly handmade and it's more inside jokes and sentimental value type stuff. I'm going to drop it off Christmas day. I hope she likes it. I don't even need to to get back together, I think I just want to see her again for some closure.

My company is taking time off for christmas, they paid out my Vacation pay because EOY is coming and on top of that I got a nice christmas bonus.

 I'm planning to enter 2021 with that big bill finally paid off and I can start saving money again. I hope work stays steady but we're about to enter another 4 month lockdown or whatever so who knows what'll happen... And maybe this year I can move on and try and find someone new to be with or maybe (Slim maybe) the ex and i talk things out and see about starting over. I'd like that very much.

I have hope for 2021. Not much but still hope.

People like to suggest Therapy like it's going to save my life or something, but it didn't do anything when my sisters died with my Mother.

If it couldn't do anything then, for that, I doubt it's doing much for being the Child of a Rapist or for having been molested once.

I was wondering how you actually have a life that's goes decently and is any good. Now, I imagine people not like me do a bit better, at anything. (Anyone molested is probably more Shy and not as trusting as anyone that wasn't, right?)

Most types are likely more Confident, and better in any way, than my type. (you know, I don't see people that were already the quiet type becoming ever too outgoing after their whole life is fucked over.)

I have noticed that people only like you for what you have. (&amp;, as someone that doesn't have much, guess what? No ones wants anything to do with me)

Sounds like I'm being fucked over for being an Orphan and for having a shitter body.

59,"Someone worries for his ocd. He cant ignore the anxiety, and the compulsions.

He is unable to ignore ocd so he tries to use the fear of Godly punishment, in order to fight ocd. By using the fear of Godly punishment, he can force himself to stop worrying about his ocd. Like threating himself (with a Godly punishment) in order to stop worrying. So, in order to do that, he make a deal with Gods that if he does an ocd compulsion, practically or mentally, he will become bald but he wont be able to the baldness. If he looks in the mirror he would see his hair as always but the others will see him bald.

So, the guy, even though does not want to make the deal, he tries to mean it when making the deal/promise in order to prove to his ocd that he really, makes a very bad and dangerous deal with Gods. He tries to prove that the deal is valid by doing the cross sign 3 times ( he had told God or Gods that a real deal/promise will be valid only if he validates it by doing the cross sign)

So, the guy tries to make a real deal (even thought he does not want to) in order to force his ocd to leave him alone.

That guy worries for his ocd and maybe risks breaking the deal by thinking/worrying about his ocd.

Then out of nothing L giggled under her breath and said smiling ‘you looking at her there?’ In a smiley/giggly way Whilst looking at her computer screen the whole time still Quietly but I juts heard her enough to made out what she said. I didn’t say anything and kept my head down.

Ofc she was doing her job--I'm not under the impression that we were in love or anything but the connection that we had was meaningful and reassuring to me. I'll never know for sure what she was thinking but the way that we connected suggested to me that it was something more than a simple transaction.

I'm no stranger to laying with women who make their living through sex work. Generally, it's a pretty simple thing. We talk a bit, we feel each other out, we get down to business, we have a little chat and a laugh, and we part ways. It's always a pleasant experience. I don't talk about it with my family or anything but I'm not ashamed of that part of my life. Most of the women in sex work are pretty detached from what's going on and I don't blame them. I take care of myself and I try to form at least somewhat of a connection because we're both humans but I know for a fact that a lot of their clients, maybe even most, aren't so respectful. So I don't blame her if she's spaced or if her connection to me isn't so profound. After all, we both know why we're there.

With Trisha it was different, though. I'll never know exactly how much of that was her just being great at what she does and how much of it was a genuine connection between people but I know from enough experience that it was \*different\*. I became her regular and we used to really connect. We would talk about what stresses us out, how we got to where we were. We would chat and joke and laugh and spend a fair amount of our time genuinely enjoying each others' company. We would often cuddle and lay together talking and just being present for long over the time I had paid for--once over an extra thirty minutes. Her smile seemed genuine when we would meet again, and she would tell me how excited she was when it was me who had booked her time because her experiences with other clients could be so negative and she felt comfortable with me. 

Again; I'm no fool. Of course her motivations to like me weren't fit for the plot of a romance novel and I'm certain she turned it up because I was a regular customer. But it was more than that--I know a lot of men who visit these girls tip \*really\* well, something I can't afford to do. I know she was in high demand and all those extra minutes she spent with me were time she could be making a lot more with someone else. It wasn't love, but it wasn't nothing either. It was special to me and, based on my experiences, it seemed genuinely good to her, too. She went well out of her way to keep me satisfied, learn what makes me tick and selflessly offer it. Never had another girl, even ones who I've paid more for, come close to that. 

When Covid hit, I stopped seeing sex workers. It was a practical decision and a clear one to make. 

One thing that sticks with me is the last conversation we had. 

I mentioned that I knew she was in the industry for a while and that she'd be moving on soon. Since we weren't in regular contact, I would not have any way of knowing when she would be retiring. She told me that she wouldn't want to never see me again without first having a debrief and talking about it. Her exact words were ""I promise I'll let you know."" 

Alas, when the virus began spreading and I was social distancing, her life brought her to retirement. I sought her out briefly in the Summer months when the numbers went down and I was going through a hard time, which was when I learned that she was no longer a sex worker.

For the sake of being respectful, that was the end of it for me. It would have been creepy and weird to try to reach out beyond that, especially because I can never be certain of how much of our time spent together was her genuine reaction or how much was her acting very sweet because it kept me coming back and kept food on her plate. 

Since she's been gone I've had a cold feeling. Not as cold as a breakup--it's not \*that\* serious. But something's missing. We had a ""relationship"" (as in knowing one another) for about 2 years and saw each other regularly. Held each other, spoke, laughed. Losing that was a genuine loss for me, regardless of the circumstances. Yet, because she was a sex worker, I have never been able to talk about how much that hurt me to anybody. I've just had to deal with it quietly. And frankly, it sucks.

I miss you, Trisha. I hope you're doing well and that you've found gainful work which you can be more proud of. The time that we spend together was genuinely meaningful to me, even though I'll never truly know what or if it meant anything to you. 

I will remember you and the impact that you had on my life, and I will always quietly hope that some strange coincidence might have us meet briefly once again.",24Dec2020,1

76,"I have noticed for the past year, my mum has been intentionally throwing up. 
I havent had the confidence to speak to her because she is very self defensive and will start shouting at me. 
I dont have a great relationship with my mum, its always been up and down. 
As I grew up, she was always an alcoholic and has severe depression due to my dad. I tried many times to help her, pleaded with her, begged her to seek help but she would just shout at me and deny everything. However, this year since March she has not touched a single alcoholic drink and I am so proud of her. 
So this is my question, should I just leave it and she will resolve it herself (like she did with her heavy drinking) or do I intervene? But I am worried that if I do intervene, it will just cause aggressive arguments and stress.",24Dec2020,1
77,"Forgive me for my bad english. 

So today i want to share what i have been through. Suspected for Klinefelter Syndrome. 

So it all started when i noticed i was physically unable to compete my school mates, in sports of strength, no facial hair and i was born in such part of the world where manhood is considered the prime factor in mens life. A teenager boy having male boobs always trying to hide himself and who didnt know the reason why it was happening to him until he discovered that he has undescended testis and will not go through puberty if not treated. Somebody calls on the home telephone and when i pick it up they would say my sisters name that is it her speaking, and i would try my best to sound more deeper and convince them no it is me, these would hit me so hard that i couldn’t participate in any debates in school because of my voice sounding that of a girl. All my same age cousins were going through puberty however i was the same for years with tall stature and only fat tissues around me. I gained weight very fastly around my chest and belly, my hands were so tender that anyone shaking hands with me would feel like if he met a girl and keep holding my hand for some times. In public transport i would try to avoid molesters in all the ways i can, and try to be a strong boy, things were hard for me and I couldn’t share this with anyone. I had zero interest in girls and any relationship, i would only go to school and study hard to get good grades. My father died when i was 7 years of age and then my brother was way  older than me to share these fears with him. One day i told my mother i have this problem, i think i am missing something in my body, and her brothers were surgeons, but its very strange no body noticed that what i was going through. After discussing and doing scans we found out that my testis were in the inguinal region lying dead probably. We were not that well off so could not afford expensive MRI tests, and only proceeded with the findings of ultrasound. I got operated and everyone told me your testis will come down as we have cleared the path and you will be fine. This is when i was 15-16 years of age. I agreed and waited but nothing happened, and proceeded with life again, i had alot of weakness in my body, i got lumbar disc pain, would get sick quite often due to weak immunity but still i focused on my education and got admission in top college in Engineering. Life continued, new to college, again all my classmates were over puberty somehow and i was always trying to hide my man boobs with tight vest wearing all the time and tried to keep myself somehow isolated and only made friends with those people who were interested in studies only. I studied hard and got good grades, meanwhile i got a girlfriend and even talking with her, she would say you sound like a girl, i didn’t share my problems with her, but she was very caring and we loved each other. It was a long distance relationship we could only see each other at peoples weddings after 4-5 months, life continued and i ignored all these issues, my face was a baby face, everyone would tell me you are still a child what are you doing in college, no one listened to me, i wanted to lead my class, but all these facial feature of having no beard or mustache while being 17 years old never helped. i kept low profile all the time and only prayed and studied.
Then one day i shared only my undescended testis and surgery issue with my cousins who was freshly graduated doctor. I still remember when listening to my story he was continuing smoking cigarettes and couldn’t say anything except feeling sorry. I told him i have accepted that i dont need testis but I want to live a normal life. I am a man and i want my face, voice and strength like men not like girls. The next day we visited a doctor and they did some tests if there was any tumor bz if something is dead and lying inside your body it becomes carcinogenic with time. They didn’t shared the reports with me but told me nothing to worry about tumor. Its fine. And then we went to endocrinologist who said i am already too late but still we can start hormone replacement therapy(testosterone deficiency). My levels were below 100 and other hormones which spikes were pretty high. I started testosterone and hoped that my life will change forever. It changed my voice, i started to have some hair on my body and mustache started to grow and few signs of beard. But here come the next problem. Just for comparison the testosterone shots which i am taking now cost around $100 and the one i used in 2013 back in my country costed my merely $1, now you can judge the quality of the hormone and it was time for the side effects, which no one told me and i just kept on taking injections without routine tests/ checkup because it was expensive and being financially tight I couldn’t afford. Before all this i had a very sharp memory and would remember even the page numbers on which some text was written in books. So one day i was fixing a blood pressure machine at my home   , when i fixed that i wanted to check my bp and it came out 165/105 at the age of 18. All my relatives couldn’t believe that and they said the machine is not working. We bought a new one and checked and again it came out the same. So I discovered that having a family history of hypertension, testosterone triggered it  quite early and it was the reason i was always in aggressive mood and wanted to fight with someone of hit someone in the face. So in order to treat that i was asked to restrain from fatty food, salt, and start exercising and take medications. Meanwhile my girlfriend did suicide because her parents didn’t agree with our relationship. Mind it our society is very strict muslims and such affairs even on the phone are not allowable. So she was in hospital for 3 days and then her eyes opened, she took medicates of different kinds all together. But they rushed her to hospital and her stomach being washed helped in her survival. Cross talks continued between my and her family and unfortunately her parents engaged her to a person who was kind of land lord or more well off. It was very hard for me to get out of the relationship but still i managed and got goi my with life unknowing that i was depressed due to all these events. I continued my 4 year engineering degree and to cope with loneliness i started photography. I bought some cheap equipment and started from scratch. I excelled in it and got recognition at different levels. Meanwhile i was having hypertension, extreme memory  loss that i would forget the complete syllabus which i had studied for the exam. Anyhow i passed my degree with average grade. I got internship in oil and gas which was my dream and after doing the hard-work there my back pain lumbar issue become so sever that sitting and walking become difficult and i had to stop the internship. I would do freelance work and earn some money and visit doctors all the time sometime psychiatrist to discus my problem because my family was not supporting me in these endeavor of finding a solution to my problems. All the doctors in my country who i met were money machines. They would again tell me to take injections the same low quality and one most famous doctor gave me medicine for epilepsy 🤦🏻‍♂️. I felt bad and hopeless about a solution and it was difficult to explain to someone. So i lost my internship in a country where its very difficult to get a job. So the next step was to move out of country for better future, i took loan from my relative and went abroad. Got interview call 1 day before flight and prepared so well that the manager appreciated me of my skills and communication in the interview. I got the job and the best thing was we got health insurance and i was happy that now i can sort out my problems peacefully. So i got started on the new and better version of testosterone, which really helped me in many ways, especially the blood pressure, aggressiveness, mental health was much better than before. Even my body i started to convert the fat into muscle and was getting leaner. 
I got new good friends here, and after 6 months of developing friendship with them, i finally shared my story, they were shocked and advised me to go to doctor and sort it out. I had already accepted that i dont want children in my life, maybe i am here for some other purpose in life, maybe i have a different unique destiny, but still whenever i would visit any doctor they would ask me where are my testis and i would not know where they are? Because after the surgery in 2010 nobody told me what happened and i thought there were no testis. So to solve this confusion one doctor told me to do MRi scan to clear this confusion and also do some tumor test just to be on safe side. When the results came, we found my both testis were still in the inguinal region and eveyone in my family was shocked that why my maternal uncle (surgeon) who operated me didn’t tell anyone that he was unable to find the testis, it was his failure so he didn’t shared with us. The doctors here were shocked that for 25 years you are having undescended testis, but fortunately the tumor tests came negative and we were on safe side. Urologist told me to get operated at these were dead testis and of no use and are dangerous. Also we found some lymph nodes in my inguinal canal that were little concerning but he told me we will remove it during surgery. So again we consulted to do a fertility test to see even if there is a single chance of sperm that i can store in a bank, and later on use for having children. The test came out completely negative and it hit me soooo badly, although i had accepted the fact that i will not have children but seeing zero/negative in the report hit me really hard and i am living alone here in this country and my family is back there. It was easy to say but very difficult to accept that i will have no offsprings. Whoever i would see outside i would always think that even this guy will have something to plan for in his life. Anyhow it took 3-4 weeks for me to accept that completely and move on. Then one doctor asked me all your symptoms looks familiar to Klinefelter syndrome XXY (47- males having extra X chromosome). It was again a shock that in all my life no body even cared of to look at the root problem. Now i have given my blood sample for a possible Klinefelter syndrome analysis. And the results take 3-4 weeks. I am waiting for the results to further decide about the surgery. Currently my low back pain is triggered again, i am living alone in a studio apartment, i get hormone shots every 3 months and it causes some kind of depression/anxiety, severe cystic ance, and mood swings due to which i decided to move out from my friends place and live alone as i do not want to ruin my good relationship with friends. I spend around 85 % of my salary just because i live alone. Currently oil industry is going bad and i am  worried about my job. 

I am not a very good story teller, there are many events that i didn’t explain properly or even not mentioned here. But as i have dealt with every problem myself, i will deal with them as well and defeat them soon. 

Much love to you all.

I 26(M) born with undescended testis or even no testis that went unnoticed until i was 15 years old.",24Dec2020,1
78,"A guy has ocd. Ocd is making him to do some tiring compulsions. The guy cant stop doing the compulsion. He tries to ignore it but he cant. He tries to force himself not do the compulsions, by making promises to Gods that he wont do the compulsions and asking for punishment in case breaking them. By asking the punishment, he gets more scared and makes it harder to break the promise by doing the compulsion.


Sometimes, these tricks backfire. And he worries that he may have broken a promise. He tells Gods that he does not mean the promises and that a promise will only be valid, only if he validates it by doing the cross sign 3 times. He tries to seperate the fake, ocd promises from the real ones.


One time, his ocd was telling him to do a compulsion. The guy did not want to do it but ocd kept bugging him. He could not ignore it. He tried to make a promise to Gods about not doing the compulsion. His ocd knew the trick of the fake promises and kept bugging him. The guy foolishly, without wanting, tried to make a real promise. He did not want to do it, He just, thought that it was the only way out of the compulsion. He tried to mean the promise and tried to validate it by doing the cross sign 3 times (he told Gods that a real promise will be valid only if he validates it) His ocd recognised that by doing the cross sign 3 times, the promise was valid. His ocd was like

ocd: By making a real promise there is no point to keep bugging to do the compulsion because the fear of the punishment in case of breaking a REALpromise (by doing the compulsion) is bigger than NOT doing the compulsion. So, I shut up.

Later, that guy asked Gods not to accept those promises because its because of his ocd. He asked for the promises to never count and the punishment to never happen. The guy tries his best not to even think about the compulsions. Sometimes, the fear of accidentally, doing the compulsion ( and breaking the promise) is making him to act compulsively and sometimes, he accidentally, messes up and maybe does the compulsion. He worries that he maybe broke the promise and was punished for it. The punishment he asked is an invisible punishment. A similar example of the punishment is as if someone asks to be cursed with bad luck for the rest of his life. It is invisible. So, the guy cant know if he got punished or not.

The guy is worrying even for writing this post, because when he was ready to write a specific sentence his ocd randomly, told him that if he writes that sentence it will count as if he is breaking the promise. The guy got anxious and rushly, deleted the sentence that wanted to right. He realised that there was no need to delete the sentence because there was nothing wrong with it. So, he starts worrying that he somehow acted compulsive with the sentence by deleting it. He now, worries that he accidentally, broke the promise.

His worry is this:

What if there is a secret rule that all promises (ocd or not) are always valid, and if someone makes a promise and asks for a curse/punishment in case breaking it, the deal is always valid and even if someone tries to cancel the deal, the deal cant be canceled. The fact that the guy has ocd and did not want to make the promise does not change the situation.",24Dec2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

So my story isn't quite set in stone &amp; it's taken lots of twists &amp; turns.  So my roommate has covid and I was exposed to him last Tuesday (it was brief, as we saw each other from across our house).  He got a positive test the next day. Catching it pretty early,  we quickly adjusted &amp; laid down some ground rules (masks in the house, wiping things down, he even got plastic dishes/silverware). I'm feeling slight allergy symptoms/sore throat, but I was also feeling funky before I got exposed to my roommate. I got 3 separate tests throughout the week &amp; all were negative, so I thought I dodged a bullet &amp; that we did great.  There was also someone at my work who tested positive.  We all got tests last Saturday (which there were 7 days in between when I got tested &amp; when we were working together)

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this week.  I'm supposed to drive home to my family in Indiana on Tuesday (12/22).  I got a covid test on Monday just to be 100% sure, and because my brother said it takes 5-7 days after exposure for symptoms to begin/a test to show up positive.  I do my drive on Tuesday, and LITERALLY when I pull up to the driveway at my family's house, I open my email to check my results.  They're there, and lo and behold, it's positive.  I took a lap around my neighborhood because I was in kind of a panick &amp; unsure of what to do - Do I not say anything and hope for the best and base my decision on the evidence that: my symptoms are extremely mild and that 3 of my 4 tests were negative?  Or do I just come clean and we go from there?  My mom said to me that I could still come home if I was positive &amp; had a mild case, and that we would just have to adjust.  After mulling over it for some time, I decided that the best decision with the least detrimental consequences would be to just be honest and put our safety over our enjoyment of a normal Christmas.  We've had to make some adjustments (masks in the house, I'm isolating in the basement, they're bringing me food and leaving it by the door), but at least I am in the same house as everyone &amp; not on a god damn Zoom call.

&amp;#x200B;

I did get a covid test yesterday just to make 100% sure I am positive, so there's a very slim chance of hope.  I find it hard to believe the most recent test I took for these reasons: I tested negative 3 times, the most recent one I took was a rapid test, and the facility was kind of fumbling that day.  However, the chances of a false positive are 1/10.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am quarantined in my basement, and my family is all upstairs, and our exchanges are slim - just when they come to bring me food, and if I get anything from the kitchen while they're all off in the living room.  I think that we're gonna make it work.  Our living room &amp; kitchen are connected, so I will just be off in the distance while we watch Christmas movies/do gifts.  Also, my brothers have already had covid, and my mom is a middle school teacher, so I am not the biggest threat in the world.  But, I do still need to be careful around my mom (she is very healthy, but still older).  This is lightyears better than being alone at my house in Nashville and celebrating the holidays over Zoom, but it is still agonizing to think about all the normalcies of Christmas that I was looking forward to: dinners together, various activities with my brothers, gathering by the fireplace to watch movies, cooking together, drinking together, HUGGING, I could go on.  The worst part is that I can't even touch my fucking pets, and looking at my dog and cat makes me cry.

&amp;#x200B;

It also sucks because this is most likely the last Christmas we will have in our childhood home, as my Mom is downsizing &amp; moving to California next year.  It's also been hard to watch everyone get older, and watch the time we have to all be together as a family become sparse, and watch many aspects of our family become that of nostalgia.  Every time we're together feels like the last time, and that we won't all be together for years to come.  I also had some fun New Years plans to look forward to that are probably down the drain now.

Through it all though, I do need to count my blessings:

\-I'm still here &amp; still get to see everyone's faces

\-I'm on good terms with everyone in my family

\-My case is very mild (just allergy symptoms)

\-I'm good at handling tough situations with a sense of humor (the jokes have been nonstop since I got home)

\-Something about having this much space in between me &amp; my family is actually kinda nice at times

\-I'm super proud of myself for facing the truth of me testing positive and coming clean, putting everyone's safety above my desires for normalcy.  It was hard to think about what would happen if I said nothing &amp; several days later one of my family members got sick

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if that was a whole can of worms, but it feels good to get my situation out of my head.  feel free to share your covid story in the comments.  And I wish those of you who are alone this season (and those who aren't) a very Happy Holidays.  Stay strong, take some time for yourself, and above all TALK TO SOMEONE.  One of the biggest things I've learned this year is how grounding it can be to talk to someone when you have a lot in your head.

TLDR: Exposed to COVID positive roommate and coworker, got 3 tests &amp; all were negative, got another test a day before my drive to my family's house bc it takes time after exposure for test to show positive , found out it was positive when i pulled into the driveway.

97,"this year has been fucking wild as i’m sure you all know by now. but i’m so grateful for it. 

i lost my job in march after moving back to my hometown when a relationship didn’t work out. it wasn’t due to covid, just my own stupidity, but was lucky enough to get unemployment insurance. let me tell you, this was a well deserved break. i’ve typically worked two or three jobs while in school and i was experiencing burn out. 

the old flame came in and out throughout the summer because the world was/is a scary place and we still had a lot of love for each other. in the end we just wanted different things. it didn’t change how we felt about each other. it was difficult to get out of that cycle. and then the reality hit that it was really over, and my world was turned upside down. i just wanted it to work so badly. i was very unhappy with myself. 

i chose a school program that i had always wanted to try. it was okay at first. but then the final break up happened and i completely lost interest. part of me chose the program because of the person i wanted to be when i was with my ex. i thought it would make me happy because it’s a lucrative field, or so i thought, but it got more difficult and my heart just wasn’t in it. 

so i felt like a huge failure. my relationship with the person i thought i’d be with for a very long time didn’t work out, my future plans weren’t working out, and it took a huge toll on my mental health. i really honestly didn’t believe that i would make it to christmas. on top of that, i was going through the stress of filing for bankruptcy pro se (not recommended). it worked out in the end. 

i know the US is known for having fucked up healthcare, but i’ve been one of the lucky ones. i’ve been on state insurance this year and can actually visit the doctor. i got back on my meds for ADHD and i’m seeing a therapist. and i don’t have to pay a dime. 

in some ways it pays to be poor. it’s all i’ve known, so i’m pretty good at it. and being on unemployment has changed my life. i will probably never again know what it’s like to not have to work and to live my life how i wish. 

i don’t take a single day for granted. my bills are paid and i’m relatively debt free. my family is in good health, even after my dad had a cancer scare. the people i love are safe. i have a roof over my head and food in my kitchen. with the time i’ve had off, when i wasn’t focusing on finishing this semester, i’ve used to focus on my mental and physical health. i’ve lost ten pounds just by walking every day. i don’t wake up wanting to kill myself anymore, and it’s been some time since i’ve felt that way. i’m learning how to play the guitar. i get to snuggle with my cat any time i wish. 

i’ve switched programs and i’ve got a job lined up. but for now i’m soaking up unemployment for as long as i can. i deserve it. god knows when i’ll get another break like this. 

the highs were as low as the lows this year. what a strange ride this is. but i’ve learned so much about the world and myself this year. i’m so incredibly grateful to be where i am. 

and with that, peace out 2020. i think 2021 is gonna be a lil easier. 

blessed be",24Dec2020,1

It's got a smaller second story and we started playing it and just had fun till my palms started to sweat from holding the controller so we agreed to have a few minute break. I feel like when we played this game on the same console but now we have the luxury to have our own screens :), It's weird how tech can both isolate and connect you to people.

106,"My mom has asthma which puts her in a way higher risk category. But no one seems to have a problem with my sister constantly hanging out with her friends or bringing them over here almost every single day. 

I’m in a constant state of anger and anxiety. Last week she was about to go to a party and I finally snapped and told her how stupid that was and that if our mom ends up in the hospital its her fault. She didnt end up going but the next day she hangs out with the guy who threw the party. I just can’t understand the logic.

You would think my parents would care but my dad is your typical right winger “its just the flu” and i love my mom but she basically has no opinion on real world things unless my dad does. 

I just don’t understand why they wouldnt want to be more careful. Every day I wake up anxious as hell wonder if today is going to be the day one of us contracts it and gives it to my mom.

And I understand that its not like she’s 80 years old or anything, she’s 50 but still, why even invite more risk factors. 

I dont know.. its just been getting really hard and its hard to vent bc i havent seen my girlfriend in weeks since she’s a nurse that works nights. 

I’m 23 and still live at home if that helps anything and my sister is 20. i’m just so done with everything and we probably wont even get the vaccine for a few more months.

My fiancé has a Christmas Day birthday. After his grandparents died when he was much younger he stopped wanting to celebrate altogether. They mostly raised him and used to make sure he felt like his birthday was celebrated too by making sure he got gifts for both.

This will be our fourth Christmas together and he lets himself celebrate with my family now but still doesn’t really love to mention his birthday.

I always try to knock it out of the park and spoil him with gifts. (This guy asks for nothing ever and deserves it.)

Welllll.... guess what showed up on my porch today!

113,"It can be uncomfortable to look at unfavorable demographical statistics, and it's incredibly easy to try to write them off or forget about them. At the same time it can be easy for some to write off the entire demographic based on statistics. When you favor one side or the other, society gets stuck in place, no progress is made because one side ignores the statistics entirely, while the other takes the wrong message from them. 

&amp;#x200B;

You've probably seen the[""despite being (x) percent of the population (y) commits 50% of the violent crime](https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/ucr.asp?table_in=2)"" statistic being touted. Unfortunately, this statistic while not completely accurate, (it's rounded up), is mostly true. It's often used as ammunition for truly racist groups, and ignored by everyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, I think it's important to acknowledge the statistics- and instead of writing it off in one way or the other, try to figure out *why, and how to move forward from here.*

&amp;#x200B;

A major factor with this statistical discrepancy it due to culture- not skin color. Many businesses don't like to set up near neighborhoods of certain demographics- with some exceptions. These neighborhoods have bad reputations, and many times they're not unjustified. It often can be difficult for businesses in those areas, which is why gas stations in certain neighborhoods have to employ the use of expensive barriers between the customer and cashier, as without them, the business is significantly more likely to be robbed or shoplifted from- but at the same time, the lack of available hiring opportunities in these communities can make it much more difficult for one to get away from the dark underbelly of said community- which is why gangs are more prevalent in said areas.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do we do about it? I don't know. I don't have the answer. Money makes the world go 'round, and if money is the object, businesses will refrain from opening up in bad neighborhoods, regardless of skin color. It's a vicious cycle, the less available options people have to escape the rough atmosphere of their homes, the more likely they are to turn to crime, either to get by, or because there's nothing else readily available. Government reparations won't solve anything- if people have to work less, they often will take the path of least resistance, thus paid-off government housing and excessive welfare has been so ineffective in fixing bad neighborhoods. Equality of outcome is never assured, no matter how hard we try or how much money we throw at the problem, but bringing equality of opportunity  is a necessity. I don't imagine it could be fixed in our lifetimes, at this point, Rome wasn't built in a day after all, but pushing it in the right direction may kickstart progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any answers or solutions, but I do believe there are some things we could do to help. Opening businesses closer to these bad neighborhoods would give people a much closer-to-home way to work, and if money is coming in consistently, they may be less driven to resort to crime. The issue would be sustainability. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's an uncomfortable subject to be sure, bad apples are universal,  but it's important that we don't ignore it entirely, or that we don't fall into the trap of jumping to conclusions when thinking about *why* it's like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some may choose to condemn me, or misinterpret my post, whether it be out of misguided idealism or a desire to keep the subject under wraps, some may even condemn me because they believe that bad neighborhoods are a result of arbitrary factors such as skin color, only time will tell.

118,"This pandemic has made life horrible, for all of us. I'll explain why it's affected me personally and what I need help deciding in a moment. I think a little backstory is important and it could help any advice that someone might offer. 

Growing up I didn't have anyone to connect with. My mom's a lawyer and was always on business calls when she was around and my dad was a businessman, working hard hours to put food on the table and roof over our heads. Since I was able to eat normal food, my mom had no reason to be around me. She showed me where all the ""treats"" were and bought me a bunch of toys, and that was the end of it. I got along with my sister briefly, but we fell apart because she didn't like how boys were, and my brothers were just babies. At this same time, I'd always sneak into my parents room, despite it being the forbidden room that the baby is ""always resting in"", just so I could put my finger in my brother's palms. When I did this, he'd squeeze my finger, and for a brief moment I'd feel like someone needed me or was affected in a positive way by existence. 

Some how, time flew. Before I knew it, he said I was around him too much and that I never left him alone. It kinda killed me, because he was the only person I'd felt close to. When I finally moved on from preschool to first grade, it was a shit show. The one kid that wanted to hangout with me was a little dude who snuck into the girls bathrooms to peek on them. I didn't know it at the time, and I don't think I could've not been his friend because he was the only person that approached me to talk to me. It wasn't just that I couldn't make friends, it's that I was wasn't white. I was the guy who transferred every year of his academic career all the way up till senior year of high school. When I tried to join in or show off my similar skills (Art, Music, Sports, etc), I'd just been phased out of their world some how. It really got me thinking about how nobody needed me again, and that I should just leave one night and disappear from this world, as it seemed to already be empty. 

Fast forward a little more and we are at my freshman year of high school. I played some video games in the time being and really got attached to Roblox and GTA because, well, it offered friendship and a world where I could exist. Each time I'd hop on Roblox, I'd get an easy 50 friend request and I truly believed people enjoyed my presence and that if I ever disappeared, they would notice. in GTA, I was a badass that had friends, connection, and girls. This was around the time that everyone in my age group was hyping up girlfriends and I really wanted one too, just that connection. Because it's high school, I started to meet people. Friends. I had real friends that were normal people who liked hanging out with me after school. Life felt like bliss at this point because I thought I had what I really wanted. But I moved, and they began leaving me on read, and soon after just stopped responding to me entirely. Just to be clear, I'm not super clingy, and I don't hit someone up everyday to hangout. I ask if they got plans this weekend and if they say yea, I don't ask again for a week or two. So it really surprised me that I got abandoned so quick. 

""Fuck"" was all I could think at this realization. ""How the fuck did I mess this up?"". 

I think this was the moment that the inevitable depression every teen experiences began to sink in. It manifested kind of strange, though. My grades got better and better, I began to read and practice everything in my free time, rather than play video games. I was the top of all my classes, and I mean the very top all year. I also began hitting the gym and sleeping very early. My days shifted from sleepless nights to hardcore nights of just pumping weights in my room. I pulled enough money from odd jobs (I couldn't work, my dad said I should focus on my school) to buy an entire Bench and began deadlifting to pass the night. I got bigger, and bigger, and bigger. 

I should've seen my fall coming, but I forgot how the saying went; ""The bigger they are, the harder they fall"". And god damn, did I fall. 

My good grades and noticeable physique led to many improvements in my life. I got a girlfriend, and I was known as the guy that knows everything, and everyone wanted to be my friend. I got smiles from every hall and class as I walked bye. I began to feel a strange sensation, one I later learned the word of; ""Hatred"" I was furious internally. At my parents, peers, schoolmates, girlfriend, and at myself. Why the fuck did I have to suffer so much, be so alone, and change so much so that people would want to even know who I am? This was the moment I got into metal, because I guess that specific genre of music was perfect for my primordial rage I'd unconsciously buried. 

I let it all get to my head eventually. I wasn't able to study for an exam one night but still got an A. I got cocky really fast once it happened three or four times, and eventually stopped studying all at once. This is where I basically put the rope around my neck and stood on a chair with a broken leg. Senior year comes around and I'm rolling 6 AP classes after being in 2 the previous with straight A, and without studying for a damn thing while I was at it. My report came in, and I had D's and C's. When my dad saw it, he was more than angry. He took my computer that I'd built and cancelled my cell number, and to top it off he limited my internet to school websites only, and some how filtered my Youtube, too. 

Here came the hard part of depression. 

I stopped caring about everything and pushing everyone away. I began listening to depressing songs by famous rappers like xxxtentacion, and it just threw me down more because all the things I'd felt emotionally I was realizing cognitively through the words of their songs. My hatred quickly dwindled down and I quickly gained weight. This went out through the whole year. 

Once college came around, I was honestly worried. I was to burnt out to care about the SAT or anything school related, and was worried I'd be denied from every university. Nonetheless, I was accepted into so many. But my personality was damaged still. I didn't care anymore what anyone thought, and I didn't care that I was alone, I preferred it. 

Now, I find myself thinking about everyone as annoying, constantly getting in fights with my Dad and girlfriend, and pushing all my friends out for good. I always apologize to my girlfriend from being so difficult, but I can see her losing interest in me at this point, almost three years later.

When I have a problem, I google search it and find a solution. This can't be google searched though. If you took the time to read all of this, then you care more about me than most of the people I've met. I'm contemplating deleting all socials and gaming accounts and starting from scratch, this time not making any friends. My grades are back up but I feel like sand, like glass that's been broken too many times to have an actual shape.

120,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

One instance she said she booked me in for a practice interview and I just looked down and nodded and she said annoyed ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ when I didn’t mean it like that 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

💡She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


◾️I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence. And she seemed very moody about it at the time tbh",24Dec2020,1
