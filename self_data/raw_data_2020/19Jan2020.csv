2,"It feels like no one cares about me anymore. If I went to a different city it feels like they'd be sad for a week to a month, then forget me. Since I cannot legally drive quite yet, my mom refused to drive me 20 minutes to see my counsler and get more anti-depressants from my psychiatrist. I haven't taken them for about a two months. The first few weeks I was in pain because my body didn't know how to handle the drop in medication. It got better but my mental health was blissful. It was great; then it drastically dropped. I've contemplated ending it multiple times then thought, maybe I shouldn't do that. I'm convinced everyone hates me. No one likes me anymore. I'm just an after thought. I'm a terrible person. A year ago I was cheated on. I'm still with them. I love them and trust them not to do the same thing again but it still hurts. The person who called me a rapist knowing fully I'm asexual and in a happy relationship said I didnt deserve to have friends. We weren't even friends. Atleast I don't try to have sex with dogs. Maybe she was right though. Maybe I don't deserve to have friends. I don't know how to handle this anymore.",19Jan2020,1
3,"I feel like I'm that guy who wings it through life without any plan or idea of what he's doing and isn't really doing great in life but isn't doing terrible either. For example I never once studied in school but still averaged out with 5 C's and a B. Flunked college but have a respectable but low paying job as a support worker. Socially inept but has a girlfriend who understands me, somehow has a house etc.

Is there an actual term for this? The guy who's literally just winging life while hoping for the best.",19Jan2020,1
4,"This happened a few years ago but some of these things are still ongoing... One night around 7 or 8-ish I was on my phone (lying on my back on my bed with my lamp on) when I hear what sounded like a little girl say ""hey"" from the corner of my room by my door I flip over and look, nothing. Seconds later, I hear a white noise/ringing sound and my lamp begins to flicker. I glance at the ceiling and, I shit you not, there's words written in bold black on the ceiling. I get up to read it and my lamp completely shuts off!! I opened my door and bolted across the hall to my little sister's room and told her everything, she goes into my room and comes back shocked  , she tells me that my lamp light bulb is cold!! I had that lamp on for hours... A while after this incident me and my sister would smell rotting meat  and sewage in our rooms every night (She would smell sewage and I would smell the rotting meat) in the same exact spots, at the corner of our beds.. The torture doesn't end there..  My sister and I have even woken up with our pants pulled down. I have even woken up to being held down and something penetrating me...

7,"I fucked up, I fucked up bad, really really bad

I had a  female best friend(A) who is really close to me, she's actually engaged

After a while, I asked her for advice to flirt with this one girl(B)

Went out on a date and all

Then (A) was really jealous about it, *however she tried really hard to hide it, she never stopped me, but she was acting very distant and honestly it was me who forced her to divulge*

I asked for advice from someone in our circle, about A 

B found out about A being mad, and backed off from me

Then A found out that she's pretty much hated by the circle since everyone is backing B... Since well, A is engaged, and everyone thinks A is a bitch for stopping my relationship

A has pretty much said ""i'm glad I won't be seeing you for much longer""(She's moving town next week)

So I'm here feeling shit, 26year old destroying a potential life long friendship because I can't keep my mouth shut",19Jan2020,1

9,"This sounds so dramatic and I can't believe I'm typing this out to Reddit but I don't even know what to do. It just feels like my life since high school was a roller-coaster ultimately leading to rock bottom.

My first year went as good as I wanted I guess but then I met this girl the summer going into grade 10. I fell stupid in love with her and we dated  for 3 years. This girl was needy, the neediest. If i wasn't giving her 24h attention I was given a cold shoulder and it made me feel bad about myself.

I gave her my everything and I stopped seeing a lot of people i used to because of the time given to her. I had no  problem with that because I loved her and she said things to me making it seem like we were forever, I believed that unfortunately.

This finally ended when I was told she was cheating on me  (not even the first time sadly). That was heartbreaking. 

Here I was 3 years later looking like a fool. My circle was smaller than ever and I felt lonely as fuck.  I didn't go to my prom because of this, or my graduation. I felt like I didn't belong. I felt like the whole school just knew and laughed to themselves as they walked by me.

Out of that toxic place I went to college for business and hated it. Took a year off and went into another program. I literally only went because my two closest friends were doing it as well. I was stupid to do that as we all ended up disliking it and all dropped it.

So now I'm 19 and me being stupid again I recently fucked up and I lost my closest and pretty much only friends. I'm just at a loss now. Dropped out of school, no friends, lonely as fuck and depressed as I never thought was even possible. 

I'm sad all the time, I smoke weed and it makes me sad, I listen to music that makes me sad. Something about it is just good but at the same time I feel worthless. I just feel like there's only one way out sometimes.

I'm just so fucked up and I don't want to go on anti-depressants cause I know what that shit has done to people I know. I just don't know what I want in life anymore. I don't know what to study, where to work and I am so fucking scared to trust someone in a relationship again yet I have such a need for someone in my life.

I'm so desperate to get out of this hole I'm in. I just don't know what I can even do anymore.",19Jan2020,1
10,"Today I sent out a drunk text, well actually worse, an email to my ex. And a rather embarrassing one. So naturally I felt ashamed and hating myself upon reading what I wrote in the morning when I was highly emotional and just wasn’t in the right state of mind. 

Anyway so that resulted in me removing myself from all social media platforms, except this one. And I realized how reliant I was on those things to distract myself and preoccupy myself during the times I wasn’t busy or just anxious. Even though I was quite busy for the past months, I guess I subconsciously still had the need to prove that life was greater than ever, apparently to everyone; my ex, the people around me, and I realized -- the person I wanted to convince myself the most was me. But now that I really think about it, what does that all even matter when in reality I’m not feeling as great as I make it out to be? Yeah, sure I’m not particularly at a low point, nor did I ever pretend to be someone I’m not. But none of that matters. What other people think don’t really matter, because eventually we’re only really ever stuck with reality and ourselves. 

So this the day I start to solely focus on working on myself, my life, to become the person I really want to be - the best version of myself, without all of those nonsense. I can't lose sight of the things I want to accomplish and the person I want to be anymore. I hit a bump after that breakup and got distracted for a while, it's time to get my shit together again.

I’m letting go of that ex and I’m letting go of all that superficial stuff. Because after all, ultimately our life is what we make it, and not what we make it out to be. I can’t fix my internal problems by faking to be happy, it just doesn’t work that way. 

So ironically what was first a total embarrassment turned into an epiphany and a rather good decision.",19Jan2020,1

14,"Last year I ran into someone I haven't seen since like 2009. She's been living in LA for the past year and told me how she's struggling with just keeping up a certain lifestyle.

She's able to pay rent in an old apartment that she shares with two other girls, but not for much else.

She told me how she came to be a model and wanted to work with fashion brands, but right now she's fell into the adult industry and also a sex worker.

And she hates it. She hates who she works with in the industry and hates the men she's paid to hook up with. She told me how she takes a xanax pill every morning and before she goes to sleep just so she can keep her mind off the bullshit.

She also doesn't turn down any coke, percs, or free drinks that she gets.

When she wasn't working or partying, she loves to just chill and play video games. She sucks at Fortnite, but an idea still came to me right there.

She can make more money, have more freedom, and not deal with any of the negatives that come from porn or being a sex worker if she just livestreamed herself in her room.

The reason she never thought about doing it was because she completely took herself off of social media for the past couple years because of how bad she felt for herself by not becoming a model. She didn't want to see other models succeeding and also wanted to forget about the people she knew back home in the Bay.

I let her know she can livestream herself playing video games, posing for the camera in cute/sexy outfits, or just talk to the fans that are watching. Basically whatever she wanted (within the guidelines of whatever platform she chose) and for however long she wanted to.

I just thought this way, she's building herself up instead of just exchanging money for her time. She could put up a video, have people watch it whenever, and continue to get paid from it.

I showed her some other influencers in that industry along with what they were offering and rough guesses of how much they were making.

Even girls with not that many followers were making a lot more than she was in that time.

Since that time, she got an onlyfans account and connected on twitter with other creators on that platform to help her grow. She showed me the content she's posting and its great to see her make way more money than before while doing less work. She's no longer having sex with guys on camera (she could still do that on onlyfans, she just doesn't want to). She's just posting lewd and nudes and playing video games in sexy costumes. What a time to be alive.",19Jan2020,1

always had serious body image issues and have been dealing with an ed on and off for more than 5 years. got my nipples pierced when i was 17 because my boobs (specifically my nipples) are my biggest insecurity. small boobs, large &amp; dark areolas. my piercings never really agreed with me and always gave me trouble, i should have taken them out years ago. they made me feel only a bit better about my boobs, not as much as id hoped but it was one thing that could maybe distract from how hideous my boobs are. lately one of them has been giving me way more trouble than the other, and Im pretty sure the piercing is migrating and Im going to have to get it taken out. im so devastated and i feel like im spiralling. im not sure what im going to do but my best bet is probably cutting my tits off altogether.",19Jan2020,1

28,"It’s definitely hard convincing one’s self that a lack of individuals who take interest-  (are attracted to) as a friend or something more - isn’t because something is wrong with them. Could be looks or personality. But it’s hard to pinpoint. Nobody is brutally honest. 

It’s been getting to me lately. I get told I’m a great person. I get the feeling I’m not physically attractive. I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but haha... it’s been 5 years since my last relationship. I’ve only been in one. Guys really just don’t seem to take an interest in me. I put myself out there.

I just feel too tall, too big, not skinny enough, my ethnicity is not preferred, I’m not funny enough, I’m not this or that or I’m too much. I hate going to bed like this. The world is so lonely. 25, female, unwanted. The older we get, the less valuable and attractive we are seen anyway... so it really doesn’t get better from here.

30,"I'll get past all the mental blocks and damages. I'm 19 years old in Ontario, Canada. I dropped out of high-school, age 18. I got good grades too. I was in my final months, but my mental state got too...drastic. Anyway, financially and environmentally; not in a good place either. Schooling, rough. Getting a job, rough. Talking to my guardian, rough. Complete lack of understanding between my parents and I. She's severly disabled, and her boyfriend is a ticking-time-bomb. I had a sibling, but he moved out due to family issues...which is what I'm dealing with and trying to avoid. He did everything himself just to get out of here. Quite literally everything. I can't do that. It's just me, honestly. He got through college, saved up money, and left to his S/O in the US. Now, they said to me that they'd get me out of here, but getting a green card takes a while and they have things they're doing themself. I really only trust my sibling's S/O. She's super understanding and helpful. That's really it. They're the only ones willing to get me out of here. I want to get a taste of the real world, but I can't do it alone. I can't do it in a toxic atmosphere.

   

But, I don't want much out of life. I don't talk to anyone. I don't do anything. I'm just going by societal norms and financially surviving. I *can* do things, but it'll just kill me. I'll just kill me. I *can* be incredibly smart and wise. I *can* be incredibly strong physically. It's just not things I'm looking for. I've done a lot of things psychologically and tested myself through trial after trail, error after error. I've tapped in to different states of thinking, explored my mind, pushed myself to literal death just to get a feel for it. Sure, I've developed. but we're social creatures and I don't strive for a status, nor do I see a point striving for myself. I just want simple. This 'beginning to end' goal people have is foreign to me. Getting a job, talking for things, going to events, doing things, clothes, happiness from doing certain things. I understand it, but I don't *understand* it. I'm just sort of...a thing...with memories. Not very welcoming. 

   

So here I am. Just stagnant and hoping things don't turn sour. Now, my brain can't handle stress at the slightest, and moving to an *actual* loving family will hopefully get me grounded. I don't know what to do. Going to my parents for 'help' is a definite no, and I need someone to get me to places. Not *just* literally; figuratively. I'm living at the bare minimum and keeping myself healthy. That's it.

So there is this girl that started texting with me at New years eve.  I knew her through friends. Ive  texted with her since everyday throughout the entire day. I had a date with her once which went rly well. I didnt kiss her tho. I talked with her about rly intimate stuff like her father having heart attacks and how it effected her life or her visiting a therapist since she has anxiety about being ill and stuff. I told her about my brother having cancer etc. We couldnt meet up for a second date because she was ill. So we met today with a bunch of friends partying. The kind of ppl we met through. Im a person that needs to know at which point we are in out relationship. So i decided to walk her to her car when she had to leave early.  I asked her what she thinks where this is going with us. She told me she is rly glad that we come along like this and that she appreciates me, but she isnt sure yet. That hit me like a rock.  Before i alrdy felt like im on the hook, that im the back up plan for her. That was the moment i realised, aight thats exactly it.

39,"I think everything I do is to stay within the lines of making other people happy. I always worry about what people think. I have randomly trust issues. I’m insecure. Social anxiety.

I can’t think of anything that I’m capable of actually enjoying, or of being able to make the effort to reach out to find something. 

I do things because if not, ___ will be disappointed. _____ expects me to do ___ so I have to do it. I have yet to find something that actually makes me happy. 

In the time that I’m at school I do enjoy being with friends. Outside of school, I don’t have the desire to communicate. I stay inside my room. I don’t want to go out. Alone, all my negative thoughts come together. But I like being alone.

I always try to post these when I’m feeling extremely emotional, because otherwise, I don’t feel any particular way towards it. I shrug it off, never know how to explain it, until I feel emotional again. But then five minutes later, I’m over it. I don’t feel it after.",19Jan2020,1

I don't know if I'm really looking for anything from this, it's mainly to vent at a place where I wouldn't get booted for not adhering to the ultra-strict guideline that seem to permeate the rest of reddit. so, I had this friend, we'll call her Alice, who was being stalked by this guy, we'll call him logan around this time last year, Logan is the kind of guy who doesn't really acknowledge boundaries or age differences, he's in his mid 20s and buys unwanted gifts (such as chocolate and flowers) for women and even at times underage girls, now, he had taken a particular interest in Alice, who while she is an adult (22) has a smallish frame for her age and has pretty much the kind of body type he likes, and was harrassing her nonstop, calling her beautiful, saying he missed her, asking for her number, messaging her on social media etc. just being a general creep. That was where I came into the picture, I noticed how Logans advances were affecting her ability to function in day to day life so I offered to talk to him for her, I did and he backed off, she was super grateful and we started talking on a regular basis, a few months after we started talking I broke down and admitted to her that I was going through a really hard time that year, I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship, almost diagnosed with cancer, had been dealing with family issues, helping a friend who discovered she had a brain tumor etc. basically just having an all around shitty time, we talked about it all and it was the start of us going back and forth being the first one to tell each other our problems as they came up over the course of the year, at some point, Alice started dating, which initially I was fine with, I was glad she was happy. However, then I realized I had developed feelings for her somewhere along the line (I honestly couldn't tell ya when, maybe it was even back when I was helping her deal with logan), once I realized this I got increasingly more insecure around her as the year wore on and simultaneously grew closer to her, it got to the point where  while I met some of her cousins and even started getting to know her older (24) sister pretty well (we'll call her sam, she's not terribly important to this story but she comes back later and I thought she deserved a shout out), I was also constantly over apologizing for talking to her about feelings and stuff we would normally talk about before and just be generally intense with her as my anxiety around her increased (I was both insecure about losing her and that I would become just like Logan), Alice was understanding about it for a while because she knew about all my issues and that my mental health was generally not the greatest but eventually it got too intense for her and she told me to stop talking to her. I agreed and deleted my social media and stuff for a bit to give her space, but when I reactivated it a little later I saw that she had messaged me accusing me of telling people I thought she was into me and I just completely broke down. I told her I had feelings for her and never intentionally said anything to hurt her (which was true, I told a few people that I had feelings for her and somehow it got back to her that I was saying the opposite). This naturally completely blew up our circle, Alice completely ghosted me for a month out of fear that talking to me would damage her relationship and my neediness and half my friends still aren't talking to me. But weirdly Sam seems to have been super supportive of me, she stopped talking to me for a while (I think in support of alice) but she admitted to me that Alice is emotionally a little fragile because she's used to negative attention from guys and she's scared of getting close to people. she said Alice probably still won't talk to me but that I shouldn't take it personally because she has a hard time expressing herself. anyways despite I still feel like an absolute piece of shit, my greatest fear was that I would become another Logan and do exactly what he did to her and that's what wound up happening.

What I'm wondering is why then is the theory of mimicking settled on the idea that it is for liking and report building but I did it to mock? It makes me think it has at least some to do with report building and also some to do with I have no idea.

I have known you for almost one year, and I would never think that we would become each other best friend. Somewhere along the way thinking of you, you became the only boy I ever cared about so much at this moment of my life. It took me a while to trust you the way I trusted you and frankly you were the first one. It was you who was there for me when my ex boyfriend let me down. I really felt so bad back then and in the end you made me feel happy to be me. I know it's stupid, but now I would not be the same because our friendship was a turning point in my life. I realized that you were so much bigger in my world than I thought. When I felt like hell in myself you kept seeing me as the best girl in the world, the best friend you could have. Since the time when we were no longer talking, I am really afraid of losing you again. It's stupid because everything is perfect in our friendship now.

But I wish I could talk to you even more, like before. You don't know that I feel like that, and you don't even know that I wrote you a poem a long time ago but you know why we stopped talking the first time. You want to see me more happy than you. You kept your promise, and by wanting to keep it, you did what you thought best : you gave me a personal space following certain events, a long time ago. And I couldn't hold you back. But now I will never let you think I don't need you in this life again. Sorry to believed you when you told me that you should leave me alone. But you have to know one thing, I could never live without you and I refuse to live with the ghosts of you around me when I listen ""The night we met"" again. I'm so fucking afraid to admit that I'm totally unable to listen to this music without dying.

This is my final semester as a college/university student, and as of the writing of this post, I am severely panicking about one of my courses. 

I had originally registered for a class called JOUR 4900 (Digital Journalism), only to find the class primarily dealt with video editing and learning the software Adobe Premier Pro.

Having no interest in the class, and knowing video editing is a skill I would not excel at, I decided to drop the class and replace it with something else.

I ended up choosing MK 4200 (Marketing Research), but only having 1 of the 2 prerequisites, I had to email the instructor for permission to override the prerequisite and allow me to register for the class.

Good news I was allowed to register and am now enrolled in MK 4200. Bad news is I found out the class revolves around using the software Microsoft Excel. 

I have virtually no experience with this program and am SUPER worried I will not be able to grasp using it and be able to pass the course.

I need this course to graduate and am overall feeling super overwhelmed and am riddled with worry and anxiety.

So much so I decided to post on reddit hoping for someone to give me ANY advice to ease this panicky worry.

Any advice is super appreciated. Thank you so much for reading this.

For the vast majority of my 2 year relationship I feel like the luckiest lady alive. But I also have this sad feeling inside me that I cannot seem to shake no matter what I tell myself. 

I always planned to just sleep with one person, it’s just the way I was brought up and I was convinced that this would be the case. I wanted to wait for marriage or at-least engagement. 
At 24 I made a huge ( drunken ) mistake and slept with the wrong person. Before I met my now wonderful partner I had been with a total of 2 people. I know it’s not a lot but I really feel like I let myself ( and my partner down ). I can’t explain the feeling it’s just a super sad feeling in my heart that I wish I waited just a little bit longer to meet him then he’d be my one &amp; only. I actually cry my self to sleep about it Atleast  once a week. 

Should I tell him or deal with it myself? If I tell him how would I word it. He knows I wasn’t a virgin when we met but he doesn’t know how I feel.its like we will have a really nice day together then I’ll go home and this surge of guilt will hit me and this voice in my head will literally say ‘ he’s so good to you &amp; you couldn’t even give him your virginity ‘ 

My friends advised me not to, they said ‘ your boyf isn’t your therapist or confessor. It isn’t his burden to hold ‘ so now I’m unsure.",19Jan2020,1

Then the other day I was talking to someone about how I like the feeling of being sad and describing what I like about it - the sense of distance, looking down on the world from above, detached. It gives me a feeling of almost superiority to everything but not in an aggressive way. And they said it sounds like depersonalisation or derealisation. I looked it up. 

That is me. I have always felt detached. Like distant. An observer. I always referred to myself as “the observer”. Like I’m watching the world and not really a part of it. 

Also I never really know who I am. Everyone I pretend to be in the world is just made up in the moment. I know there are patterns of behavior and thought I repeat but I don’t feel attached to them. I can make myself anyone I want to be. 

I’ve never had any serious trauma or anything but I do get a lot of migraine without headaches. Just the aura. I wonder if it’s some neurological thing related to that. 

I’ve never been able to connect with anyone emotionally really. Not even my family. I just feel so detached from everyone and it’s so easy for me to just forget them. 

I have always had really strong sensation seeking drives. I need intensity to break through the veil and feel anything. I love anger and meditating on death because it’s something I can just about touch. 

I don’t really find it a problem. Like it’s associated with some negative feelings but also a great sense of superiority and specialness that I enjoy and I generally enjoy the aesthetic of detachedness and I’ve long since built as much identity as I have on being “the observer” and not part of the world.

71,"Throwaway account btw...

So I used to work for a company which we shall call ABC. ABC was a really small company composed only of less than 40 people and most of the employees have been there for decades. It was like a family, really I was there for 6 and a half years while former colleague whom we shall call Shiela is still there going on 10 or 11 years. 

Shiela was nice to me. She was a friend and I could come to her for advice. One thing I noticed though was that Shiela had a tendency to pass on her duties to me under the pretense that she was just asking for help. I didn't mind initially but would occasionally get a little bit annoyed especially when I had lots of things to do myself. Sometimes, she would even take credit for my work.

Over the years, some colleagues would come up to me to warn me about Shiela's behaviors. The most common description they had of her was that she was ""two-faced"". I brushed off those comments and would just smile at them. 

My closest colleague was somebody we will call Joanna. She became one of my best personal friends and I will even be a bridesmaid at her upcoming wedding. She left ABC about two years ago to work abroad. Before she left, she had the same comment about Shiela. She refused to elaborate while she was still rendering her two weeks' notice but let it all out after she got her last paycheck. Apparently, Shiela has been badmouthing management and spreading nasty rumors about them. Some of those rumors were even about me. Of course, I could not believe it. Joanna didn't force me to believe her but did encourage me to observe for myself.

This year was particularly the year that I started to see Shiela's cracks. She's not very good at the administrative parts of the job so she pawns it off to people. When management announced that she and I were both up for the same promotion, I noticed she became more critical of my work. There was one time that one of my staff made a mistake and instead of telling me first, she went straight to our manager. She doesn't know where the files for her own team are and keeps on commanding me to look for or create them even though I have my own team to manage. She is always late in updating her weekly reports which also causes me to be late in sending the collated files to our manager. The one time I was late in updating my report, she proceeded on sending me a message reminding me of the timeline and my responsibilities! Mind you we are on the same level!

Despite being up for promotion, I decided to leave ABC for a great many reasons but one of them was Shiela's behaviors towards me. After I informed management that I was leaving, I assumed that Shiela will automatically get the promotion. She did not. Management decided to merge two departments and have the manager from the other department head up the newly merged department. I knew this was eating Shiela up but she denied it and said she was okay with not being promoted.

I would have believed that had she not been poisoning our colleagues against the new manager. Since the manager was new to our department, I agreed to stay on for four more months to help with the transition. This allowed me to observe firsthand how Shiela talked shit about the new manager saying that the only reason she got the job is because she was friends with the company director and that there was nowhere else to put her. We had a lot of young people on our team and Shiela would ask us to go out to lunch and then she would continue talking shit about the manager.

She also manipulated me into thinking that management was manipulating me. There was an issue with another employee and Shiela convinced me that management was colluding to get that employee fired. I am so ashamed to admit that I believed her though I doubted once or twice if management really was capable of doing that. The managers of ABC are great mentors of mine and I just couldn't believe they could do that. Shiela then proceeded on telling me that I don't know the true colors of the people in management and that they were just praising my work and skills so they could continue to use me. That really hurt my feelings as I put my heart and sould into ABC. 

Management eventually got wind that Shiela and I know the issue about this employee. They explained things which clarified a lot of concerns to me. It also showed me that Shiela was a trash talker who manipulated me into hating management. 

Since then I generally avoided her but that wasn't much since I still had to work closely with her. I still see and hear her talking smack about our new manager which the young team members are eating up. They believe her to be the hero who is defending them against nasty management people. But the thing is, Shiela also talks about them behind their backs! 

Shiela's behaviors caused me to feel that I was gaslighted. Maybe I'm using the term wrong but I felt like I was insane for months. I keep questioning if I was going crazy because I didn't know who else to believe. I couldn't think for myself and I was constantly crying myself to sleep which worried my partner who offered to take me to a psychiatrist. I was regretting staying when I should have left months ago.

I eventually left and got some peace of mind. I returned to the office some weeks later to retrieve some of my stuff only to observe that the team isn't progressing that much. The staff are incompliant with the new manager and it's all because Shiela has been poisoning them. I encouraged them to help the new manager and to not be afraid to talk to her if they had any concerns.

While I was getting my stuff, the manager asked if I could spare an hour or so to talk. Apparently, my friend Joanna who was home for the holidays stopped by just days ago. Since leaving, she had also become good friends with the manager so they met for a bit of chat. Joanna mentioned Shiela's behaviors towards her when she was still working there and also informed the manager of how Shiela treated me these past few months. I had been telling these to Joanna as I had no one else to lean on. 

The manager wanted to speak to me to verify what Joanna said. I pride myself on being honest and I truly believed that management deserved to know what was going on since the team is not going to progress if Shiela keeps poisoning the staff. So I did. I told the manager everything she needed to know.

Fast forward to a week and Shiela has been sending me text messages asking what she had done to me to deserve this. She accused me of going to the office when she was not around so I could slander her to management. She claimed she couldn't believe I would do that to her since we were 'friends'. I did not reply and proceeded on blocking her number. I messaged the manager to ask what was going on. Apparently, she spoke to Shiela but did not mentione mine or Joanna's names. How Shiela found out is still a mystery to me.

The peace of mind I was enjoying is now gone. I am once again sleepless, anxious, upset, and crying at all times. Part of me feels guilty for ratting her out but a part of me is saying I did the right thing. Part of me also regrets telling management since it was no longer my business anyway but a part of me is arguing the opposite.

I informed the manager that Shiela has been texting me. She said I should just ignore her but to please report it to the authorities once she becomes threatening.",19Jan2020,1
72,"Hello everyone! I'm open asexual. So you can ask anything you wanna know about this orientation (yes, anything. Feel free ;)) I won't count any of the questions as something rude (it's the internet, btw. So feel free to get new information) I'll answer as soon as possible",19Jan2020,1
73,"TL:DR - I am lonely and I’m okay with it because I feel like my true friends will come into my life when I need them. So for right now I will work on myself.


I would consider myself an extrovert. I like to hang out with people, converse, and do things together. My issue is that I don’t really have anyone to do that with.

My friends from Highschool, who I thought I was close with, formed their own friend group when I went to college (5+ hours away). I hung out with them a few times over Christmas but did not receive an invitation to hang out with the big group unless I asked one of them to hang out.

I have some friends from my first year of college but they all live 1.5 hours away from me. Too far to drive during the week. During the weekends I tend to go back to my college and hang out with them, but only if something big is going on (I hate driving because of a wreck I got in).

My roommate is an introvert. We don’t spend a ton of time together. I occasionally try to hang out with him but he’s usually in his room and doesn’t want to hang out. So he’s off the list.

Of all my friends, none of them are true friends. No one checks in on me. No one texts me. No one calls me. You name it. I Snapchat a few friends but I’m not really big on social media.

I live in a small town where I know nobody (and there is quite nobody to know). I’m not old enough to go to bars. I don’t have a gf. The activities that are local to this area don’t interest me (for example: kayaking). And I’m not currently in college because of my internship. I don’t really approach people when I’m out because the only times I go out is to get gas, get my groceries, and go to work.

So there’s where my loneliness stems from. I know it’ll get better when I’m back at school. It’s just I want these things NOW. 

I’ve had a ton of alone time here, so I use this time to improve myself. I’m incredibly self conscious about if I’m being self-centered so I’ve been working on that. I try to be positive. I started working out and meditating more that I used to. 

And to be honest, being alone has drastically changed me. I used to give two shits about if people liked me or not... probably because I was constantly surrounded by people. Now that I’m alone, I actually care about how I act and how I treat others.

I’m starting to become comfortable with being alone. It’s certainly a slow process, but I’ve had less of an urge to surround myself with fake people. I know that my real, true friends will come into my life at the right time. For now, I will continue to work on myself. I still have several months left on my internship so I have PLENTY of time to improve.

Thanks for taking the time to read about my loneliness.

I didn't know what genre of that game would be, as that was not decided in that time, and I was expecting that I would be asked to make some digital songs as I used to, but no.

I don’t know what to do. I’m writing this to place all my thoughts in writing to try and process everything. My dad is dying from a rare blood cancer and we don’t know how long he has to live. I want to spend time with him because I am his only son, but I work 40 hours a week and his sleep schedule is irregular. He goes to bed about 6-7am and wakes up in the afternoon or sometimes not until I get home from work. A lot falls onto my mom because my dad is disabled and cannot do much. Our house is severely cluttered with papers, medical bills, and things that it’s overwhelming.  To make matters worse things just keep breaking or the house keeps causing more problems. Our driveway wall collapsed, we’ve had pipes burst in the basement ceiling, our furnace died, it’s always something and that means more money spent on the house like a never ending void. Ideally we need to sell the house and downsize my parents into a smaller place with little to no maintenance before my dads cancer progresses. My dad is trialing a new cancer drug this month, but I don’t know how long insurance will pay for a $25,000 a month drug. I don’t know what to do. I do what I can around the house, but it never seems to get closer to where we need to be. I’m worried my father will pass away in this cluttered house when he should have some peace and happiness while he still can. I feel guilty when I go out to hang with my friends even if it’s just once a week. I don’t know what I can do except just watch tv and movies with him since he’s too sick to ever leave his chair. These are my thoughts surrounding my life and those I love.

88,"Sorry for the terrible writing, I'm just on the edge of crying as I'm writing this (this isn't my main account)

I turn 15 today, and I already feel like my whole life has collapsed, almost nobody wished me a happy birthday, I don't care about someone telling me ""happy birthday"" or throwing big birthday parties, but I feel sad about the idea that nobody cares enough about me to remember me, the only people who said these 2 simple words are my parents, and they would've forgot if I hadn't hinted that it's my birthday.

But I think I should've expected that since I've never had any real friends since I was about 9 years old, it just destroys me that nobody will be affected negatively at all if I never existed, I literally never went out with anyone and I always get left out of all plans, and I end up having to keep on pushing till I get accepted to whatever activity people who I call ""friends"" to make myself feel better are doing, and even though I feel like I don't fit with them the whole time, it's better than seeing their pictures and how much fun they had while I was alone.

I probably seem very extra sensitive in this post, which I may be, but as I said, the idea of my birthday is something I couldn't care less for, but it's just the day of the year where I start remembering how many times I felt like anyone cared about me, the number is always 0.

I’m 25 years old finishing up my final year of college and my mom is 64. My mom has always been a good mom and I love her for most part except when we get into our fights. I know fighting with parents are normal for young adults but the way my mom handles things and over reacts turns into a 3rd war in our house. 
  Today, we got into a bad argument when my mom offered to clean my backpack for me so I could get a fresh start for the new year. I had some stuff still in my backpack so I wanted to put it in my room before I went downstairs. My mom being impatient asks me why I’m going in my room and I tell her it’s going to take 2 seconds. (I should have explained that I was putting stuff from my backpack quickly in there) as I’m coming down head down stairs my mom is yelling at me to come down. I tell her I’m literally down the stairs. Then, she starts complaining that I made her wait for a few seconds and she came downstairs so she could help me clean my backpack. I told her I took 2 seconds and that she could have waited for 2 seconds and I would have come down. My mom says I should have come down when she’s downstairs since she offered to clean my backpack for me. My dad starts to come downstairs because he hears us yelling at each other. Then my mom is yelling at me repeatedly to not argue with her about this, and then complains my dad that I should have said thank you for cleaning my backpack I appreciate it. 
  Every argument we have, usually my mom is add more fuel to the fire, itching to get the last word, and even if she’s also in the wrong for how she reacts she never apologizes it’s always me who has to apologize. Even my dad thought there was a communication issue that could have prevented the whole thing he still feels like my mom over reacted, he’s aware that having my mom apologize is going to be impossible.

They entered the wire with multiple amputees and gunshot wounds. There was this one particular young man that caught my attention. 

Three men were carrying him and both of his legs were gone. They were covered in his blood and his dark Afghan complexion was almost grey. 

They took him to our medical area where my corpsman proceeded to try and save his life. His friends stood feet away from me curled up crying like children. I waited.

My corpsman comes down and I ask if he made it. He says no. I said “fuck him”. In my head it just made sense at the time. Better him than someone I know.
