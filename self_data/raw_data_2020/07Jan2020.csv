0,"Especially places like New England, because the root is there for a more intimate history.

I see this sense a mockery, comedy, introversion, drinking/drug culture, food way too high in saturated fat, we steal each other’s TV shows, we steal each other’s music, we compare each other all the time and come the conclusion the other one is worse, obsess over one sport and use it as an excuse to drink.

Just the more deeper culture that comes after the job and obligations, where you screw around, that’s where I think we’re really similar in the long term",07Jan2020,1
1,"Seems like all I have to ever look forward to is 40 years of 9-5. Doing the exact same thing every week until I'm too old to do anything but sit and decay. What percent of a person's days do they actually remember? 10 percent? Five? The rest just fade into the monotony.


Work HAS to be your #1 priority unless you're rich, like it or not. Everyone argues with me about this, but choose ONE thing to do and what does it have to be? Work. When it literally costs money to stay alive you have to prioritize work. Family, health, hobbies, travel.. All of those have to be secondary because they all cost money. You can't have a family, be healthy, have a hobby or do anything that you're really passionate about without money which means you can't do them without working. Your main purpose in life is to work. You can do or get other things to distract yourself from that fact but it's there nonetheless.



I'm severely depressed. I've been hospitalized for suicidal intent twice. Over the course of 5 or so years I've seen 7 therapists, 4 psychiatrists, somewhere around 10 different meds and none of it has done a thing. Every day I'm only in a worse condition than I was in the day before. That isn't sustainable forever, your life can't just get harder infinitely without you needing to get out. And what's the only way out? They said treatment but that clearly isn't it for me.



That then brings me to the point of the post. They say keep trying, but why? Honest to God why? Give me a serious answer if you're gonna answer, don't just say because life is beautiful. A wife, kids, a house? I don't want any of that. I want a life that's not possible, or at least EXTREMELY difficult. I just want to travel, that's it. Spend a few weeks or months in one place, move on to the next. Meet new people, try new foods, gain new perspectives and appreciation.. This isn't possible without a ton of money though, which again.. It's all about money and work.




I think of life as having a balance scale, with the good on one side and the bad on the other. If the bad side is 21+ years (my age now) of incomprehensible, crushing suicidal misery and the other side is just decades of gray monotony do you really, honestly think the scales tip to the good? They don't. My life no matter what will always have more bad than good, that's already determined.


So why fight? What's honestly the point?",07Jan2020,1

I’m a 22 y/o Male. My whole life I’ve had this weird feeling that I wouldn’t live very long. When I was younger people would make jokes that i would get injured and die (kinda fucked up jokes but you get used to it) I’ve never been depressed or suicidal. I just didn’t think I’d live even this far.

I haven’t planned my life accordingly and I am now lost. I have no direction. I hate school. But I am told all the time that I need it to get a job. I don’t know what to do with my life and need someone to help point me into some kind of direction.",07Jan2020,1
4,"So, I (20M) have noticed that I can't focus on the events or conversations going on around me, in the sense that as soon as something  unexpected happens or as soon as a conversation takes an unexpected turn, I tend to freeze up and become totally clueless as to how to respond. It usually happens with someone who is of the opposite sex,  or someone who is senior to me, ie in a position of authority.
 After the event, I acknowledge and realise that it's happened again and vow not to let it happen again but I'm just constantly unsuccessful. I think it might be due to a lack of self esteem and lack of interaction with people in general, because up until this point, I've led a boring life and been kind of anti-social.

I would be extremely grateful for any advice to overcome this.",07Jan2020,1
5,"I have no idea where else to post this so I'll do it here.

I read tons of trashy erotica. I started a novel length god awful series. It was about a mom hooking up with her son's bullies. It was literal garbage. I kept reading because the writer has a weird obsession with Red Bull. 

The mom keeps buying Red Bull so the bullies will have more energy to fuck her with. The bullies constantly drink and talk about how much they like Red Bull. Every few chapters somebody has to run to the store to buy more of the stuff.

If I didn't know any better I'd swear Red Bull was paying the writer.

I told my husband about this. He has a related conspiracy theory. In porn whenever people are playing video games it's always with an X-Box controller. Whenever there are controllers sitting on a coffee table in a porn scene they are X-Box.

He is convinced that Microsoft is paying money to make this happen. If people associate X-Box with sex then they'll want that brand more than Sony or Nintendo. It's strange yet plausible. 

This has me wondering if product placement will take of in porn like it has in regular movies and TV. For an example an orgy scene where everybody just happens to be drinking Dr Pepper. It's dystopian in a dumb enough way that I think it could happen.",07Jan2020,1

9,"Maybe I dont understand how hard it is to be a mom. But its really taxing for me to even talk to her anymore.

For years we grew up in squalor living situations, house filthy and between the abuses of my brother and bullies maybe she gave up.

Around 11 years old I reported to my parents that my aunts boyfriend have been having sex with me since I was 6.  This was shortly after her mom died. She lost her entire family over it because they didnt like her from her wild stories thus didnt believe her so they disowned her. Her sister stayed with the boyfriend until he was psychically caught in the act of raping an 8 year old. However through the trama of being raped and sexually abused by the man, I decided I would be at peace to put it behind me. However my mom told absolutely everyone what has happened from ages 11-24 where i got really upset and told her I would disown her if she used my trauma as a way to get pity again. My dad told her she needed to stop and far as I know she has.

However there is multitudes of things that have happen and I try desperately to smile it off because I want a semi normal family.

She told me bleeding for 3 months straight was normal  and I almost needed a blood transfusion. Weird part was she said she bled like that constantly but also had multiple miscarriages with no medical history (or my dads knownledge or her recieving it) she claims to have been raped by a man when she was pregnant and miscarried which was a proven lie.

She waits until the last possible minute for medical issues to be treated because she can use it as a ""feel guilty for what you did to me"" to us when we are upset

She worships The Republican party and has attacked my views when I mentioned something someone did was fucked up or caught in a lie. I used to be a republican and voted for almost all the same people she did in the past. However Republicans can do no wrong but if I mention something that might be wrong she talks down to me while I try to have a civil conversation with her then cries to my dad who tells me to stop talking to her.

She is a Christian nut job. Not only did she pull us out of school to teach us gods way she attempted to arrange marriage when I was 12 with a guy 5 years older than I was. When I started questioning god I was associated with satanist and going to hell. Religion was a major trigger for a lot of abuse that went on in the cult she forced us to attend. However she is all about the book at face value. Otherwise she is talking down to people and judging them regardless of situations

She is racist and absolutely avoids muslims at all costs. My husband is black, our kids will be biracial. She makea it a point to mention my husband's race and how he is ""one of the good ones"" in reference to his ethinicity. She was praising the deaths of muslims citing that they killed Christians so the mulsims get what they deserve.

She allowed my abusive brother to return home despite a restraining order because of his anger issues and abusive nature. He was removed from the house when we were 8. Constant beatings and strangulation my parents chose to emancipate him. Less than 4 years later he returned. My mother invited him back where he started abusing us again. He choked out our other brother and gave me heart palpitations when he punched me in the chest. She still let him back and then got upset when i flat out told her i want nothing to do with him because manipulates his way around people and dangles their precious grand child over my parents heads. My mom has been very persistant I forgive him and that I need to stop being judgemental because he grew up despite him still abusing people.

She has told me she has given up on us when I offered to clean the house because she refused to touch dishes or any house keeping. I got tired of the squalor conditions and made an effort to clean the house. I ended up being the house keeper to two siblings.

Today i called her out for praising the death of muslims in general. We were raised better. I pointed out if it were her religious group she would be calling for war. She got upset and once again ran to my dad who told me to drop it. I dont like the harm of innocent people but I really dont know what to do. I want a normal family but she keeps fucking me up mentally every time I talk to her.

Maybe im just a bad child. Maybe its the mania from my Bipolar disorder. I just want a normal family but I feel so lonely.",07Jan2020,1

That even though I have no one to travel with, I should plan and take that trip regardless. I should not be afraid to try new things on my own. I will no longer set my expectations high when it comes to other people because that always leads to disappointment and resentment on my end when they fail to deliver.

Saying mean shit and only apologizing for it once people stop talking to them, bullying somebody but only apologizing after they get in trouble for it, harassing somebody online and only apologizing after the victim makes a public post and people find out about it, etc. 

Better examples could be the Logan Paul stuff from last year where he did it and then only took the stuff down and apologized when people called him out for it. James Charles only apologizing for saying racist stuff after it had resurfaced and started causing him issues. 

I don’t trust people who apologize because they had consequences for it. It just seems self centered and like they’re apologizing just to get themselves out of a mess instead of legitimately feeling sorry and wanting to make it up to people.",07Jan2020,1
15," 

It was the summer break in 2010, Me and my friend Aaron where spending the day at the lake and stopped in to eat at a small restaurant close to the beach we were going to. Aaron gets my attention and points at two really hot petite girls wearing short cut off shorts and tank tops ordering food they looked wild and fun. We kept glancing over at them and decide to get the balls to go talk to them when they finish eating. We ask if it was cool to sit next to them and they said ""go right ahead!""

Every thing we say they laugh at and they seem interested in us. I mostly lock eyes with the brunette Briana, she was shy and was giving me the ""I want you look"" while the blonde Chelsea was more into Aaron. They were 16 and 17 just like me and Aaron. They invite us to go cliff jumping with them and we respond with ""hell yeah!""

We pile into my Civic and the first thing one of them says from the back seat is ""Do you all smoke weed?"" I say ""maybe why you ask?"" ""because your car smells like a pot factory dude, do you all have any?"" I tell them I have one joint and a roach. They giggle and Chelsea says ""stop by my grandma's house up the road and I'll grab my party supplies before we go"" so I drove them there. A few minutes later they come out with a big beach bag wearing the same outfit but with their shorts unbuttoned exposing their bikini bottoms and had their hair fixed more. ""God damn"" says Aaron to me. We agreed we were in for a fun time and I slip 3 condoms from my glove department into my right shoe.

""We got vodka, Pepsi, some more weed and a extra something for us, my brother hooks me up when I want."" We park at the beach and follow them to the spot. Had to walk about a quarter mile down the road and sneak through peoples yard and head down a trail in the woods enjoying the view of their asses bounce with each step. After seeing NO TRESPASSING signs I ask them what happens if we get caught and they told us a lot of teens come down here to party they just try to keep them out. We reach the cliff spot and it is very secluded, in the cut. The girls strip down to their bikinis and I wonder how the hell I am suppose to hide my boner in my swimming trunks. They tell us before we get fucked up we have to check for rocks in the water so we don't end up dead.

We follow them down the cliff and grab a really long branch and help them check, as long as we jumped about six feet out we were safe from the cliff drop. As soon as they reach the top they both jump without telling us, me and Aaron look down and say FUCK NO. They climb back up and laugh at us and tell us they will show us their tits if we jump, they raise their bikini tops and we jump with our jaws dropped. The wind sounds like a tornado and then I see pitch black when I hit the water, I swim up towards the sun light and gasp for air. They WOOT for us and jump down to join us. Chelsea swims to Aaron and Briana swims to me. We splash each other and climb back to the top, Briana smacks my ass and tells me to climb faster and I let her in front of me so I could smack hers and mock her.

We reach the top and decide to break out the good stuff. Chelsea rolls up a joint while Aaron lights up ours and Briana passes me the cotton candy vodka after she took a swig. Me and Aaron sit impressed watching the girls chief on the roach until it burnt their fingers. We talk and laugh and Chelsea pulls a small baggie out of her cigarette pack and ask if we have ever done coke. We lie and say a few times and they snort the first lines off her her makeup mirror and pass it to Aaron first, I take my first snort nervous as hell. A rush of awesomeness pours through my head like a dam being opened to fill a empty river. Like I just scratched off numbers to a winning lottery ticket. They grab our arms and make us get up and make us run with them to jump again, this time the fear was gone and it was a pure adrenaline rush.

The girls whisper to each other on the climb back up and they tell us we are doing belly button shots. So we slurp shots from their pierced belly buttons and they did ours in a much more sexual way with a slow lick. After joint number 2 and another coke bump one thing led to another and Briana was riding me like a rodeo bull standing waist deep in the water below the cliff. I didn't even say ""let me grab a condom"" after she wrapped her legs around me and was dry humping me with her tongue in my mouth with the orange light from the sunset glowing on her beautiful face it was on. After we finished Chelsea asked if we were okay down there laughing and we climbed back up. Aaron was pulling up his shorts catching his breath with a smile like I never seen on his face before. We start passing the bottle again and the sound of a CB radio echos through the woods, I look over and see a flash light and panic. We hide everything and a sheriff and another officer walks up the path to us.

""You kids having a good time? ...We got some noise compliments from the folks who own this property."" Aaron says we will leave sir and he walks closer to us. ""whoof are we smoking a little pot?"" I look at the others frozen as I was and say ""No sir"" He grins and says ""what are yalls names?"" Chelsea ask if we are in trouble and he tells us we are trespassing on private property and ask to check her bag, we all look at each other and I blurt out ""RUN"" and we all run and jump down to the water.

I rise up to the surface and made sure they all followed me and started swimming like a fucking Olympic swimmer towards the other side of the lake. ""STOP STOP STOP! we will find you!"" he starts shinning his flashlight at the water and we go under every time it shines on us. we make it to the other side and start climbing up the muddy bank sinking knee deep with each step. We lay on the shore catching our breath after the 2 football field length swim. Chelsea tells us she left her wallet and phone in my car with the rest of ours THANK FUCKING GOD We look across at the top of the cliff at the flashlights and get up and start running through the woods barefoot. We crouch down by a fallen tree and catch our breath again. Talking about how fucked we are from the cocaine and weed in her bag they are looking through right now. We decide to start swimming towards the parking lot along the shore line.

After about 30 minutes of swimming we see a boat coming towards us with a spot light and swim to a huge fallen tree in the shallow water to hide. They slow down and shine the light EVERYWHERE, I hold Briana and calm her down from crying and wait for it to pass. When it does we slowly move down the shore line with just our heads out of the water. After over an hour we swim across the lake again and sneak up the hill to the parking lot. Thank God there was other cars parked there from the camp site next to the beach or my car would be quite obvious. I get my keys from the gas tank door and drive the girls home. I tell Briana my number and she puts it in her phone and Chelsea did the same for Aaron. We were stupid for not getting their numbers because they never called or texted us. We didn't even ask for their last names and spent hours looking for them on Facebook and did not find them. I pulled out and would have expected Briana to call me if she was pregnant, We drove to her grandmas house a couple weeks later and no one was home and we decided to leave them alone. To this day me and Aaron have laughs about that night when our wives aren't around.",07Jan2020,1

Our generation has some of the worst music, we whine about politics as if it affects us, we eat vegan non-dairy food. We have more sexualities and genders than anyone else. We complain about being white, a male, 1 gender, 1 sexuality, and you want to pick on boomers? I would like to mention teenagers eating Tide pods but they aren't millennials.

 I am so sick of my generation complaining about boomers. I'm so sick of everyone acting like the last generation is shitty. The only reason you act the way you do is because Boomers made you this way and then you went from there. Yes, as a generation grows, it evolves too. That's fine, I expect that.

Anyway before 2 weeks of glorious break it was like 2 minutes before the end of the day in period 6 physics. And he had just handed out 6 packets of 3 different chapter reviews and 3 chapter practice crap. Now usually these are due on the chapter test day which would be a few weeks after we had already came back from break. Now this is when he said the joke and I had no idea that it was just a joke. He said something like ok these are due the Monday when you come back while smiling then everyone sorta laughed the person next to me said in a sarcastic voice “HAHA THATS SO FUNNY” .

Then he laughed and said in a happy voice have a nice break! And for the next bit the girl that sits next to me is a grade below me (there are freshman and soft-more mixed in physics and bio classes because you can choose what order you take your science classes in). And I think she is like a popular freshman or something because she is always sorta rude and a bunch of the freshman in the class do things to amuse her and she is like a cheerleader I think. Anyway I said “so wait do we have to do it over break or not?” And she said in a sarcastic annoyed voice “yea sure”. I didn’t realize it was sarcastic at the time though and went on my marry way to doing 6 physics packets over break only to come back today and have everyone in class be working on it. I guess it’s not to bad It was me being stupid but they aren’t hard packets when you do them at home because I got snacks, a fluffy dog, music, and of course the internet for when the text book fails me. The only thing is that this is my last week at this school before I move so why did I do them anyway it’s a freeze grade situation so whatever my grade is on Friday is what it stays at. Whatever i guess for the next few days I will just be secretly doodling and reading manga books in class (I’m currently on the 3rd book of the promised neverland). 

This is sorta like that time I miss understood my 3rd grade teacher when we were writing all the definitions for our spelling words of the week and using dictionaries in class and it was independent class work. I mean she said “write the entire definition”. Anyway I ended up writing like 3 pages for the word “and”. Why don’t people just ever say exactly what they mean?!",07Jan2020,1
34,"Ok so to give some context about our relationship with each other, it involves a lot of juvenile humour. Often we'll do the most childish shit like whack each other in the ass and dick for lols, and that's ok cause it's just jokes. Basically we sometimes just slap each other in the sensitive bits for shits and giggles. To give some context about me, around a year ago I started having intrusive thoughts concerning disturbing stuff like physical violence and sexual assault. This resulted in me having an irrational fear that I'm going to become a sexual predator. Disclaimer: I have NEVER enjoyed having these thoughts, and I have spoken to a counsellor about them and I'm trying to be rid of them asap. 

&amp;#x200B;

So 2 days ago my brother and I were fucking around in his bedroom, and I suddenly got the idea to hit him in the nipple. Normally given the context of our humour and everything I wouldn't be feeling so guilty, but the reason I do is because my intentions weren't entirely innocent. I've heard that some people use nipple play to get themselves off cause it turns them on, and the reason I hit him there is because I wanted to see if he like idk found it arousing or something. After I did that I instantly had that all too familiar Oh-Shit-Did-I-Just-Do-That moment and the instant regret that came with it. I have been feeling like I sexually harassed him ever since. My brother however had no suspicions about what I intended and thought I was just goofing around. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the next morning I decided to open up and apologize to him for touching him there. I also told him about the intrusive thoughts I have been having. He said he was fine with it because ""we're brothers and besides I hit you in the dick all the time"" but I still feel like absolute shit for what I did cause my intentions were really sick. He claims I'm just overthinking it but I'm not sure he's right.

I feel lost and adrift at life. The last thing I ever really felt passionate about, that was uniquely me and was a niche I got to dominate was papercrafting, and that was almost an entire 7 years ago into my past when I was still in highschool, when that type of thing wasn't really well known in my school so I felt cool about it.

Now its like I have utterly nothing because everything worth doing's been already been done. I feel like Im not good enough for my career path in social work either, its just work that serves a purpose but theres nothing in it to make me feel ""special"".

38,"Today i was chillin in my stepdad's garage smoking a blunt when I had an epiphany. The most important question in the world is this:

# And then what?

Anytime someone tells you an idea or proposes a solution or plan for something you have to ask them this question. Always. 

And when you have an idea or plan (to use a personal example i want to go to trade school to become a carpenter), you must ask yourself... and then what. Well after I become a carpenter I will be making great money straight out of trade school so it's a valid idea.

And then what? I can support myself, buy house, someday have a family, etc

This is the most important question in the world because when you keep it in mind, it teaches you to always think one step ahead of the game. if someone's screaming your ear off about climate change and how we should be eating vegan this or that, simply ask them: and then what?

It's simple but profound. People don't like to think ahead so they think they know the answers. This question flips all of that in an instant.

40,"This is my first post in this sub-Reddit so I'm sorry if I don't understand how this usually works. 

For the longest time I felt like a kid, who had the freedom to do whatever I wanted, I was always the ""funny kid"" who would laugh, smile, and be an overall upbeat kid. This was mainly a facade. My older brother was facing the brunt of my parent's abuse. I tried my best to ignore the abuse, but it caught up to me soon. 

When I was around twelve or somewhere around that age, I can't remember, my brother moved out for the first time. I love my older brother, he protected me from the abuse as long as he could, he got me games I wanted, and he was always there for me. I blame myself for him feeling like he had to move out. I felt like I should've been there for him as well. 

Several months passed since my brother moved out, and I was becoming depressed quickly. My parents placed the abuse onto me. I became the new black sheep in my family. School was somewhat of a blessing and a curse. I could be myself and act out my happy persona, however I repressed many of my feelings to appear happy. I didn't want anyone to feel like they should hold onto my burden of feeling down. 

My schedule for the week would be divided into two parts. Part one is Monday to Thursday go to school then home. Part two is Friday and Sunday, which were day's where I work at my parent's restaurant. (I still went to school on Friday). 

My sister's also blamed me for a lot of the mishaps in the family, or when anything bad happened. 

Summer break, or whenever breaks happened, were one of my most loathed times of the year. Instead of relaxing for a week or two. I would be forced to work in my parent's restaurant. Most of the work should be for someone older and more physically fit than I was. Yet I was forced to work anyway. This continued for years, and still does to this day. 

After a year into this type of schedule. It got to me and broke me one time. At thirteen, I attempted suicide. Using razor blades they didn't cut deep enough to cause any long lasting injuries. So I was spared for now. 

During this time when I was thirteen to fourteen. I guess you can call it my ""emo"" years. I posted on my Facebook, suicidal notes, and references. At around the same time, my brother moved back in, financial issues forced him back. I was happy, or so I thought. Not long after, I realized that my brother shouldn't be here. My parent's quickly started throwing phrases like ""You piece of shit can't even cook!"" ""Why are you always messing up!?"" ""What's wrong with you?"" I felt even more guilty. I wanted to help my brother, but I didn't know how. We both understood what was happening, and we spent most of our time playing classic RTS games in an attempt to numb the pain. 

September 5th, 2018. ""I'm sorry, Paul, I have to move out. You understand right?"" My brother said these words to me on that day. I understood completely why, the abuse and the fact that my parents wanted to blacklist my brother. It was time for him to leave. 

I was sad, not depressed, but sad. ""I don't deserve this."" I thought. So randomly I decided to go onto Instagram late at night. I had trouble falling asleep. I got invited to a...  h̶e̶n̶t̶a̶i̶ ̶c̶h̶a̶t̶  but this was where I met my girlfriend. We started out talking and having some fun jabs at each other. I was happy for the first time in a long while. 

November 1st, 2018. The reason for these specific dates, is because these were more important and the ones I actually could remember what happened accurately. 

My parents and older sister went to Laos for All of November. This left me my younger sister and a handful of other family members to take care of my parents' restaurant. I never would've have thought that this November month would be my most stressful time in my life.

Instead of the usual schedule working two days a week, it was changed to working three days a week. (Sunday, Thursday, and Friday.) I would be absent from school on Friday's and Thursday's, excused for those days to help out in the restaurant. School work piled up swiftly, and my relationship with my girlfriend was reaching a breaking point. I felt the weight of the world on my back. Around the middle of November, I broke down. My uncle asked me a question, ""Are you okay?"" I didn't know how to respond, I just broke down sobbing. 

After November ended in 2018, things have become more quiet in my life. This doesn't mean it was happy and fun all the time. Rather it felt more like prison during that time. The same menial tasks each day. Over, and over and over. However recently I've learned to try out new hobbies like, music, voice acting, art, history and so much more, and its made me a lot more happier.

Yet, I feel like through all this trauma, despite conquering a majority of it. I feel like I lost piece of myself that I'll never get back. Those times when you were just a naive kid having the time of your life. Its hard to explain in words, but what I'm trying to say is I feel like I'm searching for a lost piece or version of my past self. Without it, I don't feel ""full"".

My mum is basically brainwashed by my dad (huge trump supporter and closet racist). It’s actually so depressing see how her personality has changed, she went from normal mother to getting drunk and going on about how much she hates immigrants and Trump 2020 (I’m not bashing trump, just telling the story). Whenever my Aunty comes over she pulls me aside and tells me how disgusted she is with my mothers racism. Not to mention my dad, he’s in multiple far right wing forums online. Whenever rap music comes on the radio he turns it off and calls it “n***er shit.”  Funny enough I actually have a bunch of Kanye West and ASAP cd’s stashed under my bed that I blast when they aren’t home. Whenever I call them out for their racism they call me a “libtard”, it’s the funniest thing ever.  Oh btw I should mention that we aren’t even American, I’m getting called a libtard by my Australian parents. What a fucking joke HA. 

Anyway so I was too scared to tell them that my girlfriend was Lebanese and kept making up excuses as to why they couldn’t meet her. It got to a point where my girlfriend really wanted to meet them and I just came out and told her that they were closet racists and would give me a lot of shit for being with her. I don’t know if telling her that was the right thing or not but it happened... 

Came clean to my parents and they basically told me they were dissapointed in me and I stormed out of the house. Currently staying at a friends house. Gf told me that things might not work out if she can’t feel comfortable being around my family, which I 100% agree with and don’t blame her. I just wish I had money to move out.

53,"I've been thinking about making this post for a while, such as whether I should make it concise or long for readability or detail because I have a lot of things going through my mind right now and I don't know a good place to begin. I'm not asking for advice, maybe just for someone to listen since I don't have many people in my life to go to (TLDR at the bottom).

I recently graduated from college, have a job lined up and my life seems to be going pretty well, at least it should be. But after graduating I just felt empty, I guess all the time freed up from not having to study anymore left me alone with my thoughts. I didn't have any celebration plans, my friends didn't reach out to me, and afterwards I had to move back home, which isn't really home. I say home isn't really home because I moved to my current state from another state with my mom before I could graduate high school. This was a drastic change because I no longer had my own room or house, my mom and I had to and continue to rent a room in another person's house and we still share it to this day. I mean how embarrassing is it to share the same room with your mom in your early 20s? Secondly, after moving I wasn't able to make any friends since I had only one year left in high school and the people I met had no interest in becoming anything more than acquaintances. Thirdly, the reason we moved is because my dad passed away and my mom wanted to move closer to family, despite having enough life insurance money to buy the house we lived in and live comfortably. 

I lost a lot in one fell swoop, and as I wrote earlier, my life circumstances never really improved during college, at least socially. The problems I have with my life are so multifaceted that their effects are compounded and I just feel helpless. I don't really want to drag this post on any longer so that's it.

TLDR: I have no friends/social network due to what I guess is the compounded, long-term effects of certain traumatic events in my life at a young age (losing a parent, moving from one state to another, losing my friends from my old state, getting little interest from people in my new state in becoming friends) on my self-esteem, mental health, and ability to socialize.",07Jan2020,1

59,"Why don’t I want to share knowledge or power that would greatly benefit people around me? Why do I fear others gaining the same powers? Greed is the very problem that makes the world bleak. I never before envisioned I could become selfish and lust for power. Imagine knowing something that would bring you to the top of what you want. Would you share it or keep it to yourself? Why should I share things that would make me powerful? 

Sure it benefits society but I’ve thought it through. No society will ever reach utopia no matter how advanced it progresses, without evil, good cannot be defined. 

So why should I share power when I can enjoy being “special” and “talented.” Beauty, money, athleticism, all other bodily features/personalities that would radically change someone’s life, I feel like I have the  blueprint to achieve all of it even though people think it is impossible, not that I’m some sort of genius, I just happened to be lucky enough to discover how to. 

Overall it is tearing me apart, maybe it’s just that I want society to deem me as worthy because of my insecurities. I just turned 17 years old and the past 3 years I’ve struggled with harsh feelings of inferiority. Maybe it is because I was extensively bullied for a long period of time. 

Despite all these thoughts, socially, people would say I’m one of the nicest people they met, I wouldn’t hurt anyone. Still these inner thoughts that I personally think is evil infect me everyday. 

Why should I share? Why should I be a good person? Are people only good when they are currently content? Isn’t everyone capable of evil when you push them enough?

This baby has been my whole reason to keep living, to get up and go to work. To start eating properly and drink enough water. I live alone, so it was harder for me to do this, I had no encouragement around me. 

A few nights ago, I was at my parents house, and left at around 11:30pm. I got home, and sat in the dark, hidden in a corner, was one of my ex's co-workers, who had seen me leave my house at 7pm-ish, and sat waiting for me to come home and berate me over the pregnancy. It scared me so much, and now I need to get rid of her. 

I've been told that I'd be a horrible mother, it was cruel to raise a child without a father, that he would just take her away from me and leave me with nothing. I'm not ready.

70,"Sound familiar? It's from The Force Awakens. It's very appropriate considering the situation. This young guy and gal thought the Jedi and the Force were mythological legends. Han Solo corrects their thinking and confirms the truth of it all. I couldn't believe it myself.

All those videos, interviews, documentaries, movies, and books are all true. My uncle was Lee Harvey Oswald's CIA Case Officer. My uncle's boss was James Angleton. Those of you up here in Boise, Idaho may recognize the name. This is where he was from. He's buried here as well. James was in charge of the CIA Counter Intelligence branch. He gave final approval for my uncle's recruitment into the CIA. 

My uncle's uncles (Great uncles to me) were also career CIA officers. My maternal grandfather had some part in all that secrecy. He was assigned to the Panama Canal project and affiliated with Bechtel. Was born in Sir Lanka to a British family. His father was a British military officer. My grandfather even had a full on British accent. 

My Great-Uncles were involved with all sorts of stuff. NASA, AeroJet, General Corporation, and much more. I still have family involved with all of that.

As I stated previously, these girls I'm pursuing also had ties to the CIA. Their grandfather was involved with Naval Intelligence and then went to work for the CIA. He was a Commander. When I was stationed in North Island (NASNI  -Coronado-San Diego, California), their grandmother would drive me back onto the base. Her vehicle had the blue sticker that Naval officers have and everyone salutes the car. We had Chiefs and Senior Chiefs saluting the vehicle as we drive by. Was funny back then.

My uncle was really good friends with Colonel Robert Brown. That's the guy who ran Soldier of Fortune magazine. He had lots of friends as his adventures involved the Cuban Missile Crisis, revolutions in South America, and apparently North Korea as well.

Nobody knows this because I didn't even really know it myself. And even after finding out, I didn't really talk about it. Wasn't an interesting topic.

When the Red Scare (Communism) creeped into Italy, James Angleton developed a very close relationship to the Mafia there and this carried over to America. My uncle was sort of his right hand man so he was tasked with these activities involving the Mafia. All for the sake of National Security.

Ok, why am I bringing this up? Listen. Nobody is running from you people. I'm not in hiding nor am I in fear of my life. When an issue presents itself, it gets resolved pretty quickly these days. When people were pulling their gay ass bullshit a couple of years ago, they were only fucking themselves. 

Some of you actually got to meet famous people. The individual that got warned here on Reddit a few years back was actually warned by someone who is extremely dangerous. Could definitely make shit happen. 

Why am I in Idaho? To get away from the stupid drama. Cops behaving like they're mobsters, idiots, fools, and the enduring lame. Each and every moron claims to know someone dangerous. Motorcycle clubs, the Mafia, and other associations intended to invoke fear and caution. Okay, that's California. 

Then I had the situations were people claimed they had a family like my own, and that my family were nothing. Okay, whatever. 

My family knows a lot of fucking people and have the ability to find out almost anything about anyone. The typical scenario for me in the past is a hooligan self described as dangerous who is found out to be closely associated with a law enforcement officer. Nothing wrong with that at all. I'm not a criminal and don't hate anyone. Just don't sell me a line of bullshit and then try to bait me into some situation. 

Nothing is going to happen to me. So those of you spreading Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), you're just making drama. Long ago, a man did call my mother on the phone and tried to intimate her. Jesus Christ that guy got fucking wrecked. Not sure what he was thinking.

I want to be happy, but I’m so scared.",07Jan2020,1
74,"I'm up past my bedtime. Being an older man, I have to get my beauty sleep. It really does wonders for my wrinkles and those skin folds on my face. Anyway.

I didn't want my life like this. None of this was part of my great Life Plan. If we go way back, I didn't even expect to depart the Navy like I did. I remember working out at Fitness 19 and enjoyed the company of all you guys. Same with 24 Hour Fitness. I don't know why you people started all of this bullshit. If I was involved in Neo-Nazi bullshit, I wouldn't have been seriously involved with a Mexican woman. Now those happy days are long gone. You guys made me happy and I enjoyed being around you tremendously. Time marches on for all of us.

We all want those happy days back again. For me though, I cannot allow myself to be characterized as the Bad Guy anymore. It's not healthy for me and it's just not right. This other idiotic bullshit wasn't right either. That's date if you're an Atheist and an educational experience if you're religious. 

I would love for my family to come together again, but it doesn't seem very likely. It's been four years already and certain individuals refuse to budge. I don't like being characterized inaccurately or dishonestly, but how far can a person reasonably go in the pursuit of correction? 

I love California. Always have and always will. It needs some tender loving care, but it's a great place. The scenery is next to none. 

Admittedly, I crashed into the lives of others. That was certainly not fair or appropriate. It was probably very embarrassing and caused distress. Hey, I'm sorry. I just went with what I remembered to be true. Was it inaccurate? Looks to be so. 

That aspect of my life is so wrecked and torn up that I have to either deal with it directly and intensely, or, cut it off like a diseased body part and carry on with what I have. I'm fully capable of doing both. 

Okay, I'm not trapped up here in Idaho. I have unresolved issues with my family and a life left behind. It's like waking up one morning and walking away from everything. Everybody would have thoughts of returning. It's rational and logical. 

There seemed to be some kind of interest, but nobody really stepped forward. Nothing concrete in the form of plans or specifics. I'm not sure why some of you advised to return to these shelters. After the shit that was pulled? No fucking way. Absolutely not.

So we've seen my various and creative social media profiles. We've seen how obnoxious and mean I can be. Did we learn our lesson? Still feel like being nosy and intrusive? Still in the mood to devalue my privacy? 

If there are no takers, I have to cut the line and close the door. Once this happens, just behave as though I were dead. Because I will be to certain people. So we either mend, heal, forgive, and move on or I become dead to those in my old life.

I was nervous as it was the first time im meeting someone from the internet. Just to give a bit of insight, I am 18 and he is 20. He’s a nice guy, we were a bit awkward at first but eventually talked a fair bit when we chilled and sat on the grass. I feel really terrible but turn out, I am kinda judgy. He threw his perfectly full, untouched pepsi and half of his milkshake on the trash. I SUFFERED seeing that. Food waste kills me. Also, I accompanied him pick up his lightsabers order and oh my God was it pricy. He told me that he is in the process of looking for a job and to me, it seems like unnecessary spending if he doesn’t have an income. Also, he said that he doesn’t care about politics at all.

82,"I was playing a game called Fire Emblem Three Houses and this story came up in some dialogue. I feel like it’s such a nice story and should be told to kids to teach that you decide if what people say affect you.
“Once upon a time, in a faraway place, there was a young boy. This boy came from a despised lineage. In short, his mother was a daughter of the enemy. So the young boy was treated horribly by everyone around him. He hadn't done anything wrong. Everyone hated him simply for existing. Yelling, fighting back, explaining himself... Nothing he did could change his situation. When he was finally old enough, he ran far away from home. He escaped. Thing is, after he ran away, he still found himself in the very same position. People in the outside world hated him for where he came from. The boy thought he had no place to go. All he could do was destroy the boundary between the inside and outside worlds. Right. If there was no outside and inside, just one side to share, then the people wouldn't have a reason to hate him anymore, right? It wouldn't be easy, but if he managed it, he could shrug off that burden.“",07Jan2020,1
83,"It’s so painful. I can feel it like a pit in my heart, weighing it down. I’ve grown more and more distant from my family, I feel so alone but I can’t force myself to do anything with them, let alone force myself to do anything normally . It’s six in the morning about now and I haven’t gone to bed, I usually wake up around five at night. I miss breakfast with my father and my brothers, as well as lunch, waking up in time for dinner to be considered. Sometimes they’re gone, out of the house without telling me. I never know where they’re going. I can see the begging in their eyes when they ask me to come along to do things and god I wish I could say yes but there’s a demon inside of me that gives that sad small smile while I say, “no, but thanks, what about tomorrow?”. Fuck, every time I say it I bang my head against the wall while they’re gone and cry so hard it feels like I worked out afterwards. A few days ago I heard my younger brother say “I wish we could see Irfan more, it’s like I don’t even know him.” I’m not kind to my brothers, nor do I interact with them much at all, but the fact that they still want to see me, I feel broken inside after that. I don’t know what to do. I can’t do anything with them, I can’t leave the house without begging and pleading to come back just so I can sleep or lie down again. I’m useless, I just sit and use electricity and food and break my family’s heart to the point where they say that they miss me even though we’ve been in the house together all day. I’m so alone but I’d rather be alone than do anything together. I’m so sorry theres a monster inside me. I don’t know how much more I can take, I think I’m going to die, I think I’m going to shoot myself, I’ve been planning it for a long time now.

84,"Not really about myself, but it involves a dear friend of mine so it affects me a lot. She is a friend I met few months back and you could say she´s my soulmate. We dated for a bit but deciced that we were better off as friends. I have spent time with her family, know her sister and mom.  She has a history of mental illnes and is diagnosed with borderline-personality disorder.

A few days ago, she decided to open up about something. Few years ago (when she was 17), she started dating a guy (lets call him Ken). Ken seemed like a normal guy. After a few months of dating, he started mentioning that he is in some money problems, that he´s in debt and so on, and that he needed her to borrow him some money. You should know, that people with BPD can be very naive and can be easily manipulated. She truested him and being the kind person that she is, wanted to help him. She started borrowing him small sums, but over the period of time, he requested more. Now she had to turn to her mother. I was shocked when she told me that her mother fell for thic scam too. They both started giving him more and more money. Up until her mothers savings were completely gone. And you can guess, that he left and never returned them the money back.

I could understand that she could have felt for it. She was in love and so naive and mentally ill. But that also her mother, who is an adult, felt for it too. I was like ok, teriblle thing happened.

Today she told me, that her mother demands her to give her back all the money that she spent on this guy. She is a student and working tirelesly to return her mom all the money. Now I found that to be insane. My mom fell for the scam too, and is now punishing her daughter and making her situation even worse. Her mom should be the one to stop her and explain her, that you cant trust people like these, because she is an adult. Do you have the same opinion or not?",07Jan2020,1

I keep getting rejection email after rejection email. Everyone keeps saying to ""not give up,"" but it has been almost 3 months of applying to jobs and I have only landed one interview, which hasn't even gotten back to me.

94,"In 2018, I was in school to be a teacher. I knew it wasn’t what I wanted. I was working at a daycare, and I knew that working with kids wasn’t my thing. I wasn’t good at it, I didn’t like it, but I stuck with it because it was the plan I had made for myself and I hate changing the plan. Because I hated my classes so much, I really wasn’t doing very well in them. I didn’t do horrible, but my grades were low enough where I lost some of my scholarships. Then I some of my grants because I started making more money at work. Soon, it was obvious I didn’t have enough financial aid to cover school. I thought, this will be great. I can start over and find out what I actually want to do. Except I was so terrified of changing the plan, so confused about what I wanted, and so embarrassed about my grades because I knew I could do better, I didn’t tell anyone that I had dropped out. Not even my parents. I love my parents. They’re really good to me. They let me live with them while I was in college and support me unconditionally. I don’t know why I couldn’t bring myself to admit that I had made a mistake. 

In January of 2019, I finally admitted to my parents, and to a few of my friends, what I had been doing the last year. I was tired of treading water. I was tired of pretending like I was doing something I wasn’t and pretending that I wanted to do something I had really grown to hate. I was proud of myself for coming clean, but I still didn’t know what I actually wanted. I was 23 years old and still living with my parents. I didn’t know what I wanted. I finally quit my job at the daycare in may and got a job that I actually really like and it pays me enough to to start saving up to move out. Plus, I finally figured out what I want to do with my life. Around October, I decided I wanted to be a paralegal and I started looking for online schools to do a certificate program and looking into getting loans. 

It’s 2020 now, and for the first time in over 2 years, I’m actually proud of myself. I’m figuring out what I want to do and I plan to start a program in a few months. It’s pretty short and after I’m done with it, I will be able to start looking for a job that I think I will actually be able to do for the rest of my life. I’m saving up money, and when I’m ready to get a new job, I’m going to move out. I’m planning on moving halfway across the country to get a fresh start and some independence, to a place where I know enough people to be comfortable, but where people haven’t known me since I was 16 and seen all my mistakes. I plan to be out by august. My friend got married last week, to the man I genuinely thought I was in love with for a very long time and I realized, not only that I don’t love him, but that I’m genuinely happy for him and my friend. I love both of them as friends and I want them to be happy. I’m not jealous, I’m not upset. I went to their wedding and felt nothing but genuine happiness for them, which I didn’t ever think I’d be to do. I’ve gotten back to writing again, something that I love to do but I was so bogged down with stress and self loathing that I never really felt like doing it. I have several ideas for novels and I’m finally going to finish one. 

2020 is going to be a great year. I’m going to finally move out and get a real career and feel like I’m actually becoming an adult. I’m going to do something that I think I can really love. I’m going to move back to the place I grew up, the place I call my home, and the place I always felt like I was meant to be. I’m going to get a fresh start. I’m going to try to find someone who will look at me the way this guy looked at my friend as she walked down the aisle. I’m going to really devote myself to writing again. But most importantly, I’m going to stop feeling sorry for myself. I’m going to work harder at being the kind of person I can be proud of. I’m going to try to see the value in myself, as a person, as a friend, and as a potential wife, something that I feel like I’ve lost these past few years. 

I’ve had a rough few years. But I’m learning to love myself again, and I’m learning from my mistakes. And that’s the first step in turning everything around. I’m a different person than I was two years ago. I hope, I think, this change is for the better. And hopefully, two years from now, I’ll be even better.

I graduated in June and have been living at home for the last six months, but she didn’t seem to pick back up on our former closeness, and she spent most of her time in my parents’ room (this increased in October when my mom went on a business trip and her cat started to hang out in my room). Recently, my cat was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, which partly explains this change in her behavior as well as others, but even on medication, she didn’t start hanging out with me again until last night. We had to stop the medication this weekend in preparation for her to receive a radiation treatment at the end of the month, so maybe that has something to do with it?

She VOLUNTARILY came into my room, JUMPED UP ON MY BED (she’s very old so she doesn’t do this type of jumping without help often and she hasn’t voluntarily tried to get onto my bed in months), LAID DOWN ON MY ABDOMEN (she used to do this when I was a kid/teenager), and STARTED PURRING. I couldn’t turn over onto my side like I usually do to sleep, but it was worth it. I fell asleep like that, and when I woke up she was sitting on the cat tree in the corner of my room, just chilling out and watching me. My door was wide open all night, so she could have left at any time, but she stayed with me. 

I’m so incredibly happy that we seem to be rekindling our former closeness and that she isn’t treating me like a polite acquaintance anymore. I feel like I have my best friend back.",07Jan2020,1

Recently this has caused me so much stress and emotional pain I’ve become suicidal.

Not anymore.

I’m 23 now and since I’m a responsible adult, I officially ackowledge it’s time to stop worrying and committ to being celibate and relationship-free. I believe embracing that I was meant to be single can help me undo the mental harm I’ve inflicted on myself because I never experienced love. I clearly have not earned it and don’t deserve it, but thats ok! Not everyone does.
Right now I have an intense crush on a female friend who I could never tell my feelings too. In fact, I’m thinking of cutting all contact with her and ending our friendship to spare me the emotional pain. I’m taking control of my life and am no longer allowing my failure to find a partner define me.

At 23 it’s too late and I understand the universe is making it clear a girlfriend is not or will ever be in my future. I’m no longer going to let the stigma of being a loser beta virgin rule my life anymore. It’s too late for me, but that’s 100% ok. I realized that any girl worth loving deserves someone much more adjusted and sexually experienced than me!

If you’re in my situation, know that you can free yourself from it. It’s ok to surrender and realize that there is more to life than this suffering. Dating and sex and relationships can just bog you down with so much negativity ane harm.

103,"So I met this girl, she's cool, smart, quirky, funny, down to earth, and we share a lot of the same opinions and values.

I have a lot more fun when I'm with her compared to when I'm with other girls and the thoughts of starting a relationship with her have been crossing my mind. Both of us are really into each other. And I know that she's looking for a serious relationship.

The thing is, I've just been enjoying being single too much.

I love having all my free time to myself, all my money too myself, and being able to make decisions without having to take anyone else in account for other than me. And mostly being able to flirt and hook up with other girls without worrying about hurting a significant other. 

Sure sometimes it gets lonely, but it's a small price to pay for being able to do whatever I want whenever I want.

I ended my last relationship after a year and a half of dating because...well to be honest I got tired of the responsibilities and expectations of relationships and longed to be single and have complete freedom again.

It sounds bogus on my ex's end, and she was definitely hurt. But in my opinion it's better than me staying in the relationship and lying to her about me being happy.

Now with this new girl, it's making me reconsider being single. But I'm scared that even if we start dating and do get along for a while, that the feelings I had while I was dating my ex will resurface. And I really don't want to hurt this new girl.

I find myself switching between fantasizing about being in a relationship with her and just choosing to move on and continue being single (to be honest before meeting her my main goal was to stay a bachelor at least until my mid 30s, I'm still 24 at the moment). Part of me still wants to continue staying a bachelor, but the other part of me wonders that if I don't go for her that she may be ""the one that got away"".",07Jan2020,1
104,"Hey, hope you all are having a lovely day and remember to smile. 

Context, I’m 20, currently studying at University in my home city and hence I haven’t moved out. Life is good, at least when I’m not at home. Home for me is eight people living together, a joint family, two families living together. Growing up it was great to be with my cousins but as we are all maturing it’s not the same and this was expected. There is no privacy. Home for me can be good but is usually just a house full of depression, annoyance, and toxicity. Despite being around people I love, I can’t be myself, can’t express myself and am always looked over, made fun of or just despised. My mother understands this and we’re both in the same spot. I am myself with my mother but despite loving her she vents to me about the family, this puts a burden on me, I have to put up with some of her unexpected toxic behaviour as she, like me, has unresolved issues, only hers are much worse. I listen but what else can I do? My dad is the most unsupportive man in the family, he doesn’t help anyone emotionally, financially and is very egotistical and abusive. Without going into many details, he has mentally and verbally abused many members of the family. This is normal to every family member, that sounds crazy but its true. It’s a norm for the family and they accept it, brush it off as if its nothing. It makes me sound like a coward and weak human, but I can’t be myself at home. No one in the family understands it. I want to be able to smile and laugh without being worried about what my family thinks of me as they stare and judge me. Over the past year I did this, and I feel better, just not as good as I feel when not at home. I have been working on my mindfulness, spiritualty and faith, this has got me so far mentally. I can be a much better version of myself outside of this house. When wanting to move out, I get looked down upon, but if all goes well, there’s not long left here. I do love my family, but I shouldn’t be around them for my life if they can’t accept me being me. I like meeting my friends and going out on dates, with my family this is like an illegal activity. I do meet my friends much more now, but it’s always met with disgust as if I killed someone. My grandma is really caring but has a very traditional mindset, she is from India. She loves judging everyone and always just stares at me, judging me as if I have done something wrong. This mentality doesn’t disappear when I’m alone. I have no privacy in this house. I can’t sit somewhere and meditate in peace without being laughed at or watched by my family. I can’t even talk to people on the phone without being questioned so much. I can’t use the car which I am insured on, because a spare care needs to be at home, “Just in case”. This is another big issue, I’ve had my licence for 3 years, we have 5 cars at home and there is always 1 or 2 left at home. My uncle doesn’t want me insured on my mum’s cars as he wants me to be insured on a car he owns. In a weird way its sort of a control issue, he loves being “the man”. He is caring and loving but expects a lot. He hasn’t helped my mother and I with certain issues. I don’t have a father figure in my life, no man I can look up to and respect their ideologies. I just made this realisation recently. I second guess everything I do as if my family is watching me, as if I have to explain every little thing I do. Even if it’s waking up at night and wanting a glass of water, watching TV, wanting to have dinner with friends, wanting to study in the library. Reading helped me overcome some of these issues especially with mediation but there’s so much more self-development and self-love I need to work on. I have looked into therapy and will be going this month. I love me, I just wish I could be that version everywhere I go. This post has been weird to write, I feel scared but have had these feelings locked up for all my life. I want to be myself, I want to be able to wake up in the morning and smile. I want to talk better to myself and not cuss myself out based on the person my family wants me to be. Another important thing to reflect on is that I am never angry or even sad outside of the house. I have so much energy, so much love for my friends and people around me, I can express my self freely and smile much more. My friends do understand this and have suggested to just be patient, work on myself mentally, don’t let issues go unresolved, and to seek therapy. I will be doing a postgraduate degree from September of this year, and this is away from home, I will be moving out with a dear friend of mine. I know it’s too early to get excited, but I can’t stop looking forward to this. It does keep me going.

I know their day to day lives and thats some crap right there. I saw you on Facebook posting stuff. If you had time for that you had time to just say two words right? I would have never in a million years forgotten your birthday, because on that day someone special who I would become close to was put on this Earth. People I didn't even know told me happy birthday but I wanted to hear it from you guys.... I will accept your late happy birthday and in a few days it'll be yours and I will wish you a happy birthday!

106,"I am caught in a vicious cycle of using self pity as an excuse/and motive on why everything is going shit in my life.

I am 20F. Never dated anyone. Supposedly depressed as shit but no one to confirm it. Disgustingly anxious. Jobless. Stay at home and no college degree because i didn't pass my exams to even get into one.

When i was still in highschool i didn't feel it this much. But i am really so bad at everything. I hate everything about myself. I've been trying to get a job the past few months but literally every job i got (3 in total) i ended up ditching because i became anxious, i had panic attacks and felt nauseous at the thought of having to go there. I just got another job, a job that can get me far and i have to start on monday but i feel like puking my guts out just at the thought of having to go there and do stuff. This happened when i was in school as well but back then i could skip it, so i did, a lot, so much to the point i had to repeat my freshman year of highschool and barely finished the other years.

But i have to go, i hate everything but i do have dreams, i have stuff i want to do, i just don't do shit to achieve them and that's completely on me. I sometimes try and fail miserably. Hell, i even put going to the gym for the past 6 years even though i have severe body dysmorphia.

No matter how much i want to do something, i still end up not doing it, i even barely go out with friends, if i go out once a week it's a goddamn Christmas miracle.

What pisses me off even more is that i really have no reason to be like this. I have what i need to achieve the things i want. I have supportive family memebers. Tbh i ain't even that ugly, both my body and face are pretty decent, even above average if i might add and i known that. But i still can't stop hating them and punching myself everytime i look into the mirror.

I don't know if i actually have some mental problems but even if i do, i do not have the funds to fix it anyway. + i'd much rather prefer if it was just me and not something i'd have to pill myself that can have severe side effects and no possibility of ever healing.

I am so afraid of getting old and be left behind but at the same time i also want to go to sleep and wake up 10-20 years later to see if anything is even worthy of it.",07Jan2020,1
107,"I am by no means like “healthy” or “active”
I don’t work out, or eat all that well. Hell the last 3 months of last year I lived off of fast food.

However I bought a Fitbit mid last year and it tracks your heart beats per minute. 
And recently my bpm has been 45-55

If you're a parent and your kids frequent Reddit, it's a great idea to keep an eye on them. You'll notice that these individuals never address me directly. They always get a third party to do it, or they do it in a way that's completely chickenshit. I'm used to it now. It doesn't seem to bother these people as they are of a low quality.

While they sit here and behave this way, they're taking all kinds of defensive action. Moving residences, temporarily relocating, lying, denial, or just flat out making a run for it. Don't bother because you'll be found regardless.

Some of these people have been confronted and asked directly about their activities. They denied it and then continued with their behavior. It's not very manly if you ask me. Sitting online anonymously behaving like a small child. At least you think you're anonymous.

Crazy Becky tried to conceal her whereabouts and was found anyway. This isn't a game where one loses or wins. It's a situation where one completely fucks their own life up. I will find everything out and always have.

I'm sorry that social media is such a wasteland. I'm sorry that parents have a dire requirement to monitor the social media activity of their children. Parents think it's other children harassing their children but it isn't. It's fucking adults harassing kids.

111,"This happened probably six months ago, but it popped into my head for some reason and it got me hating how people are again...

I was listening to talk radio (current events) and during a commercial I heard that jalapeno sausage was on sale for a buck at a local gas sation/convenience store chain. I regularly buy these and I'm always looking to save money. 

Anyways I briefly heard the offer and when I stopped buy to get gas I went inside and asked the clerk. I said that I had heard on a radio commercial that the jalepeno sausage was on sale for a buck. The clerk gave me that ""god damn pain in the ass customer"" look as if I was someone trying to get away with something. 

And quite frankly it pissed me off. I hate being treated unfairly. Like I am guilty of something when I am not. 

Come to find out (later on my own) that what was on safe for a dollar was something else than what I had been usually getting. I usually got the jalapeno sausage roll, NOT the jalepeno sausage.

So I gave it a shot and it worked flawlessly. In which made me want to do it again, and this kept continuing to the point where every other week I would miss a day.

116,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this. I searched before hand and my investigation led me to this subreddit. If I'm wrong please correct me and I will post in the right place, but I need to get this out there.

SO...Yesterday I was out walking and a man approached me and started chatting. He was personable, friendly and respectful. The conversation lasted 2 minutes and we went our separate ways. A few hours later, after dark, I was walking back from the store when I heard a voice behind me and it was the same guy. 

He came up beside me and asked if I remembered him from before. I said I did and he offered to walk me home. I don't live in the best area, most people around here are into drugs, but he was well spoken, clean looking and had a job (I met him initially while he was wearing his uniform so he'd just gotten off work) so I didn't think anything was wrong. He asked if he could use my phone and I said yes. He made a call to someone and made plans to meet with them after he walked with me. He even asked if I was comfortable walking with him and I said yes. He didn't say or do anything that was suspicious at this point. He used my phone again when we got to my house, (he said he was talking to his brother) and asked where the person was. He hung up and told me he was a few blocks away getting food at the restaurant for their aunt and would be there to pick up him. He asked if he could wait inside. I wasn't totally okay with it, but I am usually a very suspicious person and he had been polite and even bought me a drink from the store, so I said ok.

When we got into my house, we stayed downstairs in my dining room just chatting. After a little while, nothing was happening so I started getting nervous. Then things got really weird. He started complimenting my body and asking me if I was happy with my life. He kept asking me weird questions and implying I was unhappy and I needed to ""relieve my anxieties""

I told him I was uncomfortable. He seemed offended and tried to convince me I was being irrational. Then he started asking me if I was into hard drugs. I told him I felt like he was going to hurt me and he needed to leave. He laughed it off, not believing me, but I grabbed all my stuff off the table and told him I would walk him to the door. I decided to take him through the back door so there wouldn't be an opportunity for him to walk behind me or to lose sight of him.

When I got to the door he stood there and asked if it was ok if he came back. I said no and he got angry. He balled up his fists and started posturing aggressively. I asked him to leave again and he lit a cigarette and still stood there saying all he wanted to do was ""relax"" with me. I got really scared here and I asked him what he meant and he indicated he meant sex. I FREAKED THE F\*\*\* OUT!

I stood my ground and told him again to leave and he said no. Then he started walking towards me. I had already unlocked the door so I pushed myself against him, opened the door and pushed him out. I ran to my neighbors house and hid there. I was so scared I couldn't breathe. I did not call the police because I was scared I had somehow caused it, especially by inviting him in. I wasn't even really sure they'd do anything about it or believe me.

I did submit everything I could remember on an online form to the authorities and told my neighbors to be on the lookout for him. I live in a relatively small community where everyone knows everyone. I rarely talk to people and usually keep to myself. He was so friendly and seemingly genuine. It wasn't until he realized I was alone in the house that his entire demeanor changed. I will never forget this for the rest of my life. I THINK I FUCKED UP!!

EDIT: I also forgot to mention that after his happened I decided to check my phone to see who he called. There was a number but the call had been canceled. He made 3 calls, only one of which went through and lasted 3 seconds. He was talking to himself and there was no one coming.

""Why's that?""   
""Everything plugged in like my computer but it's fine, it's SSD so it should be ok."" (obv I'm on it) but due to there being no way to know if it's bad or not he just swapped it out.

He goes to the bathroom to check out the switch, I told him what I did and I ask, ""Does swapping out a lightswitch void a warranty?""  


""Maybe, but I don't care, people do things to their house all the time. I don't care."" He said that the wire-nuts that come with the switches aren't worth shit so don't use them, go back to Home Depot and get baggy of them. Then after that, I wen to my room to turn on my computer he hollers back at me and says, ""your bulb wasn't screwed in all the way.""

123,"This post will be very long since I am going through a long story, but please bear with me.

**My background:** I am F 38 from the middle east but living in Europe since 2005. I have created my life and my career exactly how I wanted, studied, and worked where I wanted. I'm independent, living a comfortable life, and my last relationship ended in my early 30s. It was a painful and emotional break-up, so I was terrified of commitment and falling in love again, hence since then, I am single and focused on myself, never had a problem with datings, casual flings, and friends with benefit.

**His Background:** He is 34, from Northwestern Europe, working and living in developing countries. His last breakup was also painful, and he doesn't want commitment. He is more kind of charming and very playful guy. He is comfortable being single and explores opportunities from different places he travels or works. He is in love with the middle east culture, and he does everything to learn about those countries.

**Some backstory:**

**The first time we met:** In January 2017 I met a guy through a common friend at a party. He was visiting, and he is originally from another country in Europe. We immediately clicked, I felt a strong spark and energy between us, turned out he is very fond of my homeland and my culture, so he tried to show off and tricked me a bit. However, he ended up with another girl at that party, and we became just a facebook friend. We kept in touch by chatting over one year; after a year, he came back for a visit, and we met. This time things were different, and we both knew we are attracted to each other, so we ended up sleeping together. We had a great time that weekend.

**The first time we traveled together:** After he left, we kept in touch, he moved to Africa for work. When he was here he mentioned a trip to one of the African countries and I suggested to do it together.

We planned the trip and made it though for 14 days. It was fantastic, we had so much in common, very rare connection, we learned from each other so much. We kept is very causal, we explore our sexual feelings, we talked about other dates and stories, and everything went very well.

**Post-trip:** we were both very excited and continued our chat until I got scared of falling for him, so I slowed down.

I've heard from a common friend that he is a guy who didn't have a stable relationship before, and he is a good player. Our common friend also told me other stuff that he never told me, even when I asked him. So I tried to tell him over chat that I feel he is cold and in the distance and maybe we should stop chatting. We had a fight, he told me that I expect too much, he asked me what are my expectations. I got scared and we agreed on stopping our chat and give each other personal space. It was painful for me since I created some feelings for him, but I tried to let him go.

**The first letter from him:** After a few months, I received a letter from him. It was very sweet and so emotional for me to receive a letter from a person I like so much.

So I wrote him back, and we exchanged few letters, tried to find time to meet-up again until in one of his replies he told me that he feels I am looking for commitment and he doesn't want that. Instead, he is so looking forward to seeing me but if I am on the same page and if we are just friends. I got offended and stopped our communication.

For several months it worked, and I kind of thought I moved on until he started sharing pictures and sharing thoughts from his new mission. I couldn't stop myself, so we continue chatting again for almost six months. After sometimes, my depression and fear of falling for him got bigger. I tried to cut him off, but he was asking common friends about me. So I decided to confess my feelings to him, and I asked him to meet up in a person over summer. We didn't manage to find any time or place that would work for both of us.

**The second time we traveled together:** It took us a year and a half to our reunion. One day out of the blue, he suggested me to travel together to central Asia. I accepted it and planned our trip for October. Things changed on that trip; we were closer, more intimate, but still just friends with strong sexual chemistry and deep connection. My plan was to tell him my feelings, but the whole trip was so nice that I didn't dare to ruin it. I was afraid to scare him off by telling him about my feelings until a night before our trip was ending, we got a bit drunk, and he kinda put in my plate that he knows I want to tell him something and he insists on it until I told him very straightforward that I am in love with him. He didn't respond with he got a boner. I was very emotionally unstable in our trip, I was going through depression, and he knew it. We continue our intimate moment, our last day was even closer, more intimate, we talked about future traveling plans, and he opened up very private and family-related subjects, asking me my opinion.

We had our romantic dinner, we both love Italian food and wine so when we travel we close our trip by an Italian restaurant it doesn't matter where we are. We left for the airport, kissed, hugged, and said goodbye. When I landed, I got a message from him that he is very thankful for our trip, that he won't forget it ever and he will mail me a letter to share his thoughts.

He wrote that we have a connection that is rare and we can't find anywhere else, and that means a lot to him and he doesn't want to lose me.

* He is very fond of me, admires tons of things in me (not going to name them), he thinks we can learn from each other a lot more, and he wants us to be connected.
* He doesn't share my feelings, he was always confused about me, but when I told him about my feelings, he knew that he is in a different place.
* He spares a list or outline of what he wants from a relationship, which he increasingly unsure and will know when the time comes
* He is interested in his new facets of life, and he sees me as a beautiful window into so many of them.
* He feels and thinks our relationship can evolve into something very durable and beautiful one, and he knows this because we find something in one another that we don’t find somewhere else
* He suggested moving with him into a deep and meaningful friendship where we can still travel together, maybe to my country.
* He also mentioned that he is worried about me, but maybe he is not the right person to help me due to our difference in feelings. However, he would like to try.

TL;DR! I'm confused since he mixed terminologies and jumps from a relationship to a friendship, from not having feelings but having a deep connection. How should I deal with him, What is he exactly looking for?",07Jan2020,1
124,"I don’t know where else to post this, but I financed a 2015 Honda Civic Coupe back in December 2014 when I was 18 years old. I lived independently for college (4 hours away from my family) and while all of my friends were out partying and hanging out, I would be working. Financing a car was honestly the most difficult thing for me at my age and at times I regretted it. There were times when I had to sleep in my car, eat one bread a day, search my car for spare change for gas, figure out ways to support myself while ensuring my parents and my friends that everything was okay on the surface. This all happened in the first couple years though and I eventually got better financially over time. This month, I completely finished paying off my car and I’m so excited!!! My family is very proud of me and I wish my dad was still here to share this joy. I wanted to share this with everyone on Reddit as well because my friends don’t really care nor do they understand my excitement since they all drive fancy BMWs, Mercedes, and Porsches that their parents bought for them, so I sort of don’t feel as happy with my Civic as I should be.

126,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this, but I need to get this out of my system. 

I’ve come to the realitization a little while ago that I self-sabotage my life a lot and it has damaged my life quite a bit. Whether it’d be about my future, relationships, school, work etc. 

I guess it’s some kind of a defense mechanism, I don’t want to be hurt or dissapointed so I ruin it myself before something can happen. 

In that moment when the decision comes, whether to do it the way that would actually make me happy in life or to ruin it in some way, I choose almost every time to do something which will ruin it. 

For example, relationships. Everything’s going well and it could go somewhere but I get so scared, paranoid and sure that it’s gonna go downhill that I sabotage the relationship myself and in a way I’m aware of what I’m doing in the moment, I just can’t stop it. 

I’ve broken up with many people without a good reason just because of this. In that moment all I can think about is : ” I will end this before he will because I know he will, this way I’m not getting hurt”. 

And this same pattern goes for literally everything in my life.

127,"I don’t know how many of you will be able to relate to this. 

I have posted quite a bit about my struggles. 

I have come to the realisation that some things won’t change for me no matter how much I think about stuff daily. I can’t invent a time machine to go back and change everything. It planned out the way it was meant to be. 

I actively had a part to play. If I didn’t speak to you, I didn’t. If I didn’t make an effort then, I didn’t. If I didn’t talk to you, I didn’t. I had reasons for my actions and I know all those actions were for the best of me. 

Today, in 2020, for the past 6 months I have changed. I don’t know for good or worse. I have thought of all those past actions and I have started to regret them in ways which I feel as if I won’t forgive myself. 

When I had the chance I should have said sorry to people who should have heard it, than over text. I am missing that friendship nowadays. 
I should have stood up for myself because now I realised what I went through and it hurts to think I couldn’t have protected myself. I was blind when I shouldn’t have been. 
I should have taken my chance without being scared of the outcome. I should have been brave. 

Everyday I think the same things, I call it my “sob story”, where now it gets boring to go through everything. I get bored saying the same things and trying to find a new way to cling onto the old. I try to find meaning in old stuff by inventing new stuff and it doesn’t help me. 

I feel as if I caused myself and those around me a lot of pain and annoyance. I am my own person, but from an external view I have caused myself a lot of pain from the past. I hope that one day I will be able to forget and move on easily for my own sake. 

My actions were my own last year and the year before that. I had a reason and I was proud of myself from distancing myself from people. I did it for my own safety and now I shouldn’t regret it because I had a reason back then. I don’t think I should doubt my reasons because I am pretty sure I did it for myself and the right reasons. 

Note to self: don’t doubt your past actions because you are currently struggling to come to terms about how things have worked out. If you did something in the past for a good reason then it’s good enough for you and only you.",07Jan2020,1

Friday last week, I was on vacation in Orlando with family when I received a text saying that my boyfriend wanted to breakup due to us being too different, and drifting apart. I loved him, and even imagined a future where we would do everything together. 

After receiving the text he wouldn’t respond to any questions I asked and just left me on read. He ruined my vacation and everything seemed to be tainted with sadness. Everything still is.

I saw him in person yesterday and asked him why he did it and he said, “It was bound to happen anyway.” It made me feel like he had been thinking about doing it for a long time, and it hurts.

All this is leaving me very depressed and unable to focus. I only started eating again yesterday and still have trouble sleeping.  It’s hard to lose a best friend. I told him everything and he discarded me. Everyone keeps telling me that I have to get over it and be happy again faster but I can’t. I have to keep this facade of happiness in front of my peers and it’s such a struggle. I know I will get over it in time but it will take a very long time.

131,"My dad was great when I was a kid. We used to do tons of things together. We'd go fishing or play basketball together. We'd go see movies, go for bike rides, and so on. He introduced me to a lot of my favorite movies and video games. He used to be a fantastic dad. 

Then, as he started to get into his 50s, things started to go bad. I was 15 at the time. My mom noticed it first but he just started doing less. He stopped spending time with his friends, he quit his job and started working another one with less hours, he started heavy smoking, and he just started getting cold and distant. He's had long term depression just like I have, and my mom and I thought that he was maybe just having a depressive spell. Not long after that he had a slight change to his medication which worked for a while, and then things went downhill fast again. 

By the time of my senior year of high school, me going to a private high school was causing a lot of financial stress for my parents, and he made sure to never let me forget it. He started telling me how much of a burden I was and how he and my mom were going to have to sacrifice so much for my education. When I started going to college I had earned enough money at my minimum wage job to pay for some of my tuition, maybe somewhere between a third and half of it. But my dad still was constantly tearing into me for being a money drain on my parents. When I left college to work for a couple of years, he also made fun of me for working for a garden center, constantly implying that I was gay or that I wanted to be a woman. He made fun of me for having social anxiety and for not having a girlfriend and only a few friends. He just constantly seemed disappointed in me no matter what I did. 

This past September I went back to college, and he has absolutely lost it on me for still needing my parents to pay for some of my tuition. At one point when he was drunk and pissed off at me he actually called me a burden, a deadbeat, and a parasite, and said that if I didn't ""grow up"" and ""start acting like a man"" soon he would throw me out on the streets. 

I just...feel like he doesn't really see me as his son anymore. More like an annoying younger brother. I'm not sure what else to say other than that I miss the way he used to be.",07Jan2020,1
132," My dad was great when I was a kid. We used to do tons of things together. We'd go fishing or play basketball together. We'd go see movies, go for bike rides, and so on. He introduced me to a lot of my favorite movies and video games. He used to be a fantastic dad.

Then, as he started to get into his 50s, things started to go bad. I was 15 at the time. My mom noticed it first but he just started doing less. He stopped spending time with his friends, he quit his job and started working another one with less hours, he started heavy smoking, and he just started getting cold and distant. He's had long term depression just like I have, and my mom and I thought that he was maybe just having a depressive spell. Not long after that he had a slight change to his medication which worked for a while, and then things went downhill fast again.

By the time of my senior year of high school, me going to a private high school was causing a lot of financial stress for my parents, and he made sure to never let me forget it. He started telling me how much of a burden I was and how he and my mom were going to have to sacrifice so much for my education. When I started going to college I had earned enough money at my minimum wage job to pay for some of my tuition, maybe somewhere between a third and half of it. But my dad still was constantly tearing into me for being a money drain on my parents. When I left college to work for a couple of years, he also made fun of me for working for a garden center, constantly implying that I was gay or that I wanted to be a woman. He made fun of me for having social anxiety and for not having a girlfriend and only a few friends. He just constantly seemed disappointed in me no matter what I did.

135,"Everything stops after this. There's quite a bit that people don't know about so it's impossible to convey what will stop happening in full detail. I'm about of the 'A-Team' business. That's what their original idea was. Not sure of the who or the how, but I rejected that idea early on. Now everything is being rejected today.

I'm not getting involved in any more events or issues nor will I approach my family about doing so. They still might because they want to, but I will not.

All of this James Bond 007 bullshit you people love to fuck around with will stop. I don't care what a business needs or what the owners have to say. If people instigate shit like they did previously, it gets reported to the CIA and then they can deal with it if they wish. So if somebody has some mental issue with the CIA and targets me (again), that's probably not going to end well. 

For those unspoken activities that took place to help a few of you, I hope it was taken care of as expected and I hope your heart hurts a little bit less. America is a great place, but evil is going to be evil no matter what. Restart your heart and push forward. Go do some good for those who need you the help only you can give. 

God bless.",07Jan2020,1
