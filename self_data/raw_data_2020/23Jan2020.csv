Piecing together fragments of ideas that I'd like to turn into an animation exploring my mental health issues. I haven't felt creativity flow through me like this for so fucking long. 


I wish it could be like this all the time. Just an endless calm. A quiet mind. 


I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts.

2,"During my college years I’ve noticed that 80% of the girls I became friends with hated me and which caused them to constantly talk about me in negative ways to other people. I don’t like being one of those people who bring other people down. I constantly strive to make life happier for other people. I don’t (well I think) come off as a toxic person, but rather someone that can be a loyal friend. I’ve been told on multiple occasions that girls are jealous of me since I’m attractive, easy to befriend by guys and seem to get attention everywhere. I don’t think I’m that attractive compared to other girls and I honestly just want the best for other people. I feel like maybe I’m ignoring some internal issues such as being annoying or something. How can I change myself to make these girls like me? Jealously can’t be the reason why I’m hated. It doesn’t make sense for girls to be so rude because of envy. Sorry for the rant about myself, I’m seriously bamboozled about what I’m doing wrong and how my ‘close friends’ can turn on me so harshly. I think I need some guidance on what I should do.",23Jan2020,1

6,"So I recently came back from a specialist hospital and during this visit I explained to the doctor there that when my grandparents died they put it in their will to legally lend the house and deeds to me by my current name.

The doctor told me I can change my name via deed poll, and it costs very little. I told him my mom said I'd have to go to court and he said I wouldn't have to, and he showed me internet searches on deed poll and name changing. He said the name change would notify the government officials and that I would not lose the rights to my house.

I went over to my mom's and told her this and she basically went apeshit saying the doctor I saw today was wrong and my GP was wrong as well. She kept saying ''they don't know our circumstances'' and I was calm but she was shouting at me and kept going off in a cycle.

I told her that with deed poll the government officials will be informed of the name change so nothing will happen, she kept saying I was 'wrong' so I made a quick Reddit post and everyone was saying how my mom was wrong and was being 'ridiculous'. Of course she said all the Redditors were 'wrong' and 'don't know shit'. I showed my mom a legal solicitor website that said exactly what the doctor said and she said it was wrong.

She then tried to guilt trip me by saying she was going to OD or cut herself. She then began throwing insults at me such as 'when grandma died the last thing she said was she doesn't want you turning into a boy!' and 'that doctor had an Arabic name so the idiot probably was talking about Arabic rules' (I called her a racist in response to this). She also tried to call me 'autistic' (I'm not) because standing my ground while she was yelling at me is 'having no empathy'.

I have both a chronic medical condition (likely a CSF leak) that is causing numerous health problems (including what my doctor calls 'mild dementia' from the CSF fluid loss, causing me to forget things, and my mother's been using this against me lately as 'proof' that I am 'stupid') so I am depressed and unmotivated most of the time (I have no job because of both the suspected CSF leak disability that gets worse with every year and also because I'm not comfortable in my own body) and my mom felt like this was a good time to point out I haven't done anything with my life as if I chose to be depressed and have a disabling medical condition. My goal in life is to get my condition treated and live life how I want to and to get a job and actually live life. Some days I am so depressed and unmotivated with life I don't cook and go hungry.

She claims she's 'spoken with a solicitor' about me changing my name but I've never seen her speaking with a solicitor and when I told her 'everyone else says you're wrong, including lawyers, doctors, solicitors, and people in general' she went on about how the Conservatives got the majority vote in the UK and sarcastically remarked that they must be right because they got voted in. She also for no apparent reason brought up a thing that happened 15 years ago (when I didn't want to go to an amusement park because I was tired, so my brother didn't go) to guilt trip me.

The doctor told me I need to change my name in order to get top surgery and I mentioned this many times and they just said to keep using binders which hurt like hell. I told them I wanted to be 'stealth' meaning I don't want to have to tell my employers that I'm trans and use my old name in certain places causing things to be awkward. When I asked my mom calmly ''so was Dr [my doctor] and Dr [my other doctor]'' wrong? And I was literally screamed at to leave her house.

She hasn't been talking to me since. I feel like total shit and like I've done something wrong by even bringing it up. I've been crying for 2 hours straight.

Sorry if my post is a bit garbled, I'm both really upset and also I have problems with words lately due to my medical condition.",23Jan2020,1
8,"Context about me: I grew up with loving parents, and an older brother who was born with autism. He had intense speech therapy and can probably be described as no longer autistic anymore. I was bullied by him at a young age. He made me feel down, that people didn't like me, and made fun of how quiet I was. I have extreme low confidence in social situations causing me to not have want to go out often, to be afraid of crossing paths with other people let alone meeting them. Also, the irony, of being bullied by a person who had serious autism. I attribute being bullied at a young age by someone I lived with to growing up depressed, with low self-confidence, and having the male version of a ""resting bitch face."" I wasn't able to or didn't love myself at a young age and it molded me into the personality I have today. I'm better today, no question, but I am still very introverted and have a degree of fear in social situations.

Late 2017-early 2018: I first saw her junior year of high school in AP Lang. I liked her from the start. She was sitting in front of me at an angle where I thought she could not see me. Apparently, she could. I had no experience with girls whatsoever and how to act around them. I stared at her every single class from the 1st day of school to Valentine's Day (AP Lang met every other day). She also was in another class of mine, in APUSH where she sat almost right next to the door and I sat in the back corner, the farthest distance in the class from her seat. I was legitimately obsessed with her. Her smile was gorgeous, her teeth were beautiful, and she was extremely pretty. She was short, brunette, had the sweetest feminine voice I had ever heard, and radiated unconditional positivity. I idealized her and never had a face-to-face conversation with her, ever. 

In December of 2017, my social life was being flushed down the toilet. I had abandoned the ring leader bully and everyone involved in my ""friend group."" I was bullied by him for around a year, and he caused me to bury deep anger inside me that was waiting to be unleashed (I was inexperienced in social situations, it was my first friend group, and I thought he was my friend). I have a feeling he was exposing my worst secrets to everyone, but I can't verify that. In the same month of that year, getting the girl's attention in the way I didn't want, I mocked her smile, making faces at her from the other side of the classroom in APUSH.  She buried her head in her arms and I bet she cried. I made her feel cornered and hurt. One person who knew her told me she was participating in self-harm. I had hurt her in a way that could never be forgiven, I was full of guilt, and this was only the beginning. 

This is where the timeline of this story (early 2018) gets rough: some of these following events may not be in chronological order because I was in a horrible mental state and don't remember sequential events during this time period correctly. I had DMed her apologizing for the faces I made at her and apologized for the looks (I thought she was noticing my frequent looks across the classroom in APUSH, still not realizing that she has been noticing my stares the entire time in AP Lang. Stupid me. This paragraph long apology DM, later in the story where I had taken an extensive two week absence from school, was sent around the school and laughed at. One guy had explicitly mocked it right in front of me using my own words, with her there too). A week or two later I asked her if she wanted to talk to me (I was going for all the marbles with a slim chance: asking her out). She replied, ""Sure."" She stood me up. She was the first one to leave class that day. I got mad (I learned she had unfollowed me as well) and blocked her, later unblocking her and then she blocked me. In APUSH, there was one class where she gave me an absolute mean death stare (I had never seen her so angry). In the middle of class, during a lecture, I buried my head in my arms and started crying. Some of my classmates enjoyed themselves in my breakdown and took snaps of me crying in class and sending them to friends. After class had ended, one actual friend who I myself should have appreciated more tried to console me. I tried to drive him away before telling him to wait in my recently stopped crying, cracking voice ""I hurt her. I like her and I hurt her."" He told me he couldn't help with that. This was while everyone had left the class and one of her friends was talking with my teacher but definitely paying attention to me. 

Probably the next week, she waited for me (along with a friend, most likely because she couldn't trust me) after class and it was apparent she finally wanted to talk to me. I stared at the ground and ignored her before her and her friend left. Any other day I would have been ecstatic to talk to her. But, first, I had a major anxiety, nauseous episode before school that day where I almost threw up (this drama was spreading outside the classroom, in high school, surprise!) Second, I was mad at her because she stood me up and didn't want to talk to me on my own terms. And, finally, her friend was there who, along with her, could have reported everything from the conversation to students outside the classroom. I wanted to talk to her alone, and it ate me up inside that she couldn't talk to me alone. I approached her once days afterward, where to the delight and laughter of the class that I was ignored.

During the subsequent weeks, my insanely dumb self ""wised up"" and stopped staring at her in AP Lang. I heard her, talking to her friend, which was probably directed at me, saying ""I suffered for a long time."" And who could blame her? I certainly couldn't, she was completely in the right. Now, it gets stranger. During those weeks, she told as many people as she could, lying that she ""dumped me"" (we obviously were never together). I learned later from someone who knew her that her dad was putting her up to stuff to bring my social life down (which was already at an all-time low). She talked with my former friends, who were gleeful to offer that I spent most of my time in my basement and had pectus excavatum (a sunken chest). 

I could no longer deal with this drama (to be fair, I definitely did deserve it based on my actions). I had taken a long two week absence from school, resulting in my grades being all F's. I was having auditory hallucinations, hearing her voice and what I thought was her dad's voice. I consciously chose not to eat or drink, and thought I no longer deserved to live. With no one in the house during one specific time, I was having one of my worst auditory hallucinations of my life (I had never had hallucinations of any kind before). During this, I had my eyes shut, and felt a person sit down for a little bit, before getting up and stroking my eyebrow for a second or two. I never opened my eyes, I was afraid to open them because of the hallucination. To this day, with a sane mind, I'm still convinced it was her. I'm extremely sensitive to touch, and I was not expecting to be touched, so my full body flinched. She immediately left the house. The hallucinations (which were never visual) thinned out and stopped. I got reinstated at the same high school. The drama had blown over, and I never had any contact with her since. I was not trying to pursue her, and she was ignoring me. I still to this day do not know whether she liked me or not, but I do genuinely think at some point in this story she had feelings for me. 

This extremely long story also serves as an apology to her. I'm sorry for how I acted, and I still have guilt for the things I did that were directed at you. I caused you to have intense hate grow inside of you. I'm truly so very sorry. You were the first girl that I liked, and you were extremely important and special to me.

This whole high school drama event has made my high school dead to me. I'm not going to be close to any reunions my high school will have. The whole school turned against me, nobody had my back, I was laughed at and not treated like an actual human with feelings.

 If you're wondering about what I've been doing since, I recovered enough academically to get into college. As a freshman, I earned a 3.7 GPA this past fall semesterand made the Dean's list (I almost had a 3.5 in high school, which actually was not good for my large high school where people took multiple AP classes and regularly earned GPAs of 4.0+). It was a vast improvement for me academically and I have never been happier than I have been in my life, but my obsession with this girl still rings true because I have thought about her at least once a day for the past two years.",23Jan2020,1

Problem is, last month I went, for a few days, on a road trip with her and some friends, one of the nights we kinda had a moment (maybe was only for me) and all I ever felt for her came rushing back, and today I spent the entire afternoon fighting the urge to kiss her, and now I can't sleep because I hate this feeling and what they are making me think. I don't what to be that kind of person!! But I also don't want to be a dick to her and pull away without explanation...

Any time he receives constructive criticism or advice, he takes it as an attack on his character. Recently, our father and stepmother politely suggested that he start looking for a full time job and a place he could move to, unless he wants to go back to school. Immediately, he starts blowing up my phone about how “annoyed” he is that “they want him out”, etc. 

After this exchange, I’ve been feeling strangely emotional on his behalf, to the point of almost crying. I worry about my little brother a lot, but at the same time he needs a little kick in the ass to get his shit together.

So here's my promises!
1.) Stop wasting time on internet, ideally spend 2 or 3 hours maximum on internet. 
2.) Stop chatting with random starngers.. it doesn't worth, it's never gonna last, maybe a week that's all. 
3.) Stop falling in love / infatuation. You will meet the right person at right time.. these guys now don't worth my time. 
4.) STOP getting mad at parents, they love you! Realise that.. have a control on your words you through at others. 
5.) Realise you live only once, so stop being shy and socially awkward and get involved in conversations and make yourself heard. 
6.) Stop LUST
7.) GET BACK to the religious person, once you were.  For past few months I literally skipped church and rather spend time in home and did nothing. 
8.) Start studying your daily lessons.. try to spend atleast 3 hours daily on studies..  because I'm not superb intelligent.  I need to put forward hardwork to pass my exams with flying colors. 
9.) Stop being mean
10.) Stop getting depressed by random humans words..  humans are cruel you can do nothing about it. It thier personality. As long you're nice, that only what should matter to you. 
11.) Stop being so self conscious.. build some self confidence:)
12. ) attend every day. Dont sacrifice your classes for extra 1 hours sleep. Study matters. Also attendance matters. 
13.) Stop stupid. When you know something.  Dont shy away. Speak it loud with courage.",23Jan2020,1

Living for myself (for the sake of control) is making me exhausted. Not literally socially isolated, but at home I'm over my family and even though one of my goals is to move out once I've saved enough, I now have doubt it'll fix me instantly.


I haven't gone through any breakups, by the way, nor have I been heartbroken in another form. But the walls &amp; guard I naturally have, why isn't it working? It's a rinse &amp; repeat of me feeling OK for a few weeks then felt awful &amp; feel like breaking down in a week.


It's more of a home thing as I'm alone at home, but I'm not as bad when I'm at work for example. But I hate being vulnerable, yet I naturally keep a close grip on most things I do - not just emotions. My energy has slowly declined to, despite getting a decent amount of sleep and any caffeine I might be getting. 

At least in the last few days - and it ties with the fear of the unknown - is a fear of vulnerability. Or a lack of desire to be vulnerable or climb the walls, and wondering why this isn't working. That, in addition to how to deal with relationships (all kinds) when they don't agree with you, from your insignificant ideas to your hopes &amp; dreams.

42,"So, I’ve posted here on Reddit before about how I struggle with attending high school every day. I have now over 50 absences this year and I can’t bare to attend anymore. Quite frankly, my school is horrible atmosphere-wise, and it drives me further into a depression. I have been diagnosed with MDD and Anxiety, and I have struggled with attending public school for some time. I’m currently working towards recovery, but it’s a struggle.

I am considering getting my GED since I have ~4 months to graduating and I don’t think I can make it that long. I have gotten stellar grades when I *do* attend, and the past 3 years I have gotten all A’s and B’s and made honor roll regardless of my attendance, but it has gotten to the point where I will either be kicked out for my attendance or I need to leave on my own. I would be fine with getting my GED, my parents would be fine with it too, but I worry about what people would think of me. I’m not bragging about being smart, but I’ve seen and heard a lot of people assume that people with GEDs are stupid and lazy. My father has one and makes six figures, and he’s very smart, so I found this to be untrue, but I also worry that it would hinder me in college and careers.

I have friends who say that college is better, and I have aspirations for my future career, and it requires a masters degree in a science field. I worry that a GED would effect this. Does anyone here have experience with this?",23Jan2020,1

My friend (we'll call him Joe) and I have known each other for about 5 years now. Back in May 2018, we went camping with other friends and Joe and I planned the whole thing together so we got very close. After camping, we went out to dinners, concerts and touristic places by ourselves without telling our other friends. I eventually developed a crush on him but I never told him. He went to a spiritual retreat on November 2018 and he changed a lot that he stopped talking to me. I got invited to my friend's birthday party on January 2019 and I saw Joe there and we started talking about what we had been doing with our lives. I started seeing him more often because he's part of my friend's group so everytime we'd go out, he'd be there too. 

We started talking again and we started going out to dinners, movies or simply get food and eat in his car. The crush that I had on him came back and this time we were hanging out a lot more often than before and I started falling in love with him. I couldn't help it but he was being very nice to me.

On June 18, 2019 he asked me out to dinner but he was involved in a car accident so I had to pick him up. I decided to tell him how I feel about him that day but I didn't have the guts to say that in person. I dropped him off and 2 minutes later, I called him while I was driving home. I was nervous and I didn't know how to start telling him about my feelings for him so I had to stop at a parking lot outside of a grocery store. So I said: I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship but I had a crush on you since we went to Frankie Valli's concert and ever since we started spending time together again, that crush came back and I eventually catched feelings for you. I know it's not mutual but I just needed you to know because I've been carrying with this for so long. He replied by saying: ""It is mutual but I think it would be better to be discussed in person.""

He came to my house the next day to pick up some things he needed. We saw each other and he didn't mention anything about my confession to him. I texted him like an hour after he left and I asked him about my confession to which he eplied: ""I'm sorry but right now is not really a good time to be dating."" I didn't reply and I stopped talking to him. 

I got injured and I had a risky back surgery on September 13, 2019. I always wanted to take Joe to this beautiful place up in Malibu so I texted Joe 2 days before surgery saying that I wanted to take him there. He replied to me saying: ""I can't. I'm going to the movies with someone"" I never told him I was having surgery but then my friends told him about it and he never sent me a ""feel better"" message, which broke my heart to million pieces. Despite of what happened between us, there was a friendship and I needed his support through a rough time like that.

A month and a half has gone by after surgery and Joe texted me saying: Hey, how are you feeling? what do you think if we go out to dinner? and I had to turn him down. I was healing from my surgery and I needed to heal myself mentally because of how hurt I got by him.

3 months after I had surgery and having no contact with him, I saw him at my friend's birthday party. I was physically and mentally much better by the time I got to see him. He hugged me and asked me how I was doing and how he misses me and bla bla bla. He then asks me if I'm free on the weekends and that he'd like to start hanging out with me again.

We went out to dinner the next day and guess what? we forgave each other for everything that happened. I felt so much better BUT we started hanging out again and this is not good.

We went to our friend's surprise party this past Monday and I got very drunk. He offered to take me home and drive my car. While we were on our way home, I started telling him jokes but then all of a sudden I asked: hey, are you dating? to which he quickly said: ""Yes"" and 5 seconds later, he added ""No, I'm actually not."" and I said: Well, that's a shame because you're a great guy. He didn't say anything back and stayed quiet. 

My friends came to my house today because an old friend of us is visiting us for a few days. The problem was that I didn't know Joe was also coming until I opened the door. I was embarrassed because of what happened on Monday but we still talked normally. 

He fell asleep on the couch while we were all watching a movie and I brought him a blanket. He looked so adorable sleeping and God, my feelings for him never left. 

I need to walk away from him but it's so hard when my best friends are also their best friends. We stop talking and we see each other at a friend's party and start talking again.

It's too damn hard being friends with someone you're in love with.

Yesterday was my diagnosis. Post traumatic stress disorder. Very certain result. It's good to finally have somewhere to place what I've been feeling. Something recognizable. Something treatable.

I still feel like a target. I can't confide in anyone about it. I'm no combat veteran. Even not being a combat veteran, I'm so often around so many of them. I take comfort in being around them, and they have no idea. I couldn't ever tell them. They don't need some 17y/o kid trivializing what they face. They've lost friends to it. I don't have it nearly as bad.

I want to train. In AR handling. I want to move like a soldier, take the fight to my enemy, even though I know I may never have one. I'm tired of sitting here, anxious, waiting for something to happen. I want to push forward and just get it over with. I hate waiting.

Every time an uncomfortable thought crosses my mind, I spontaneously imagine myself in full gear, Armored and armed, with some manner of rifle. In the first-person. Not particularly doing anything except moving. Moving powerfully. I think it means I want to be in control of the situation that may make me uncomfortable. And I don't feel in control, usually.

Wearing my baton helps. Doesn't help much in school, since I can't wear it there, but normally it's decently helpful. Not as much as it was, though. You know what happens when you appease someone, or something. Its demand grows bigger. I think the same thing happened to me. At first I carried a knife, like every teenager and their little brother. Then I bought the baton. Then the armor plate and plate carrier. Now my mind won't get off of full-sized rifles.

I'm finally getting help, though. I'm on the waiting list for therapy. Also, to anyone who might read this: I do not have thoughts of hurting myself or others. I have thoughts of being in control, and defending myself or others from aggressors. I've never had issue with identifying who is and isn't presenting a threat.

My other main symptom is experiencing massive dumps of adrenaline where it isn't necessary or called for, such as in class, right now I'm my bed, at the bank or grocery store, etc.

Anyways, that's it. That's what's going on with me. I can't tell anyone because I don't want to be questioned by the police, because there's really no way to word all of what I just said without sounding like a killer waiting to happen.",23Jan2020,1
50,"So I’m friends with this girl, I’ll call her Alexa. Me and Alexa have been friends for years, she’s a very dramatic person, she lives and thrives in conflict. I however, avoid conflict at all costs. So straight away idk how we became friends in the first place lol. But I’ve been dealing with this girl for years, she’s extremely spoilt and acts like the entire world revolves around her. Recently we stopped hanging out, because we don’t have any classes together anymore. I tried to talk to her and she was acting really odd? I quickly realised she was mad at me, for no apparent reason, but found out it was because I hadn’t been hanging out with her?? I’ll reiterate, I tried to talk to her, multiple times. She’s made absolutely no effort whatsoever to talk to me, why should I be the one hopelessly chasing after her? Somehow once again I ended up being the one that apologised to her, like always. But now that I’ve stepped back and stopped hanging out with her, I suddenly see that I really don’t like her. I don’t know how I didn’t see it before, but I can’t even talk to her anymore because she frustrates me so. She genuinely acts like the world revolves around her, and if she has a problem with someone, she’ll talk about them to everyone else and just completely ignore the person she’s mad at. Whereas if I have a problem with someone, or someone else has a problem with me, I’ll just talk to them until we’ve sorted it out, like a normal person 🤷🏼‍♀️ .  Yesterday, I walked over to her to go talk to her and a couple of our friends she was stood with, and they just got really quite. One of our friends there, who I’m closer to that Alexa is, let’s call her Taylor, well Taylor can’t really keep her mouth shut lol, so she started telling me that they had been telling her something about me and then Alexa really quickly told her to shut up. Like seriously, she’d rather talk shit about me than talk to me? The thing she told my friend was about something I had worn. They were laughing at something I’d worn, something they knew I was self-conscious about the day i had worn it. But after everything, that moment yesterday was like the final straw for me and I can’t put up with her anymore, during the time I didn’t see her I was so happy, everything was so drama free, and life felt so much easier. But despite the fact I know i don’t want to be friends with her, I can’t bring myself to stop being friends with her? It’s like I feel guilty because we were ‘friends’ for so long, like I owe her something because of that. Idk what to do, I know I don’t owe her anything, but I have an over abundance of empathy and even though I have every right to not hang out with her, I still feel bad about it? Any advice would be really appreciated, I’m not even at school today because I spent last night stressing about her, and I love school ☹️ (yes I’m a geek I know)

55,"I was originally going to post this as a reply to \[[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake/comments/eshc4k/mental_health_issues_can_be_fixed_just_be/)\], but it got a bit long and felt somewhat too soap-boxy to belong there. So instead I'm launching these thoughts into the void.

I'm a Christian. This whole 'you just have to pray hard enough and you'll be cured' mentality that can often be found in hardcore Christianity baffles me.

Praying harder isn't going to do any good. I don't think prayer is meant to induce overt curing miracles today. Generally speaking, I think we've progressed past that. I know there are cases where doctors just don't know how to cure someone yet, and those are tragic. But it's also tragic that there are people who, due to their beliefs, reject professional treatment for issues that are pretty well-known and manageable by non-supernatural means now. And this rejection leads to dying of the disease that could have been treated, sometimes by suicide.

I use prayer as an affirmation to myself and to God to improve in the areas that I know I *do* have the capability and will to improve in. Things like 'help me muster the drive to contribute a bit more to house chores,' or 'help me figure out how to be a better and more attentive friend.'

It takes some work on my part; I need to meet God halfway if I expect anything to happen, and it's worked pretty well since I started doing it. There's always room for improvement, but that improvement isn't going to happen in giant sweeping moments.

For things that can't be overcome by simple perseverance - like a chemical imbalance - praying for a miracle cure to happen is, in my opinion, useless and even a bit insulting. With the scientific advancements today, the treatment for a lot of issues has already been provided for us thanks to the things here on earth and the work of brilliant and gifted minds.

God already *gave us* these materials for treatments, things that can sometimes be taken raw or can be turned into useful medications through chemistry. We were also given the mental ability to discover and utilize those materials, and to figure out how to help each other with therapy.

To deliberately reject these gifts seems to me to be a slap in the face to God.",23Jan2020,1

59,"I've noticed recently that i keep trying to feel the void with other people. I'll crave attention and affection and I'll go out clubbing just so I can have some warm bodies against mine for a couple hours. I think I've realised that the underlying problem is me. My intense need to have someone. But not just anyone. Only those who don't want me in return. For example, the guy that only wants me for phone sex and nudes, or the guy that is dating someone else or even my ex, whom, I should in no circumstance ever be around. I crave these people, and I convince myself that it's love that I feel for them, but it's not. It's desperation and lust. 

I think my self awareness is my achilles heel, because I'm able to therapise myself and identify all my issues and the factors that have caused me to be this way, but I'm just not able to fix it. I can't fix myself, I want to so so so bad. I want to be my own person, I want to love myself enough to be on my own and I want to be able to respect myself enough to not go after guys that are trash. 

During the past 4 months that I have been dealing with this breakup I've just slowly been spiralling. You'd think that it would be getting better by time but somehow it's getting worse. I don't love him anymore and I don't miss him anymore, but I can't stop thinking about him. Thinking about what it felt like to be so completely and utterly happy in his presence, having his arms wrapped around me while we watched netflix, waking up next to him in the morning. Those are the memories that I just can't seem to shake. I miss having that. And not necessarily with him, just in general.

72,"True Intimacy

Few people actually experience true intimacy. Sure we all have sex, but how many of us actually take the time to completely inhale our partner, speak to him or her on a level of understanding (before during and after sex), because you truly take the time to understand their needs, wants, and desires in life, not just in bed?

We all have tendencies to just run toward the finish line in life and most definitely in sex and relationships.

There doesn’t have to be a finish line and life and love, do not need to turn into a race.

A true lover hits the starting line every day. He or she understands that their partner isn’t a robot and has emotions to contend with, just like they do. 

A true lover has empathy and can turn off the anger or frustration tachometer when their counterpart is off the path or in layman’s terms, “losing their minds” for a bit.

Time spent trying to understand one another as we walk through daily activities, talk about work, discuss family, each others history and future desires-etc, enhances the ability to understand one another on a level few take the time to achieve. It is “True Intimacy!”

&amp;#x200B;

If it were easy…

If it were easy, we all be walking around with that “special glow” all day everyday. No, it isn’t easy, but nothing worth having really is now, is it?

It takes time, it takes effort but most of all it takes vulnerability to allow ourselves to truly crawl into love. Yes Crawl! Stop running follow our head’s not our feet. It’s easy to want to have sex because we are attracted to someone on the exterior but do we really know who they are on the interior after a drink, day, week, a month or 3? 

It takes years to know someone when we just jump in bed with them. Why? Because we have an immediate vision in our minds of who we want them to be while we are entangled physically. We aren’t paying any attention to their mind, we’re just seeking release and ecstasy. 

True Intimacy far exceeds any simple ecstasy encounter and I challenge anyone to prove me wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not advocating 16th century courting, but I am trying to open eyes to the spiritual connection so many have no idea even exists. Become one, breathe together, learn from one another, explore together in every step of each day. Learn to trust without boundaries, be vulnerable and experience love the way we were created to experience it. Sounds like a fairy tale, and it actually could feel like one if we let it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend today has been a friend since 2011, I’ve been married and divorced, chose wrong girlfriends multiple times and have lived the life of simple ecstasy all while she was just a friend.

79,"I’m a 35yo single mom with a 7yo in joint custody, divorced after a 15y relationship that ended by him cheated on me 2y ago.

By the end of 2018 i started dating again and met someone with whom i started a non exclusive FWB relationship, which was pretty new to me since I committed at 18 and didn’t really experience in dating by then. In the beginning we saw each other about once a month and our encounters included restos, going to the movies, etc. Last summer we started meeting more often, he took a french class and since i’m a french speaker i proposed my help. We also started having more serious conversations (friends, family, how we saw relationships in general). Since he works a lot and doesn’t have that much free time, i think he isn’t seeing other people. That summer I also realized my feelings have developed to the point i lost interest about going through the process of meeting guys over a boring coffee/beer again, and that i might be wanting something more with him, like, at some point introducing my daughter.

So last week, the conversation drifted about expectations and how it’s important they met for both parts. I saw in it a chance to come clean about the fact i cared about him and if he was comfortable with this idea maybe we could try something more serious. But instead of that, when he asked if mine met, my brain shut down (i guess the fear of facing a potential rejection) and after being silent a moment i went on some non sense babbling about me being emotionally damaged or even emotionally unavailable and not wanting to put us in a unfair situation in which one of us could be hurt... (seriously this poor guy, I sounded crazy)

I’ve always been a poor communicator, but here it came out so awkwardly, plus it was the opposite of what i wanted to say. Though we still text and he has been understanding so far, I’m really embarrassed by that talk, and  I now see myself as someone with so many red flags that i don’t understand why one would want to stay around me. 

I guess we’ll have to talk about that, but i clearly don’t know how to address that matter next time i’ll see him.

I already saw different therapists for a few sessions each (5, 3 and 7) but going through that again isn’t in my mind: those meetings left me in a shitty mood when i didn’t wanna go out of my place, which isn’t that practical when you still have to work to provide for your kid and yourself. I’m really tired that healing process took so much time and anchors me when i have opportunities of moving on.

They also have clear power dynamics between the male and female (going both ways).

Then somewhere down the road  we developed BDSM kinks or DaddyDom kinks and for some reason it's so disturbing to older folks and they don't understand why. There is absolutely nothing wrong with these kinks, but it's no coincidence that the word 'daddy' is a sexual 'trend'.",23Jan2020,1

2020 has been going terribly so far. My boyfriend lost his job and he's been applying all over the place but we live in a small town and there's not a lot of prospects, especially when he can't commute since he doesn't have a car. A week ago today, we also lost one of our cats. He was 11, which I know is a pretty decent life span for a cat, but he's the second cat to die in my arms in less than a year. He'd been sick last summer and lost a lot of muscle mass. It seemed like he just wasn't putting the weight back on. We didn't see him as ""starving"" because he ate a lot. He was eating and drinking normally and then he was throwing up and within 3 or 4 hours, he was dead. We had no money to take him to a vet but even if we did, there's little that could have been done to save him.

For the past few years, we have tried to mold each other, like playdough, into seeing the world the way we do. Never stopping for a minute to fully understand what the other is thinking. Maybe I'm just too immature and jealous of a person to have the capacity for polyamory. My mom always said when I cared about people I would literally give the shirt off my back if they needed it, but loving someone for me is different than being in love with someone. And while I feel I can endlessly love and be concerned about someone, I just don't have it in me to give myself romantically to more than one person. Some people can, and all the power to them, but I am stuck in a rut where I know I cannot be what you need me to be - even though you don't have the heart to ask me.

We have spent the last few years dancing around ideas, growing and changing as people, and fervently trying to resemble what the other believes in. We both began isolating ourselves, becoming more and more out of touch with the people we used to be. Or maybe are? I think at this point, neither of us really know what we think or believe in. I understand you have every right to change your opinion, but when you come to questions about your fundamental values and beliefs, the ones you spent hours thinking about and felt defined you to some extent... that's on the verge of unhealthy. Especially when some of these values held significant meaning in your life and helped explained your own individual experience.

Who am I, or anyone else for that matter, to tell you or try to force you into some role you are much bigger than and have to hide parts of yourself to fulfill. We rely on each other for so much, but we have become so out of touch with each other - to the point that you feel you cannot be open and honest with me and I have to stumble upon the truth, like an idiot, from others.

I didnt think I could love a person this much, and for that, I have to say goodbye. I cannot hold you back anymore, especially not to the point of self doubt and deceit.",23Jan2020,1

91,"I'm not sure where to post this, but I need to talk about it, so I'm sharing it here.

I  live in a small street with several large and rather old apartment  buildings. Last night, a fire started in the cellar of one of the  houses, for reasons unknown. Everyone was evacuated, and luckily no one  was badly injured. Not so luckily, the fire ate its way up unnoticed and  now the roof appears to be on fire. People have gathered around (out of  the way of firefighters and police) to play music and have some drinks.

The  strange thing is, I can kind of understand them. Here I am in my flat,  eating my toast, while two houses over people's homes are being  destroyed, their lives turned upside down, and there's nothing I can do.  I've never met them, and there's nothing I can do to help, at least  right now.

Since there's currently  no danger of the fire spreading over to our building, I can just stay  home, but it feels \*so\* surreal to have a small catastrophe just happen  right next to me, but still nearly out of sight and earshot. It's been  about 19 hours now and I have no clue how long this will last. I guess  in a way, watching it all happen with a beer and some friends would make  me feel less disassociative - but also rather unempathic. So I'm just  sitting here with my toast and a vague smell of smoke, wondering if I  should just read a book or something.",23Jan2020,1

I didn’t take it personally (you can’t force these things and I knew she still thought highly of me.) We remained friends and in the following 7 years she became one of my very best friends. We would hang out frequently, have great conversations. We really opened up to each other and we had each other’s back. It formed into a beautiful bond that I truly cherished.   Occasionally the thought would cross my mind about wanting more but I was able to push those thoughts to the side and focus on our friendship. We dated other people off and on and it never bothered me because I wanted her to be happy and I did the same for myself. I focused on me while also caring about her. She did the same. I got to a point where I came to the conclusion that we would only ever be friends and I was very happy with that because she was a great friend. I didn’t look for anything more and genuinely appreciated the relationship for what it was. 

About 3 months ago now she came on to me and we went on our first date. Now she’s my girlfriend and it’s still very early but I’m already a very, very happy man. I’m in a relationship with a person who I greatly admire and respect who is also my best friend. It turns out the friend zone isn’t such a bad thing :)",23Jan2020,1
93,"I (21f) have suffered quietly with mental illness for a majority of my life, probably since I was 10. As I got older, things got worse and I feared for my life. When I got to college, I was officially diagnosed with depression, so I started to make changes to help my mental health through the suggestions of professionals, friends, and my own personal research. I go to the gym 3 times a week, practice yoga 2 times a week, meditate nightly, pray and read my bible nightly, journal, eat healthy snacks, and attend a weekly group therapy session through my university with people very similar to me.

We had loose plans of meeting on Saturday, but today she mentioned it's her mum's birthday party that day. She didn't say anything else about, so I think that's what riling me up. She didn't mention our loose plans.

96,"wasn't sure where to post this, but i'm feeling irrationally guilty about this. figured i had to share it with someone.

a few days ago, i was at home writing when my fitbit alerts me to get off my fat ass and walk around a little bit. i have a cat who absolutely loves to explore -- she's basically a dog in a chubby cat's body. i decided to let her out onto my apartment's balcony, which wraps around about ten apartments on my floor, and walk around with her.

a guy i'd never met got off the elevator and started walking back to his apartment. he was dressed in business casual, looked like he'd just come back from a job interview or something. my cat, being the intrusive little asshole that she is, bolts for his door and starts trying to get into his apartment. i walk over and pick her up. i said something like, ""sorry, she's an explorer haha."" he just kind of slowly looks down at her and says, ""ha, nice cat.""

i really didn't think anything of the exchange. i hardly even remembered it.

the next day, i got a text from my neighbor saying ""something bad happened."" i immediately called her, thinking that may be my cat had gotten out or something like that. she told me that a small army of firefighters and police had just shown up to the building. they were trying to get into this guy's apartment. i told her that i didn't really know him but that i'd bumped into him the day before.

he killed himself that night. i don't know for sure, but i think mine was the last conversation he had with a living human being. i wasn't rude to him or anything, but i wish i'd been more present with him. i wish i'd asked him how he was doing or just shot the shit with him. i had no idea that he was depressed, recently lost his job, and was having a hard time getting over his dad's death (all things i learned from my neighbor later).

i wish i'd shown him more kindness. i wish i'd been more of a neighbor to him. i know it's irrational to blame myself for it, but i just wonder if i could have said or done something that would have made things different.

i've been thinking about him a lot over the last few days. it's been a real wakeup call to me. it's so easy to pass people by, to not get involved in their lives, to get absorbed in our individual bubbles. i could have manifested more kindness in the world, and i didn't. that's something i need to change about myself.

if i can preach for a second, you never know what a small gesture can mean to people. slow down, be present with the people around you, and lead with kindness.",23Jan2020,1
97,"I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this so I figured I might as well let it out somewhere. In 2018, I lost 10kg in less than 6 months.

102,"This is a story I’ve wanted to tell for a long time because it’s seems so rare it’s crazy. I feel like IUDs loose their effectiveness over time though. I was interning with a midwife when this happened and she said she sees IUD pregnancies more often than .01% of clients that have them. I was on my 6th year with a copper one (supposedly good til year 10). Turns out the 99.9% effectiveness is from data only measured in the first year of use (Where can I petition to have long term data collected lol). 
Regardless... I knew I was pregnant the day I missed my period. Having been interning with midwives I was primed to know early symptoms.  I took a test to confirm 3 days later. I couldn’t believe my trusty IUD failed me and honestly no one else (sans the midwife) could either. Devastating. By 4&amp;5 (4 weeks and 5 days since my last period start) I used planned parenthood’s online portal to set an appointment for termination. I never considered any other option and I have no guilt. The online portal won’t let you use the appointment tool until you’re 6w since last period. I lied about when my last period was to get around this. I set the appointment for when I would be 6&amp;1 so I figured it was fine. I also did tell the nurse the truthful day of my last period at the appointment. So they knew I was at 6&amp;1 at the time of the procedure. I wanted to take the medication to just bleed it out in the privacy of my own home and went to the doctors with this intention. I did this 5 years previously and felt comfortable that I knew what to expect. HOWEVER: the doctor personally came in to my clinic room (normally wouldn’t see him until I was legs up on the table or taking the pills) while I was talking with the nurse and convinced me to go the surgical route because he needed to take out the faulty IUD anyway and if I did the surgical abortion instead it would only be an extra 5 min on the table, I could have pain medication, and he could insert a new one on the spot (instead of waiting 2 weeks). Sounded convenient and like a good deal so I agreed. Procedure went fine from my end, I was doped up and cracked some jokes with the anesthesiologist that got me through it mentally and told the doctor&amp;nurse about my current pursuit of being a doula. Afterwards they tell me I’m all set and only to come back if I don’t have a period by 8w post. 
I didn’t get a period by 4 or 5w post and I started getting suspicious because my period is normally every 28days on the dot no fail. But I let it slide because I wasn’t on a regular cycle being post abortion and they said to wait 8. But then... everything got really out of whack. I am a lifelong vegetarian and all the sudden the only meal I could eat without wanting to (and sometimes literally) vomiting is chicken. I would go to a bar and devour an entire 12pc of chicken wings. Usually that would gross me tf out. Brushing my tongue made me vomit. I was down to one meal a day because everything sounded nasty and made me nauseous. I really knew I was still pregnant because I was eating 1 meal a day and somehow getting fat. Soooo I took another test. It’s normal for there to be some hgc (what pregnancy tests test for) in urine after abortion, miscarriage or birth for some time but 7w post the line on the test was dark in 3 seconds on a test that said it took 3 minutes to develop. So the next day I went to PP  again and told them I needed an ultrasound because I was still pregnant. They tried hard to convince me to go home and wait because it hadn’t been 8 weeks yet and I was probably not but I fought them for it and agreed to pay up front out of pocket. When the doctor came in she was kind of snotty about it and said “first we are going to put the wand on your lower abdomen and when we can’t see anything we will put it against your cervix to confirm there’s nothing there”. The second she put the machine on my lower abdomen her jaw literally dropped. There was definitely a 13w fetus moving around in there. The doctor left and told me to send her a copy of the book a write because the stats of this happening were so rare. The nurse in that room was a bad ass for me and negotiated that I would go back and get the procedure again for free, a new iud for free, and refunded for the ultrasound. I had to use the same abortion doctor because of the availability in my local area and you could tell he was nervous about the whole situation. No one in the surgery room paid any mind to my attempt at conversation during the whole thing and it made the pain soooo much worse to not be distracted. During the whole process they explained to me that surgical abortions at 6w and earlier are the most likely to fail because the embryo is sooo small they can miss it with their tools. I think my story is a really good case against the laws and people that rationalize 6 weeks is enough time to realize a pregnancy and get an abortion. It’s not.",23Jan2020,1
103,"Hi all, 

I've been a long time lurker and finally decided to switch to posting (and up-voting) mode. I moved to Los Angeles for a job. It's not bad pay but in LA I've found it really doesn't go very far. At present, work in administration and supervise a team of about 16 people. I run a pretty decent program but do not have a great deal of autonomy to make changes. 

To get down to the heart of the issue, I'd love to figure out an option to make some money on the side. I work 8 to 5, Monday to Friday. With traffic, i can usually make it back to my apartment by 6. I have an MA in Literature and BA in both Literature and Composition. I've looked into avenues for being an adjunct professor or test grader but you seem to have to know someone to get anywhere fast. I'm not above dog walking but it looks like I would have to have some sort of certification and I wouldn't mind doing some writing but most of the places I've looked feel kind of ""scam-y"".

In the past year, I've gone through a lot of personal changes which have brought me to this place. I like LA and I want to make the most of it. But I am surprised by how hard it really is to do much of anything when you don't pull in a six figure salary. I have a fairly solid budget but my car is about 8 years old and needs a new transmission in the near future. If I lived closer to work, I wouldn't mind biking but I've heard public transit isn't the best.

Honestly, I know like 3 people in LA so I have minimal connections. If someone knows a different sub-community this would be more effective, I would greatly appreciate the guidance.",23Jan2020,1

Year ago I went to college, then skip some classes, and drop out becouse i was scared to talk to professors about making it up. I though that I will go to work, dreamed about being video editor becouse I know basics and I like it but I did not learnt much more, didn't made portfolio (my only works are some memes that I would not show to client) and my anexiety hold me from looking gigs.
Then I was neet for the year. I get up, smoke weed if I have, then browse Facebook and YouTube whole Day. Sometimes I will watch some series, read book or play game, but it's hard to focus on Such thing for me. I also go out with my best friend (and smoke with him) and definitely he keeps me sane.
This year I went to college again and it was almost the same like before, but this time to be honest I didn't give a fuck from begining, and now I droped it out too.
I also went to extramural film school with my best friend becouse we thought that it will help us with video editing carieer but it's different that we were thinking. I behave simmilar to college although I cared about this school more. Still did one week, improvised project(becouse I was to stressed to plan this) out of 3 that I should to this time, missed some exams for which i did'nt learned and on weekend I have another that I dont know shit too.
Parent's said that they will not pay for my school since I droped out but my grandmother offered me secretly that she will pay for that if I don't find a job
Now Im looking for a job and hope that I will find one where i can make enough money to move out on my own.
I don't know what to do with school, on one hand I don't feel that it's the thing that I need and Im scared of confrontation and have no motivation continue on that. On the other hand I could do it just to better deal with stress and responsobility, and to do some projects. And I would feel like disapointing my grandma, parents would probably judge me too.
I always dreamed about having just room or apartament in highschool I thought that I will move out to college but reality was different.
Im lonely, I would want to know some girl romantic and sexually but Im to ashamed of how I live and what I do and where I live.
I would want to see some things or travel but i never have money and if I have some I spend it on weed. My anexiety holds me too

105,"I'm banned from 2 places I would post this so I thought I would post it here actually:

I think it's funny how little people know about technology and it annoys me. Seriously, I'm at Best Buy walking around, killing time, waiting on a Dash order to come in so I can work, and I hear someone around their late 30s go, ""Can I use this router with more than 3 things?"" You're a fucking millennial and you don't know how technology works?   


I was visiting a friend at work one day and this kid was asking super ""google this you little shit"" questions. He was like 16. And I said, ""just go on Reddit and ask it."" the kid goes, ""What's Reddit?""

I...Are you serious? Hell, my parents know what Reddit is. It's like in the top 10 most used sites in the world. Literally, with a google search, Reddit is number 7. How?   


I think it's sad at the same time. Technology is all around us. We went from using the internet for what we used to use it for, talking, interacting, teaching, work, to all this bullshit we have now. The internet used to be a place where only the smart people knew how to get on. A place where you had to have your computer connected, you clicked on a special program that connected, it was dial-up sounds and then you're on. ""WELCOME, YOU'VE GOT MAIL!"" OK, it's AOL but even before that, you had to get in a special way.   


It's funny because if you watch an old 80's movie and there's some kid/teen with a computer, he's hacking"" or ""phreaking"" a phone, he was on a computer with what looked like a black CMD with green text across it. You had to be smart to know how to do this stuff.   


This isn't about the internet completely, just talking about it. What's sad is that we have infinite knowledge around us yet no one wants to search it for themselves. You tell someone to ""google it"" and suddenly it's an insult. ""Why can't you just google it?"" and they look at you like it's the hardest thing in the world. I have ""OK GOOGLE"" on my phone set up and I ask it something almost every fuckin day. What is so hard about typing this shit up?  


A computer isn't complicated, you just don't want to learn. Do you know what is complicated? A fucking car. Granted, it's nuts and bolts but compared to a computer that is already coded for you, all I have to do is get the software and install it and FOLLOW THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS. Granted, I know someone here will say, ""you just have to follow the instructions too for a car"" which is fair, but if you get the wrong part, you have to reorder it, go find it someplace else, you have hunt down specific shit for it.

We had a good heart to heart chat a couple months ago though where I was honest that it did hurt me that he wasn't there. We really got in to it and I guess it hit home for him because he ended up moving to the city my sister lives in and I'm likely to go back to (I currently live out of country). 

He's gone beyond that too. He was very supportive when I finally told him I was bi and we had a long chat about why he reacted badly when he suspected so in my teen years (he was mad I was sexually active, not that it included girls). 

Now he's liking and responding to all my facebook posts. I don't make many, but he's reacted to them all. 

I'm 30 years old now and I'm not an idiot. I know it may all fall apart. But I can also see all the little signs that this is genuine. Especially how he wants to know about how he fucked up, and he's never gotten upset with me for how it upsets me. 

He hasn't even made excuses. He has just asked about it, explained some parts, and mostly just apologized. And now he's backing it up with action.

107,"As the title says, my dads birthday is on valentines but I want to spend it with my girlfriend, but I don’t want to seem rude and neglect his birthday. Another problem is that I haven’t told anyone in my family that I have __the big gay™️__, let alone that I have a girlfriend. We have been dating for around 7 months now and she’s the first person I’ve been in a relationship with, so I want to spend it with her even if it isn’t something special.

110,"Lately my friend has been giving me the silent treatment if I ever tease him or make a joke, even though he does the same thing and I barely act mad. That's really not the premises of our friendship, we've been through a lot but today he told me that he truly hates me and hates talking to me. I asked him if he was overreacting and calmly told me that's how he felt. So I apologized for making him endure myself for 3 years. I feel like a garbage person and I just feel really alone since I don't really have any other close friends. I told him I hope we could be actual friends one day even despite me believing we were really best friends. I feel like trash.",23Jan2020,1
111,"So.. part of me really wants to change to where I feel like I fully love myself because at this time I mostly don't. My thing is is that whenever I try to do it... I feel like unless I have someone else to help me.. be there for me.. I won't stick with it..
Does anyone have any advice for that or feel the same way?",23Jan2020,1
112,"I'm just starting to get a handle on this now. We look to successful people to see how they manage their time, thinking that by copying their routines and habits as inputs, we will be also be able to yield some of their success as outputs; however, we will never be able to copy the procedure that returns that output (consciousness, mindset, motivations, neurology, purpose, talents, traumas, upbringing, values).

Ultimately, I think the answer comes from ridding yourself of distractions, and asking yourself the question - ""What do I want out of life?""

If you can answer that question, you will also be able to manage your time efficiently, because you will always be directed toward that purpose.

Without knowing your individual purpose in life, you will go through life checking the boxes that biology and society put before you.

With that said, it can be hard to settle with realization that you aren't personally driven to do anything that will make you an idol among your peers; you can finally stop trivializing everything in your life and just enjoy it, enjoy the process, enjoy the journey.",23Jan2020,1
114,"At this point this is bit speculation, but I met my best friend when I was 12, he’s seen me in a lot of weird phases but still was my friend through all of them. We obviously had some points where we were more distant and times where we were close, but now we’re even closer than ever. While I was hanging out at his house, he showed me this cute steam game called ‘Kind Words’. It’s a bit like reddit but with lofi lol while I was going through it, mind you, I know most of the things in his life and he knows a lot about me. But while I was going to the questions he asked on the game, he got frantic and was trying to not let me see. I was really confused for a second, but sorta let it go. If he didn’t want me to see something, that’s okay. As it went on, I was going through and answering other’s questions and he was just watching TV. I decided to write my own question for people to answer, So I did and got a response sorta quick, so I read the reply and everything, and I clicked the next button to see if I had any more replies to my question and I saw a question my friend had asked the most recently on the game that said: 
“I’ve been in love with my best friend for years, but she had said she never wanted to get married and that’s a big thing for me” 
I was a bit taken aback for a moment, because that’s something I always said to him. We’ve talked about our future and what we’d want, I would always say ‘I don’t want to get married, I’d be content with just being alone’. 
Now, it could be about another girl, wanting to not get married is a more common thing nowadays. But as far as I know, he doesn’t have many other friends that are girls. 
I didn’t wanna say anything about it and sorta just went back to doing my own thing on it and eventually left. 
But it has me thinking about a lot of things, should I confront him about it? Should I just ignore it for his sake? He obviously doesn’t want me to know about it. 
But the thing I think most about is being able to be with him? I’m honestly not opposed to the idea, I love him so much as a friend. He’s been there for me in some dark times and I could never repay him for what he’s done. And honestly, if I were to be married, he could be someone I’d marry and love as more. But I’m just confused, because we’re only 18 and 19 and I don’t want to throw away my youthful years to be with him. But at the same time, I could if it was for him.",23Jan2020,1
116,"No, I won't, not today. For starters. It's 1h20m to get to her place. Even if I started, I'm going to be dead center in fucking traffic at 5:30. Fuck that. I was there tomorrow. I told her that we should do it tomorrow. OK, it's raining. Then she says they can't because the company delivering the shed doesn't deliver on weekends. I'm sorry. Not my problem. Do it Monday then. I am busy every Thursday. I don't care, I am going to my weekly Yugioh Tournament. I want to go because I finally got a good deck and I haven't played in a month.

I was originally going to go over there but after finding this all out, I feel bad but also, it's not my problem or responsibility to help them. I'll do it, but not on a Thursday.

As far as I can tell, they are just making a mistake and using my phone number, but I can barely understand how they could be applying for so much stuff and haven't figured this out by know.

121,"So for the past 2 or so years I've been wanting to have a career in Maritime, specifically as a Maritime Engineer. Last year I couldn't get accepted because I failed getting my health in check to pass the physical requirements. 

But this year I lost 70+ pounds, got my high blood pressure in check and I finally got accepted. 

My mom hasn't approved of this because I'll be away from home for months and she said since I loved computers, why don't I do something with that. 

And that got me thinking, especially after today and yesterday where I figured out how to connect a printer we've been having an issue with and IT couldn't even do it. 

So I'm having second thoughts. I mean I'd love a career in IT but I feel like it's oversaturated and harder to get into than Maritime, where the older folks are retiring now and not many people know of the industry. 

Plus, I really dislike the 9-5 weekly norm and that's why I went with Maritime because I can work for months and get months off, something that probably can't be done with IT. 

I wish I had more time to think about it but I'm 27 this year and I don't want to keep thinking about it when I'm 30...",23Jan2020,1

123,"I have always believed that there is, on a quatum physical level a correct and incorrect thing do to in any given situation, its nothing to do with morals but it is about what balances out the elements of order and chaos in the universe. I know that I should give up on love but the idea keeps creeping its way into my mind. I've had romances in the past but they've never been great and since my breakup 18 months ago I have felt undeserving of love. Everything points to me not asking out girls on dates or being my authentic self with anyone I like. So why can't I give it up and persue my hobbies of painting, writing and combat sports? The right thing to do is focus on those but I feel like I am constantly reminded of what I don't have. I think it comes down to the fact that I can't wrap my head around how so many people can be liked and like others, its the one thing I can't figure out and it frustrates me.  I want to be able to be myself without worrying about affection or lust, do the things that will give me pride in myself.

I have seen the destruction toxic relationships can bring, how they can strip away individuality and drag you down to a shill of a human being, co-dependency to a shocking degree destroys people when they don't have someone there to lean on. People don't want to be alone, they really don't, I don't mind being alone but my mind wonders and I hate it. 

A few months back I was part of a musical theatre showcase, for this show I directed one of the numbers, had ensemble roles in two group numbers and performed a monologue. I made it my show and it was my shining moment of 2019, but I ruined it by letting my mind drift, I saw the loving couples and casual flings around me and It made me realize I had nothing outside of that show, and it didn't matter how much I pulled my hair out, practiced and blew my voice out to get the best out of myself, the fact that I failed to connect with another human drove me crazy and I hate the fact that it drove me crazy. I achieved something great and yet I let external forces derail me. Yet after starting to get my mind and life back on track my brain jumps around say ""why have you got anything going on with anyone"" and  won't take ""because I don't want to"" for an answer. 

I have flights of fantasy about the guy I can be, and when I think of my heroes the people I model myself after I never think of their love life's, their contributions to society is what I think of their significant others mean nothing so why do I think anyone cares about my love life? I want my legacy to be about my theatre performances, my stand up comedy, the books I want to write, my art work my contribution to enhancing the human experience. That's what I will be thinking off on my death bed not who I shared it with.",23Jan2020,1

That said I’m so very very lonely. Haven’t had any friends in 5ish years, no girlfriend in 4. I want some kind of feeling of physical intimacy just not sex. Sex seems inherently dirty and wrong to me. Idk maybe something is wrong with me. Either way I’m tired of feeling alone.",23Jan2020,1
125,"Let me give you some context. First off, I'm a 16-year-old male Muslim. During the summer before ninth grade, I had realized that I didn't really have any friends. That all my friends were just fake. I tried and tried to just remove those thoughts. So I made other friends. I moved on. But still, it came back to haunt me. The two friends that I made ended up being just boring and never talking to me. I would talk to them, but it just felt boring and awkward. And it just felt like they were not comfortable with me. I don't know why. I feel I just fuck up every friendship that I get. 

And now I have no friends in any of my classes or even in my lunch. I just sit in the library all lonesome. If I'm in the hallway walking to my next class, I see people being happy, they're in their groups, talking to each other, I see a couple walking by, and I see the people who were my friends, all happy without me. And then I just get sad, unmotivated and whatnot. All I want now is just a group of friends I can feel happy, comfortable, share things with them, and can hang out with. I just want to be happy and deal with all of this. 

School is literally like the majority of my life. I have some friends at the mosque, but not all of them go to my school. Only one does, and he's not in any of my classes. I don't see him every day though. He's got tons of other friends. 

I'm sorry for all of this venting by the way. It's been a while since I've said all of this to someone.",23Jan2020,1
126,"This is my first post on reddit, besides the one picture of my dog. English is not my first language, so I'll do the best I can.

Well I'm close to 23 years old now and I have been smoking weed for the last 6 years. It all started with a new group of friends, many of them I still talk to today. We were around 15 or 16 at the time and they already smoked weed. I always was very against it, but ofcourse curiosity got the better of me and I tried it a few times. Well it is safe to say that I absolutely loved it and I still do. 

While the time passed by, smoking weed became more regular every day. Also the amount of weed became more and more. 

At first we would buy a bag with like 4 people and then we smoked 1 or 2 and we were high as a kite, but sooner  then later we had our own bags and smoked 2 joints each every evening. 

Some of us kept it at that point, but unfortunately I wasn't one of them. It came to a point that I was smoking atleast 4 joints a day. But it might aswell be 6-7 depending on if I had anything to do that day or the day after. I did this for atleast 2 years, you kinda lose track of the time if you are high most of the time. 

Now you guys know a little bit about how it all started, now we move to the part where I decided to quit smoking it. 

For the past few years on NYE, our group of friends (the ppl that smoke weed) decide to just quit when we wake up after NYE. But every year those ppl just fail after a while and I really didn't see the point to join them in that  battle. I think i can count the amount of times I didn't smoke weed for more then 2 days on one hand, and this is only because it was absolutely not possible in those days. 
But this years was different because I finally saw that I stood still in life. The only upgrade I had is that I was hanging outside with friends with a car instead of a scooter. My girlfriend (also 6 years+ together) said it so many times but I just never really understood it or something. 

Anyway I stopped smoking on the 1st of January and after 23 days I feel worse then ever. I expected so much difference but I really don't feel or do things different. 
For example:
- I still don't know what to do with my life
- I like my education but I hate to go there since it's below my skill level and there are just a lot of douchebags on that school. A lot of forgeiners aswell (nothing against them aslong as they do normal stuff, which they absolutely don't do at my school) I ruined my other education because I was to lazy.
- I have no idea what to do on a day besides go to school , gaming and see my girlfriend.
- I am still not motivated to pick up sports or anything else for that matter.
- Even getting up in the morning is still a freaking pain in the shitter.

The worst part is that I really don't feel different and I even feel sad most of the day. I had that when I smoked weed, but a lot less and most of the time I just forgot it. 
I'm starting to wonder why I even did it. Maybe it's for the better only because my gf and a friend (girl) think it's good. 

So this is my story, atleast a big part of it. I hope the feeling gets better very soon and maybe someone on reddit could give me some advice or something. I would like to improve my life, since it stood still for so very long.",23Jan2020,1
127,"Not really sure why I'm posting here, just feeling very sad and lost and like a bit of a sad act. 

I've had to muscle my way in to be accepted for volunteering in this field and deal with some rather unhelpful staff. I was a bit worried that I was annoying everyone but kept reassuring myself I'm doing a good job. But now I've seen they advertised for my position as paid and didn't ask me to apply or even mention it to me, I'm feeling very lost. I do think I'm quite good at it and very knowledgeable in the position role, I think I would have been the ideal candidate. 

I'm volunteering as it's something I absolutely love and have endless passion for. I'd like to gain experience and get into the industry. I've been feeling quite down the past year or so and decided to go for the career change. This volunteering has made me so happy and now I just feel like such an unvalued loser. I think I will keep fighting to be included because it means so much to me, I'm ok with standing up and being persistent, but it does make me sad. Thanks for reading.",23Jan2020,1
