5,Haven‚Äôt seen anybody really brought this up but I‚Äôve realized how selfish people are when a global situation happen. I‚Äôve seen people taking stuff and over pricing things for there own benefits. Now people are panicking because they don‚Äôt have enough things because some asshole took all of it. Imagine how many old people are dying because they didn‚Äôt have there hand sanitizer. Now a lot of doctors are running out of items and they are the ones that needed it the most not y‚Äôall who‚Äôs going to be staying home all day. I can‚Äôt imagine how it would be like if a war would of ever happened in our time period. (Not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting but this is what I‚Äôve been noticing),31Mar2020,1

8,"I‚Äôve got a number of things to be thankful for. I‚Äôm employed in a sector I‚Äôm interested in. I‚Äôm saving money and can afford to fuel my life-long gaming passion (while being sensible and practising some restraint). Life would be pretty sweet if I could just be happy in myself. But nothing can alleviate this feeling. No amount of friends can make the creeping loneliness disappear. No amount of reassurance can stop me hating this body I‚Äôm stuck in. No amount of time can loosen the grip of the past around my neck. No amount of improvement makes me feel like I‚Äôm good enough. On the surface, I‚Äôm happy, I smile, I laugh. And it‚Äôs not like those emotions aren‚Äôt real. I‚Äôm not pretending. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm only laughing on one side of my face. God, I‚Äôm tired of this.",31Mar2020,1
9,"This happens randomly throughout the day when I'm not doing anything that's keeping me entertained. But it also always happens during nights and i feel like it could be the reason why i fall asleep very late. It's 2:22am rn and I feel tired but i was trying to sleep for like an hour and yet I'm still here 

So basically... I just think a lot. About whatever's my mind. Well, that's completely normal since people..think. It's not something unusual. But i can't really stop my thoughts... I can change the discussion in my mind but it's usually the same thoughts that are bound to come again and again.

I don't think I'm suicidal. I wouldn't mind dying but i would never commit suicide because I'm fine with living. I hope I don't come across as an edgy teen who's making this deeper then it is, but i really feel like this is genuinely a problem to me. Randomly during the day i get these suicidal thoughts. I start thinking about how I would do it or whatever, but they always vanish. I'm more annoyed by them then anything.

This isn't my most important problem or anything like that but I still feel like it's worth talking about. I rarely have ever even seen discussions about one's own thoughts so I would like to talk about that. What are your *thoughts* on this?",31Mar2020,1
10,"(Idk where this should go and r/confession didn‚Äôt allow it because it‚Äôs a relationship post)
So a couple of years ago I was just entering high school, in Australia, I was the tallest kid in my year and a couple years above that. I had a girlfriend at that time who was actually a year or two older than me. Although she was an asshole and really kinky to me, which is not my side of the treat but I still respected her, also she wanted to call our kids Rainbow Dash (ngl bruh moment). She also went to a different school for a year (to go see family), and when she comes back she had another Boyfriend! And she did not give a shit wether I cared or not because she acted like I mean something to her at the time. Then fast forward probably a month and she decided to break up with me for the sole purpose that I was the propelling force that made her lesbian, I knew this was gonna happen so I just moved on, no point in staying. After a couple of months I had a another girlfriend and I decided to be a bit more respecting and less tiresome, not to say that I didn‚Äôt respect the other one that turned lesbian. But due to my autism and bad adhd I couldn‚Äôt really focus on my new girlfriend who I did love at the time, I also did take the time to know her and her friends but they despised me maybe because I came off too hateful towards them or just overjoyed. I took my time to build up a relationship to the point where I had failing grades on all my subjects, fortunately it did work. Until... well, my girlfriends not the gamer type, so when me and her friend opted we could play Minecraft together on Hypixel she didn‚Äôt hesitate to decline which was really sad for the both of us since my girlfriend and her friend was my only friends so I just decided to game solo and occasionally play online with her friend, turns out Skyrim is not the best game for most woman (and because of my mental disorders playing long range games like Skyrim helped my disorders a lot and let me forget about the real world). She hastily broke up with me saying that ‚ÄúI was ignoring her feelings and that game made her sad how I got to focus on that instead of her‚Äù, and how she was ‚Äúshowing me hints that she was sad‚Äù. then she got all of her friends to judge me and hate me and this all happened in one week where she just heard about it, although my girlfriends friend was still cool with me she did hate me... I do miss her sometimes because she was the only person relatable to me and not a douchebag. Although maybe I should focus on better things. Thanks

P.S. if you guys find any other subreddits I should put this in, can you tell me?",31Mar2020,1
11,"I mean fuck... The pandemic itself is pretty crazy. So many countries, so many dead. Its really shown how as a whole nobody was really prepared for something like this. We've all been so comfortable with the status quo it starts to feel like nothing will ever change- But then COVID comes into play and the world just... Comes grinding to a painful halt. Maybe its for the best- Maybe moving forward we, as a species can prepare for the next big disaster but honestly? I doubt it. 

But its not just the virus thats blowing my mind here. Its the global societal implications of this whole thing. Im a cook, and like me about 700k of the 1.2 million service workers in my country of Canada are now unemployed. How long can this last before restaurants start going belly up? How many service workers are going to move on to new careers? I miss working but Im happy to sit on my hands for the moment- Especially with the CERB money my gov is gonna give me. But what if this is still a serious thing in six months? At what point do we realize the entire restaurant industry is going to die? Now add in all the other industries effected by this... And the numbers get mind boggling. People keep acting like this is going away in a few more weeks but the data seems to suggest otherwise. How does society change to cope? Can society just stay, frozen and stagnant for a whole year? It really goes to show how shaky everything is with so many people absolutely fucked without incomes. Maybe its time to consider something different?


Not to mention how quick people are to lose their composure or even support crazy shit like letting the government track peoples locations to make sure they're self isolating. Like THAT won't come back to bite us in the ass after this is all over. Im already uncomfortable with the idea of bars and stores scanning your ID to be allowed in. Never mind expanding that privacy violating bullshit.

Or the idiots not taking this seriously. Which is still a thing somehow. Fuck you for laughing about this like its all some conspiracy. Or the complete and total fuck wits hoarding basic cleaning supplies and toilet paper. Seriously- what the FUCK are you morons going to do with all that TP? We're 3 weeks in and people are STILL buying out all the stores supplies of TP and lysol wipes? WHO? WHY? Idiots.

What are things going to look like in a year? Two years? It seems like we're going to be dealing with effects from this pandemic long after its become a bad memory. This is the new normal.",31Mar2020,1
13,"There were these long aisles The robot was  similar to the one in one of the robocop movies. The one where they tried to make another robo-cop but used a psychopath and addicted it to drugs to control it. 

It was  plodding and slow at times, but could be VERY fast. It would slowly walk the aisles and if it heard or saw you it could run to try and catch you and ill you.

You could hear screams somewhere in the store of a customer who was found by the robot and killed. 

In the store there were they very long aisles and at first it was fucking terrifying going down them because the robot could appear at the end of one if you were stuck in the middle and it could catch you if that happened. So you spent time at the ends ... watching for the robot. And it could easily see you if you were at the ends if it was close by and you were peeking out from the ends of the aisles. 

There was also a section of the store where there were countless rows of lockers (dreams don't always make sense) and other customers had figured out you could get inside to hide if the robot got near.  ANd get out once it passed. And I did this too. 

You could hear the robot approach at first then it learned to be silent. The robot was kind of stupid at first but slowly learned in a kind of stupid robot-way. Once it realized that people were hiding in lockers it would stop and randomly open one. Which just added to the suspense (and terror)... especially if you were in a locker and watching through the vents and see the robot suddenly stop nearby and open up a locker next to you.... find no one... and then move on. 

Some people were also getting stupid (cocky) because they figured out they could hide in the lockers and then get out and know they were safe once the robot passed. This was before the robot learned people were hiding in the lockers. People were acting cocky and dumb. 

I remember thinking that these people are going to definitely die... you you are stuck in there with them. 

The lockers were empty and often filled with spiderwebs (and possibly spiders), which added to the scariness whne you had to suddenly jump in one as the robot passed. Once you got used to jumping in lockers a new problem started happening.... some lockers were full and you couldnt jump inside them and had to quicly try another... and THAT one would be full, so you had to try another hoping it was empty before the robot approached. 

I was also hiding behind store product on the shelves and other things  until the robot passed. One time we could hear the robot in another aisle (next to ours) and one nearby customer dropped a pair of pliers which made the robot come to our aisle so we had to hide quickly. 

Before I woke up I was stuck in an aisle and had to hide behind a few big packages of toilet paper. I had to lay down behind them because the shelves were not fully stocked. 

SOr some reason I was with tiffany amber theison (was my girlfriend) and we got separated  and was very worried about her getting killed by the robot. 

It was a scary dream but also... kind of fun as I had never had a dream like that before.  

Sorrry for the rambling. I just woke up and wanted to get this all down while I could remember it all.",31Mar2020,1
14,"Today has been hard. I went through his facebook, looked at some pictures and read some of his old writing. I don't really have anybody to talk to about him. We had a falling out shortly before he died, but he tried to stay in contact. I never got to tell him that I loved him and how much he meant to me. My dad says he thinks about him every day. Recently we were able to talk and I learned that a lot of guilt I had over his death was unfounded. In my head I found a way to make every minor thing I did some reason for him to start using heroin again. It used to be that crying about his death was the only time I felt justified in living. I'm glad I'm okay with crying, it feels good. He has a collection of crust punk and metal records that I feel guilty for not listening to. I just don't like the style of music, and it sometimes makes me angry that that music might have influenced how he decided to live his life. Glorifying drug use, and telling him participating in society is useless. At one point I was angry at him for what it was like growing up. He was in trouble a lot, and didn't do well in school. So I could fly under the radar by just passing my classes, and no one really paid much attention to me. I felt like he didn't do what a big brother should, toughen me up and prepare me for life. But I think he let me be me and loved that person. I think he accepted me more than anyone else ever has or will. What has made me the most sad was when I realized I'll never get to know the man he would have become. Overcoming so much, having so much life experience, it would have been a privilege to have that person in my life. And get to be 50 or some shit and just talk to him about life.",31Mar2020,1

It's not as bad as it might seem. You won‚Äôt believe me for anything if I show you where I live. This is a small town on the edge of the country. Have you ever heard of class cancellations due to bad weather? A typical phenomenon. Do you like winter? Here winter lasts six consecutive months.

In fact, this post is not about how great I feel. In fact, you are separated from the whole world. Not much - there is Internet here! But ... You are obviously deprived of the joy of traveling, being confident in the future and in general in your future.

Have you ever felt this? Lack of understanding of what will happen next. Studying brings only disappointment and even greater misunderstanding.

Until recently, the only joy was the sunset, which could be observed every evening from a huge window in the room. I was very depressed by the fact that people from big cities, in fact, never see the sunset or dawn as I saw it. Directly from under the horizon, as if at sea.

18,"
It taken me a long time to actually get this out. 2015 was a different time for me, I just turned 20 and to be honest I was lost. I had a close group of university friends and it was awesome. They were truly like a second family - 7 of us against everything else. Which sounds suuuuper cliche. 

One friend in that group, let‚Äôs call him Jake, and I were particularly close. I don‚Äôt know what it was but we just clicked instantly, it was like I‚Äôve known him for years even though we met the year before. He had a girlfriend who lived in a different country and they saw each other maybe twice a year (either he‚Äôd go there or she‚Äôd come here) but Skyped a lot.

I ended up catching feels and I felt very confused and guilty. One night while we were very drunk and a little high I confessed my feelings to him on a phone call. He told me it was late and to drink water before I go to sleep. We didn‚Äôt mention it again. Not for about a month at least. But we kept hanging out like nothing was different so I just tried to ignore it and push away my feelings. 

One night we were watching a movie and both fell asleep, he had his arms around me when I woke up. There was a part of me that liked the feeling but another that knew it was wrong. I didn‚Äôt move though I just went back to sleep. I woke up again to feel his lips on mine. I looked at him and his eyes were shut, I thought I dreamed it. I moved and stood up, he asked were I was going with his eyes still closed. I said I had to go to the bathroom and he asked me to come back when I was done. I laughed and made some joke about how my phone was charging there anyway. 

When I came back into the room he was sitting up and staring blankly at the wall ahead. He looked over and said, ‚Äú I‚Äôm sorry I had to kiss you. I can‚Äôt pretend I didn‚Äôt want to‚Äù. I remember those words perfectly. I made some comment about how he shouldn‚Äôt and then he said, ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt feel wrong though, did it?‚Äù He really did look genuinely curious for my answer. 

We talked about what happened hours and agreed it shouldn‚Äôt happen again. That didn‚Äôt last long. We started making out in secret every chance we got. No one knew and it was a very weird time for me. I felt guilty because of what I was doing. I felt confused because I didn‚Äôt know what this meant about our friendship. I had feelings for him. I couldn‚Äôt deny that but what we were doing was so wrong.

He would say things like ‚Äúif she wasn‚Äôt around we‚Äôd be together‚Äù and then say he can‚Äôt leave her. He would send me messages about meeting up and then end it early to go call her. 

Then one night it happened. We were both drunk and we had sex. It was great to be honest, we were so sexually compatible. After that night I knew nothing was the same. I felt lost and broken and used and torn up but at the same time he was my best friend. Jake and I had a bond, we told each other everything. 

Our little affair continued months, until I got a boyfriend and I officially ended it. Since then nothing has been the same. We talk briefly and infrequently. I haven‚Äôt seen him in person for 3 years. He is still with her. 

I saw on Facebook last month that they got engaged. All those feelings I had cake rushing back. I think there was a part of me that still thought we‚Äôd end up together. When he was drunk he would say he loved me and would hate to lose me. 

I was stupid and naive and I can‚Äôt help but feel regret for my actions. Although a part of me wishes to have him back. I want him back in my life. Sending me memes or pictures of helicopters with arms. Stupid inside jokes we had about music and watching picnic face together until 6am.

BF never invites me over to his place

Hello all! My (34f) bf [31m] and I have been together almost 11 months now. We both live about 30 mins from each other. We both are divorced. We spend as much time as we can with each other, he works very long hours. We do lunch dates a few days a week and spend a Saturday night together. Never overnight though. I understand his job is stressful. We however, hardly spend the night together. The very few chances we do are spent in a hotel. I have asked him why he never invites me over and he says his roommates are pigs etc... he has met my mom and been to my house. Is this a red flag? How can I approach the situation without looking so sneaky? Is he hiding something bigger here? I would hate to know that he‚Äôs hiding something. What would you do?

38,"I was in an abusive relationship for two years. It didn‚Äôt seem that way at first, but apparently those around me had their suspicions. There were red flags constantly throughout our relationship. Even almost a year and a half into the relationship I still chose to ignore them because ‚Äúall we ever did was fight about things‚Äù and ‚Äúthere was not a day that went by that I didn‚Äôt cry‚Äù and my partner ‚Äúwished things were how they used to be in the beginning‚Äù. 

To /clarify/ some things: I stopped working, my mental health was decreasing, my anxiety was at an all time high, and I also got a birth control implant in my arm as well as an oral birth control. The birth control took a toll on my mental health and let me tell you I would not have wished those 6 months on my worst enemy. I had what I self-named ‚Äúoutbursts‚Äù, bursts of confusion and rage, I couldn‚Äôt explain it and I couldn‚Äôt control it. I wanted to die. I wanted to bang my head on anything I could find. I never wanted to hurt anyone else, I did want to throw things, but I never did. My partner didn‚Äôt know how to deal with this‚Äîquite literally how he stated it. 

He walked out on me during the worst panic attack I ever had. My parents left the country, my dog was put down the same day, I didn‚Äôt know how to handle being alone. He walked out because I was crying too much and hitting my head. He said he was going to call the police which made me panic more. He left. He would say ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to breathe like that‚Äù when I had an anxiety attack, and that he‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen through this before and it‚Äôs just a maturity thing‚Äù (he was 6.5 years older), I‚Äôll ‚Äúgrow out of it once I grow up‚Äù. He always wished I was older so we could move out and move on with our lives.. I live with my parents and they ‚Äúbaby me‚Äù.

December 7th was our 2 year anniversary.... but we were on a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù. We were on a break because he wanted me to figure out how to get better and come back to him when I was. Yes, he said that. We had been on a break for probably 2 weeks. We agreed we wouldn‚Äôt see anyone else. A week went by and we were distant, I was giving him what he asked for. The second week went by and we hung out way more. Almost back to normal. We were sleeping together, going to dinner, acting... normal.

One night we were in the middle of sex and he said to me, ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre not talking to anyone else‚Äù. I was really confused because we agreed we wouldn‚Äôt talk to anyone else. I clarified this and he agreed. He told me to tell him that my body is his, still during the act. Afterwards we showered and he asked me how many people I‚Äôve slept with. This was odd. 

We go on our anniversary trip. A week later he‚Äôs having car issues, not unusual. He stops by my house to pick up his spare key because he left his at work. I offer to make him food and ask if he can stay and cuddle a bit, he declined. He was supposed to go back to work. 6 o‚Äôclock hits, he should be off of work now. I check his location as I want to make sure he‚Äôs out of work before I call him. He‚Äôs not at work, he‚Äôs at a bar. I call him. No answer. I text him, ‚Äúhey, call me when you‚Äôre out of work‚Äù. He calls me. I asked where he was, he dodges the question. I say ‚Äúthe reality is I have your location and it says you‚Äôre at a bar, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù He said he‚Äôs embarrassed and he will let me know what‚Äôs going on later. But he can‚Äôt talk now. I said ‚Äúok, I love you and I trust you, let me know later‚Äù. He turns his location off. He never went home that night. The next day I walk in on him with a girl naked in his bed. She flew in from out of state. They met on Instagram. 

Skipping on some of the absolute outrage that I expressed, I actually ended up taking the girl back to her air bnb, she didn‚Äôt know he was dating me. A week later and he managed to convince me for a second chance, but I found out he didn‚Äôt delete the girl off of Instagram. He couldn‚Äôt. For weeks and weeks he didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt let him have a chance because that‚Äôs all I asked for and he couldn‚Äôt do it because I was so ‚Äúmean‚Äù to him, and she was so nice to him. 

I blocked him. For awhile. He emailed me on Valentine‚Äôs Day. I answered. The conversation was so normal and refreshing. I saw him the next weekend. Our personalities meshed so well together and I missed the normalness of it all. We slept together. I stayed until 4am. When I left I didn‚Äôt kiss him because I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted and this was very soon for me and I didn‚Äôt want to lead him on. He accused me of using him for sex. 

Skipping some more details of me having a panic attack over a picture he posted.. I found out the picture was taken out of state. Somewhere north because it doesn‚Äôt snow where we live. I found out he went and visited the girl he cheated on me with. And she had come down 2 other time as well. They had apparently been dating. But me and this girl managed to catch him again. Added him to a phone call with both of us on it. 

It‚Äôs been about a month since I‚Äôve had any communication with him, it was that last phone call. My anxiety has decreased significantly, I see my friends more, I started working again, my relationship with my family is better. I have learned so much from this experience. I‚Äôve gotten closer with myself and I am able to be more empathetic with my friends. 

But lately I cannot stop thinking about him. I don‚Äôt want to be with him, I know he is bad news for me, he hurt me more than anything ever has. It‚Äôs very upsetting reliving many of the old memories, good and bad. I know it‚Äôs part of the grieving process but I‚Äôm so sick of it. It‚Äôs a very defeating feeling, especially since I‚Äôve come so far. 

Since the corona virus outbreak I‚Äôve been home alone. I‚Äôm with my family and I have pets but I miss my friends. I was finally able to get back a sense of normalcy of what life is like outside of an abusive and manipulative relationship. And now it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs been taken again, obviously under very different conditions.

39,"Any time I post on TrueOffMyChest on my main account i for some reason get one downvote and then my post is seen by nobody, let's hope this place is different.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reading Normal People by Sally Rooney and it really speaks to me I think. A couple years ago I would have told you that I think it's stupid when people say books ""speak to them"" but I guess that's because I didn't read books.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the two main characters are Connell and Marianne and they are, well, damaged. Marianne's family situation is abusive as hell and Connell is just empty. Marianna feels like she doesn't belong anywhere and exists to be used by people. At first she felt above people and soon she realizes she's just as shitty as the people she judged. Connell was popular in high school but after a  few failed relationships and the death of a friend and much time spent with Marianna he also believes he has no place in the world and is pretty depressed. I have not finished the book.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like Connell a lot I guess. I'm in college and I just don't really see a future for myself I guess. I wanted to study Wildlife Bio but I suck at STEM and even the most basic of classes are kicking my ass. I thought maybe I could be a Lit or Creative Writing major except I haven't really read for fun since elementary school (just now getting back into it). I don't write much but I like when I come up with something I'm proud of. Too bad my comments and such through my various accounts always get buried. My dad says I might like being a surveyor, like plotting people's land and such but that's pretty math heavy which I'm also not great at.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I don't really have many skills. I played Trumpet in high school band and my town's youth symphony but I don't really like playing trumpet anymore. I want to learn piano but I just can't find the motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I should move backwards a bit to give anyone that actually reads this an idea of maybe why I am the way I am. My family isn't very affectionate. I've been told ""i love you"" by my dad once in all my life and I basically had to call him out on it. No physical affection. Not much ""proud of you son"" kinda stuff. In school I had friends until I moved districts around 6th grade. Never really found an actual group of friends after that. If I had to guess when the depression set in, I would probably say around 8th grade. I guess that's when I started to notice people didn't really want me around and were usually just too polite to tell me to go away. Some people did that in high school though. I never really got a group then. Insecurity and frustration at myself led to me just lashing out at people and ruining potential friendships. That happened a lot. It kinda started a cycle I think. Me not having many friends leads to me not really developing social skills which makes me awkward which makes people uncomfortable which makes them not want to be around me. You see how it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in college now (as I said before) and I THINK I might be finding a group but they make me feels pretty unwelcome sometimes too. A lot of them seem to hang out and not invite me or talk about things that happened with all of them there but I don't remember it. And when I AM there with all of them I kinda get ignored a lot of the time. I guess two of the girls met for breakfast  nearly every day really early in the morning and now are the best of friends. They went to Utah and Glacier Park together and  are temporarily living together now I guess?

&amp;#x200B;

I still have issues with expressing myself in a healthy way I guess. I haven't really lashed out I think like I did in highschool but I have made some offhand comments that in hindsight make me feel like an asshole. I just wish I actually had, like, friends I guess. Because I can say at best I seem to have acquaintances. There were some people that I think could have become friends but they were all exchange students that won't be there when actual in-person school resumes in the fall. I talk to one of them here and there. But I doubt that will last with the distance and them working on their Masters thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what I was hoping to accomplish by writing this. I guess that book has me feeling kinda down again and I just wanted to jot down some feelings maybe. Books and TV shows that show like damaged people or psychopaths or whatever always make me feel this way. I'm not sure why, it just puts me in a weird mood for hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm done?",31Mar2020,1

Then we'll see how much you think this is any other Saturday. It breaks my heart.

41,"I‚Äôm a 22 year old male who has been out of college for about a year now. Around last August of last year I had decided I wanted to move; I needed some new scenery, I wanted to make new friends, wanted to experience anything. Through some bad luck and poor timings I hadn‚Äôt been able to move yet. Now with everything being locked down and working from the same room that I sleep in I‚Äôve never felt a greater urge to just run away from everything. I look at a screen all day long and I feel like a prisoner trapped in my room. 

I want to go some place quiet where there aren‚Äôt screens, where I can silence out the news for a little while, experience nature. I just want to be able to clear my mind of everything for a little while but with everything going on, I can‚Äôt.

Anybody else feeling this way right now?",31Mar2020,1
42,"So, since being quarantined myself (I‚Äôve only been dealing with the quarantine for a little over a week now because where I work was trying to keep us open as long as possible, but then they realized that we really needed to shutdown‚ÄîI work at a thrift store). I‚Äôve had to deal with some interesting experiences. 

Within the first week I went with my dad to pick up pizza and I ran in to get it. I was standing at the register when an older gentleman walked in with a mask on, and when the lady went to hand me my pizzas this dude sketched out and practically flew against the wall like I had the Black Plague. The lady at the counter and I just kinda looked at him and I thanked her, but as I turned to leave I saw that this dude had NO FREAKING SHOES ON!! He made sure to wear the mask, but not his shoes??

Going outside has been weird. I‚Äôm not even talking like the stores or anything cause I try to really avoid that as much as possible. Just going outside to get the mail. Our neighborhood is very lively and usually full of pre-teens riding bikes around and neighbors hanging out in the front. It‚Äôs been pretty eerie and quiet every time I‚Äôve come out to get the mail. 

My family goes to a church that is pretty small and mostly seniors, and the pastor encouraged people to do something very, VERY stupid. He said for a few people to meet in the parking lot and practice ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù by conversing with one another from their cars... this led to my mom showing me a Facebook Live stream of about 10-12 people (mostly seniors and one lady only has one lung and survived a bout of cancer) basically having a little party in the parking lot of our church. There was absolutely no ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù being practiced either. It mad me very angry because these are people that my my parents call friends willfully being ignorant while my brother and mom (who have serious health conditions) are taking every precaution to not get sick right now. I don‚Äôt have a very good picture of church to begin with and shit like this makes me want to leave the church even more. 

Then, today (I did not witness this myself, but I felt this needed to be shared) my mom tells me how when she went to the grocery store the cashier told her how awful some people are. The worst was one lady took off her mask and coughed all over the machine. 

I really hope we see an end to this soon.",31Mar2020,1

44,"I know thats a callous thing to say in times like this, I feel bad.   I've been depressed before, like really depressed. I'm back home for now and I drive past the highway divider I wanted to crash myself into one day.  I had to pull over to a gas station and calm myself down.  I think of everything i've ""stuck around"" for and it just...isnt worth it.  My life isnt bad, its probably better than average by most measures.  But the best moments in my life? It takes immense effort to recall those feelings.  The best love I ever had, greatest concert I ever went to, getting into college, getting the job offer I wanted.  Those were feelings that faded after days. Every terrible thing in my life I remember so much easier.  And it all reflects onto me.  My poor performance review at work, bad grades, rejection, these things all get written onto me and define in my mind my worth as a person.   

There's just been more bad than good, my life hasn't been worth experiencing. I'd trade all the pleasure i've felt just to feel that much less pain. 

After my darkest episode of depression, after being suicidal for years, I finally got on meds.  And I feel better but everything feels a bit like an epilogue.  Like im not actually supposed to be around anymore.  I dont think im going to kill myself.  I wouldnt want to hurt my family.  But life just feels like such a unasked for burden",31Mar2020,1

49,"I was thinking of circulating the finished product amongst my friends/close colleagues and encouraging them to write in as well.

First, I'd be very interested to hear what you all think, whether you agree, disagree, whether you think the point is well made, that I've missed the point etc. 

Thanks,

""Dear X ,

I'd like to know what X is doing to demand safe working conditions and proper remuneration for nurses working in exceptionally difficult circumstances in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The value our skills have has never been clearer, the danger we face at work on a daily basis has never been greater. The poor condition our facilities have been allowed to fall into has never been more apparent. The resources, staffing, and equipment made available to us were already stretched to the limit pre-COVID. What now? Now we watch on as nurses are dying in first-world countries as a result of doing their job.

I am angry that the current response from the broader public seems to fall mostly into the category of 'hero worship/martyrdom' (organised clapping events) or 'feel-good' gestures (free pizza for front line staff). Meanwhile, healthcare professionals‚Äô workplaces are becoming more unsafe than ever, PPE is being rationed, equipment and facilities are barely fit for purpose and in short supply, nurses are not being paid or remunerated in any way to account for the extra complexity, workload and risk, and in some cases being told they should be grateful and are 'lucky to have a job'.

Hero worship‚Äô is a way of justifying inaction on the dangerous working conditions and egregious circumstances that nurses are now faced with. 'Feel-good' measures are a way of refusing responsibility for our safety, of avoiding paying us more or equipping our facilities properly. We are not heroes. We did not ‚Äòsign up‚Äô for this. We are skilled professionals trying to do our job, and we are a resource that is being exploited.

I‚Äôm concerned that some of the measures being floated to increase hospital capacity show a lack of understanding about what acute care nurses actually do and how skilled they need to be. I‚Äôm frightened that this lack of understanding exists in the top levels of government. Sending student nurses in to assist? This implies at least a little bit that student nurses with partial academic achievement and limited practical experience are a short jump away from being competent professional clinicians. They are not. Doubling of ICU beds in Australia? Great, but who will staff them? Again, the implication is that it is easy and quick to upskill nurses with no or limited acute care experience into these roles. It is not. It takes years for our best to train to this level of competence. Standards of care will fall. Patients will die

We need leadership against unsafe working conditions. We need more PPE. We need revised ratios to properly reflect increasing acuity in our hospital system. We need increased wages or remuneration reflecting the skill of specialized nurses working in acute care outside of/parallel to ICU (e.g Acute Haematology/BMT). We need more cleaning and maintenance of our hospitals, more admin staff, more support staff, new buildings to house our biggest inner city hospitals which are falling apart with age and will be hit hard.

Our government has the power and authority to make real changes to support and respect the work of nurses and other health-care professionals working in acute settings. If not now, when?

Sincerely

50,"I found out on Sunday that at some point over the weekend my mother (75 years old) suffered a stroke. I live 4 hours away, and my family down there had the police do a wellness check on her. They found her laying on the floor in her bedroom, conscious but unable to speak or move.  


I don't know many of the medical details other than there was bleeding in her brain from it, and they couldn't do surgery but I believe were able to stop the bleeding. Because of COVID, family is unable to even visit her, so she's sitting alone in the hospital with nobody there to hold her hand or offer words of support and encouragement. She has minimal movement in her fingers, cannot speak, and can turn her head when they call her name. Fortunately we are in contact with the Chaplin who has offered to relay messages to her for us since nobody can visit. 

  
I don't know if I have the strength for this. We lost my father a few years ago - he died right in front of my mother from a severe heart attack. She has been alone ever since, which has given her bouts of depression but she has also enjoyed generally good health and the ability to live in the house my grandfather built on her own.   


I cannot stop thinking about how that has been ripped from her in the blink of an eye. She was laying on the floor for who knows how long, scared and alone. Now she's in the hospital alone, unable to communicate. She lost her independence, her freedom to do what she wants when she wants. I don't know if I'll ever hear her voice again. This is the absolute worst thing that could happen to her, so much so that I know that she probably wishes she would have just died. That's how much her independence meant to her. I can't stop thinking about what must be going through her head right now, the suffering she is experiencing, being trapped in her own body. It's killing me.  


She put everyone else first her whole life, and this just seems so unfair for her to go out like this after having fought through so much shit her whole life.",31Mar2020,1

53,"(This post is approved by u/AgitatedSpinach5, the subject\[M\] of this post.)

After making a post on a subreddit to make friends, I got messages from a boy (I‚Äôll refer to him as M). Looking into his profile, I realized that people have been identifying him as a ‚Äútroll‚Äù. M made a bunch of posts asking people to be his friend, and messaged many people asking for help. I decided to talk to him anyway and see for myself, as he seems like someone who desperately wants help.

After knowing him for 5 days (and talking with him quite a lot), I want to write this post to response to the information about him being a troll, as well as to introduce him to this community. Note that I have decided to trust him for the most part, and I don‚Äôt agree with labelling him as a troll. Please protect yourself in any case.

I hope this post will contribute a bit in leading him to help, and advocate for a friendly and empathetic community.

The reason M got labelled as a troll

It is understandable that M got labelled as a troll, and people have been spreading the message so that others won‚Äôt fall into the trap.

1. He has multiple accounts, he gets a new one when an old one got banned. The post history of these accounts are similar, consisting of posts with titles and contents along the line of ‚ÄúPLZ HELP ME‚Äù or ‚Äúplease talk to me‚Äù, posted to many different subreddits including social subreddits and mental health subreddits.
2. He also mesages lots of users. He talks about crying and screaming nonstop, that he needs help and wants someone to be his friend. However, he is naive and non-understanding in many ways, which makes conversation exceptionally hard, and potentially harmful.
3. The number of posts and number of users he messaged are high enough to have him banned.

With these points, it‚Äôs reasonable that people, especially a few users who had more elaborate experience with him, have warned others of this troll, and advised others to not interact with him. For detailed description see: [https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/ddf5bn/l\_please\_be\_kind\_to\_me/f2gib00/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/ddf5bn/l_please_be_kind_to_me/f2gib00/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

How M is NOT a troll

I know M‚Äôs behaviour has more or less made him a troll, but with my interaction with him I believe it is not intentional.

1. While a part of what he says seems untrue, it is consistent. It is possible that he does believe in what he said however untrue it seems or is.
2. His intention is genuine. In these five days of interaction with him, he has not tried to make me do anything, except to help him get a friend in different ways. A troll or someone with malicious intentions is not likely to spend all these time and acts to get to nowhere. You will see his kinder side if you get to it, but his frustration takes hold a lot.
3. He has denied any history of mental illnesses. I cannot diagnose him as I am not a professional, but it is evident that he is struggling with communication and mood problems, and according to him he has no social support and also cannot function in daily life. He doesn‚Äôt speak and act that way to annoy people; he does it because that‚Äôs the only way he knows.
4. He is vulnerable in ways. And he has encountered bad people on reddit which added to his despair. According to the chat logs he showed me, someone tricked M into sending them his money, by guilt tripping M into helping. There were also many rude people who told M to kill himself. These are unacceptable in all cases.

M asked for help and indeed he needs help, but as the troll warming mentioned, what he really needs is beyond what the online community can offer. M wants someone to help him, and he insisted that the help he needs is a friend and that will save him, while he likely needs social workers and professionals. He wants someone who will be nice to him and will not abandon him, which is tbh an innocent and humble wish. The thing is he wants to be saved and satisfied, and he doesn‚Äôt understand how friendship works for other people.

I hope we don‚Äôt label M as a troll anymore, and hopefully with some more genuine interaction with people, he will one day get the help he really needs. That said, I am fully aware that precaution is needed.

Points to note in interaction with M

First of all, please be serious when you decide whether to interact with M. If you are not ready to commit into a difficult and genuine conservation, it is better for you to do nothing and not interact. If you decide to interact, please be patient and empathetic, and note the following points.

1. Set boundaries. Know clearly what you will and will not do, and define your role. I say define your role because you may approach him as a potential friend, or as a helper. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt be both, but these roles do have different requirements. If you decide to be a helper, adapt and try to understand and convey your messages to him, and help him with things within reasonable boundaries. If you decide to be a friend, be yourself, be kind and casual, but committed.
2. Keep check of emotions for both of you. Either of you may need time away to rest and calm down during your conversation, and it‚Äôs okay, give each other time to rest, and take a rest anyway if you need it.
3. Be gentle, but direct and clear. You may find him not understanding you and keeps repeating things like ‚ÄúI need help‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy are you doing this to me‚Äù, ‚Äúthen kill me‚Äù and sad faces or gibberish. Acknowledge his frustration, but don‚Äôt lose your stance.
4. DO NOT ENCOURAGE HIM TO KILL HIMSELF. YOU SHOULD NEVER DO THIS TO ANYONE. 
5. Don‚Äôt let him insult you, and don‚Äôt insult him either. Please take very good care of yourself.
6. Know that most likely you alone won‚Äôt able enough to solve his problems, you are not expected to (despite what he tells you).

Although I have written all these, I know that I am just one ordinary person who don‚Äôt have the power to save M, and this long post here may not even be appropriate. The reason I made this post is to make things clear, in hope that bringing this to light will help in a way. Maybe you will encounter (or already encountered) him when you make a post, or you may try to get in touch with him after seeing his posts or this post. In anyways, I hope things will get better, for M and for everyone. Please feel free to comment if any part of this post concerned you.

56,"I want to start off by saying how thankful I am to be talking about how to carry this journey forward. Ever since my 20‚Äôs and I jumped into a lifestyle of weed, alcohol, cigarettes, and klonopin. I want to dive into one of the most effective ways on how I was able to start this journey. For the longest time I conceded in Klonopin and gave up on a life without Klonopin. I was literally bound to this form of medication for the past ten years of my life and it really stunted my growth for a long time. After meeting my fianc√©, she really helped me discover the learned helplessness in my life and areas in which I needed to stop the pathological lying. If you can relate to this, seize the moment to change your life for the better. This huge step for me got me into a process in which I started to quit the negative habits in my life. 

The process of deleting my excessive drinking and smoking was a significant prerequisite to my journey to getting off of klonopin. If you are addicted to any substances besides kps, start with those addictions before moving onto a benzo. I started off by quitting cigarettes and than moved onto e cigarettes. I quit smoking e cigarettes and stopped smoking shatter from my bong. This took several months but was well worth it. My life consisted of smoking a bowl of marijuana a day, drinking, plus kps. I realized that drinking was a huge damper on my health so I decided to quit drinking. A few months later prior to a trip with my fianc√© I decided to stop smoking. This was a huge breakthrough for me because I never thought I would be able to quit weed. 

These small steps of eliminating these habits/addictions helped me feel the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù victories that would lead to a momentum to quitting Klonopin. My life was getting better and healthier and I was loving the best/new version of myself. For months I settled on kps and thought i was going to be ok, but after some time of deep thought, I decided I did not want to live a life where I relied on a pill to get me through. My path towards completely getting off of klonopin took a two month taper. For three weeks I fluctuated between 2-4 mgs. The next three weeks I went between 1-2 mgs. The last two weeks I was between 1-.0.5 mgs and then I jumped. 

One of the reasons why I am writing this is that reading a lot of comments, posts, and online research, it was very intimidating. As an individual who is going through this I want to let you know you can do it. Easier said then done but I was exactly where you were sitting and reading with anxiety. I want to give you the most important advice I can before I go into a couple of little ones. Suffering is the point of entry. You must accept the fact that you will suffer but this concept is a necessary fact in any endeavor in life. If you are venturing out to start a business you will suffer with the amount of stress, deadlines, and work hours but the suffering is worth the prize at the end. If you want to be in a healthy relationship you must suffer through the process of removing as much toxicity in your life. 

The first few weeks are going to suck but I looked at the suffering as a momentum of progress. There were many days when I had vision sensitivity, weakness, nausea, nightmares, lack of sleep, decrease in sexual anything, migraines and muscle aches. These were tough and they will be for you but focus on the prize at the end of the road. I got through my acute withdrawal by going for long walks everyday. I didn‚Äôt think to much about these long walks but I realized that they were important for my mental and physical health. The worst thing you can do is lock yourself in a room. During those walks I would have nausea and blurred vision but the active lifestyle helped me sleep and keep my appetite. The worst part of my acute withdrawal were the muscle spasms and migraines. I still have muscle spasms and they effect me especially at night but they are getting better. Treat every day that passes as a win because they are. These small goal mentality will help you achieve the big goals with much ease.

One of the things I would recommend is if you are honest with yourself in regards to substances, weed helps a ton. Weed may be a great substitute for your gaba receptors rather then anything else. The weed will help with your sleep, nausea, migraines, muscle spasms and appetite. These may vary per individual but it worked for me and I believe my case was a tough one due to 10 years use with 4-6 mgs. The next step is an important one which is try to find someone who you trust to help you through these tough times. Whether it is family or friend this step can really be helpful. For me it was my fianc√©. We have a very healthy relationship and I was there for her to help her when she switched seizure medications and I needed her. I was very upfront with her in regards to what I will face but why I wanted to do this. This honesty about what‚Äôs to come will be of great use to you.

For the really good part after 41 days am I 100 percent there? No but I believe I am at about 80 percent of the way. There are tough days but the greatest thing I realize is that I can never imagine taking klonopin ever again. I have my self respect back and recently got into law school so I am looking into every avenue to become a better version of myself. To all of you who are about to embark on this journey, you‚Äôve got this. The very fact that you are here is a very important and life changing moment. Remember that you were a slave but no more. Gaining back your freedom has a cost but it is worth suffering for a little rather than becoming a slave to something for life. God speed",31Mar2020,1
57,"This exact quote is like the biggest buzzword phrase of all time. *Any* time anyone says a word about mental illness people just say ""get help"" and think they did such a good deed.


Lemme give you a few reasons why that isn't helpful:


1. Like I said every single person says those exact words and don't even usually change it up in the slightest. They could say ""try therapy"" ""have you seen a therapist?"" ""Have you considered seeing a professional?"" it's always ""get help."" It feels super cheap, dismissive and just feels like you typed the fastest thing you could that could still morally license you to do whatever you want for the rest of the day. Like you're using that person's pain to fuel your own ego. It's cheap.



2. Since we hear it every goddamn time, *we know.* We know that's what we're supposed to do and people may or may not be doing it for their own reason but you won't be the revelation that makes somebody do it just by saying that. Nobody's gonna read it and say ""oh wow I hadn't ever thought of that""


3. It's impersonal and dismissive. You'd be better off saying nothing in my opinion because it shows the person you're not actually interested in helping, and again it's moral licensing. ""Look at me I helped! Hey everyone aren't I such a good person?"" It says *you* don't wanna be the one to help, but boy are they fucked up.


4. *We probably have already. It isn't always as helpful as you think.* Here's the conversation that happens:


""get help""
""I have""
""You need to try different therapists""
""I have""
""Oh...uhh..good luck then""


Everyone thinks the process is mentally ill&gt;see therapist&gt;cured. I've been seeing therapists (yes plural) for about 5 years. I've found a bunch I didn't work well with at all. I'm on my sixth now and I don't think I like him either. I take therapy seriously, never miss appointments, do everything they say, give it my open mind, and it's never worked. Yes this has been in conjunction with medication too. I've tried close to 10 meds now that also haven't worked. 


5. Not everyone has the means to. Speaking from an American perspective, this shit can be impossible to navigate and get access to. If you have insurance at all, you might only have one or two providers in your area, the rest don't have open appointment times that fit your schedule, they don't take your insurance, are too far away, etc. Then out of those two they might not be a good fit for you (and yes it's extremely important to find a therapist that personally fits you and your needs. Most people can't just go see any random therapist and benefit perfectly from the relationship.), at which point you're SOL. Or they might take your insurance and be an ok fit but the copays might still be more than you can afford, or you might not be able to see them as often as you want, etc. The mental healthcare system is a shitshow and doesn't work for a LOT of people. I didn't even talk about people who have no insurance, but they're probably completely screwed. Sometimes there are free or low-cost options but they're usually really hard or impossible to find outside of urban areas, and the quality of care may not be as high. 


So don't just comment ""get help"" on someone's post. If you need to say something like it to do your good deed for the day at least phrase it differently, I don't know why people say that *exact* thing but they do. 



Way more helpful to just acknowledge their suffering. A lot of mentally ill people are used to people downplaying and invalidating their feelings and it can be more valuable than you probably realize to just say ""wow yeah that's really hard."" 



If you don't know what to say then these cookie-cutter responses might seem helpful but they're really not. You're better off saying nothing in my opinion.",31Mar2020,1

These last few weeks have been crazy. Coronavirus is wrecking our world and my grandmother passed away a week ago to a long battle against dementia. For me, leading up to 2020 life had been pretty simple. I had fallen in love with my ex about 4 years ago and we broke up due to long distance after 8 months. We are both in college now and we knew it was for the better. I know it wasn't that long of a relationship, but to this day I still think about her. There's never a day I don't have a fleeting thought that passes through my head regarding her; i still truly love her. I've tried everything to move on but nothings works. Deleting memories from my electronics, trying new relationships, moving away for some time. Nothing works. With that said, and as the tittle gives away, her mom passed away a couple days ago. This all seems so surreal to me. her mom was an absolute joy to be around and to now think that she's gone is just heartbreaking. She texted me the day it happened to let me know and ever since I haven't been able to get this pain out of my head. I texted her back giving my condolences but she hasn't replied. It's such a mix of emotions that I had no idea existed. It absolutely breaks my heart to imagine the place she's in right now. I know no words can express the type of sorrow her and her family must be going through, but it just destroys me to think what all this must be like. I haven't slept in the last few days because I keep thinking about her and what must be going through her head. We're still very close and I want to help, but knowing my past with her it's difficult. I'm no longer the same person I was to her and I need to give her all the space she needs so she can navigate these tough times. I also find it necessary to give her space so she's not overwhelmed. The last thing I want to be is a burden for her. She must be getting millions of messages regarding what has happened and I can only imagine how stressful that must be. I want to give her everything but unfortunately everything right now is a simple acknowledgment that I'm here for her. Words are hard to find that'll console her and I think the best thing is to let her know that she's loved by so many and that we're all here to help. Now, i'm struggling with this. I want to reach out again and see if I can help, but I know that's a bad choice. I have two conflicts in my head going at each other and it sucks so much. I want to help the girl I love, but I don't want to be annoying and overbearing. I know for a fact that the right choice is to let her decide what role she wants me to play in all this is, but it's so hard. It's so interesting how something like this can teach you some very meaningful lessons. Sometimes you just have to learn to bite the bullet so  you can do the right thing. I guess there's no clear point to this, but it's so nice to know that there are people out there that are willing to help and just listen through all these tough times.

I have been in a serious relationship with my boyfriend since 8th grade, and this month, we hit the 5 year mark. I know that sounds crazy, but I think I am ready to move in with him. We are both freshman in college right now and we go to the same university. I wanted to live with him at the start of this last school year but my parents told me that it was too soon to be living with a boy and that they would rather me live with girls first and decide what I wanted to do after this year. I respect their thoughts and opinions, and that sounded reasonable, so I ended up living with 2 other girls. It's been good, but I have been spending the night with my boyfriend every single night. My parents agreed to pay for my rent as long as I pay for my schooling. So basically, my parents have been paying for an empty room this whole year. Keep in mind, my mom knows this. I told her that I was wanting to live with my boyfriend for real this upcoming year and that we would have two other roommates, one being his older brother. She absolutely lost her mind and denies ever saying that I could decide what my living situation would be after my first year.

I am kind of in a pickle. I know I will probably end up living with my boyfriend, his brother, and our other friend next year, but I am scared that my mom will cut me off and tell me to figure out my own way to pay rent as a sign of disapproval. She has never really been fond of my boyfriend either, but I think it's because I am the youngest child and I am the only girl so she feels like he is taking me away from her or something?? I don't know, he's a great guy and obviously we work well together. I just don't want my mom to end up hating him for something that I want to do.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Or have any of you been in this situation before? I feel stuck and I feel like I should have full control over my life at this age. I shouldn't have to feel like I have to pick between doing what I want in my life and pleasing my mother's opinions.",31Mar2020,1

I‚Äôm trying so hard to keep it together and pretend that I‚Äôm okay, but I‚Äôm not. This pandemic, this virus, it‚Äôs just the sort of thing that could kill someone with my condition. If I get it, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll die. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it. 

I‚Äôm not ready to die. Sure there have been lots of times I almost did without realizing it. I was angry that I didn‚Äôt die then. I‚Äôd rather be oblivious than know it‚Äôs coming. My life is so wretched and sad. 

No man will ever love me. I‚Äôll never have romantic love. I thought I did once but he lied. He told me he didn‚Äôt want to pretend anymore and didn‚Äôt want to have to care about people like me. My own country doesn‚Äôt want to care about people like me. They‚Äôd rather I die to ‚Äúsave the economy‚Äù than live wretchedly.

I don‚Äôt blame them. I don‚Äôt want to be stuck with me either. I want to get better and stronger. I just want to be normal. Then maybe he would‚Äôve loved me. Maybe they wouldn‚Äôt leave me.

But I will never be normal. I‚Äôll die with this disease, and it could happen very soon.

I don‚Äôt want to die. 

Why couldn‚Äôt he love me?

Why can‚Äôt I matter?

76,"I don't believe I've done anything that has impacted other people in a terrible way, but I can't help but feel like a shitty useless human being. As of now, I have three lingering thoughts in my head that make me feel like I'm a horrible person.

For one, I often complain about my life to myself, even though I believe that my friends are going through worse. I mean sure, my living space is cramped (living in a family of four with in a one-bedroom apartment), and my parents are always at work. However, despite that, I've been living a decent life of playing video games and watching anime. I should feel content, and yet a part of me wants more to life, and compensate this feeling by complaining on how ""miserable"" my life is (to myself, of course). I have friends with divorced parents, and friends who are neglected and/or mistreated by their own parents. Yet, they live (in my eyes) a life that I believe is much more fulfilling than what I have. My friends, well most of them, partake in a part-time job and/or in a sport, whereas I'm doing nothing with my life despite having a more desirable condition of living (or that's how I see it, at least). 

Then there's that one time I rejected someone. I'll try to keep the story short, but I was hanging out with a really bizarre friend group that I eventually detached myself from. One of my now ex-friend was transgender, someone who I thought was a girl but identifies as a boy? I don't know how genders work to be honest (no offense), but this certain individual (let's call him/her Casy) confessed their feelings to me. Before that though, they've told me of their life at home, how their parents were were abusive for being transgender and how they were going through depression. Casy have also told me how one of their friends committed suicide and how they feel responsible for this girl's death. I remember some of Casy's friends telling me on how I was their reason for living. I couldn't handle the responsibility of Casy's emotions, especially since I was going through depression myself, so I rejected their confession. I wasn't also comfortable with the idea of dating someone who's transgender, since I'm a straight guy. I would have remained friends, but then one of Casy's friends told me that they set up this elaborate plan to have Casy confess to me behind my back. I couldn't help but feel betrayed, and thus I broke off from their group entirely. Since then I've tried getting my life back together, in which I did, but only temporarily. I sacrificed my friendship with Casy in exchange for a better life. He/she is still alive and still goes to my school, but I can't help but wonder if they're okay.

One final thought that lingers my mind is the one time I ""simped"" for a girl that I considered my friend. This girl (let's call her Faye) and I were classmates in Chem Honors and Pre-Calculus. One day she decided to ask help with her Chem homework, and I obliged. We started talking with each other more frequently in our Chem and Pre-Calc class and gotten to know each other quite a bit. Honestly, Faye was the only person I actively wanted to get to know. I don't know why I forced myself to do this, but I gave her a Spiced Pumpkin Swiss-Roll one Friday morning after she joked about how she would get hungry every morning (because she rarely ate breakfast). I thought I was being creepy when I stood by her next class, but she gave me a playful hug when I offered her the morning treat. I originally did it as a concerned friend, but now I became infatuated with her. I even emailed her my phone number after school so that we could talk more frequently. When texting I kinda got flirty with her, but played it off as a little joke. My big mistake, however, was doing the same thing again (giving her a morning snack). I must have been desperate that time, since I wasn't really being my usual self. When I texted Faye that I was waiting by her class, she texted back saying that I should just get to my next class in a cold tone. My heart sank when I read that, and that moment plagued me for the rest of the school day. I actually cried pathetically when I got home for about an hour (though I cried while nobody was home). After that, I sent a really long text to clear up misunderstanding and to tell her how I really felt. She actually took it well and let me down easy, stating that she wanted to be friends. Over the course of time, our texts slowly became shorter and shorter, until I eventually ghosted her. Actually, I was the one who always initiated first, but since I've always felt like a bother to people, I just stopped talking to her entirely. This one thought has made me feel the most shitty, and has been responsible for my continuous regressing state.

Faye, if by the off-chance you come across this post, I just want to apologize for causing you a lot of trouble.

I feel a strong, painful stinging sensation in my leg, like someone had jammed a needle in there and was injecting something bad. I wake up a bit after the pain stops, and come to the conclusion that I was drugged with a shot at the end of my dream, which ironically did the opposite of putting me to sleep.

That day, I check my calendar. What almost scared me is the calendar said it was time for my monthly shot! I would have completely forgotten if had I not checked it. I go to the clinic and receive it. It wasn't even painful at all, unlike my dream.",31Mar2020,1

86,"From a very young age, I have been playing violin. It‚Äôs like a ball and chain to me. I have never been very passionate about it, often dreading practicing etc. Instead, I‚Äôve always loved filmmaking, storytelling, and art (and am naturally better at it). I often pushed those passions down to replace them with violin, since it was required of me. It always hindered me from doing the things I truly cared about. I‚Äôm utterly sick of it. I was very much looking forward to graduating highschool and finally getting away from violin, so I could freely pursue and live up to my potential in filmmaking (don't need a degree for this, better to go straight in). For this, I was confident in my plan of not going to college, and instead doing a different online program. I knew college wasn‚Äôt for me for several reasons, one of these being that I wanted to be free of all things that would hold me back. The plan was heavily thought about, and not a conclusion I came upon recklessly.  

I wasn‚Äôt going to go to college. And the only reason I applied to one was because of a deal made with my private violin teacher who works at that college. Turns out, I got a full ride there on a music scholarship. How could I pass up a full ride? Knowing that many people would die for this opportunity, I felt awful about not being happy. In fact, after the news, I felt so sad and conflicted to the point of wanting to vomit. Not an exaggeration. I‚Äôve been yearning to get away for so long, only to be confronted with the notion of being trapped in the same situation for another 4+ years of my life. Putting off my goals/happiness AGAIN in place of violin. I would have to be a music major. And if I go, I would double major in something like digital communications. Not film, because if I get a degree I at least want to get something that could be used as a stable backup/supplement to what I actually want to do. But still, the idea irks me. Do i really want to suffer for another 4 years, just for the sake of getting a backup degree that i may never need? It seems silly to me. But then again, it's hard to pass up this kind of opportunity. I can't make up my own mind, so any advice/contributions are greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",31Mar2020,1

90,"I‚Äôve left my teens and have turned 20 today. But it just doesn‚Äôt feel right. So much is going on in the world, what with COVID 19 and what not. And on top of that, my personal life and health just seems to be falling apart, so I‚Äôm just in a more or less terrible place mentally, holding on by threads, at frikkin 20 years old. I feel so lost, despite being on a certain path. I hate it; I feel as though I waste my energy every day doing stuff that is ultimately going to be irrelevant and useless to what I want (which I don‚Äôt actually know what that is btw). It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know what I want to do with my life, but I know it isn‚Äôt this. It‚Äôs so exhausting and overwhelming to just be going through the motions in life, where everyday is a shitty, what seems to be pointless, motion.

I remember this time last year I also made a post on this sub (which I deleted because I was embarrassed hah), talking about how lonely and lost I was feeling, and that none of my ‚Äòfriends‚Äô had remembered my birthday. Well, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs gonna be the same today. I was just texting one of my ‚Äòclosest‚Äô friends and not a word about my birthday, yay me. And the fact that I more or less feel the same, if not worse, blows.

But it honestly just doesn‚Äôt feel right to complain about the fact that he forgot it. Or that everyone else is probably going to forget. Because there‚Äôs so much going on in the world right now, what importance is the day I was born? Not much. And, I suppose it really is just another day, that I so happen to turn 20 on. 

Well that‚Äôs my rant. Not really a rant, more so word diarrhea. Oh, and did I mention I turned 20 today? Because I turned 20 today.

101,"My workplace is refusing to shut down temporarily. We manufacture cardboard gift tubes, like those that accompany wine and whiskey bottles. This is the epitome of non-essential work.

The working environment is such that if/when the virus enters the factory, it will spread like wildfire. It is a hands-on environment, with people sharing materials, equipment, products and stationery. Finished products are often passed person-to-person.

Many colleagues are near retirement age, and many have families with vulnerable members. Their families are adhering to isolation, but it is nullified by our having to come to work. We initially were given the option to self-isolate, but must use out SSP and holidays if we want to receive payment. Lately, some people have been refused permission to isolate out of work.

Certain procedures have been implemented, all of which are inefficient, inappropriate or ill-applicable, seemingly for the employers to 'cover their backs'. Their attempts to separate workers by two metres are futile because of the highly mobile and interactive nature of production lines. Certain positions require their holders to interact with every other employee consistently during the day - no measures or guidelines have been introduced in regards to this. These positions particularly widen the risk for the factory as a whole (if an infected colleague enters, the rest of the staff will be contaminated).

There are many other foul, unjustifiable aspects relevant. We are becoming every more fearful for our health and for the lives of our loved ones as a result of these managerial decisions. The health of our c.100 staff has second priority to our cardboard gift products.",31Mar2020,1

I‚Äôve been stuck in quarantine for about two weeks now. I currently live in the US and I‚Äôm living in one of the top COVID-19 states in the country. For that reason we are on complete lockdown except for essential employees. I currently work for big chain retail company in a processing center (which was deemed non-essential) and my SO works for a logistics company (Essential). During this time I am at home not working while my SO is working from home. 

During this time of quarantine I‚Äôve learned I can be a bit annoying. I‚Äôm extremely quirky and super goofy, my girlfriend is not. I tend to entertain myself by dancing or randomly singing (horribly), etc. I also enjoy getting attention from my SO on a regular basis so being in quarantine intensifies that by 1000. So, yes I‚Äôm needy. I‚Äôve apologized to her probably a million times already about my neediness but she‚Äôs laughed it off and called me silly for thanking her. 

This quarantine has made me realize how much she puts up with because she loves me lmao. This may seem silly but it means the world to me. I know I‚Äôm annoying, i know i can be a bit much to handle at times but she still loves me and during all of this shit that‚Äôs what really matters. I‚Äôve never ever doubted that she loved me but this just seals it all for me.

About six months ago I applied and was selected to join a much larger law enforcement agency. However my wife expressed concern about the time commitment. Normally this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem however we had a newborn at home. So we agreed to defer the offer for six months. 

For months I wondered if I had made the right call. However life‚Äôs goes on and I focus on the task at hand. My agency is currently helping battle the COVID-19 virus which means a lot of stationary posts and double shifts. This brings us to two days ago.

Luckily my agency has us trained in Narcan and CPR. After three rounds of Narcan and several minutes of CPR EMS arrives on scene and the man regains consciousness. 

After the dust settles I go back to my command and my mind begins to wonder as I fill out the paper work. Had I taken the job six months ago, had I not had four cups of coffee today, had I used a different bathroom would this man had lived? Long story short I now believe fate is real.",31Mar2020,1

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to.

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

I just wanted to let you guys know that there is hope, this is probably a lesson to mankind, but we will tons up for our mistakes and learn to be a better species.

113,"My brother (22) and I (17F) have shared a room since I was born, so we already spend a lot of time together (whether we'd like to or not lol). 
But still, this quarantine has made me realise a couple of things. The foremost being that even though we don't show each other affection or support in the traditional way, I'm okay with our relationship as it is.

I'm okay with it because last night, he put on some of our favourite bands on his speakers and we danced around the room, head banged and sang along to the lyrics till 3 am.

I'm okay with it because when I make a dark/nonsensical Gen Z joke and my parents roll their eyes or get upset, he'll chuckle because he gets it and shares the exact same sense of humour.

I'm okay with it because a couple of days ago he bought me a can of Pringles. I'm always the one who buys him food/gifts. He rarely ever reciprocate. But this time he did.

I'm okay with it because after my parents gave me the scolding of my life, and I cried in front of them for the first time in years, he put his arm around me for the first time in ages and told me it was going to be alright.

I'm okay with it because even though we smack each other on occasion and hurl insults 24/7 (and sometimes those insults can really sting), I know that that's our way of being playful and showing affection. 

So, even though we cringe at the thought of saying I love you or squirm away from hugging each other unless something terrible has happened, it's okay cause at the end of the day, we know that we can laugh together when life gets depressing, or give each other a good smack just because we felt like it, and that's really all we need. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I just had to say this somewhere cause actually saying to my brother would make me feel uncomfortable af lol",31Mar2020,1

115,"Well, this video sums up my feelings about it. https://youtu.be/Xv-GBQV8zY4",31Mar2020,1
118,"We got a call at 3am from a local hospital, apparently her caregiver/roommate sent her to hospital because she was really weak but she had been sick for a couple of weeks. Her heart stopped around 1:20am, she had pneumonia and we won‚Äôt find out the results of her COVID-19 test for a few more days. 

This is just the icing on the cake right now, here‚Äôs a rundown of the highs and lows as of recent:

January 2019 my ex tried to kill me in my sleep, with no warning whatsoever after a really chill two year relationship.

February 2019 Scott moved in to help with my boys because he‚Äôs someone I trust and they really enjoy being around.

Also in February Scott gets sucker punched by a customer at his job and they refuse to do anything about it so I convince him to quit before something worse happened to him.

March 2019 my crazy ex calls Child Protective Services on me, they come out, inspect my home, talk to my kids, do a background check on Scott, see that it was all harassment by my ex and close out the case.

My landlord‚Äôs response to this was to give me a 30 day notice. 
I‚Äôm living on savings at this point with nowhere to go. Two weeks in they decide I can stay because my file was closed out with CPS.

May 2019 my mother gets kicked out of her place because she was living with my brother and they had a falling out. I let her move in because she‚Äôs my mom and despite how strained our relationship is, I‚Äôm not about to let her be homeless.

June 2019 I took unpaid medical leave due to 2 slipped disks in my lower back and was informed by my doctor that I would never be able to return to the kind of work I was doing.

July-October living on a combo of mine and Scott‚Äôs savings and my mom‚Äôs rent contributions, she‚Äôs still paying down loans taken out when she was with my brother so it‚Äôs not much, but helps.

September Scott goes to the ER with chest pains, it‚Äôs high blood pressure and an issue with his lower left ventricle. He gets on meds and gets things somewhat under control. 

November 2019 Scott gets a warehouse job making good money, starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. My depression is in overdrive so I don‚Äôt get my disability appeal filed, still haven‚Äôt as of current.

December 16th, 2019 Scott goes to the ER with leg pain, he‚Äôs told it‚Äôs a pulled groin and sent home. Over the next two months he has to take off from work repeatedly because the pain keeps getting worse in his leg, by mid February 2020 he‚Äôs only able to walk with crutches and forced to take extended medical leave from work.

February 20th, 2020 Scott goes to sit down in a kitchen chair and his femur snaps like a twig. He has emergency surgery on the 21st to repair the broken femur and is diagnosed with cancer that caused the soft spot on the bone and led to the break.


March 15th, 2020 my mom‚Äôs last day at work, she‚Äôs laid off due to her place of employment being considered non-essential because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Around the middle of March Scott was calling his mom regularly to check in with her, she was sounding a little out of it, but she usually does due to medications and health issues. We hadn‚Äôt seen her since the end of February due to suggestions to socially isolate. 

And that brings us back around to where we are.  Scott has appointments at the end of April to start his radiation treatments, he‚Äôs  looking at 5 weeks of 5 days a week.

We have to call the funeral home tomorrow and figure all of that out.

My mom is going stir crazy because she‚Äôs not used to social isolation so she‚Äôs pissed off everyone in the house, and I have three teenage boys living this nightmare with us as well. I feel the worst for my kids because I‚Äôm trying to hold things all together for them but that‚Äôs not working so well for me right now.

I know there are a lot of people going through some horrific things right now, you are not alone and it‚Äôs all terrifying. I‚Äôm trying my best to hold things together as long as I can and I hope you can too if you‚Äôre struggling right now. It‚Äôs easy to want to give up, but there will be better days. 

I share my rough times because it feels good to get it off my chest and helps put it all in perspective. I don‚Äôt know where rent is coming from, or bills, or how we‚Äôre going to pay for my mother-in-law‚Äôs funeral arrangements, but right now I‚Äôm in bed with my cat snuggled up between Scott and me and as soon as I get done typing this I‚Äôm going to do my best to relax and hope tomorrow morning brings a better day.",31Mar2020,1
121,"Well, this is a bit sad, but i want to share it, maybe I am not the only one. 

So because of the whole Corona pandemic nearly the whole world is in quarantine or at least social distancing. I live in germany and here we currently are not allowed to go out with more than another person, we are not allowed to meet, no parties, no school, many stores closed, etc... Many people here whine about it. They are frustrated and some get even depressed. I heard about a hotline for Corona-depression and suicide. And I'm just like, WTF?! Yesterday they made a drama in a TV news show about how horrorfying this is for couples. It really makes me start to roll my eyes and shake my head. Because, if all those people whine about this, what would they do if they had my life?! Because, the (sad but true) thing is, for me actually not much changed! 

I am 24, i have no boyfriend, never had one and maybe i am asexual, idk. And I also never had any real friends. I don't know a lot people. Tbh I don't know anyone except my family, and workmates. I have no real hobbies, especially not with other people. My life is sad. Some of it is part of my own fault, and some because of cirtumstances I can't change. I rarely go out. Most days i spend in my room, sitting on my pc. Not because I love it, but because i got nothing else. I have no friends to meet. I don't wanna drink and party. And i am even ok with that. I mean, most people are... strange. Nobody is like me, I am an exception with my whole identity. (Other views, other tastes, different lifestyle etc.) I have lots i can do on my pc or other things alone at home. It is even that much, I will never be finished. I am never bored. And I need some time for myself every day. I cannot understand these people who need action for 24/7 and permanently people around them. Don't get me wrong, I'd REALLY love to have friends and i wish to finally have a best friend someday in the future. But what makes me angry is all the whining and hysteria everywhere right now. I hear this and I'm like bitch please, this is the way i have to live for my whole life! I even think it's fair because now nobody got a better life than me, now everyone knows it. To me this is normality. I'm in my room, i go to work, i ride my bike alone just for fun, i go shopping from time to time. Social distance? Haha, everything is normal for me, i live socially distanced for 24 years. And THAT is the real sad thing, isn't it? I am so used to it, that i don't even feel lonely or so. 

I don't know what answers to expect. Maybe i hope i am not the only one that doesn't feel a difference being now in social quarantine...",31Mar2020,1
122," I thought, I would share something, I wrote about on my blog, mistakes that people tend to make in a relationship. I hope you find this informative:  


**One of the biggest mistakes people make in their relationships, is giving unwarranted advice when people vent.**

It is the most frustrating thing for the recipient to deal with. It is also difficult for the person who gives the advice since usually the person venting is not pleased or won‚Äôt follow the advice. When people open up about how they feel or have a problem, more and more today, it seems people are eager to give advice or try to fix their problem. This is a mistake because one, it‚Äôs highly inappropriate, no one asked for your opinion, they simply wanted to express themselves emotionally. Second, most people do not want you to take responsibility for their problem, it is their problem to figure out and your job to support them in that endeavor. Unless you are an expert in the topic or they ask for your opinion there‚Äôs no need to give it out. But yet so many people do? Why is it so hard to resist?  


People like giving advice when others vent because: it can be a chance to feel some sense of power or feeling in charge of a relationship or it feels good trying to fix a problem or they could be seeking validation for their good advice. But all of this is very selfish, it is selfish. Because if you truly were trying to help the person, you would stop and think how can I help them? Would giving unsolicited advice be helpful? Have you even thought about their situation long enough to arrive at a good opinion? Or did you do what everyone else does and give advice as if they were you, shared your thoughts or had similar life experiences to you. You likely did the latter.  


What you fail to understand is that the person who is venting has already thought long and hard about their situation, they have already probably read some advice or they even heard many times before what to do. But what you don‚Äôt understand is that they emotionally are not ready to solve their problem and what they need is to work through their feelings. What‚Äôs worse is that by continuing to do this, people will start to see you as the person to not be vulnerable with. Ask yourself do people confide in you? Because if not maybe there‚Äôs a reason? Women have long understood this, often women have been the victims of unwarranted advice. Which is so frustrating, because all women want to be able to confide in their boyfriends.

**Just listen, people don‚Äôt want to hear about your opinions, instead they want to feel HEARD and UNDERSTOOD.**  


In fact, if you actually do this, they will be a lot more open to your advice. Doing this will do more for them than anything you could advise them to do. Just by letting them talk through their pain and nodding you are validating them, they will feel less isolated. When you give them life advice, it can lead to them feeling more alone than before. They might think no one listens to me or understands me. Instead hold back judgments against them and simply support them. If you don‚Äôt know what to say, you can simply say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you‚Äù. Just by doing this, they will be more likely to take action than they would by listening to what you have to say. People often find solutions on their own to fix their problems, especially when they are given a chance to express themselves unfiltered and accepted for who they are and given unconditional support. By listening to them they will feel appreciated and it will deepen their trust for you and the relationship.¬†",31Mar2020,1

125,"So, two days ago (Sunday) I broke up with my girlfriend. For the forth and final time. But the issue I have is that I usually go further then I want to cause I keep waiting for that moment when I fall in love. But my gut tells me from the beginning that she‚Äôs not the one, and that has happened before in my life. I‚Äôm currently going to a psychiatrist and eating prescription medication (to help with my moodswing) and honestly I don‚Äôt think they help that much. 

I overthink and over feel everything all the time, and have a problem staying in the present. And it always boils down to me not being sure if I want to be with the girl or not, and it‚Äôs killing me inside. I‚Äôm not consuming any type of alcohol anymore, due to my former life as a sex lunatic on the nightclubs for ten years. I‚Äôm a good looking male (34y) and honestly hate the fact that I‚Äôm doing this to a person I feel for. 

Don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this on Reddit, but my best friend is out of town and I just need to get this of my chest. I just wanna be happy for my self and do thing because I WANT to, not because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs expected of me. That cross have been mine for to long to bare, but I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a loop.

129,"This is something I experience quite frequently. I see it with my siblings, my closest friends, and a lot of online posts and comments.

I cannot speak about Asperger‚Äôs, but the first thing to understand about Autism is that the disorder it is on a **spectrum,** meaning, the severity of symptoms can vary between different people. I can attest, with a certain degree of confidence, that I am on the higher-functioning side.

When your average adult says ‚Äúautism,‚Äù I believe they are actually using a profoundly ignorant blanket statement to describe a person on the low-functioning end of the spectrum.

When I was around 5-7, I was diagnosed with ASD, and in hindsight it made complete sense. To begin, I have very little memory of my childhood. Only small fragments. I barely talked to anyone. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to, but because I was so unaware of the importance of socializing and making friends that it never occurred to me that it was something I should do. Making friends isn‚Äôt something that you learn in school, so I didn‚Äôt learn about it until at least junior high. 

Here‚Äôs another peculiar thing: you know how some guys and girls are critically aware of their reputation in school? About that ability to perceive and manipulate how other people think of you? I wasn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt even know I had a reputation. I had basically no idea that people deliberately avoided me, and that people actually cared enough to spread rumors about my behavior. 

Sounds nice in hindsight, but to tell you the truth, I was a very lonely person in K-12.

I believe memory retention plays a critical role in autism spectrum. Memory is knowledge, and every human being is actively learning. If you can‚Äôt remember your social experiences with people in childhood, you can‚Äôt be expected to act upon those past experiences you forgot ever happened.

As I grew up, I became increasingly self-aware of my own idiosyncrasies. For a good example, I feel like I‚Äôm supposed to be aware of maybe 20 important things going on at any given time, but I‚Äôm only really paying attention to 5. This sometimes leads to blunders where I‚Äôm not thinking about the full consequences of my actions, good or bad. 

Being aware of this problem allows me to target the issue, analyze my thought process, and develop a strategy to deal with the problem. Suffice it to say, with consistent therapeutic counseling, I ‚Äúgrew out‚Äù of my autism by the end of high school. People no longer perceive me as being weird or creepy because I have the awareness and humility (unlike some) to admit I have mental problems I need to fix. 

As a final note, when I entered college, I was exposed to cannabis and psychedelics for the first time. I am personally shocked and amazed by what these substances have taught me about the reality we live in. LSD has taught me more about myself and my condition than any therapist ever could. It‚Äôs how I made the connection that my poor memory of childhood was linked to my social skills.

However, I am appalled by the realization that my peers in K-12 were actually using these substances prior to college.

To conclude, the problem is this: many people believe autistics see the objective world differently. My own sister insulted me once when she asked me to help solve a puzzle ‚Äúfrom my autistic point of view.‚Äù Like come on! I‚Äôm not *that* different. The only difference between me and anyone else is my interpretation of what‚Äôs going on, and how I may react to it.

130,"Slowly deteriorating Self-Esteem and Confidence. Loneliness is killing me. How can I make my life improve from this point.

Since a young age I‚Äôve been made fun of every aspect of myself. My forehead, my nose, my lips, my dark skin, my hair, etc. I‚Äôm sure everyone has went through some sort of name calling at a young age. But for me in particular, it was virtually everyday. I was considered pretty funny in high school and I would usually make fun of myself to hide the fact that I didn‚Äôt like being constantly made fun of. I couldn‚Äôt get away from these comments unless I distanced myself away from the people I talked to. I did and the loneliness I felt when I was with my friends only multiplied.

140,"When I (32f) was about to turn 20, I was diagnosed with Lupus, an auto-immune disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue. For me, it was attacking my kidneys. The doctors decided that high doses of steroids and chemo would be my treatment. I did 12 rounds of chemo over the course of a year along with the steroids. The chemo did it's job and the Lupus activity ceased. I started going to beauty school and was trying to be a normal 21 year old. 

About 6 months in to beauty school, my hip started hurting. I went back to the doctor and  was diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis, a disorder in which joint tissue collapses and dies due to lack of blood flow. So at 21 years old I had my first hip replacement. The doctors told me it was unlikely that the necrosis would travel to my other joints, but 6 months after the hip surgery, my shoulder collapsed. After that it all kinda went downhill and the necrosis traveled to my other hip and shoulder, and eventually both knees. I ended up having six total joint replacement surgeries over 4 years, the last one being a total knee when I was 25. Eventually I will have to have them all redone, as none of them will last a lifetime. They don't really bother me now, I hurt every now and then, but I feel lucky that my Lupus is in remission.

Instead of constantly staying inside and laying in my bed I made an effort to surround myself with people as much as humanly possible and to go out and do fun things as much as I could. And I gradually started to heal and to find myself again. And then the coronavirus happened, and I was sent home from college to live with my family.

144,"Maybe my sense of taste changed (which can happen). I have had clinical depression for almost 3 years now and I have definitely noticed food tasting bland and I barely have an appetite for really anything unless I‚Äôm to the point where I‚Äôm starving and need something in me. 
I noticed that people seem to enjoy junk food a lot, and it confuses me because I don‚Äôt really find it that enjoyable. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, not all junk food tastes bad to me, it‚Äôs just most things. For example, chips. I‚Äôve tried a decent array of chip flavours from different brands but none seem to be that tasty. The reason I finish a bag of chips if I buy a bag is because I don‚Äôt want to throw the rest away in the trash, so might as well eat the rest even though it doesn‚Äôt have much flavour. Typically, I can finish a bag of chips in a few days, like 3 or so. I have also noticed ice cream isn‚Äôt that good. Almost 2 years ago I used to binge on ice cream. I practically ate it everyday. Now, it just doesn‚Äôt taste sweet anymore, and it simply tastes like I‚Äôm eating frozen milk. It‚Äôs not like I have a high tolerance to sugar, I‚Äôve actually reduced my sugar intake for weeks but sweet foods don‚Äôt taste as sweet anymore. One of my biggest dislikes is cake, which may sound crazy. But even as a kid though, I didn‚Äôt find cake that tasty. I only really liked ice cream cake as a kid (not anymore though). I always found the icing on cake to be too buttery and unpleasant, the cake itself to be too buttery as well, and simply not sweet enough. I also dislike pastries.

148,"This might be too specific for some, but I couldn't help posting it because of the current pandemic going.

Two years ago, I was applying for bunch of grad schools for spring admission, which is uncommon because most funding is for incoming fall masters/Ph.D students. I applied to like 20 just to make sure I have somewhere to go, and I got in like 9 of them incluidng my alma mater. The schools that rejected me were some of the most respected places in my field, and it sucked that they didnt think I wasn't good enough for them. I was still able to move from deep South and go to NC for grad school with funding, and while I was getting good support from my advisor and others, there was a tiny regret inside me about not getting into more prestigious school.

But now? I feel like my grad school admission was a blessing in disguise. With all the virus clusterfuck going around, colleges and grad schools are shutting down their labs, and millions of people in eastern states are facing dangers. Here in NC,we currently have 1300 positive patients, but it is much less bad compared to those states. For all I know, if I were a student in highly populated cities, I could be sick and not do anything for my thesis and research. This would cause a huge trouble for me because one, I am a foreign student that always have to be in full time to maintain my status, and two, I need the stipend to stay afloat, and three, I have no luxury of postponing my graduation because of visa rules AND my country's rules about draft and postponing draft.

149,My german shepherd ( a lil over 1 year old ) got diagnosed with heart worms yesterday and i suspected it a while ago due to the coughing and constant sluggishness but my mom brushed it off and so now we have to restrict his movement so that it will lower the chances of complications and death. I feel terrible but i keep reminding myself that it‚Äôs to help him and for his own good so that he can get better. We‚Äôve been doing deep research on plans and medications to understand how the rest of the year is going to play out and how limited his space has to be in order to prevent things from getting worse. He REALLY needs to be socialized but when he was a puppy we were told that he could not se either dogs until he had all his shots. On top of that we live in a sorry town so there are now dog parks with people that follow the rules or dog parks peridot. When we took him to the dog park he was attacked by a small dog but the owners did not obey they rules about leaving immediately if their dog shows aggression or acts on it. We had nowhere else to take him so that he could get used to people as much as he needed to so now he barks at cars passing by ( sometimes) and people minding their own business down the street or neighbors doing yard work. He obeys well in the backyard but terrible when in public. We tried parking outside of PetSmart and letting him observe people and dogs through the window (cargo space of vehicle) but he still barked aggressively and tried pawing the door like he wanted to get them. We have tried this at the zoo so he could observe kids but ended up with the same result. My neighbors probably think we tied him to the stake just because but if only they knew.

157,"Don't say ""be thankful you could live in a 3rd world country"" yes I know. I am thankful for that. That isn't my point. 


But literally out of every developed nation being born in the US is a worst case scenario. This government would rather let tens if not hundreds of thousands or more people die than cost billionaires a few extra cents. American corporations and billionaires are its citizens, not anybody else. Not just during covid-19 but all the time, this is just highlighting it.



Other countries get paid time off work, rent assistance, government care packages, free healthcare, free education, but you so much as mention those things here people foam at the fucking mouth and lose their absolute shit in outrage. I've had people scream at me for suggesting that healthcare is a human right and being born poor shouldn't be a literal death sentence. People cannot fucking handle it. 100+ years of nothing but propaganda and brainwashing since birth has worked to somehow make people think the least vulnerable members of society need support, and nobody else deserves any. 


What do we get here for the pandemic? Layoffs, eviction, homelessness, medical debt, starvation, and a measley $1200 as a ""good luck have fun."" Meanwhile of course this country is giving corporations the 5-star luxury treatment, giving them as much money as they ask for, not forcing them to treat their workers well, encouraging them to hold the entire global economy as a toy like America always does. 



I hate America. An entire country built by and for rich white men and centuries later that's exactly what it still is. There has never been a heroic America. We held onto slavery as long as possible and then didn't even get rid of it, we just made it so now the slaves have to be kept in prison cells too. We held onto segregation for another hundred years, didn't want blacks or women to vote, we've overthrown HOW many democratically elected leaders and put right-wing dictators in their place but call ourselves the model of democracy? Where a president can now commit whatever crimes he wants and not even be put through a fair trial. 





Everything is privatized. The only, ONLY concern in this country is profit for the rich. That's it. That's the purpose of this country. We privatize prisons and make money off peoples' suffering there, making sure we keep them in prison as long as possible for the sweet sweet profit. We privatize healthcare so insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies can make *billions* and billions at the expense of human life. Oh you're sick/injured by nothing but dumb luck. That'll be $25,000. Can't afford it? Sorry you'll have to die then. This is fucking barbaric and inhumane and if you don't support universal healthcare in the richest country to ever exist then I have nothing to say to you. I don't want to hear your perspective or find compromise because there's no compromise to be made. The decision is which is more important, profit or human life? There's no room for compromise there. If you don't support universal healthcare in the US please look a poor child with cancer in the face and tell them you don't care if they die or you have no business talking any BS. It's not socialism, it's not communism or whatever else the propaganda machine tells you. It's fucking compassion, empathy and the absolute most basic function of a government. Keep its citizens alive. Instead the function of our government instead of protecting us is to deliver profit to shareholders, and to hell with us if we die.




This is a country where far-right extremists can murder as many people as they want and everyone shrugs, where people are kept in prison for profit, where medical care costs *fortunes* and if you can't afford it you just die, where police can and do rape and murder as long as the victims are people of color, where we take toddlers away from their parents and treat them worse than animals, where corporations and the rich run our elections to best benefit them, where our Overton window includes literal fascism, and worst of all everyone thinks this is ok. Ask anyone here , this is the greatest country on Earth God bless these here United States üá∫üá∏ ü¶ÖüóΩüò§üí™

I've posted these things before and had people say they wish I would kill myself, so I know that's coming.

I‚Äôve had so much free time to cook healthy nutritious meals. I‚Äôve been eating plenty of vegetables and antioxidants. My sleep schedule has returned to normal.

170,"*Brief backstory for context:* *my long distance girlfriend of 1.5 years suddenly got cold and distant. She's an introvert and sometimes needs to ""breathe"". I'm anxiously attached and I've been paranoid in the past, so now I'm dialing it waaaaaaaaay back and I'm doing my best to respect her space. She's really busy with university now, so all I'm doing these days is sending her occasional loving, encouraging and supportive messages without pressing her or requesting a reply. I'm still a bit anxious and have to restrain myself from bombarding her sometimes, but I'm getting used to it.*

I \[23M\] consider this a ""moment of crisis"" in our relationship, so this time, instead of acting on my anxious feelings as I've done in the past, I did some introspection.

I noticed I tend to stick to a routine, and every time I discover something that fits into my routine, I add it in. Well, I think I've been doing this with relationships as well. That's why my previous girlfriends got bored after a year and some change, and I'm afraid this is happening now as well.

Whenever something goes wrong, I adopt the wrong mindset. I don't start repairing the relationship by carrying out acts of selfless love. On the contrary, I get obsessed because *""something is disturbing a part of my routine""* and I become egotistical and anxious until MY (notice I'm using my) problem is solved. I found out I'm not trying to solve it in order to IMPROVE the relationship (well if that happens in the process, then great!), instead I basically want to solve the problem so that the routine gets back to normal.

Every time there's a moment of crisis in a romantic relationship, I tend to focus on ""getting the relationship back to its working state"". I tend to focus on the relationship more than on the person I'm in a relationship with. That's absolutely not healthy and diverts me from the path of love. On top of that I'm not good at doing acts of love or little gestures, so I find it hard to surprise my girlfriend after the honeymoon phase is over.

To use a metaphor, it's like buying a plant because it suits the room very well, but then leaving it on a shelf without ever watering it because you take its presence for granted.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I tend to stick to a routine in an obsessive way and I make my relationships part of that routine. I see every moment of crisis as a ""problem"" to fix so that the routine gets back to normal. Moreover, I think I still haven't learned to truly love, but I really want to.

Since therapy is out of the question as long as corona is around, what first steps could I take to improve my awful situation? I do want to love.",31Mar2020,1

176,"My parents had me and my sister way too early, they weren't ready in any way. Emotionally, financially, intellectually, etc. They were young and I think even immature for their age. My mom had my (technically half) sister when she was 17 and then my mom and dad both had me when they were 20. I don't understand why after having an accidental pregnancy in HIGH SCHOOL you'd go on and purposely have another kid just 3 years later. My mom has talked about how hard it was having my sister, how she wasn't old enough to have a kid, etc. She barely finished high school because of it, my grandparents weren't supportive and had extreme drug problems, and my sister had an even worse childhood than me I think.


You know what's the best thing to do then in that situation? Have another kid, on purpose this time! The last one went so great and I know we've barely been together and we already have a 3 year old we can't take care of but let's have another one! Because what else do you do when you're 20 and bored?



They were both working minimum wage fast food jobs. They absolutely COULD not afford even one kid, let alone two. I don't even know how they did it. But they weren't emotionally available, couldn't provide financially, and had a ton of their own shit they should've worked through long before they had any kids. They both had alcohol problems (mom still does, 21 years later), fought *all the time* and just had no idea what they were doing. My mom had other men over all the time while my dad was at work while me and my sister were probably 3 and 5 respectively and told us not to say anything. My whole childhood beyond that though too was just a fucking mess. They never had the money or skills to give us a normal childhood and have always spent their time drinking and fighting. 



Just what the fuck. Don't have kids because you're bored, or feel like you're supposed to, or someone tells you to, or for whatever other BS reason might seem good enough. Contraceptives are *cheap and easy.* I see free condoms all over the place and even if you buy them it's like $5 for a whole box compared to probably tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for a kid. If you really can't afford it then just don't have sex. I'm not trying to be insensitive, I guess I know shit happens, but I don't know. In the developed world it seems so easy to prevent unwanted pregnancy.



But more than that, if you do have an unintended kid you're really not prepared for in any way, sure as hell don't have another one only 3 years later. I was never set up for success. Grew up poor as hell with parents who had a world of problems and weren't available for us at all, were extremely young and immature, and just should not have had kids.

Even though I look at those deep, angry cuts on my thigh and feel some shame, I wonder if completely covering my legs in cuts will make things right again. I know it doesn't make any sense, but spilling blood has always helped bring a sort of balance. I can't explain it any better than that.

Otherwise, I am fine. I'm not suicidal or horrifically depressed. I used to be, and I was so miserable that I prepared my suicide note.

What sucks the most is, we‚Äôre going through the VA and for the appraisal to be approved we had to fix a few issues the house had. We already invested money and time in this house but now it feels like it will all be for nothing.

199,"I have a friend and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met anyone with a more fucked up life. We haven‚Äôt even known each other incredibly long, maybe 2-3 weeks or so. She has got it so bad I‚Äôm at a complete loss at to how to help her as much as I wish I could.

Dear lord, so where do I start? This girl gets fucked up on every drug you can possibly imagine, and mixes tons of them as well. From Cannabis to MDMA, Acid, Cocaine, Heroin, Meth and more, she is doing some sort of drug (usually combo) every single day and tops it off by adding more and more on top of it throughout the day. (This morning she told me she took Acid. It‚Äôs 5PM now and she told me she took more again along with some Cocaine and Methamphetamine.) She has overdosed on a bunch of pills twice since I met her. She wasn‚Äôt deliberately attempting suicide I suppose, but according to her she just said she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care anymore but hopes that this finally ends her suffering‚Äù.

Her mother, along with the rest of her family that she lives with, are complete assholes to her and treat her like shit. They all have problems of their own I would assume because that‚Äôs usually the case. Her mother belittles and degrades her, as well as places heavy restrictions on her. Her brother and his friends punch, kick and abuse her, and if I remember correctly, her dad is in jail.

She is failing almost all of her classes.

The police are at her house almost every single day for one reason or another.

She also slept in the woods last night for reasons unknown. Her communication skills aren‚Äôt that great because when I ask her ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù or basically any question at all, she normally just doesn‚Äôt answer and changes the subject.

I probably am forgetting to mention a few more things, but regardless, I‚Äôve honestly never seen anything like this. I wish I could help her so bad but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I live in Florida, she lives in New Jersey. What exactly do you do in a situation like this? I‚Äôm not getting too involved or anything, I really just feel terrible, needed to write this down somewhere and seek advice from anybody who has any.",31Mar2020,2
200,"In the past week to so with lockdown really kicking in where I live everyone I know‚Äôs obviously had boredom setting in.  Me and my extended friend group have been going into group video calls quite a bit over the last few days, which has been really fun; we‚Äôre not all usually so close, and apart from those I‚Äôm really close with, we‚Äôll all usually just talk in a group chat and maybe see each other in person for a night out once a week at most. We‚Äôve all been keeping in touch a lot more and shit, it‚Äôs been nice. I think having this happen just makes you appreciate the people in your life more.

Anyway, one girl in my extended friend group I‚Äôve had a bit of a thing for for quite a while now. We‚Äôll sometimes flirt on nights out (we had a really quick kiss back at New Year‚Äôs but I‚Äôm not even sure if she remembers it), maybe message the day after we‚Äôve been out or whatever, and it‚Äôs kind of an open secret that I have a thing for her, but we‚Äôve just never really progressed to getting to know each other beyond that. It‚Äôs like life gets in the way, other things take up our time, but when we do eventually get round to being around each other there always feels like there‚Äôs a spark there. Over text, not always so much, cause it feels like we‚Äôre trying to force it I suppose, or maybe we‚Äôre just not sure where we stand with each other? When we‚Äôre both out and drunk it‚Äôs easy, but to go from that to a real, sober, being in each other‚Äôs lives deal feels a lot more personal and hard to do. She‚Äôs a pretty closed off person for various personal reasons that she‚Äôs opened up to me about on these nights out since I‚Äôve known her, and she‚Äôs pretty guarded. It kind of feels like I‚Äôve been able to let her get her guard down when we see each other (and her with me, I‚Äôve found myself having one or two mutual heart to hearts with her), but after that it‚Äôs maybe just a little awkward because we‚Äôre not so used to opening up so much? I dunno really, but outside of seeing each other drunk we just kind of have had different lives.

But with the quarantine, all my friends have been group video calling every couple of days, and she‚Äôs joined in a couple of times, and I feel like it‚Äôs really broken the ice between us. The other night we were all on for hours, she was laughing at all my jokes (often she was the only one), and it felt so relaxed and easy. There were even jokes about my little thing for her being made a few times that would usually embarrass me that I just kind of brushed off. I never knew if the chemistry with us was just two young, drunk people wanting to flirt, but it‚Äôs clear we get along well normally. 

Even after the call ended we ended up staying up until about 4 in the morning messaging each other, and in the couple of days since then we‚Äôve been messaging here and there and she‚Äôs been pretty clear about how much fun she had, she‚Äôs been posting stuff on social media related to the jokes we were making during calls that she‚Äôs obviously put up to get my attention so I‚Äôll reply (Gatsbying as my friends call it lmfao), etc. I was always scared to message her too much before all this in case I annoyed her, but I think it‚Äôs pretty clear she‚Äôs open to us two really getting to know each other now. Maybe it‚Äôs just quarantine boredom and loneliness making people look for any kind of attention or whatever, but it‚Äôs still really nice that in the middle of all this shit it‚Äôs helped me get closer to someone I kind of always wanted to but just never could. It‚Äôs been great. I just wish I could actually get to see her in real life lmfao.",31Mar2020,1
201,"I used to be a porn addict. Now, this is very bad,but in my case it was damaging in a...i dont know if worse,but in a different way. Think of being burnt vs being stabbed. I liked femdom porn,then I sunk further into filth and started watching futanari cartoon porn.

an article online ,showcasing semen retention as an aryan ancient skill,made me quit for a year. Not even church had let me quit! during that year I still peaked but didnt fap,but i eventuallu fell due to carelessness. 

Now, im at day 1000,i have beaten my social anxiety, had my first kiss, composed music,wrote several short stories, ran a small marathon, and overall became a decent human being

I met many young people trough facebook groups,and I coached them one by one to take up nofap,and the ones that did saw great results. I dealt with a lot of hate by the far-left people who consider male manipulation of the penis as""healthy""...

202,"Why is it flaring up now? It's been there so long. Now however, I wish to wake. And not be numb. Maybe it's like the lint in your eye when you first wake up, you just have to rub it off. But maybe it's like ink instead, and rubbing it makes it spread?

There has been nothing stopping me from ending the loneliness though, just the usual inertia and momentum issues. But sometimes you get over addiction by forced deprivation in snap decisions, isn't it? Delete the game, flush the stash, block that person? And force yourself to face the withdrawal. Maybe this is the withdrawal, except I keep escaping it with the numbness. Just kill time, easy as that. I don't think I have ever lived a whole day. Just shorten it to a dose of comatose or two.

207,"TL;DR extremely uncomfortable and toxic working environment due to extremely RUDE and arrogant employers who don't communicate with employees, they only state their demands but never listen. They also comment inappropriate things about their employees. Read: WORKPLACE ABUSE by the employers themselves.

Note: There is a number of fake 4-5 star reviews about this company (Advance Infosys Sdn Bhd) on other websites, they might have been posted by their close friends and/or relatives, or clients/other parties so that they get discounts for the provided services.

The employers are overly rude and arrogant, they have no respect for anybody whom they consider ""inferior"" which is practically everybody who doesn't match them in wealth and influence. They also never ever said sorry when they made mistakes (but never failed to accuse everyone else), which they do all the time due to their own lack of even the slightest effort to listen or try to understand the problems when told by employees). At work, if they're present, they often abuse employees (say derogatory things about them, often on problems that they themselves caused), and they're often the main cause of problems for everyone (they're this company's bottleneck). Outside of work, they always try to micromanage their employees, often harassing and monitoring them and pestering them in the group chats.

Furthermore, they are either quite incompetent or constantly distracted by something that's not related to work as they aren't even able to setup their software properly, calculate properly or fill out forms properly, often doing their work with lots of mistakes. Then they would scream and insult employees whenever their own mistakes impacted them.

There are two bosses.

The older one is extremely absent-minded, often can't remember the things he said and the things and the mistakes he did, yet he often, without any hesitation, accuses others of those mistakes he made himself. It is impossible to talk to him because he doesn't communicate, he only screams or states sternly about his demands like a child even though he's in his 60s.

The younger one is always very unreasonable and can't stick to his words, so anything he says can't be taken seriously. One moment he says A, then right after he changes his mind. Despite this, he is extremely quick to accuse employees for not being able to cope with his indecisiveness.

Adding to all this, is that during the movement control order to prevent or slow down the spread of CO VID-19, both of them are still pestering so many of their employees to work on-site despite the dangers. AFAIK, a few of their employees ACTUALLY WENT TO WORK at the office during the MCO!

It would seem that they do not care about the lives of their employees at all.

Complaints about them and even police reports have been lodged to the authorities. Despite all this, they're still unrepentant and show no signs of remorse.

217,"Spent three weeks literally stuck in bed staring at a wall because of depression (except when I forced myself to make plans and go to plans with people). Dealt with a barrage of personal shit and corona-virus shit on top of that. Today I finally got out of bed, walked my dog and cooked a meal for myself. I got my classwork done. I smiled a little because I felt lighter than I have in weeks.

But at the same time I know I have a problem with leaning on alcohol to make myself feel better. As soon as that ""light"" feeling faded, held off of drinking for a little bit but now I'm drinking. And wow I am smiling, absolutely cheesin'.

I'm proud of myself for the first half of the day, but I need to find other things to rely on to be happy than drinking. But I'm still smiling and still happy, not worrying about the drama going on in my life for now, so I guess that's still a win in my books.

Nobody in my life knows about how I've been doing or how I'm doing now so I guess I just wanted to say that on here. Hopefully somebody out there is proud of me too.",31Mar2020,1
