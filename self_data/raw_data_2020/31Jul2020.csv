0,I’m serious ... what happens on these cake days?! Help me celebrate!,31Jul2020,1
1,"If you can’t pick a favorite, just choose one of your favorites. I have many favorites, but this song is one of them. This is the story of the song [Possum Kingdom](https://youtu.be/aSI-Wk00rVw) and why I like it so much. It keeps showing up in my life. 

I first heard it years ago and instantly loved it. Loved the 90s alt rock feel and the creepy lyrics, and the screaming at the end. Honestly thought the song lyrics were kinda hot; “behind the boat house I’ll show you my dark secret”, wink wink. There was this cute guy at my job who would always smile at me and talk to me, but I think he had a girlfriend. Which sucked for me, because I liked to admire him from afar. I felt like he was flirty with me but I obviously didn’t do anything. 

We had a jukebox in there at my job where you could any music. We had karaoke night every week. One night, he sang, and guess what song he chose? POSSUM KINGDOM. There’s a part where it goes, “I can promise you, you will stay as beautiful with dark hair and soft skin forever” and the guy LOOKED RIGHT AT ME and *pointed* at me during that part. 

Cheesy but I was blushing *hard*, and people were staring at me and laughing. It was flattering tbh. I was surprised to say the least. After that, I decided he totally sang that song for ME. I quit my job soon after that for unrelated reasons, and I’ve never seen him again. Such a good memory though. 

My current boyfriend, we’ve been together 2 years now. We love driving around and blasting music. One of the first nights I went out with him, he asked me to play a song on the aux. I picked Possum Kingdom. He told me it’s one of his favorites and cranked it up. Now we listen to it whenever we go on long drives and he said it’s “one of our songs.” 

Swoon. I loved that he loves the song as much as I do and I think it fits our relationship :)",31Jul2020,1
2," haven’t been in a real long term relationship and I don’t know where to start. There’s also this pandemic which makes it hard to meet people. My old ex really hurt me but it’s been 9 months and I think it’s time to try dating again. The other problem is that I’m staying with my mom and dating isn’t common in our culture, so she’ll be worried and upset if I’m leaving the house to meet someone.",31Jul2020,1

3 years ago I was in the worst place I've ever been in my life. I wanted stop existing for a while, and the experience I was living through at the time drained any will or energy out of me. There was no chance to escape, no way to fix anything. I believed I was stuck forever. Two years ago I found it in me start my life over and get myself to a better place. I was still at a dead-end job I hated, but for the first time in years I felt like I could breathe. I still had no money, lived in a tiny room, and the only family I had on this continent was my best friend, who was struggling right beside me. 1 year ago I was still at the dead end job. I still had no money, no way to  support myself, definitely no way to explore any hobbies or goals. I felt like I had burned out. Like I peaked some time in college or even highschool. My job had nothing to do with my education, passions, goals, it was just a mindless 8-hours a day sales drone job. I worked for barely any money and died on the couch every night until 5am came up. Once again, it seemed like there was no escape. I fully believed that this was it. I made a mistake getting a degree in something unstable and now I have to accept the concequences. There again were no other opportunities and again I thought I was stuck forever..... Today I am able to say I love my new job, I love what I do. I am using my degree and I can finally afford to get myself out of mounds of debt, slowly but surely. Today it seems like things happened so fast, however when you are in those awful moments they seem to last forever. BUT THEY DON'T. Today may be bleak as heck but a couple of years from now you will look back realize you made it through. I don't know if any of you might need it today, IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER. You will make it through. Just do the next right thing. ❄️",31Jul2020,1
4,"I’m finally doing it. I’m logging out of this account and abandoning the quest for breast. 

Porn and the internet have completely skewed my opinion and thought process on relationships. I can’t talk to girls in person anymore without being awkward. 
I have no drive to get in a relationship. Today that changes. No more porn or NSFW content.",31Jul2020,1
5,"Back when I was a sophomore in high school, I met my first serious boyfriend. I was 16 and he was 19 and had already graduated high school. We started dating in January of that year and it went pretty well over the next handful of months until the beginning of the summer. He decided to break up with me citing the fact that I was Wiccan and he was Christian and that he didn’t see any possibility him ever marrying someone who wasn’t Christian. (Note that he was NOT religious at all and never was) We broke up at that time and I was pretty distraught at first but oddly, we stayed in contact and nothing really changed after that point. (I actually started reading the Bible and several years later became a Christian and I credit him and his family for that change, but that’s a different story.) We still did all the exact same things as before the break up. He would pick me up from school every day, take me to his parents house where he lived, and we’d hang out til night time and then he’d take me home. We still kissed, made out, etc. Literally nothing was different but he wouldn’t call me his girlfriend anymore. He knew how desperate I was to be his girlfriend again and he left me hanging there for about 3 years. If it suited him in the moment, he’d allow the idea that we were dating but if he decided in an instance he didn’t want to acknowledge it, he wouldn’t, and it always hurt so damn much and I swear he thought it was funny.

For instance, at his house I don’t know that his family even knew he had “broken up” with me at all. I went everywhere with them. Grocery shopping, retail stores, out to eat multiple times a week, church, family events, walking dogs, meeting friends, vacations, etc. and at those times it was always assumed we were bf/gf. I was always too afraid to say I was his girlfriend because I couldn’t bear the embarrassment of him correcting me and creating such an awkward situation. 

But at times it suited him, he would correct me or deny that we were dating after I would say we were (which made me look psycho). It was like he looked for the times it would hurt and embarrass me the most. At football games at school, surrounded by MY friends (bad friends I admit) he would deny we were dating and even flirt with other girls. 

He was also really controlling and isolated me from everyone (didn’t realize until it was all over.) by picking me up from school every day and taking me to his house every day and not wanting me to text or talk to any males at all and not talk to anyone if I was with him at the time. 

On special days, he would always refuse to take pictures with me. He knew how much I wanted “proof” or “physical memories” of our relationship so he would come to, say, the zoo with us and act boyfriendish, etc. but when i wanted a picture- he’d refuse. But he would take pictures with other people. The same thing would happen when his family would take me on vacations. I have pictures of multiple vacations his his family but 0 with him and me. (Thankful for that now lol) He once interrupted and  introduced me as his sister to a complete stranger and then looked at me to see my reaction. I don’t remember what he said on one vacation but I spent about an hour in the backseat beside him crying silently while he put headphones on and ignored me. (I guess his mom and gma just acted oblivious to the fact that I was crying? I had thought I hid it well until I became an adult and realized they couldnt have not known.) 

At one point he had started talking to an ex of his who had a young son and he was very bad at hiding it from me. He sometimes would go see her and I ended up seeing pictures of them all together on her Facebook and shortly after that he had started talking about wanting kids ASAP. (Looking back I feel like this was him trying to torture me with a break up situation I couldn’t change) He started talking to me about how I wouldn’t be able to have kids any time soon because I was still in school, etc. I was so desperate to be with him that I even convinced myself that I could have a baby with him and be a teen mom as long as I had him and his family and even told him so. We never really intentionally tried that, thankfully, but we did have one  pregnancy scare when I was 17. Terrified, I told him I was almost 2 months late. He was not happy. Shortly later, he pinned me down on the bed (picture like a tickle fight type thing, it seemed playful at first) and then did what I can only describe as “compressions” but on my lower stomach instead of my chest. I told him to stop multiple times but he didn’t and I cried. A little later I had cramping and bleeding. When I told him, he said “oh, I guess you weren’t pregnant after all.” And I took him at his word that it was just a late period..... but now years later I wonder if he made me miscarriage. 

The only other time I remember him being physical, he shoved me as we were walking around his house to the back door and i  fell and scraped my knees up and cried. He helped me up and said he was just playing and when we got into the house he told his parents I had tripped. 

Another time a girl on MySpace messaged me very belligerent saying she was dating him and that I needed to back off. He told me she was his crazy ex but she kept messaging me with inside information like she actually was talking to him. I think he either was cheating on me and telling her that I was hitting on him or  that he and the girl were playing mind games with my 16 yr old self. 


Another time, I saw some stuff on his MySpace from this Canadian girl and he was always really shady about who she was. I think it was an online relationship he was hiding but there were times I saw envelopes with her name and a Canadian address in his room that were always in the back of mine but I never asked him point blank because I was too afraid it would all fall apart and I’d lose him. Ignorance is bliss type thing. 


I look back now with 20/20 vision and ever since I “escaped” that relationship I have felt like I was in an emotionally abusive, manipulative relationship those years. But now I look back and I question myself  and I wish I knew his perspective. Did he just see me as a girl that he wanted to be friends with but not girlfriend and I WAS crazy? If so, why would it continue so long? Why would it go so far that his family took me on vacations?? After I finally came to my senses in college and I suddenly broke it off and broke off all contact, he contacted me months later and acknowledged how he had been so terrible and how he missed me so much and realized I was the best thing that had ever happened to him. I had already recovered enough of my self worth and such at that time that I was able to tell him to get lost. I kind of remember those years with him as like Stockholm’s syndrome type thing and that problem where abused people dont think they have any choice and they won’t be loved by anyone else, etc, that everything is their fault. I think I need therapy :/",31Jul2020,1
6,"It’s so weird and very annoying. 

Sometimes I can be cold, progressive and immersed in logical thinking. In this state everything clear to me. I can manage any situation in the most effective order to minimize a fallout. 

Then there’s times that I’m completely ruled by emotions. Morality, pride, anger, love, hatred. Everything chaotic. Nothing makes sense and I can really think, just flow with whatever emotion is at the surface. 

Then there’s times when I feel there’s those 2 forces raging and fighting for control. The result ends up be physiological reaction combined with intense anxiety. I’ll start feeling vertigo, sweating and this weird feeling like a wave of energy just being washed through me just under the skin. 

I struggle with relationships a lot. That feeling of loss is crippling. Having just come out of a bad one that raging feeling is frequent. I’ve gone so far as to write a pro / con list. Said it out loud and understand that I’m better off without her. Yet the loss and loneliness combined with what she once meant confuses that logic. 

I’ve forced myself out of the bed ridden self loathing depressive state I was once in. I forced my anger and pain into a form
of focus so that I could get back to being fit. I made a plan to challenge the toughest race on the planet and have training for it. Yet 5 months later, there’s still rage, there’s still pain, there’s still loss and mostly there’s longing. 

How do you deal with that?",31Jul2020,1

I had an in-person interview on July 16th for a House-Person position at a high-end hotel. During the interview I asked if he had “any doubts about my ability to fulfill  this role” he said “No” after the interview he told me to come in on July 27th with a white t-shirt and black pants so I can get my uniform ready etc. and that he would CALL and EMAIL ME and that if I don’t respond to the email its a “red flag.” 

I  waited and waited to be contacted and didn’t receive any updates no email no nothing! I called on the 27th and was told that the hiring process was delayed and that an email was sent, which I never received, I waited two days and sent an email explaining the situation and then i got a response which says this. 

“We apologize for the confusion but are unaware of conversations regarding uniforms and/or a start date. At this time we have decided to move forward with other candidates. We wish you luck in your continued job search.” 

These motherf—kers pretty much saying everything I said didn’t f-ing happened!!!! They wasted my f-ing time because I thought I really had the job!!! They gaslit me!!! They are screwing with people during a freaking pandemic! And it is wrong!!! I want them to get in trouble should I contact HR or its pointless?

PS: No, i didn’t get a paper/email stating I was hired, where I’m from you don’t fill out or get paper work the same day as your interview its usually done afterwards",31Jul2020,1
9,"I had a last appointment to get travel expenses for my new job with my job advisor who I'd been going to for 6 months. I'd never really got on with her in recent times as I used to just keep my head down rather than saying hello to her and I always felt she hated me tbh.

I got a new job and I told my new job that id been in a temporary work placements the last 6 months rathery than being with that advisor the last 6 months as I said (because they didn't want to see too many gaps in unemployment, I lied) and my advisor (who didn't know tbh) contacted my new job to confirm my employment, and then my new manager questioned me about where I actually was the last 6 months ( I nearly got sacked) I emailed my advisor angry about it and her responses were her mad to on the defensive she replied with things like ‘I will not contact you again now if this is what you prefer’ and ‘I’m sorry you are unhappy about this but I do wish you well for the future’ etc. but but I quickly apologised as I realised she didn't know I lied I replied ‘ok sorry to make a fuss’ and she didn’t reply. 


Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. 


Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass at her desk. so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'oh Its ok I understand' (in a nice way) and she went quiet as she carried on  written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses).  

A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll stay in contact yby email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got a job.",31Jul2020,1
11,"As it says in the title I just feel trapped in life. I am under 15 (m) and, I don't want to sound like I have massive ego, but I would say above average intellect.

I love this about myself, the fact that I'm doing well in school/have good grades. But even though I have friends, no-one shares my interest or likes and I just feel lonely. Its like I'm the only kid in my year who's self aware, or smart enough to know what's going on in the world or make informed decisions.

There is really only one person who I can talk to about serious topics like climate change, politics and mental health. But she has gone to a different school and I got really made fun of for hanging out with her so I have kind of lost contact with her.

I think that the more aware you are the more likely you are to be depressed or have mental health problems, (I don't have any that I know of) but my base level of happiness is just quite low anyway.

My biggest fear is failure and sometimes I just want to escape and run but I'm smart enough to know that that is not a good idea.

My relationship with my dad is not great, but he probably doesn't know, I feel I have to hide my emotions from him l. My mum is better but it's still not great.

Sorry for my ramblings, I just don't feel great right now, and had to talk to someone. Hopefully I don't sound like massive narsacist.",31Jul2020,1
12,"My 17-year-old dog had a bad pancreatitis attack, including trying to vomit, which ended up with him painfully gagging on something. I rushed him to the dog hospital on Sunday, where he still is.

By Tuesday, they said he was doing better and said I would pick him up on Wednesday. On Wednesday, they changed it to Thursday because of high BP and him not eating much. This morning they changed it to tomorrow.

He ate some lean chicken yesterday, but nothing since. A few minutes ago, the vet called and expressed her worry, so  I asked her if it was time for me to let him go, and she said the next few days would give us the answer.

The only thing she is worried about is his sporadic eating. I guess he just isn't eating much of anything, although he is being fed through a nose tube. One option would be to keep him all weekend, and another option would be to put an esophageal tube into him and sending him home with liquid food.

I want to make sure I do right by him, with my feelings being secondary to his quality of life. But man, I am having such a hard time with this. I always forget how hard this part of owning a pet is.

14,"The last time I posted here regarding this was at the 38 day mark. 4 months ago.

She actually went 72 days before saying anything to me. 

Most of those 72 days I was pretty crushed. I spent my time outside hanging out with my neighbors and drinking a bit too much wine. 

On the 72nd day she came out of the bedroom, (this was mid May or so) and asked me what my plans were for my birthday. She offered to buy me a ticket to anywhere I would like to go because ""I deserved to do something on my birthday"".

Suddenly she was happy and told me she had found herself while being alone for so long and she now wanted to be best friends. Traveling and hanging out, but not a couple. 

I did not know what to think about this. The change was pretty drastic.

A few days later she flew to California for a few days and I got to sleep in my own bed again for the first time in months. 

She came home and then a few days later, I got up and she was gone. She had taken her dog and some clothes, and left. I had no idea where too. 

There was no contact. I didn't reach out to her and she did not message me, but our/her friends did keep me informed because she was sending snap chats of herself driving from Texas to California. 

A few weeks ago she walked in the door at 1030 and told me she would need to sleep on our couch for a couple of days while she gathered her stuff. 

She bagged up clothes and took them to a store and sold most of them and 3 days later was gone again. 

How has this affected me?

I FEEL WONDERFUL

I am so much more comfortable being away from her. I have realized since she left that she really did not input anything but bad energy on my life anyway. With her being gone my house is cleaner, I'm not walking on eggshells trying to avoid making her angry. I have lost weight. I'm getting attention from women now and I do not know what the difference is. 

There is nothing in the world that would make me go back to that miserable relationship. I a ready to carry on and for the first time in a decade or more, my heart feels good. I grieved for months while she wasn't talking to me. Now I'm celebrating a new chance at life. 

She reads these. She follows me here. 

You are good on your own. You no longer have a home here. I wish you good luck but stay away from me. You got what you want. 

Thank you friends for all of the advice. A lot of it was very good and it helped tremendously.",31Jul2020,1
16,"I just graduated in May with my bachelor’s. Before corona I was living in my college town hat I absolutely adored. For obvious reasons I went back home due to corona. My lease didn’t end til the end of July so I kept putting it off for the longest time. I was sad that a time of my life that I genuinely loved was finally coming to an end, this apartment was the last piece of that time period that still existed. I guess a part of me still wanted to hold onto it and pretend like time was standing still and that I was still in this phase of my life. So many memories were made in that apartment and my time living in my college town was cut short. The past couple weeks I pulled myself together with the help of my lovely sister and mother to get everything out and clean it to the best of my abilities. Today I turned in my keys and said goodbye.

20,"example of lyrics from Lovebites and Razorblades:

""Who you fucking now?""
I use my slit wrist
To sign my name with
And when you can't compete with the Joneses
Gun 'em all down
(even the father).
You filthy whore.
Shut up and swallow my pride for me.
Move closer or drive farther.
Suck on the end of this dick that cums lead,
But first I'm coming after you all.

It's ladies night at the bar
But she smokes a man's cigar.
I guess she's dying.
Oh well.
I don't give a fuck about your dignity.
That's the bastard in me.

I know a girl
Who sells herself around
And I'm sure one day
She'll sign autographs in your town.

Looking back into my diary
What makes me say those things?
What causes my laughter at another's disease?
It's the bastard in me.

You live in shit
And you will eat your own way out.
I am too fly and shy
Like no other guy.

Too fly and shy just for you.

I'll mark you all.

23,"My parents immigrated from a country where living with your parents til marriage is cultural norm. Earlier on when the pandemic first started, I told my mom I wanted to live in my campus housing again (I miss the independence, my roommates, etc.) and it became a huge issue about how I should always remain with family if I have no reason to return to my campus housing. 

Long story short, I’ve been here for 4 months now. I’ve really tried to make the most of it. Spending time with my family when I can, cleaning up my room, virtual hangs with my friends, etc. I even TA’d an online class and completed an internship all from home.

Now we’re approaching August and I asked her again (even though like 90% of my classes are online). It got into a huge issue again and she told me that everyone in my family (multigenerational household) can sense that I hate being home (apparently I wasn’t as talkative anymore, much more distant). She said that the longer I stayed here, the more they felt that they were losing me and didn’t want to see me be this way, so I should just pack up and leave.

This was kind of a blow to me because I’d been trying my hardest to show only my happy side. And it hurt me knowing that everyone had been feeling this way. I feel like such a fool.

28,"Context: she’s in a relationship with him because he’s the baby daddy. They have been together off and on for a long, long time. She’s smoking hot and she messaged me out of the blue one night. We had slept together one night a few years ago, and the sex was really good. Turns out she had been thinking about it. Then shortly after she messaged me, one thing led to another, and I had the absolute best sex of my life.

The passion is so intense. I’ve never desired someone this much in the bedroom. But she’s also really fun to be around. I like talking to her. We chatted for nearly 5 hours the other night. We’re sexual, but we’re also very affectionate with each other. Think good morning and goodnight texts with lots of heart and kissing emojis. Things are getting very deep and I’m feeling this attachment grow between us. We’re practically inseparable.

This has all happened in the span of a week. I have slept around a lot, and I haven’t felt this close to anyone ever. I didn’t even like my gf this much when I was in my last relationship. This girl admits that she shouldn’t like me this much, either. She told me she’s been having dreams about me practically every night.

Is it weird that I feel sad when I go long periods without texting her? And is it normal for me to be afraid that she’ll suddenly go from feeling very warm and affectionate towards me to not liking me anymore? I also feel weird about talking to other women.

The only reason I got beer is because I am so fucking tense. My uncle is visiting for what feels like a month now (a little more than a week to go). He just stays here all day watching tv, so I can’t game with my friends or game at all. On the rare nights when I am led to believe he calls it an early night I’ll try to hop on and game with my friends. He’ll come down and try to talk to me and my friends (through my headset) he ALWAYS wants to talk. It’s like I just want to be left alone. And I’ve gone out and talked to him several times but there are times (like tonight) when I want to be closed off from the world, and play a single player game. I went for a walk earlier, but other than that I’ve been spending time on my laptop which is cool but I miss my ps4 and escape I guess I’ll call it.

41,"Hi! First time posting here. I'm F21 and a complete mess. I appreciate u taking the time to read this,, 

My place has been in quarantine for over 4 months now and I feel like I turned into a different person.

Back then, when I was enjoying my college life, I felt happy most of the time, felt occupied with orgs and acads, was so sociable and friendly and got along with everyone! people tell I'm kind (and I can see it ngl). I was determined to. 

But now, I was given the opportunity to reflect. During this quarantine, socializing with people became awkward for me (maybe I just enjoyed being alone so much in my own little world that i no longer like the company of others?) My habits are also a mess, Ive been struggling to build my habits but over time, I lose the drive and it makes me miserable again.. I also gained weight (gained 10kgs and now I'm over 90kgs and that makes me feel sad too) The only things that really really made me happy this quarantine were webtoons and masturbating (daily and more than twice)

I realized that I became short tempered (like getting mad and shouting when interrupted while reading webtoons),, i sometimes resort to violence (smackijg people and dogs) when I get really angry... 

I don't know anymore, I'm definitely not like this before,, this is a serious matter to me, I hope I can hear yout thoughts about this

42,"So my friend and I decided to get an apartment together since we are both sophomores in college and aren’t allowed to stay on campus(pre-COVID). We decided to get a 4 by 4 since it was the cheapest option. I wasn’t really into the idea of a 4 by 4 but she comvinced me to give it a try. I wanted to room with her and two of my acquaintances but she also convinced me to get two random people because she didn’t like my acquaintances.
Now, 1 month before move in, she texts me that she doesn’t want to move into the apartment anymore because she’s “not feeling it anymore” and wants to “stay at home with her boyfriend “. She said she’ll just sign her lease over to someone else( also someone random). Now me, who didn’t want to really get the apartment and she convinced me to get one without my acquaintances will now be stuck with three random people i have never seen for one year!

44,"So essentially, two friends of mine went to a party last Saturday. Monday they hung out with another one of my friends, we'll call her Carly. The two friends who went to the party felt sick 3 days afterward and got tested for COVID on Wednesday. I hung out with Carly, not thinking anything of it because my birthday plans had just been canceled, and, in a moment of stupidity, I wanted to hang out with someone. While I'm in the car with Carly, we get texts from our two other friends that their results came back positive. At this point, Carly and I are both freaking out because she came into contact with them, and I was currently in direct contact with Carly. We went back to Carly's apartment, and I left. We probably hung out for a total of about three hours. None of which were spent socially distancing ourselves because we're idiots!!!!! Carly is getting tested tomorrow, and depending on her result I'll either be testing or just quarantining for the safety of my family. I feel like an absolute fucking moron right now. My dad is diabetic, and I'm staying at his house right now. I have to leave for school on the 6th, and I'll be driving down with my mom, who made my brother and I quarantine since March (so she's extremely anxious about getting it).

45,"I(M-19)spent most my life in different houses of my relatives since my parents didn't took me in. So y'know I'm always the ""transfer student"".

I used to have friends when I was young but after lots of farewells you just get afraid and tired of it and that led to me being an introvert pessimist.

During rare times I'm with my parents, when they were still together, it had always felt like I'm a mistake. My mother was intelligent and had dreams, she lived in poverty and was not able to achieve her dreams because I was born when she was just 18 though so its understandable that she sometimes looks at me with regrets in her eyes. Even children notices those y'know.

My father was a player, he's got good looks and talent in dancing. He's not really affectionate, I mean I don't even remember getting hugged by him or hearing anything about being loved by him. Not that my mother was any different though.

The first time I've ever received a gift was when I was 17 from my GF(F-20) (who's now my ex) she was really nice to me. I've been in relationships before but never really lasted because of my pessimism, trust issues or they feel like I'm too needy and clingy, like, ""give me all your attention!!"" Kisses on the cheek, lips and forehead &amp; hugs everyday. Like REALLY CLINGY. I text, call and liked to meet up a lot and they get suffocated.

So during her 18th Birthday,  there was a debut party for her, her classmates who she have always complained about and said she hated for being ""fakes"" are there, so after the formalities there comes the dances, as an introvert as I am, I was in a table, alone, and she didn't even bat an eye on me and straight up went with her classmates. She only came to me  an hour or so before the party ends. It kinda hurt since we've been together for about a year during that time and she have always said I was the most special to her, and I believed that. That someone actually loved me, even though there had been a lot of times she chose other people over me, I didn't mind those. But on that day I realized that its time to giveup.

After another 3 months I broke up with her. Its been 2 years but I still think of that day and how I felt. Still breaks me everytime. And now that I can think about our relationship properly, she might've only stayed with me for that long because of pity, because she don't know how to end it without me getting hurt because she knows she's all I have. I really wanted to apologize to her for that, for making her stay with me for that long.

I have a bunch of pictures of it on my phone and was wondering if showing this to the police would do anything. They're following me for basically i did something embarrassing but unintentional and now they keep harassing me.it led me to do really stupid things and they're making fun of me even harder. Even when I did move they're still doing it even if I take different routes they'll still follow me and leave graffiti tags and stickers. I would show pictures but I have way too many to count. There was an instance were I visited a friend taking care of someone's home and we left i was the first one the leave and I see a car with two dudes looking at me and laughing with one of the guy with his hand up and they drove off.

51,"Hey, I’m a 21 year old dude. I’m just kinda lost. I went to college for 2 semesters to be an electrician and I honestly enjoyed it but also hated it. My dad told me it’s the best trade I could get myself into. 

I didn’t have the best marks in high school to land a scholarship or even get accepted into a university. Actually, I didn’t even apply to any (I was a 50-60 average student and I was depressed at the time.) So really there’s no hope of me getting an office job that pays super well. I’d have to stick to the skilled trades as I’m better with my hands anyways.

After my first two semesters, I told myself I’d take a year off school to “find myself” and to be honest I didn’t find shit. I like to make beats every now and then but with the work ethic that I have I don’t think I’d ever land a job in that industry unless I got really lucky so I gotta treat that as a hobby and find an actual job. 

Anyways, that year has now become 2, I’m still not in college and I owe maybe $6000 in loans. I don’t have a lot of money saved, my fault, so getting back into college is gonna be difficult as I don’t ever wanna take loans again. I also don’t know what I want to study or if I should finish my electrical degree (I’d have to restart from semester 1).

Currently I work at a fish and chips place, it’s a job but not where I wanna be forever. I just don’t wanna be 30, living at home (doubt my dad will let me at that age) and working at dead end jobs.

I want a real job, where I can make real money to support a family and just be financially free. 

See I don’t know what I’m passionate about. I see all these entrepreneurial things where they say “start a business and make money that way” but I don’t even know what I’d sell... A lot of people tell me to follow my heart but that doesn’t make any sense to me.

I’ve told my dad already that I’m going back to school this September but I don’t have enough money for it and the money he put aside for my college has already been used thanks to my first to electrician semesters.

I don’t know what to do with my life. I feel like I blew it with school. So many people I know are already getting out in the real world with real jobs. I know that comparison is the thief of joy but I honestly just feel so behind. 

I don’t know how to figure out my purpose or my passion or what I wanna do either. I have no idea why I’m here, I feel like a failure to my immigrant father who sacrificed so much to be where we are today. I’m not passionate about much other than the gym and my beats but again the gym can only make me look good and I barely make beats these days. I don’t know what I wanna do because I don’t wanna have to wake up for a job I hate every morning, what’s the point.

If you read this far, thank you.

And it hurts to think about losing this person entirely- even if we're not together romantically, I don't want to lose him.  I want to still check on how he's doing, what he's going through and I want him to do the same for me. But that probably won't happen.

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

Over the last decade or so, I've had a number of partners. Many of which I've had the pleasure of getting intimate with and having not only as a significant other, but as a sex partner. Those who I have been with have all complimented me on the general size of my penis. To which, I would often humbly wave off and disregard. I'm not very good at taking such compliments.

Well, today I had a little dose of reality. I suppose that some of what they've said is at least partially true. Though, I'm not THAT big, I'm considered above average. Additionally, the most used term I've heard from women I've been with is ""girthy."" Not necessarily the most pleasing descriptor, but I suppose in these terms, it's not a bad thing.

Alright, so here is what happened that afforded me my little reality check. Throughout this quarantine period caused by COVID19, I've been self quarantining appropriately, and as such haven't seen any action in a while. I'm single, and often find myself aroused without a means to share an intimate moment with someone else. The obvious answer? Masturbation!

As per usual, I'm taking care of myself. Today, I decided to break out this relatively new toy. A simple silicon masturbator that I've only used a couple of times. I'm well into the moment, and everything is building up to that climactic moment. When all of a sudden, I feel that pressure around my penis get a little...limp? I look down, and the silicon masturbator is literally split in half, down the middle.

Apparently I am well-endowed enough to rip a silicon sex toy in half. I guess that I should feel flattered? 😐

Unfortunately, there goes that little purchase. On the bright side, I have a nice little dose of confidence to put a spring in my step! Additionally, I now have a dumb story to tell over drinks that is sure to get a few shock laughs. 🤷

By no means am I attempting to brag. I want this to be clear, as I'm not seeking attention. I genuinely believe this is funny, and I had no idea where else to share this stupid story. Regardless, I hope you find humor in my story. I know that I have plenty to laugh at, once I get over the fact that my toy is now ruined. 😓

79,"for 9 years I was told my diarrheas are self induced due to stress and are psychosomatic. I convinced my doctor to run some tests and it just came out as I'm not lactose intolerant nor do I have celiac disease or any major allergies.

His advice? Avoid foods that make you feel bloated or give you diarrhea and see a psychologist.

Throughout the years I saw a few different doctors and none of them took me seriously, no matter my history of fainting in the toilet or being violently sick up to 11 times in a day, being knocked out for 2 days because of the toll getting sick has in my body, or getting sick 12 separate days in a month. It always ended up going back to me having to start therapy and take anti-anxiety medication and practise mindfulness.

This was until I saw a new doctor and he bothered to actually do his job and order some tests he saw my other doctors didn't take. So it turns out I have IBS. At least after 9 years of going through this now I finally know it wasn't all in my head.

What I learned from this experience is that when it comes to your health, you're your own and best advocate. If you know something's not right with you, keep fighting until someone listens  and takes you seriously.",31Jul2020,1

- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bits to me about how much she smells.

Edit: she’s Normally nice and she seems pleasant etc with me never had a problem with her before",31Jul2020,1

""Oh Ink that's easy man, Impossible Is Nothing."" I said, now tell me what you stand for. When people look at you, do they think excuses? When people look at you, do they think victory? When people look at you, do they think, that's a person that's gonna give me everything they got, not on some days, but on every day, and it's not gonna be predicated upon if I feel like it, because I think we all know if we only worked on the days when we felt like it none of us would get much accomplished. I'm talking about the real level of commitment. Not the commitment that falls in line if everything goes right. I'm speaking of the commitment that says, I am going to stay true to what I said I would do, long after the mood that I've said it in has left. See, most people ladies and gentlemen, are stoppable. Most people, all you have to do is tell them no. All you have to do is make it inconvenient for them, all you have to do is make it difficult for them and they'll stop. See, when you go to get your goal, don't think that all you have to do is think positive and everything's gonna work out hokey dokey for you. When you go to get your goal, You are sending a telegram to Murphy's law to visit you personally. You thought you were just gonna have a dream and a goal, And you were just gonna wake up and just walk into the sunset. You're like, dream, boom. It doesn't work like that. You have a dream, and then life punks you. Life punks you and says, do you really want this? You're gonna lose friends, do you really want this? Do you really want this? Cousins are gonna abandon you, people that you used to be like this with gonna think you boujee and not wanna deal with you. It's a part of it. But I paid too much. I should've quit when I heard my voice say, your mama don't want you, your daddy don't want you, take your life. I got through that, so why am I gonna quit over an F on a grade? Come on. And so I'm telling y'all, you have come too far to quit now. You have invested too much to quit now. You have lost too much to quit now. Don't cry about it, don't whine about it, get a reward for your pain. And so by being committed to everything that you started, you will finish it. Don't stop walking.

91,"I’m not condoning violence, but this is just something that happened.

Him and I have been beefing for 2 years. Only verbal. It’s fucking stupid, silly and childish bc were both 22/23. Anyway his fat ass loud mouth girlfriend saw me walking home from work I guess and they pulled over to a nearby parking lot in my direction. I was not in the fucking mood, but for the first time in my life, I was not afraid of this physical confrontation about to happen. Bruh , Im 5’10” and weigh like 120lbs. I’m not fucking lying. So naturally ANYONE and everyone just automatically assumes and probably can, whoop my ass. Guys, girls, teenagers. I stay away from people. I feel like the smaller you are the more people just straight up fucking disrespect you. My friend had at least 20 pounds on me, and he’s 6’1”.

He hopped out the car and she stayed near it with their fucking child in the back lol tf. He was yelling and fucking screaming names at me saying it’s on basically but I didn’t say anything. I dropped my belonging and held my ugly ass amateur guard up. I was afraid, at first but he kept yelling and talking. In my head I think I figured his baby momma hyped him up to fight me. If it was just him riding alone he’d probably have just rode by and pretended not to see me. 

Fucker finally shuts up and walks up and I KNOW for a fact he’s going to try to pick my skinny ass up and slam me, as it’s happened to me before in previous fights when I was younger. He walks up and so do I , except I lower my head when I close in the distance, and bring my right hand over as he goes for like, a regular standing punch. So he basically missed my head, and walked into a fucking overhand right. I felt my fucking fist hit his face, god that shit gave me a burst of adrenaline.

He stopped talking. He SHUT UP! I’m smaller than him so immediately after that punch I kinda did a fucking weird awkward backspin like to the side of his body and he tried to grab me but I kick pushed his fat ass off of me. Still, he’s silent like me now. His upper lip is bleeding. I can’t believe I did that! I’m defending myself. He looked like he got some space between us to figure his next move and I didn’t fucking know my next move either. So he rushed in and I extended my long ass leg hard as fuck at his stomach basically and it pushed him back, he just drops his guard and looks at me. I was really getting space to think of a new move lmaoooo. His baby momma at the car yelling “fuck him up already!!!”

So he manages to grab me and tried to headkick me, I give body shots but I don’t think they’re affecting him, so I slip out the headlock. I think it worked bc I have a skinny neck and can just slip like that. He tries to kick me and I kinda instantly swat his foot away. It fucking hurt my thumb hard as hell though. Every time I press too hard it hurts now, like it feels like the muscle or bone or whatever in my thumb is sore or broken. Anyway, he tried to go under, and lift me, his head was in a position where I could try and headlock or at least try to “guillotine “ him. But I didn’t, I held on and walked backwards into a wall to prevent him from lifting me, as he struggled I kept fucking elbowing him the back of the neck. And punching his backside rib cage. He eventually lifted me, I braced for the fall as best as I could, I skateboard so I naturally brace myself for falls. He got on top and used his weight to pin me down, after that he kinda just went to town on punching me in the head over and over. While I was down he grabbed my head and like, slammed it on concrete. I didn’t feel any of this until after the fight. I was once again about to attempt to slip out of this. I got this, I know I can! Idc if he’s hitting me I’m not about to quit or run. 

Cops arrived right then and there thiugh. We were in public space. Sat us and made us tell our side of the story. We both kinda said the same thing. “We’re friends just fighting out some old stupid beef”. Him and I kinda squashed that little beef but I feel like he’s going to run back and tell everyone he dominated that fight. Towards the end he was definitely getting me but I had enough in the tank left to do SOMETHING. The cop let us go, thank god but his baby mama kept fucking screaming yelling as if she was the one who was fighting. She was fucking furious. I felt like they did not expect me to fend for myself so very well. At least, for a guy my size. 

I learned most of those moves from playing and watching UFC/UFC 3. I know, it’s amateur and I’m no fucking fighter at all but I’m stoked I took care of that by myself. I want to maybe learn more self defense, now.",31Jul2020,1

Every night we texted eachother asking eachother to get on Xbox or computer or to go fishing etc... he was one of my only friends as we had a ton in common and were both unpopular and nerdy. Well around my junior and senior year I became friends with another kid, let’s call him Jared. Same situation as Sean but I always liked Sean a little more and did more stuff with Sean simply because I’d known him longer. But I almost always invited Jared with us. When I introduced Jared to Sean, it all went downhill. Jared followed him around like a puppy, doing everything and agreeing with everything Sean said and did. I was not like this. Sean and I had our differences, but ultimately we were still best friends. But as Jared began to follow Sean like a religion, slowly Sean lost interest in me. They stopped inviting me to places. Sean never texted me and never asked me to hang out anymore or to get on Xbox. They would hang out together, sometimes right across the street from my house, and not invite me. Now years have passed and I have not gotten a single text from Sean asking me to do anything. If I invite myself, they don’t care. But that’s the thing. They don’t care if I’m there or not. But without them, I have no one. No other friends. So I feel lost. Like I could disappear and no one in the world except my immediate family would care.

115,"I would like to say it's because I'm lonely during a pandemic but I don't think I'm horny enough for that.  I think the fact that I'm not around girls lately has cleared my head enough to really think about what I want.

She started talking to me in high school and I wasn't super into her at first but then we got talking and I realized she was one of the funniest people I've ever met.  Most people think I'm funny and it honestly takes a lot to make me genuinely laugh hard and she could do this with no problem.  Immediate telepathy and it only grew from there.  Fast forward a bit and we dated for like a week and my dumbass didn't know how to date and I was annoying so that ended quickly but we became close friends again shortly after.

Fast forward again and I catch feelings for her,  she goes through a hoe phase that I at the time didn't understand so I was always jealous etc and it really messed things up,  and her constant gaslighting (she is incredibly smart and very good at this) gave me serious trust issues despite the feelings I had for her.  We go our separate ways after I get insanely depressed and make her life hell which I'm sure was her worst nightmare because of her family's history with divorce and abuse.

She is now engaged and living with her fiance on the other side of the country and they seem pretty happy.  He seems funny and it looks that he treats her well and I'm happy for her.  We started talking again once she moved and I had convinced myself I wasted years with her and it was a learning experience so to this day I haven't been jealous/psychotic or anything towards her or even romantically interested.  We facetime sometimes just as friends and its still fun and we make each other laugh but once we hang up I'm not sitting around thinking about her or wanting her.

But now I'm out of school and maybe it's just because I'm older and it's more pressing to find a girlfriend but I always find myself using her as a template for other girls.  I've hooked up and talked to other girls and had flings and I've learned valuable things about people and girls and I've enjoyed it all,  however I've never been as happy as I was when I was with her.  It's not like I'm hoping they will be as good as her,  I'm just using the things I liked and disliked about her to help me make a good decision.  And honestly it has helped a lot,  I find I'm more able to avoid certain girls and attract others,  but at the end of the day no girl I've ever met is unique as her.  She changed my life and worldview and most importantly made me laugh,  and I always find myself faking laughs at other girls.  It's not that they aren't funny,  it's just that none of them can keep up with my humor like she could.  And now that I'm inside most days whenever I find myself wondering what type of girl I want all I can think about is her.  I think about past relationships and the pros and cons to them but none of them ever seem so pure as what we had when it was good.  Maybe it's because we were young and spent so much time together,  but I messed it up,  and I've accepted that,  it just sucks.

So he told me his school and i was like oh surely they have school pics of him so i looked up the school website and there was nothing so i tried his school youtube and there was also nothing but i knew one of his friends who was a girl and shes really pretty so i was looking through her insta to see if he commented anything and id like look at her insta a bit cause she was just really pretty and looked happy and i enjoyed it.. Then i had like alot of boyfriends(also online) when i was like 14 and like i did this thing well i still do it now. I imagine scenarios in my head but to see the person clearly in my head i look up pictures of them say on instagram or facebook so i can visualize them better in my head. So one day i tried looking for one of my boy friends mum on insta to see if she had any pics of him but her account was private so i was like nah im not going to click on it. Then a different boyfriend i looked through his followers to see if they had any family pics so i could see him and i found his sisters. And i just get lost in like peoples lives so i was just looking through all of his sisters pics seeing how her life is. Then i also kept going back to her account to see pics of him well after i broke up so i could imagine him better. Then i had this crush on a boy in my school and i really liked him i was like 13 and on snapchat id like constantly check his snap maps idk why but i just kept checking them alot i think to see if he was active on snap and messaging others or to see where he was. And then if another girl spoke to him in school id get so jealous. Then one day he said to me oh you could live near me because my neighbour is moving so i was like omg yesss and i told my mum and then i started imagining scenarios of me bumping into him on the way to school etc. I eventually stopped liking him. I also knew where he lived cause of snap maps. Then after i had all those boyfriends i had a crush on this boy like a big one. So in school i wanted him to come talk to me but i was so shy and im socially awkward so id like take my friends to sit near where they would so i could watch him to see if hed come over and talk to me. But this became like constant like every lunch id try and find him in the cafeteria or be there early just so i could see him or id walk by where he was chilling or id stay there just so he could look at me and then id have like a fake convo with my friends or id stay hanging by this area which i knew hed walk passed at like a certain time. Then i used to like always look at his insta like just constantly looking at him cause he was so cute and so i could imagine the scenarios. Then i knew he had a friendship group and they seemed like a good bunch of people so i started speaking to like 1 of them and he was nice and then i found all their instas and then came the looking at the pics and then imagining scenarios like constantly(while listening to music). Also i kinda like spied on him whenever he was with girls and his ex was talking to him and i got so pissed and then i looked up her insta and started looking through comments to see what he had said on them and then he liked  this other  girl so i started comparing us like what does she have that i dont.Then we ended up going out together and i really wanted to be in his group and meet his friends but i didnt because we broke up. After we broke up i started looking at his snap maps and. i was like omfg he got a girl over his house wtf why is there a girl there omg they are on their own. Then i still liked him but then i met these other 2 boys that i liked and i rejected one but ended up falling for a right dick. Then that guy like just stopped bothering with me but i also started looking at his insta to imagine stuff in my head whilst i got music in. Then i fell out with the boy i rejected over pics and he was just a prick but i also used to do the insta thingy. Then i met another boy who was really sweet and i liked him but then he was like nooope. And im like really shy around boys i like at the beginning but then i get ok. Then we stopped talking and he blocked me. I also used to talk to his friend who was nice. Then i started imagining scenarios with him in my head the boy who went off me and then id purposely walk by him or where hed be heading so hed see me or come talk to me cause i did still like him but i wouldnt look at him cause i get nervous. But his friends would say shit to me like shout stuff and then they started saying i was staring at the boy when id only glance at him. Then it became constant looking through instas of the past boys to imagine bad ass scenarios in my head with them in it like idk making out or doing a concert infront of them so they could see what they missed.  And i really wanted to join that group of boys(they were a part of the same group) cause i really want a group of male friends so i started imagining stuff with them in like going out doing stuff. So like now i still do the insta for the pics to imagine scenarios with them in or whenever a girl they know does a tag on insta id check if the boys were tagged in it or i check comments of other instas to see if they have said any comments like about their appearance and i get jealous if they have or if a girl has on theres even though i only speak to like 2 of them from the group. Its like im jealous that girls are friends with them because i want to be friends with them or start a relationship. Now i keep imagining stuff and ideas to like be in their area where they live so i can bump into them and like start talking and make friends or sit where they go out in the streets and chill or walk by them in their area like just be there in there spot or close by. Like 3 times ive messaged the boys who stopped talking to me saying why did u do it or whats ur issue hoping we will make up but nope. And once i pretended to accidentally send a snap to one of them so i could start a convo with them. And like now i even look up peoples facebooks and instas still to look at the pics then imagine cool scenarios where they fall for me or some stuff like that whilst i got music in. Like i do this for alot of people(boys). Im worried its like obsession and im gonna be some insane girl whos obsessed and will kill if anyone gets in my way(its unrealistic but i still worry).

And i keep looking back at like my exs tik tok account or his mates aswell. And also on skype i go on there when the boy i still havent got over is on there like to see if he will join a call or message me or i will go on skype and see if he will suddenly come on the app and talk.

123," TGIF! Any plans for this weekend? It is the end of July and the end of Parks and Recreation month.

Do you remember the movie Freaky Friday? Imagine if the son and the father switched bodies instead.

The son may learn that his father has BPH (prostate enlargement). It is a common condition in older men,

where the prostate grows in size, and symptoms include the following: 

frequent urination,

nocturia,

struggle to stop and start urination,

sensation of urine remaining in the bladder,

slow urinary flow,

urges and incontinence 

Some ways to manage the symptoms include the following:

exercise,

eat a balanced diet,

pelvic floor exercises,

safe heat therapy,

regular fluid intake and less at night

Make an appointment to see your doctor if you have BPH. Try UMOOZE if you have mild BPH. Its natural ingredients may support the prostate and safely reduce the symptoms. 

So enjoy your weekend and take care of your prostate!",31Jul2020,1
124,"This is really really embarrassing but it's my reality now. I'm a piece of shit, I'm addicted to several things but one of them is sexual shit. Everything from buying nudes to prostitutes (never met with one, they all got me to send the money in advance and then ghosted. Not their fault I'm just dumb as fuck). Last night I went to the strip club and tried to limit myself to $50 including a couple drinks and cover, ended up spending just over $300. Got pretty damn drunk too but was just going all in with dances etc. Fucking idiot. I also have an alcohol problem I think and I knew that if I got too drunk I'd spend too much money but I couldn't help myself, just beer after beer until I felt sick.



Now I wanna actually literally kill myself. I already have wanted to for so long and I've been getting professional ""treatment"" for almost 6 years now and it does nothing.



I absolutely can't control myself. I have so many vices that just run my life and I have 0 self control. Alcohol, weed, spending money, binge eating, I can't fight any of it.




Now I'm missing my phone payment and my student loan payment and will be late on them because of this fucked up shit I did.

126,"I mood cycles between ups and super low lows.

Reacent cycle has been around 3 weeks of extreme low. And just 3 days ago suddenly my mood went really high up. It's so sudden and extreme that I can pinpoint exactly when it happened.

For 3 weeks, I was extremely depressed. I didn't get out of my bed. I did basically nothing. I basically just spent three weeks in my bed crying. I was constantly sad and hopeless. I didn't talk to my family at all. They noticed it and confronted me about it. 

Now I feel like I have extremely good ideas. My mind is like on overdrive. I've done all kinds of things. I've played the piano, played games, learned stuff and picked up chess again. Tomorrow, I'm going with my dad to cut down some trees. I'm also finally fixing my moped. I'm being like super productive. 

And all this changed overnight three days ago. 

Something to note is that I also sleep less than I did during those three weeks. I slept around 12 hours a day during those three weeks. Now I sleep around 6 and would be fine with even less. 

My feelings of the world not being real are also completely gone. 

And it's not just a one time thing. This cycle has been going for at least like 2 years now. My low points have gotten lower and my high points have gotten way higher.

I don't understand what the fuck is happening.

I will still enjoy these few days of feeling good before the cycle repeats again.

127,"5 years ago, I found out the my then husband had been cheating on me with men. He told me it was just a result of trying to work on his trauma of being sexually abused as a child. We tried to work it out, but when the whole extent of his sex addiction and how many men that he cheated on me with came to light, I realized it was not something I could do. When we first started going through all of it, I could not even picture myself dating. He had been my first boyfriend and my self esteem was about two steps less then crap. 
The night he moved out I got really drunk and downloaded a dating app. I started going out and slowly my self esteem began to rise. Then one day I got a silly message from a man. After talking for a week or two, we decided to meet up. By the third date I decided that he was it. I wanted to marry him. Thank goodness he felt the same. We waited until we had been together for 3 months before we officially got engaged, and a year before we actually get married. But the longer I have been with this man the more I fall in love with him. He treats me so well. He shows me every day how much he loves me. I am so forever grateful that he came in to my life. And tomorrow I get to marry him. 
A few years ago if you told me that I would feel happy like this and willingly get married again, I would have told you that you were crazy, marriage was dumb and just leads to expensive breakups. But i am truly happy again thanks to him. So of life ever feels like it is shit, just rember the old phrase ""it gets better"". It may take a lot longer then you think, but life does get better. Thank for listening to my rambles, I am just so happy that I needed to put it out in the universe.",31Jul2020,1
129,"**TL;DR:** I’ve been struggling with keeping interest in my hobbies for the past month and a half. This is most likely because of my worsening mental and increase in anxiety. I started feeling a bit better and tried to get back into some of my fandoms. It was nice for a couple hours, but then my favorite bands lead singers son was accused of sexual abuse. Then, a similar controversy popped up in another fandom of mine. A week later, almost all my fandoms are full of controversies and I’m feeling extremely anxious again.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

This is going to sound like such a teen girl problem, and it is, but it’s been causing me a lot of stress lately. Whenever I feel anxious or upset, I often flock to my hobbies. Music is my number one escape. It’s been a large part of my life for going on 4 years now and I can’t imagine my life without it. I play several instruments, always have some earbuds in, and am often researching it. This isn’t my only hobby, but it takes about the majority of my interests. Within the past couple months, I’ve lost interest in all my hobbies including music. Sometimes the interest comes back, but normally, if it does come back, it’s just for a couple days. This is most likely caused by my worsening anxiety and mental health. Quarantine has been very rough for me. My lack of interest has been bothering me, but I started to get some interest back recently. I started with getting back onto social media, researching my favorite bands to see what I missed. The end of the tunnel was finally coming up. 

Hours later, a controversy popped up with my favorite band. This year has been really rough when it comes to controversies with them, but they’re all so minor and often due to managements fault, but this one was different. I felt super anxious after learning about it and haven’t been able to look at them the same since. I tried to ignore it, but I wasn’t able to get it off my mind for about 5 days. I lost all interest in my hobbies again. I tried to sneak back into some of my other fandoms which I now regret. Of course, just my luck, my other two biggest fandoms (also bands) were also scrambling over controversies. None them are about the members themselves, but instead relatives and friends. The thing is, if they allowed some of this stuff to happen (abuse, pedophilia, sexual assault, and, though more minor, sexism/racism/homophobia/etc.), it’s hard to respect them.  

I never thought I put my favorite musicians on pedestals. Yes, I do admire and respect them, but I don’t see them as these godly beings or anything. Honestly, I like seeing facts that make them more human. And, yes, I do have standards for them, but they’re the same standards I have for everyone else (abuse, sexual assault/rape, cheating (not as bad as the others but still), murder, etc.). It doesn’t matter if I know them personally or if I mostly see them through a screen, I’ll be let down if they ever break any of my standards.

It’s been over a week since I found the first controversy and a couple days since I’ve witnessed the others. Though they shouldn’t affect my life, I’ve worried and overanalyzed them to the point where I feel kind of empty once again. I don’t feel as anxious about it (thanks to a couple listeners) but it still lingers. I still can’t see them the same. If someone would just say something clearing all of this it would be such a relief, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. I’ve dedicated years to these guys and it’s hard just to throw it away— especially considering I’ve looked up to them so much. Its difficult to erase every poster, flag, CD, t-shirt, autograph, concert ticket, and signature guitar from my life. Am I overreacting? Probably. I just don’t know what to do.

_____________________________________________________________________________________

***The rumors/controversies that I need second opinions on are described below***

So, my favorite musician’s, Bill (false name), who I’ve looked up to for over three years now, son was accused of sexual abuse of a minor last week. I don’t know what Bill knew or if he was complicit but the thought of him knowing and not caring terrifies me. For decades, he has spoken out against sexual assault and abuse. He was a feminist before it was cool. So, if allowed all of this, I would be extremely disappointed. On top of this, someone mentioned him cheating on his wife. I’ve heard this before and passed it off because most musicians have these rumors around them (even Paul and Linda, who are known for being faithful to each other). There wasn’t any evidence outside of some song lyrics. When I looked into it further, I found someone on Tumblr claiming that they had a “theory” that was proven my someone connected to the band. They wouldn’t say what it was on their main page, so I contacted them. They then told me that Bill and his wife are in an open marriage and they don’t even love each other that much. She said that her friend’s best friend was told this by a bandmates ex-wife. I was extremely disappointed. Even though I’m not normally bothered my open marriages (I don’t understand them but it’s fine if someone chooses to be in one), this one really got to me. I had always seen this couple as a role model couple. Even though they’re in the rock and roll lifestyle, it was always said that they were monogamous and very, very in love. Bill mentions her every five seconds and looks at her in ways that are hard to fake. I’ve heard rumors of an open marriage because he’s bisexual (which, to be clear, doesn’t automatically make someone polyamorous) and is affectionate with friends, but I always believed him when he said he was monogamous. This was a month ago. I forgot about it after I talked to someone about it (who had no idea who this person was to remove bias). Now I’ve been reminded as this friend of hers has mentioned some more rumors. Supposedly, the wholesome family unit is actually very toxic. The family doesn’t get together at all, which is also extremely surprising seeing how close they seem. Sure, no family is perfect but the user was hinting at physical fights. That’s kind of extreme. I talked to someone on a fan website and they happened to also know someone connected to the band. Her partner grew up with the band and, even though they aren’t super close, they’re still in contact. She said that even though him and his son haven’t been too close for the last couple years (the son grew up to be... not great), she hasn’t seen anything hinting towards a toxic family unit. She said she doubts that they’re in an open marriage. A lot of the “evidence” towards the open marriage (rumored hook up with Winona Ryder, onstage “relationship” with bandmate, etc) isn’t true or can be explained in other ways. She says that her partner hasn’t seen anything that would indicate an open marriage. When it comes to the situation with his son, she said that Bill is completely heartbroken and didn’t know. I want to believe her and I feel like she’s telling the truth but my mind is so messed up right now that I don’t know. She mentioned some other things other things that made me think it’s true. She mentioned him struggling with his mental health. Even though there’s no proof to the public about this, I always had a gut feeling about it. At first, my gut feeling was that the ex-wife wasn’t telling the truth but now I don’t know... This happens a lot. I over analyze my thoughts leaving me feel anxious and confused.

Then, I have another musician who I admire, “Steve” (fake name, once again). His past has been problematic (questionable jokes on vine and some comments made onstage), but it seems like he’s grown as a person. He’s, like Bill, very vocal about supporting minorities and has created his own charity to support a group of them. A couple years ago, the touring guitarist was revealed to be very creepy to younger fans. He was kicked out immediately and hasn’t had any contact with the band since. Now, two years later, the security guard and very close friend of Steve has been outed to do the same things. Along with this, people have brought up hundreds of tweets showing sexism, racism, homophobia, ableism, fatphobia, etc. and stories of him just being and incredibly disgusting human being. The ex-bassists wife came up saying she knew but had to silent about it so her husband could keep his job. I was extremely disappointed but gave Steve and the rest of the band the bee fit of the doubt. That’s until someone pulled up a video from about five years ago showing Steve making jokes about a “nude wallpaper” that this security guard/friend was creating with underage nudes. He has since changed, but it’s still disappointing to see. I’m starting to worry that this change wasn’t genuine and he’s the same guy he was a decade ago (which, to be clear, isn’t too bad but it’s still disappointing). Along with this, I found old posts about him being abusive to a long time (now ex) girl friend. This was on MySpace and it’s been wiped from, the intent. Supposedly, as current fans say, the statement about rung a shove wasn’t by the ex and the ex defends him saying it was all BS. Is that true? I don’t know, but it hurts.

There’s a bunch of other controversies but those are the main two that stick out. I always look for dirt on people before trying to “Stan” them but this was long before and of these controversies. I don’t know what to believe, who to believe, but I know it’s going to be hard looking at some of these guys again.

131,"This is my first time ever exposing myself like this on a subreddit so I’m not sure what to expect.

Last night, my mom and dad were arguing about my mom’s assumption that my father was being unfaithful to her. He’s had a history of being unfaithful to her. He’s had a bit of a violent history with her. I believe he has anger issues and he has put his hands on my mother in the past, when I was only 6. Since then, he’s claimed he’s changed but I’ve always been able to find him being unfaithful through his text messages.

Last night, he stormed out after the argument with my mom and came back a few hours later. I confronted him and told him to stop doing such things, and told him that I was only 6 when he was already being unfaithful and violent. He proceeded to approach me as if to hit me, so I got scared and pulled out my pocket knife. I asked him to back off and left the house for the night. I never meant to use it on him. I was only scared he’d hit me. Did I overreact? He’s never hit me before besides spanking and discipline with a belt but he walked up to me very angrily after I reminded him of his violent past with my mom.",31Jul2020,1

My next door neighbour is a lovely old gentleman in all the real meaning of the word, but 6-8 months ago he got involved with a monster of a woman much younger, alcoholic, every word is toxic and she has slowly been manipulating him, tonight I found out she stole his debit card, she started spewing tirades of trying to tell me he hated me all that stuff,  she tried to get in my face even though I am in self isolation at high risk.

I tried to keep her away with a washing line pole and which I had to deflect a wooden wheelbarrow with that pole full of dirt she tried to launch over the fence

Police came but what can they do, they just told me if she tries anything tonight to ring them, I don't know how much fight I have left in me, I am alone, next door neighbour has gone to stay in a hotel I think, me I can't do that this is my home with my dogs.

I don't know what to do.",31Jul2020,1

136,"I could be having an ordinary conversation but if someone says something rude directed at me (and doesn't apologise or it's not talked about), I completely lose my trail of thought and blank out. Like I think about nothing at all and I can't really think about anything else. Almost as if I suddenly lose all of my energy. To me this seems as if I'm giving the silent treatment when really I'm not (well not deliberately), I just lose the ability to function properly. It's stupid really, because I feel like any normal person would either just comment on it, accept an apology and move on, or just not notice small rude comments. I don't really get mad at whoever it is, I just become absent",31Jul2020,1
138,I've never had a job and have been rejected by multiple places until now when I got a call from Arby's about my application for a closing sandwich maker. I don't want to screw this up and need advise please! What do I wear? What questions should I be prepared for??,31Jul2020,1
140,"I’m male, aged 30 (look younger) 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) skinny af lanky with long legs etc, pale with a receding hairline and a kissless virgin. So yea in the looks department it’s over. I never leave the house and havnt since 2015. Between 2012-2015 I had a bar job, I met some amazing people but also some horrors. Horrible women who’d call me ugly and treat me like shit for it and these were the staff and managers I worked with. The good looking guys could do no wrong and when they fucked up it was pinned on me so many times. In the end I got fed up and left. I do go out to work at football stadiums as a steward and that’s the same, women staring me down because I’m skinny like it’s my  fault they’re fat. Other guys I work with staring at me with a ‘wtf is that’ face and overweight short girls calling me a ‘Ming’ (whatever that means) it’s great when say for example an older male will pass conversation to me and be very friendly and I think ‘it’s nice when someone looks past what I look like’ but there isn’t many like that about. I eat to gain weight my face goes fat and rounder but thinner I feel better. Still hidoeus nevertheless. A comment on here once I asked about my hair one comment said ‘he’s clearly balding and hidoeus btw’ and it got upvoted 17 times. I drink whiskey every night watching cartoons  and I’m starting to get chest pains. There’s a tree in my garden (I live with my dad) with multiple think high branches that can be reached with a step ladder I have already. All I need is the rope. I practice the pressure by standing on the ladder next to the thick branch where I plan on hanging myself most night. Practice the height feeling and feel the drop down and suspense. Need a rope but I need to buy one online which is only £5.99. That’s a bargain to free myself from this shit.

Also the only girl who ever liked me was in 2014 which is 6 years ago tomorrow. She was gorgeous too.
She worked in the bar with me. Damn I miss her so bad. Take me back To then please 

I basically live upstairs watching Netflix everyday in a house waiting to die while seeing other guys my age or younger/older have looks on their side and a life to go with it. 

Lookism man

That’s what I get",31Jul2020,1
141,"The title says most of it but 6 months ago, I (20M) ended a toxic relationship with my girlfriend of 2 years that was full of depression, anxiety and constant put downs from her confirming my thoughts that “I’m not enough”. Anyways, it’s been about 6 months and I haven’t felt better! I’m back to having snapchat friends and keeping up with old friends that I was prohibited from speaking with. I bought my first car, in cash off the lot and have saved up more than 5x what I had while we were dating (because if I loved her, I’d buy her whatever she wants). I never thought I’d be the one to fall into such a toxic relationship but I can’t remember the last time I felt so much like myself and I’m happy that I am back in a very positive mental space with a great support system of friends and family. I just wanted to share and hopefully be an encouragement to someone! Thank you!",31Jul2020,1
142,"Just needed to vent. I am currently struggling a lot with my mental health. I am getting help and doing my best everyday, but something is still really bugging me. I was with my ex since I was 14-18, I am now 21 and am still tormented by the memories of his emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. He cheated on me once, maybe twice, but I was too blind to break up with him over it. Finally when I moved to the opposite coast for school I got the guts to end the relationship, we were engaged at the time. 6 months later, he gets married to someone else. I’m not jealous that he “moved on” so quick, I’m more upset that I’m still suffering from the aftermath of what he did to me, while he gets to go get married and be happy when he’s the one who hurt me so much. Is it wrong for me to feel this way? Like it’s so unfair? Like I got the sh*tty end of the stick? It’s just so frustrating.",31Jul2020,1
144,I am pressured by my parents to go to uni and get a high paying job like a doctor or dentist nothing less. I’m scared I won’t be accepted to any. My grades are too volatile I get c+ one day then all As and Bs the next. It’s making me anxious,31Jul2020,1
145,"I understand the disdain for Trump and his goons but why does it seem like people can just shit all over average Americans and get supported for it? Don't we as a society dislike racism and bigotry as a whole? Most Americans didn't even vote for Trump.

If I made comments hating on Muslims or Germans I would be rightfully flamed into oblivion, but if it's Americans then that's cool? We don't need hate we need help.",31Jul2020,1

147,"Of course this doesn't apply to everyone because different body, different reaction. I started taking Lexapro, at night, I took half a pill and my period started.

I've been known to have bad menstruation cramps and sometimes depend on pain killers but only for the first day.

 So the next morning my cramps started and I felt like i was dying. I had cold sweat. I felt very nauseous and I tried to throw up but couldn't (because I didn't eat before then) and I couldn't move but I was shaking. I was clenching my fist, digging my nails in just to handle the pain. 

I somehow managed to go to my bed and ask my sister to bring me painkillers. I took 2 pills of painkillers and lunch. After that I felt better. Cramps are gone, no more cold sweat. Not nauseous. I still feel weak tho.

 Now my cramps dont get this bad but it may have been because the Lexapro was making it worse.

So if you're gonna take Lexapro and you know your period is about to begin. Just take Lexapro after the cramps has passed. Starting the day like I did is not worth it. This may not happen to you but I wouldn't recommend it to take the chance.",31Jul2020,1

149,"I suppose I just need to see a therapist but I can better organize my thoughts when I write them down so here goes...

I'm so lost and confused. Everything is all topsy turvy.  I dont know how to live. 

How do people work a job, have all their deductions  taken out, pay tithes, pay Bill's, buy food, pay rent, and still have money to go out with friends or buy new clothes and electronics? 

How do people eat healthy on a budget? How do people life a healthy life and maintain a healthy weight? 

How do people wake up early, exercise, pray, go to work, come homes, do chores, make and eat dinner, and still have time for hobbies and friends? 


I suppose my biggest questions are 1): How do people live life and ENJOY  living life with everything that goes along? And 2) Hiw do people know who they are, what they love, and what they enjoy doing? 

I dont know who I am, what i like , or what to do. I'm very lost and confused. 

I would like to strike out on my own and try to find some answers but I'm too scared.",31Jul2020,1
150,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall height) 161lbs weight)

In December 2019 I had a shave and went over again and again and again with shave gel. The next day I had really bad hyperpigmentation and swollen face (also was brown too) and my nose went really red and oily too. the hyperpigmentation is now   gone and my face is a alot clearer again after 7 months but face is bigger in size than ever like Iv gained 10lbs when Iv actually lost 7lbs.


I swell  every time after I shave for days. But my nose and the area around it still very oily and grey oily under my eyes too and I can’t look at myself in reflections etc unless I cover the middle of my face with my hand.it looks puffy/larger too in that area  the rest of my face is totally clear again tho From the pigment on but swollen on the cheeks and jaw still whet my face looks longer

Edit: I look brown disclosured and larger faced and it’s not weight related I don’t think I weight less now than I did when I was skinnier",31Jul2020,1

It is ALWAYS important that you engaged in several activities when depressed. I know that its hard especially when you suffer from intense depression to try and take up a hobbie. But when faced with such overwhelming depression its the best time to train the body and mind to be productive. I've suffered for years with depression and it really messed up with my productivity. I had no enthusiasm or was I driven to make something of myself. But as time went by little by little I started pushing myself. 🌻Try and apply the following mentioned below ◾Calling a friend was the hardest coz i rarely don't open up, but the trick is in finding that one person who you genuinely trust to help you. ◾ Workout: this trust me is the best ingredient to depression. You don't necessarily have to engage in the gym or financial straining fitness activities. I just started working out in my own room. Basic at home workouts 🌊 ◾ Cleaning: dirt and filth is not good for the mind. That's negative energy surrounding you. So cleaning is a way to realise all that bad tension. I personally take part in this one as well. ◾Tea: herbal teas have always been know for their healing components of relaxation. An article or video about this is coming soon. Drinking tea is a habit you should try. ◾ Reading: I personally I'm not a fan of reading. But reading is a good way to engage your imagination and create scenarios completely disengaged with your life. ◾ Listening to podcast: this is the best alternative to those who do not enjoy reading. Podcast are soothing and relaxing. You can listen to basically anything. But i would encourage you listen to motivating and inspiring content. ◾Draw: ohh yes. This i still do and it has worked like a charm ◾Dance: it's good to engage in exhausting activities and then later on just sleep. ◾Take a nap: my mother always said, ""if you can't fix the problem go to sleep"". True, sleep is good for boosting your brain and immune system. It's easy to try and solve a problem after a good sleep.

Try this and let me know how it helps. I would also like to know which other methods have helped you through or are still helping you through your depression 🌻🌻🌻",31Jul2020,1
153,"I’m depressed, demotivated, anxiety is high, I can barely do exercise, and most of all I wanna end my life now. 

I made a stupid mistake asking her a question I knew would probably put the friendship at stake, at first once I asked this question (I asked her out and I explained to her why I did this all of a sudden because i was getting addicted to masturbating and I wanted to quit so I thought having a partner for a little while would keep me away from doing such thing and remind me that I can’t do it cause it’ll make me feel worse) once she replied back, she said no and told me she would do anything but that and I understood and I took it easily I didn’t wanna force her into anything or make her feel uncomfortable. guess I messed up cause she started ghosting me and leaving me on delivered but she snapped me back the next morning so I was confused and mad and depressed and when I’m depressed I don’t make the right decisions. 

I regret making these bad choices and forgetting that I promised her I wouldn’t start another argument cause it just happens every time, we make up we’re cool and we’re friends for a few weeks and then something happens because I’m weak and I get mad over little things she does that I wish I never been mad about, and I just wanna reverse the damage and bring back my friend she was so special to me.

She thinks I like her but I don’t I don’t I’m just trying my best to make her feel comfortable and make her happy while some people have talked bad things about her and sometimes she thinks I’m the blame because I’ve gone to my friends and asked them for advice for rebuilding our friendship and I describe what she’s doing and the kind of person she is and they all have either something bad to the point where she thinks I’ve made the guys in our friend group dislike her cause they do now for whatever reason. she thinks I’m to blame and I can’t help but think it is I was only trying my best to help I feel so guilty and lost she misunderstanding me and I’m trying to tell her I was just lying to myself and overreacting when it came down to when people started talking bad stuff about her, I’m trying to tell her wha really happened and some of it is a misunderstanding and a lie but she just doesn’t wanna budge, it’s been 3 days my friend has been trying her best to get her to talk to me cause she knows I’m on the brink of wanting to commit suicide.

Look I’m stuck I can’t really do much, she’s all I have really, yeah I have friends but they’re all busy now with something and my anxiety is getting worse so I don’t have energy to even join the ft calls or even talk in the group chat. I’m really depressed I can’t move on without her, I need her most right now, I want her to give me a chance, I just need one more shot at forgiveness and 2nd chances. 

I can barely move I just wanna die, I can’t believe how she could disrespect me over something that wasn’t so serious, it doesn’t even compare to what the other guys did to her. She asked me to help chance her cause she’s no longer the person I was knew she’s toxic now because of them, I don’t get it why is she doing this, I know she’s uncomfortable right now and things are awkward. I just want to talk to her and apologize and convince her why I need another chance 

My depression, anxiety, and bi-polar disorder hit the best of me and I overthinked everything and straight up ruined my relationship with her. she said she’s still mad about somethings in the past and I don’t understand we’ve made up over those things I don’t get it. 

Please if I do get a chance where she lets me ft her what should say? How should I construct my apology in the meantime and what’s a good way to explain my wrong doings to her to make her understand that my disorders got in the way and I wasn’t making the best decisions.

Please anything, I’m thinking of committing suicide.",31Jul2020,1
154," I find it disgusting that NBA players wear jerseys that say ""stand up"" and ""Freedom"" while supporting the Chinese government, the oppression of Hong Kongers and the killing and enslavement of Uyghur Muslims. If they really cared about freedom, then they would stand with Hong Kong If they really cared about freedom, then they would stand with Hong Kong. So come on NBA, denounce the Chinese Communist Party if you truly believe in standing up against oppression and fighting for freedom, until then, take a long hard look in the mirror. Soon the B in NBA will stand for Beijing. #StandWithHongKong",31Jul2020,1
155,It’s always funny how you can always make time for someone but they can never make time for you. I never understood that when you need something I’m always there but when I need something you’re not there. Things have to change I keep giving second chances and it’s always the same.

Often I see someone with a well articulated post that is down-voted to oblivion.   These post end up at the same rank as people who post one word pointless answers.    I would love for this to be a forum for discussion and not the echo chamber it is increasingly turning into.  Would people be I interested in such a system?
