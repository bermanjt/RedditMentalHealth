i’ve been going to the gym for almost a month now and I’ve been trying to eat clean and I’ve really been doing my best and after every workout I have a protein shake sometimes a banana sometimes rice and beans sometimes just a shake but like no matter what I do I feel like I’m getting nowhere. Like I mean I’ve been gaining weight and that’s normal but like before the second 125 or like 127 and I just checked today and I weigh 131 and I’ve been trying to lose weight not gain it. I don’t know it just sucks because I wanted to lose weight and I mean muscles good but like it’s just hard because my clothes aren’t getting bigger and I don’t feel better. it’s just hard because like I’ve been doing abs specific exercises two in the lower part of my abs is the hardest part I have to deal with it still hasn’t gone away and I’m just really frustrated.",07Mar2020,1
1,"I’ve been really frustrated with my own mediocre performance in my AP World class. Half of my performance is due to the class being challenging and the other half is classic senioritis (99 days until graduation). 
Anyways we had a test on the largest unit of the course and I got 104 on multiple choice and 110 on the essay. 
I’m just really proud of myself for focusing and improving.",07Mar2020,1
2,"I seem to have a lot of supressed feelings because now I can't stop crying. She has ALS and a ton of respiratory and mobility issues brought on by it. I am extremely busy with school and I could only go see her yesterday after she has spent a week in the hospital already for having fluid-filled lungs, and they aren't expecting her to survive this weekend.

The worst part is seeing how aware of the situation she is, if she was kind of out of it would be less painful for our family. But she knows, she knows what's happening and it hurts so much.

I always wanted to have her see me go to university and get my degree, and now she won't be here. I feel like I failed her, I want to be with her but I can't miss schoolwork or having my grades drop. Today is my birthday, and I wish we could go eat some ice cream as we used to do.

Watching her cry as she held my hand and looked at me through the oxygen mask is the most powerful thing I've ever seen.

I love you, grandma. I'm so sorry.",07Mar2020,1

I am currently in my last phases of getting my braces removed and then I am looking to move in with her. 

But getting there seems to take ages and even when I do see her pretty much once a month it always hurts us both to say goodbye.

I just hope I can be here faster and get a job so we dont have to say goodbye anymore.

10,"I used to be very argumentative. Everytime someone said something I disagreed with, I'd voice my disagreement. Most of the time, it was about something factual, because I've noticed that most people tend to say a lot of unverified crap as fact as if their own beliefs are the absolute truth.

Fast forward to now, and I can now only rarely muster the will to correct people. I especially can't bother to change people's minds when they have wrong opinions about me. More often than not, people don't want reasons to change their minds. They want to hear why they're right. Being exposed to this over and over again just makes me angry and I prefer to separate myself from this toxicity.

Some of my relatives have views about me that I have noticed are extremely unfair. I used to try to convince them that those views were hurtful, but now I just don't bother. Why bother? People don't care about any opinions but their own or the ones by those they respect, and even then only up to a limit. I've had people who respect me fiercely argue with me, accusing me of misleading them when I'd been transparent from day one. Why bother, eh? Why bother changing their views? Why waste my time? People's just going to believe what people want to believe.",07Mar2020,1
11,"I think (no diagnosis because I don’t feel comfortable talking to my parents about it) that I have had social anxiety for a while now. I definitely have introverted tendencies. My main problem is that I really can’t act like myself and just be normal. When I try to actually act like myself in front of a group that is not just my friends, it comes out so forced - this makes me real fucking annoying. It has gotten to the point of where I can’t even feel like myself around a few friends and just one classmate that I have known (not friends, just someone part of school) for 2 years now. This is just depressing. My social life with my friends has been hurt too - they constantly go out on the field at lunch, usually playing volleyball with people  I have known for a while. While it may seem that I should be fine, I just can’t act like myself. I hate feeling awkward and uncomfortable around people, because I know they feel awkward too. Also I just want to point out that I know for sure that how I think my normal self acts is how I act. This is not just me putting on a mask. How can I help build my confidence and finally start acting like myself again? Do you think that going to a doctor to get a official diagnosis and meds to treat it would help? Thank you for any help that you can give me.",07Mar2020,1

I hate my life. I just wish everything would stop, and I wouldn't have to care about this new world I live in. I am still a teenager, not old by any means, but this world feels so foreign. Everybody else I know likes different things, and the new things, most of which I really don't like, are everywhere now. I just want things to be the way they were a few years ago.

Honestly, I really wish I never got a phone. I think it may have ruined my life.",07Mar2020,1

19,"Everything is in shambles. I’m usually good at keeping it together but right now I just wanna break down. Turned 18 last December and thought everything was smooth sailing from there. I had plans to move in with my long distance boyfriend and continue my education. I’ve been taking a few classes to land a job that can help me get through college. Everything was going good.

In February things began to change for the worse though. Mid February my boyfriend admitted to me he had a porn addiction. I’ve been researching it and coming to terms with it, but it wears me out emotionally. I constantly worried I wasn’t enough for him. I’ve been the most stressed I’ve ever been in my life. From searching for apartments, to searching for jobs in another state, to constantly worrying about finances.

About a week ago my boyfriend admitted to cheating on me. I was devastated. He talked to other women online and said he never did anything, but he still went behind my back and talked to other women. I’ve been having panic attacks for the past week. They’ve been wearing me down emotionally and I had one so bad yesterday my whole body felt tired afterwards. He says he won’t do it again but with my bad track record of dating, I have a hard time trusting anyone, including him.

Just a few minutes ago my stepfather lost his job. He was the main one supporting us. We’ve gone from making a decent amount of money to having to rethink how we spend our money from now on because my mom doesn’t even make half of what he made. I’m worried. We tend to have a decent bit of medical bills from my mom who has a mixture of different things wrong with her. Nothing too serious but we’ll wrack up medical bills sometimes that we’ll have to pay off for a whole year.

For the first time in my life I’m scared. I’m worried that everything is going to get worse and I just needed to let it out. Typing everything out kind of helps me deal with it all",07Mar2020,1

23,"Recently, I asked one of my close friends to attend a festival with me. My sister-in-law is performing at this festival and my partner and his family also may attend this festival. The problem occurred when I told my partner I would be attending this festival with him but rather with my close friend. He responded by saying that I did not ask him if he wanted to come with me ( He is on 24hour home curfew due to court conditions) and assumed he would not go. He reads my messenger so he is aware of everything I do etc, which I have no problem with. I live with my partner and don't see the problem with e spending time with my mate - she too has a partner who does not question what she does etc. Am I wrong to assume he would not attend? Should I have invited him also? Am I in the wrong?

I think this is a problem because A) I’m not even a legal fucking adult yet and B) everyone seems to like kids except me.

I just despise how stupid they are and children who are sheltered as fuck. But then they are like young and don’t know anything about the world but something about me just finds them so so so so fucking annoying. They scream in public, don’t provide anything to society, and just seeing them pisses me off. They’re so awkward.

And I know this will get me a lot of hate but I don’t care I’ve never told anyone and I’ve just bottled it up. I honestly think it’s a mental disorder.",07Mar2020,1

People think that I don’t have much working experience to be such a down to earth person but I’ve been practicing for almost a decade. Now that I keep receiving such comments, I’m starting to doubt how I live my life. It’s physically tiring but I don’t want someone of my mum’s age to carry heavy stuff.

26,"I thought I might share the past few months of my life, as it has been somewhat unorthodox.. to put in context I’m a 30 year old male, with a young son. I am a user, I use cocaine, speed and benzos.. the use of drugs has always been present in my life, from a young age, family members and friends would use to fill whatever void left in their life. 

The use of drugs eventually led to a year long battle with depression, starting around 2018.. my keeping it a secret made it hard for the people I love to understand what was going on with me, as well for myself up to my diagnosis of major depression this past Nov. 2019, the month everything came crashing down on me and my life put on pause . My behaviour had finally caught up to me. 

I was performing poorly at work, my relationship to the mother of my child and woman I loved was coming to an end and my overall well-being was on the verge of complete burn out. I mean how could I sustain this type of ritual? Impossible and foolish of me to think that I could. The years of using had me numb, emotionless, robotic, tired, warn out and beat down. Nov. 15th 2019 I had a psychotic episode which led to the end of my relationship, the diagnosis of major depression, a 6 month leave off work and a hell of a battle to find the person who once saw joy out of life. I would find myself alone in my house, missing all the chaos from my son, girlfriend, dog and 2 cats that had me complaining almost on a daily basis. God I missed it and still do to this day. 

Out on leave from work, not seeing my son and crippled by this monster of an illness, I set out in self destruct mode, consuming mass amounts of drugs, more than I have ever done before, with a “fuck it” type mentality, this of course did not help my situation, and spun me deeper in the depths of my depression, with all the meds my doctor had prescribed+ the drug use+ the booze+ the depression, it was just a matter of time I guess.

Dec 11th 2020. This day I will never forget, I took my car out that morning, to go pick up, whatever I could from who ever was available, I was completely out of my mind from the night before, I had a good friend stay with me over night, as he watched me hit line after line, the look of hopelessness on his face, worried to death for my well being and nothing he could do about it. After he left at around 7am for work, I took my car out to go pickup, as I was driving onto the on-ramp, something happened, I had never been suicidal but I can remember the pain, vividly, the pain of life and the pain of the memories, the things I had taken for granted, my selfishness.. I was on the highway around 9:30am and as I past a car to my left, I noticed and overpass and for some reason, at that moment, I said “ Fuck it “hit the gas and accepted death, the feeling of accepting death is.. unnatural to say the least, it goes against our instincts, it is a feeling that I will never forget. The car got up to about 100mph, I was in the left lane, it felt surreal, surely I couldn’t be going this fast? Was it real? I didn’t know at that moment. Objects in my peripherals were blurry from the speed and my steering wheel was shaking, I was headed straight for that concrete overpass when out of the blue, a car cut me off from the center to the left, I tried to avoid the car but clipped it in the back left as I was trying to swerve left to avoid it at all cost. BANG, violently.. 2 seconds after BANG violently once again, all I remember was sitting in my car, which was on fire, on the opposite side of the highway, people running around everywhere, I thought I had been severed in half, the pain in my abdomen was unbearable, I remember thinking right away “ fuck I hit someone” some innocent person.. going to work.. I will regret that for the rest of my life.

As I was sitting in my car, half unconscious, I saw flames form the hood, my instinct was to get out, did you read that correctly? My instinct was to GET OUT.. and live.. anyways.. the whole ambulance drive to the hospital,  the only thing I was asking was if the other person was ok.. and they were.. and so was I. Except for two giant bruises I had, across my chest and belly, from the seat belt I was wearing, the other driver walked away with stitches on their forehead.. I am looking at charges today.. dangerous driving causing harm, but I have my life, something that I didn’t really give a shit beforehand. 

My use had decreased dramatically and I am on the road to recovery, I’m scheduled to go back to work this coming April and have been in therapy 2x a week, seing a psychologist, working out and doing charity work at an old folks home.. I am doing great.. and I feel truly blessed to have been given a second chance. Life is fragile and delicate and too short, appreciate what you have, tell the people that you love how important they are to you, because tomorrow isn’t promised, to anyone.

28,"I was like 12 or 11 when a neighbour used to molest me sexually and used to threaten me.
I got beptized later when I became 13 and I told him to stop and my religion don't allow all these bad things.

He used to force me into doing shit. I am male and 22 now. No one knows about it. He is living normal life. Last year was so bad for me financially and mentally. My dad was not healthy, he was not getting any salary for 6 months. I was scared. He do not have gallbladder.

 I tried contacting some friends and asked them for work such as websites. No one helped me though. I found a friend lastly whom I found on Facebook who gave me small online work. I was studying in a uni and I thought that I should drop out. I was in severe depression and emotional as hell. I failed in 2 exams. I was good in academics throughout. Was in top 10. Everything messed up when I joined this new uni for higher studies. My roommate in hostel was pervert too used to fantasize about making playboy of our country. 

I can not sit in placements for companies this year. I am bipolar too and always think that I will make things work and do some stuff which end up failing, making me more depressed, everyday is a rollercoaster of emotions, one time I am manic and other time I am lying in my bed.

So my young brother who is now like 18. He is also shy. I looked at his phone, he searched for gay forums and apps and is part of some forums. I asked him about this. He did not tell me. This went for several months. I asked him several times that ""has anyone done something bad to him?"" He always denied. Today I told him about my past that a guy used to do bad shit to me. I was thinking that same guy was culprit. I was filled with resentment, fear and all that stuff. He told me that once a gardener tried to do bad shit to him, and my brother ran away as he was scared. My brother does not go outside anymore.

I can not tell it to my parents. They are old and are not much healthy. My career is ruined. I have no proof and I can not physically harm those perverts. This will raise many questions, and if went legal I can not win. I am really poor now atm. Now I am feeling so sad, I can not focus on study. I cry sometimes. I am coward I guess. I was always bullied, in school, in play ground, in everything. I was mocked because of religion. I live in area where we are minority. I am nerd wanted to break poverty of my family and make them proud. I wanted to freelance full time last year, but my procrastination, lack of expertise and depression ruined it. I try, give up, try again and procrastinate. If I get a job I will have to move away from my family making me more anxious. If this freelancing worked out it will be life saving. 

I am again in the beginning. I try to study, I get negative thoughts, I procrastinate. Yes I can not afford therapy. I will make it work somehow I think. I don't know how to feel safe in society. I am worried about my parents, my family all the time. 

I am reading ""feeling good new mood therapy book"". I have no friends, my career is ruined and I am depressed! This year I want to make myself stronger so that I can fight this bullshit. 

To the parents I beg you that always try to be in contact with your kids. Tell them when they are young that if someone touch them wrongly immediately tell you.

These perverts can ruin whole life of someone and can live normally in pride in society.

31,"TL;DR all the romantic relationships I witness suck ass, and has jaded me from wanting to pursue any of my own.

For so many years since the onset of puberty I thought I had this dream of what I wanted in life. It was what I thought of as the ""perfect life"", with a wife and kid(s), a 2 car garage, white picket fence, and walk-in closets in every room. I have never really been in a serious relationship, and only in the last two years I have been going out and actively dating. 

I am going to be 32 in 30 days and I have felt the desire to pursue the dream slowly dwindle away over the last few years. It started when I began working in property management 4 years ago. A lot of my tenants are young newlywed couples who are making their first homes in the apartments I manage. 

Anyway, I slowly began to notice after working there for one year that the couples who are coming in and renewing their lease are also approaching their first wedding anniversary, and they all just look fucking miserable. I mean each and every single one of them. There are so many times where I just want to shout ""is there a fucking reason everyone looks so fucking miserable!?!?!""

I have seen it with not just my tenants, but also my coworkers. My one coworker is physically sick because his wife is too demanding of him and IMO betrayed him with changing so much after the wedding. And my other coworker's husband cheated on her once she was diagnosed with stage zero breast cancer.

It's hard to say what I am actually feeling, since I have never experienced it myself, but I am just so cautious that I do not know if I am sabotaging myself in some way, shape, or form? The thing is, that I feel like I might be entering an existential crisis, or a quarter life crisis of some sort. I do not handle crisis' well, so I feel petrified so many days and cannot focus.

Is this normal? Or am I just making too much out of what I am seeing out of context?",07Mar2020,1
32,"I've been working at an office for almost a year now, some interns left so this week we got new ones.

We have two bosses at the office, one is the boss boss (BB) and the other one is a smaller ONE (SB), I don't know how to explain it so I hope that it made sense. Im normally the only one with the smaller one.
One of the new interns (K) was placed with SB and I.

For some background, the other day I was asked to stay one more hour past my shift, they repayed me by leaving early the next day. 

Days after, K told me she was going to stay an hour past her shift, I was not about to do the same, no one told us to so we were not getting that hour back, I went home and she stayed.

The next day BB told me that K got annoyed that I wasn't there so she ended up not staying the whole hour, I'm sorry, did you expected me to stay after hours without pay? Fuck no. 

Next one it's hard to explain, but next week we have a situation where we have the choice to have Monday free, all of us chose to have that. 

The next day SB told me that BB was working so she had to come to work too, but we shouldn't, BB asked some other coworkers for help that day so there was only K and I. 

Suddenly we were flooded with work, K told me she decided to come to work on Monday, honestly I was thinking the same but I ended up being send somewhere else so I could work faster and I finished two days of work on one, my bosses were happy with me and praised me for being fast, then K busted in and said ""it was the machine, if we had that one here we could do it too"", which is true but damn!. 

K still insisted on working on Monday and I was about to do the same out of peer pressure but when BB asked me about it I got brave and told her I chose to miss the day, I did the same with SB and they said it was fine, they were also happy with me because of what I said earlier so I also felt like I deserved it. 

When I had to leave I said goodbye to K, she told me ""See you on Monday!, I could see the annoyance on her face when I told her I was coming back until Tuesday, but honestly, I don't care! She could've done the same but she chose not to, no one told her to work that day, quite the opposite actually.

My whole body hurts because of stress and if have the opportunity to have Monday free with my same salary, you know I'm going to take it. 

Also, she treats me like her boss and expects me to tell her what to do and supervice her, when I barely even know what I'm doing myself, it makes me feel responsible for whatever mistakes she makes even tho it's not my fault. 

My internship ends on April so fuck it! I don't care that you can't use a printer without me there Karen (not her real name), I'm leaving and you can stay all the free extra hours you want but you can't make me feel guilty, I'm almost out the door and I'm not coming back.",07Mar2020,1

37,"I initially came on here to curse the world because I fucking hate everything and I’m currently living the dilemma of not wanting to die but also not wanting to live.

My girlfriend was really supportive of me all day encouraging for some little competition I was taking part in. Long story short, I lost. I told her how upset I was and she called me - after working for 8 hours straight on her feet - and talked to me for something like a half hour or more to comfort me. It worked in the moment, but it didn’t last.

I did my own thing the rest of the night, but wanted her attention again so I texted her goodnight (I did this because I have the emotional dynamism of a recently-pubescent adolescent). So I thought I’d be able to talk to her more but she was talking to other friends of hers and called me out on using her as a Dopamine Button.  And that made me so FUCKING mad, partly because she’s partly right, and partly because she wanted to talk to other people and not me (even if that’s not how she viewed it).  I’ve realized I need other people to maximize and/or process my emotions. And sometimes I try to set up something bad so I can take my anger out; I realized I was baiting her into doing something to make me made so she could be the scapegoat for my own short comings (fortunately I’m not an alcoholic yet and am able to see that I’m doing this).

Somewhat unrelated, but I live in my head so goddamn much. The emotional side of my mind GENUINELY thinks that she just doesn’t love me. And that’s a painful thing to feel, not least when the logic side knows that’s ridiculous. But it’s like I use the logic side of my brain as a tool to calm me down, even if I still don’t believe my emotions to be wrong.

In the end, I’m sad and mad at myself and the reason for that anger has successfully spilled over onto my girlfriend. How _healthy_ of me. There was nothing she could’ve done to actually make me feel better, it’s like I wouldn’t allow it. I’m a fraud. I hate my life and everything in it.",07Mar2020,1

A nice future with a view:

I'd get pregnant again

""Oh fuck, it's twins!""

I'd call them Alice and Mae

And we'd have wine and home-made pizza as we finish off our day.

I caught feelings.     
I’ve been a good sport about the whole thing. I don’t push anything. He doesn’t want a relationship, that’s understandable. He wants to see other people while he sees me, that’s ok, he’s not my boyfriend and I don’t expect him to act as such. He’s been honest with me about it all; I’m in no place to be mad about it.   

But that doesn’t make it hurt any less. I’ve accepted long ago that it’s never gonna happen. I’ve realized that Despite my poor self image, I know I’m worth more and i deserve somebody who will love me back and never make me question them.   
So why do I have such a hard time ending this? Why do I start breaking down every time I go to his profiles to hit the block button? Why can’t I bring myself to end such a shallow relationship? 

I’ve tried to stay strong and optimistic, trying to convince myself that I’m on the right path and that cutting ties is what’s best for me. But it feels so so wrong. And I don’t know why.

i dont feel depressed i dont feel anxious but i still feel weird

recently i went thru a period of psychosis, thot that i was mentally disbaled forreal, well i had like a paranoia. im kinda over it now. but still feel weird.

i have this weird fear of getting depressed. like i have no reason to be depressed, but what if it will start out of nowhere? it is so weird. and that thought makes me feel the way i feel now. i know it doesnt make sense but i dont even know.

im 18 btw, and lonely asf. maybe that's the reason

well im sure it caused me to be psychotic

im off college for a month now. fell out with my close friends and i am mostly at home. well i work out everyday, but i definitely lack human interactions. this past month was so bad. i didn't feel at peace not even once. i forget how it is to be around people, or how im percieved by them and probably that drives me nuts. because when im around people i feel normal, i dont feel there's anything wrong with me. well thanks god im past that period.

I just miss him so much.

It feels so stupid writing this. We weren’t even in a relationship. We met online and were in contact for 3 months. It’s not a lot, but trust me when I say our connection was so strong that it felt like we knew each other for years. Feelings developed quickly.

Unfortunately, it can’t work between us. There are some dealbreakers and inexcusable actions on his side. I broke off contact. It’s been a little over 2 weeks. I was fine at first. Relieved, and positive about the future. I knew I had done the right thing. I still believe I did the right thing. But now around 2,5  weeks of no contact, the loss hit me in the face. Here I am sitting at wo­­­rk, not being able to concentrate. Tears randomly welling up. One thing about me is that I have never missed people. I never had to deal with someone not being there  I desperately wanted to be. So this is new for me and I have a difficult time coping. When I’m actively doing something (cooking, socializing, going out) I’m fine. Okay. But when there’s no distraction (work is mainly staring at a computer for 8 hours) I feel all the things I don’t want to feel. I  fall asleep and wake up sad every day. 

I don’t understand how I’m fine at first but suddenly I’m not. And what do I do with these feelings? Do I actively shift my thoughts to something else? Do I just let it wash over me, defeated? I can’t just give into it, that would mean running to the bathroom a couple times a day to let the tears go. 

I’m not going to contact him. It would mean putting myself through this all over again. I know the relief and soothing effect of talking to him will be short lived. At some point we will hit the breaking point of irreconcilable differences again and then the cycle starts over. I know all this. I just need to know that it gets better and that pushing through is worth it. And that I won’t feel like this forever. I miss him, and I want him in my life so bad. And I know he misses me too. After all, I’m the one who cut things off due to dealbreakers. There is something deeply painful about laying in bed at night knowing there is a big chance he is thinking about me too, at that very moment. 

It’s frustrating to feel like this. If I cut it off for good reasons that I still stand behind, then why do I still feel this way? Why is my brain screwing me over like this and just conveniently putting the reasons for ending contact somewhere alllll the way in the back of my mind where I can’t access it easily? And instead just play our amazing conversations, his jokes, his compliments on a loop? 

No one I talk to about this understands. They think he's just some guy I liked and it didn't work out. But as someone who's going through life very misunderstood and not being able to connect with people on a deeper level: he literally felt like my soulmate and that's a miracle in itself. He's the embodiment of all that I've been looking for when it comes to emotional connection. I'm struggling, I'm sad and don't know what to do with these stupid feelings.",07Mar2020,1

I used to be the mentally stable one in my friendship groups but for the past few months I’ve been hiding heavy signs of depression and anxiety (I’m not self diagnosing just saying it’s similar to what I’ve seen or researched) and Ive been internalising it all because I tried to vent once and got attacked for it. I’m really scared of myself and any kind of social situation but I haven’t let anyone see so they don’t care which I don’t think they would or should if they knew anyway. I would really like a therapist but I will never ask my parents for one because I’m really bad at that stuff and life’s very ahhh. I don’t see an end to all the bad stuff and it feels like slowly everyone is turning on me. I don’t think I deserve to be unhappy because it’s unfair on others and I don’t think I deserve anyone who cares.

She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

80,"It was a long time ago, in my later teenage years, I rose to a challenge. With the choice between living normally, and becoming more, I was challenged to eat an entire Family Special meal, including a large pizza, large pasta, salad, and dessert. my coworker offered to pay if I could finish. I laid everything on the line.

At first I had no issue. My other coworker gave me a shot of olive oil to drink - to line the tanks. And so I began. From the pepperoni, to the salad, to the marinara, I conquered with ordain infallibility. The massive battle against the tomatoes was naught before the mighty appetite I bore.

As I came to discover, the enemy’s strength wasn’t in their power, but their numbers. As the war went on, and endless supplies of Caesar salad troops made their way in, assault after assault, I felt my spirit begin to crush. I wasn’t going to make it out. But I kept driving damnit, I won’t just sit by as I lose this. 

I kept on crushing. Upon half the restaurant bar before me laid the remains of my enemy.

Alas, my will did not hold. I fought with everything I had, yet there was left two slices of pizza and half a tiramisu. 

In honor of the lost in this war, my coworker still offered to pay for the meal. After all, it was quite almost an equal competition.

However not long later my body took a will of its own, rejecting the putrid acid that penetrated through by means of tomatical chemical warfare.

My whole life, I got so invested in what people thought of me or how something HAD to be a certain way or I wouldn't be happy. But  in reality, nothing objectively matters. So that means that I only invest time in the things that I enjoy, that I feel are worth struggling for.

So me and my bestie have known eachother since 8th grade. We did litterely everything together and we love the same food, activities, shopping etc. Recently starting last year November, we stopped facetiming ( we used to ft everyday ). I don’t know if it’s because we didn’t have time to facetime but we just stopped. We continued to be friends but the relationship kind of felt forced or unnatural. This year, I kind of drifted and started to hang with other friends. Our usual playful banter and sarcasm turned into awkward compliments and hellos. 
 
I never wanted to lose her and the thought of that scared me so I face timed her twice and she never answered. We started texting less frequently and she found a new best friend really easily ( she’s super popular and is president of the school). I got extremely jealous that I was never invited or thought of by her and her friends so i’m really scared right now. I know losing best friends is natural but I was so close to her and i’m scared i’ll never find someone like her which is true. 

I facetimed her right now, she answered but her new bsf was with her and they were doing a sleepover. While facetiming, she put the phone on the floor and forgot she was on ft with me so i hung up after 5 minutes of no interaction. PLEASE HELP ME",07Mar2020,1

I just moved to this country and I don’t have much friends, my classmates are really not my type of people, so I don’t interact with them and I don’t mind being alone. I have a boyfriend who I met a year ago and I like him but I wouldn’t say I’m always happy when I’m with him, even though we don’t see each other that much. I guess I sometimes think too much and I forget to enjoy my day with him. 

I have friends in my home country and in another city of the country I live right now. But I don’t contact them always, I don’t know why. I love my friends and I miss them but I don’t approach people that much. 

So when I’m alone in my apartment, I don’t smile a lot nor I feel extra sad nor lonely, I just do things that I can’t remember anymore and let the days go by. I don’t know what and why.

I don't like it very much but I don't hate it either. The thing is that it made normal conversation almost impossible due to bad acoustics. I did dance once or twice and it was good fun but I am not too enthusiastic about it but the women were really exhausting themselves. Maybe it was because of alcohol, alas it makes me sleepy rather than stimulated. 

So I was sitting there doing nothing for a lot of the time, I didn't want to dance because then I couldn't get off the dance floor again (everyone wants to have a go), I couldn't talk or have a laugh with anyone due to the loud music, and I didn't want to drink because I was already not that good on energy.

104,"I've been living in this town for 2 years now because of a medical residency. The culture clash is overwhelming, even though it's in the same country. But, the hardest part is my residency, which is a stressful, competitive and abusive workplace.
However, not everything is bad. I've met my boyfriend here, he introduced me to all his friends, and his friend's girlfriends...and he has a dog!
We have been together for over a year now, and his dog and I fell in love with each other. We are inseparable. 
He rents a grange with his friends, so they can have barbecues, the kids can play, the dogs can run... so, it's no surprise that I always take his dog to the grange. Actualy, I was the first to take a dog there, so  later his friends started doing the same. Sometimes they throw parties in the grange too, and the dogs go along.

Today was a different party. This time 3 girlfriends (it's a very sexist culture this one) decided to throw a party at the grange, invited all their girlfriends, but no man was invited. I was invited as well. To tell you the truth, I was not really in the mood. My best friend in my job, and in this town, decided to quit this week, because she couldn't stand the abuses any longer. But, I could use a beer. So, I put a dress (which I never do), some make up (never do it at all, but figured I needed to feel pretty), put the dog in the car and there I went. 
 
When I got there, I could feel that my dog was not welcome. Some ladies started to yell at him, others would move the food away angry (thinking he would grab it). They didn't like that he started to pee on the threes and leg of the wood tables (all dogs did that there. We would scold them and that's it). I didn't like it either, because I started to feel embarrassed as could see they were not pleased at all. I Could hear the ladies saying: ""who brought this dog here?"" And another told me ""you know, we locked Bibi in our lodge when the guests came"". But I didn't take my dog from the confort of his home to lock him in a tiny room. 

I was so embarrassed. I had no friends there. I was spoiling those girls party with my dog. How could I not know that I shouldn't have brought the dog? And the music, everythink... I felt like I didn't belong. So I said to them: I'm going to lock the dog in our lodge. When I got next to my lodge, and no one was near, I couldn't help but cry. I don't know why. I put the dog inside the car and came home without saying a word. I cried all the way home. No idea why. Now, I feel ridiculous, childish and embarrassed for leaving like that.

Also, many people tell me that I am attractive and I'm pretty confident in myself anyway, so this whole thing doesn't come from insecurity or a need of validation. It's just like a desire of getting closer to those people after analysing everything they do, think and say (this sounds creepy lol, sorry) but I really cannot tell why...Btw, I am a junior in college.

If you're willing to read more about this, here comes a little back story. \*Disclaimer\* I don't know how to tell a story without unnecessary details. Sorry about this :/

There's this guy who has been friends with most of my very close friends for a while now. I met him almost 2 years ago at a party, but at the time we had almost no interaction with each other, mostly bc he just didn't seem the type of person I would normally be friends with, so I had no interest in getting to know him (again, as a friend). However, my friends have been keeping in touch with him since he moved away for uni and when he came back, a friend of mine invited him to his party. So we met again after a long period of time in which me and him didn't talk at all. Anyway, I don't really know how this happened but on that night we ended up spending hours with each other and didn't even talked to the other people. He was following me everywhere and was acting very kind but also quite flirty (I didn't think anything of this bc I knew this was more like his personality). Despite all of this, we haven't really talked after he got back to uni. I know he told my bestfriend (who is also his bestfriend..) about how he ""refrained"" from hooking up with me bc he didn't wanna do anything unless I initiated it. Anyway, it's been 2 months and I still have this weird attraction to him, but it isn't even like I would wanna have a relationship with him. I just ask my friend random but quite personal questions about him (this is very easy to do since they are such good friends and constantly text to each other) and he doesn't think anything of this bc of the fact that I will soon go to a uni in the same country as this guy. 

Situations like this happened to me so many times, it's like I wanna psychoanalyse every (decent) guy that hits on me. Please, tell me your opinion about this and thanks for reading!",07Mar2020,1

Even Kira from deathnote was very logical. He just wanted to get rid of all the people who commit crime and make the world a better and safer place to live in.

Just because lives are being taken why do people think that's bad. I feel it's a good thing when lives are lost, the population is reducing.

The coronavirus is the best thing that can happen. Hopefully it can wipe out a major chunk of the population.

Having so many people around is such a excess weight.

I think I've known for a long time, however have had my head buried in the sand as my problems got worse, and the worse they got the harder it was to look. It feels like at times that most of the decisions I've made throughout my life have hindered me in some way or another, and on top of that I have little to no social skills from isolating myself for the majority of my teenage years, and then getting heavily into drugs in my late teens. I've never had a meaningful relationship and I don't really know how I would approach it due to having ED. I don't want to paint myself as a victim as I've done far too much of that already but I realise that most of my actions have stemmed from a lack of real, meaningful connections with other people (my parents included to some extent) so the only way for me to fix this is to put myself out there. The problem being that I don't know how to and whenever I do it seems like people dismiss me, whether it's due to my lack of conversational ability or my kind of weird nature (isolating yourself will do that to ya). I would also like to add that I have been terribly mean to a lot of people throughout my life and have existed in a kind of negative feedback loop so I understand why I am where I'm at and yet I am more than ready to put all that behind me and really start *living*.

I was in therapy for awhile until my therapist ghosted me and I suffer from depression and panic/anxiety attacks every once in awhile. It’s not all just because of what happened with him, but I know that some of it is. 

I hadn’t role-played since I was in eighth grade. Now, I’m a sophomore in college and today, I went and played DND with my boyfriend at the library where he works. I had so much fun. I couldn’t stop laughing at the outrageous and amazing things the DM came up with. I know it’s not the same type of role-playing but it’s a very small step and one that I’m proud of.

129,"I’m lonely. I miss the way being in love feels. I have a couple people I could date if I really wanted to right now, but none of them are really perfect for me. I just want someone that I love, that loves me. I have only been single for the past 4/6 ish months (it’s complicated), but I can’t take it. After being in a relationship, I find it almost impossible to just not love with someone and showing them I care and cuddling and such. I really want someone to hold me and hug me and tell me they love me and for me to know I feel the same. I’m just so impatient, I can’t expect to find a perfect partner so fast, but it’s frustrating being alone. How do I make being single more bearable?",07Mar2020,1
130,"I actually think my birth order and the timing of my birth made it only natural that no one cares about me. 

I'm the youngest of 5. My parents had me much later than they had my siblings. In fact, my oldest brother's wife was pregnant at the same time as my mom. I'm only a few months older than my niece. 

My parents had my siblings when they lived in the city. I was born years later after they'd moved to the country. So, no one even knew they'd had another child. It's like my parents intentionally bred their own care giver because my siblings were all gone to live their own lives and I was home. 

So, when my dad started having heart problems, it was me that did all the appointments. When he died, it was me that had to plan his funeral. And, naturally, my mom needed me to stay home because she'd never ran a house. My dad did everything or I did. 

And it wasn't just my parents I took care of. My eldest  nephew had colon cancer. I was called on for his care. My brother (father to my nephew with cancer) had pancreatic cancer. I was called on. My youngest brother's wife screwed up their tax returns by filing married but separate (they were very married and living together) and he got the IRS bill requiring repayment. Who does he call to help him, me (I'm an accountant). My youngest brother gets scammed by someone planning vacations. Who does he call? Me. My sister's eldest daughter drains her bank account. Who does she call? Me. My youngest brother has a stroke. Who gets him medical care? His wife? Nope, me. Who acknowledges everyone's birthday? Me. 

Even amongst my friends and coworkers. Anyone has a problem they call me. I acknowledge birthdays and achievements. I encourage people when they're struggling. 

Now I'm here. Taking care of my mom who has dementia. 

No one calls to ask how I'm doing or if I need anything. I turned 50 in May, no one noticed. I'm depressed. No one notices. I'm lonely. No one notices. I was The Unknown Child.  I'm still Unknown.",07Mar2020,1
