Same name, wrong female. I can imagine the surprise though. Damn.


No this other one reached out here on Reddit. Just wanted to compel her to speak freely about what she thought a good future would be.",09Jan2020,1
1,"I’ll keep it short. Basically her and I have been on and off for years following the same cycle. First she reaches out to me, then we’re friends, then we get together, then she pushes me away, she avoids me and we don’t talk for months, then she reaches out again and gives me a shitty reason why everything happened. 

We broke up 2 maybe 3 months ago. I can’t get over it. We were still talking again for a little bit afterwards, but she stopped seeming interested and responding. She says she wants me in her life and that she wants to be friends, but her actions always say something different than her words. 

Does anyone have any similar stories or anything to say? I just wish I didn’t constantly think of her and miss her, even though I know she will only ever hurt me.",09Jan2020,1
2,"This isn't where I facilitate fantasies each and every day. I require concrete plans of action. Direct message and ask for my phone number or something. Create an email account at gmx.com. Nervousness accomplishes nothing now and never has before. 

You confused the females with my sisters. Pretty freaky and completely wrong. 

I just went through years of this nonsense and I'm not looking to continue.


These nice Christians up here turned me over to the police for no reason along with some very foul lies. Caught the informants and tracked down the officers involved. Very underhanded bullshit. No long term plans for Idaho.

3,"I just got out of a lie that was poisoning my existence, hurting my parents doing so and yet they are the most cheering and supportive people. Now it's time for me to put in the hard work and, I can't stress this enough, I want to, but I just can't. I want to do stuff but when the time comes I, can't, I just can't. My head gets dizzy, the anxiousness kicks in and I go back crawling in my bubble. I don't know what to do anymore, I go to therapy, I have loving and supportive family and friends but I don't know, it's a dog biting his tails, I want free time but when I have it, I waste it.  It's affecting my body as well, I go to bed feeling like trash every night. 
I wait, wait and wait for something that may never come, for that moment when the light just shine upon me, but life doesn't work this way, I know that, I always did and yet, I can't. It's a leap of faith I guess, but I don't think I have the strength and willingness to do it.

All I did was click ""TRY FOR FREE"" and ""CONTINUE"". There was never any agreement to be charged after the trial and they just build credit card of mine they had on file.

6,"Years ago I was depressed. It stemmed from a messy break up and eventually transitioned to my everyday life. I got over it with the help of therapists, meditation, and self realization and lived several years happy and full of life.

Recently I feel as if things are falling apart again. I get the feeling that people view me as cocky, which is my biggest insecurity, and that everything I say is jaded because I am saying it to promote my ego or some other stupid bullshit. I feel like my intentions are misinterpreted. Guys I grew up with have expanded our friend group and excluded me from plans. I can’t figure out my living situation for next year. I feel useless at my job.

I hate these fucking feelings. I know that I can be happy, it’s just hard to change my view when the world is screaming at me.",09Jan2020,1

That being said, my bank account is $68 in the negative. I asked my mom for money (she lives 10 hours away) because I just now got hired at my job and won’t get paid for 2 weeks and I don’t want 2 more overdraft fees of $35 each to come out. She said “I would if I had the money.” Which is a complete lie considering she has money to tan 3 times a week, buy her alcoholic boyfriend booze 4/5 times a week, pays $14 every day on cigarettes, and can’t LOAN me some money. I would obviously pay her back when I get paid in 2 weeks, but I guess she just wants me to suffer and be $130 in the negative because cigarettes and booze for her and her boyfriend is more important than her daughter being able to eat and live.",09Jan2020,1

12,"Back in 2017 my friend Dylan and his girlfriend Leah invited me to go camping with them and I invited my girlfriend Tori to come along and she said yes. We had only been dating for a little over 2 months but I didn't think it would be too awkward since we recently started sleeping together and she had hanged out with Dylan and Leah a few times.  We all wanted a ""real"" camping trip and chose Red River Gorge in eastern Kentucky. 

We hiked up hill way out in the woods and found a good spot where people had setup camp before. I bought a 2 person tent and blankets to make a sleeping pallet and Dylan brought his 4 person tent along with an inflatable mattress for them and their German Shepard Teddy. I felt like a cheap bastard watching them inflate it while I explained to Tori I spent $140 on all the stuff I bought and I was broke. She told me she didn't care ""as long as she was with me"". 

We got everything set up, started a camp fire and started drinking the Jim Beam and Coke while the girls made ""bull frogs"" with their kool aid and vodka. Roasted hot dogs and smores and talked about family camping trips, party stories and what not. I was glad to see Tori laughing and really having a great time, I held her and glanced up at the stars through the trees a few times thanking God I had her. Everyone got pretty drunk me and Dylan had finished a fifth of the whiskey and I was sweating like a whore in church because it was so humid. around 1am we were in our tints and me and Tori had  a wild sweat drenched sex session and slept in our underwear because it was so muggy inside the tent. 

I woke up around 5am with my stomach cramping like hell. I clinched my eyes and bit my tongue trying not to moan out in pain and wake up Tori. I put my clothes on, crawled out of the tent, stood up and dug out a roll of toilet paper from the bags between the tents and ran into the deep brush. I tripped on a tree root and dropped the fucking toilet paper and it rolled down the hill. I started running back to get another roll and couldn't handle the pain anymore, I tried to let out a little fart and felt warm juice squirt out. ""fuck me fuck please no"" I said as I pulled my shorts and boxers down to examine them with the light from my phone. There was brown chili looking shit ALL in my boxers. Like pulling over and opening your smoking car hood and you know your engine is fucked. 

I quickly pulled my boxers off, squatted down to finish my intensely messy shit that sounded like pouring a bucket of wet sand on the leafs and felt SO much better. I tossed my boxers away from the trail and heard someone walking down from the camp site. I freaked out because I had shit all over my legs and on one of my hands and it smelled like a fucking porta potty in the middle of summer.  It ended up being the dog Teddy. I shooed him away and used the bandana wrapped around my forehead to wipe my butt and tossed it. 

I  sneaked back to the campsite and cleaned up with a bar of soap and a bottle of water with the dog awkwardly watching me the entire time and decided to sacrifice my deodorant stick and rub it all over my skin and down my butt crack to mask the horrid smell. I went back into the tent cuddled up to Tori and went back to sleep. We woke up to Leah screaming, we got out of the tent and seen Teddy running out of their tent with her screaming ""WHAT THE FUCK YOU NASTY GOD DAMN DOG!!!"" we walked over and asked what was wrong and Leah told us Dylan's stupid dog dragged underwear into the tent full of shit and she had it on the back of her shirt. 

Tori was disgusted and looked away while Dylan got out and went to find a stick. I was panicking hoping Tori wouldn't see my American Eagle boxers and told her ""that's so sick I don't want to see them"" and hoped she would follow me back to tent. But she didn't. She ignored me and stood there while Dylan held the baby blue boxers on the end of the stick dripping drops of poop on the ground holding his nose as he put them in a Walmart bag. I stood there and seen Tori looking at my waist out of the corner of my eye with a fake disgusted shocked look on my face and not one on hers. 

""Who's fucking underwear is it?"" Leah asked looking at me and Dylan. We both denied it was ours and I suggested it was someone who previously camped here. ""Yeah well it seemed pretty fucking fresh to me, I'm a CNA trust me I know."" Tori was completely quiet while the two fought about the dog always being into something and Leah threatening to leave Dylan if he didn't get rid of Teddy. I tried to keep my poker face on while Dylan poured water on Teddy and scrubbed with his tooth brush to get the shit out of the fur because of course the dog rolled in the shit. There was no way in hell I was going to admit that I shit myself, I had a feeling Tori knew it was mine because even though it was dark I'm sure she seen my boxers when my shorts sagged. Leah would fucking kill me if I said it was mine after having to throw away her shirt and go through all that. 

We ate breakfast, packed up, stopped to fill up on gas and started driving back home. Tori was very quiet and funny acting towards me, She randomly says ""I would be pretty mad if I woke up to the smell of those underwear. But I would understand that someone got sick."" and starred at me. I took a deep breath and admitted I got sick, and did not ever think of the dog getting to them when I threw them in the woods. She asked why I didn't own up to it and I told her I was too embarrassed to. 

We didn't have sex for two weeks and she acted funny around me. A month later she got really drunk from mixing Brandy and gin. Shit all over herself and puked her guts up in my bathroom and was too drunk to clean herself up. She was laying in the floor crying so I picked her up, put her in the bathtub and cleaned shit and puke from the toilet and floor then bathed her like a real boyfriend would do. She told me she understood why I was too embarrassed to own up to my shitty boxers.",09Jan2020,1
13,"I found my employment authorization card, now while that might not mean alot to you however to me it's a breath a fresh air. 

I lost that card about 6 months back. Right around the time I lost my job, and the house my family was planning to move to. 

Around the same time that I was drinking every night, and smoking the day away.  I was in a very bad spot back then but the silver linings is that it got much worse. 

I was unemployed for about 3 months and with no EAC I cant apply for jobs, I can't collect unemployment as that would hurt my chances of obtaining residency in the future. So I had to rely on savings(very little btw, as I'm still supporting my family. 

When that ran out my credit card, when that ran out I had to get loans from friends, I hate that. 

I did however find shit jobs Mexicans have to do to survive, just like I did back in highschool. That was humbling to say the least. 

I began working construction under the table surviving payceck to paycheck. Working 65 to 70 hour weeks all through fall and winter 6 days a week. Shit like that is why understood why so many construction workers drink on the job, it hurts.

So here I am new yr and the card that was gonna $700 to replace just gets mailed to me by some good samaritan. So here I am with over 3k in debt and again short and late on rent hoping for some miracle. 

Tommorow I'm applying to every fucking job post I see. 
I was never defeated but I wont lie and say I didn't feel worthless and useless and pathetic for so long. 

I will lift myself up, no fake friends to weigh me down, no more just sitting back. I will go for what I want and make no apologies.

I wont waste this little break in my torture. I'm escaping this hell and saving myself and my family.

14,"I'm loosing it. I don't know what to do anymore.
Been trying to get back into my most recent relationship that I know only is destructive. We keep hurting eachother in differerent ways over and over.
His way of hurting me is telling me to seek help, that I have mental problems, that I'm insane, manipulative, a psycopath, that I'm stupid and selfish, that I'm a wet towel that only soaks up everyones happiness. And so on.
I've struggled a lot with my confidence for the past ten years, and hearing all of this just makes the struggle to heavy to deal with.
I know I can be a lot to handle, but this much?
I used to think that we're just two completely different people, that he just say these things because he doesnt understand me or my way of thinking.
But I dont know anymore. If I'm this awful should I even be around people?
My main goal in life has always been trying find someone to live with, get a place together, surprise him with food when he gets home from work. Will I ever be able to achieve this if I'm only a psycopathic wet towel?
I dont know what to do.
It may be a stupid silly tiny goal but it's one of the few things that gets me through my days, that makes me go to work or take classes in school.

15,"I have the specifications on the show, it could be Battlestar Galactica but it is just a guess. It could be Fringe the television series. I have contacted the FCC,Syfy channel, and cox cable and they do mot know what it is. They cannot access archived records that far back. I have tried searching online in different forums, reddit, quora, and facebook. I have contacted many people and different organizations about the television scenes that I saw. In one scene there is a woman in a red dress with blond hair sitting alone in a pitch black room that resembles Marilyn Monroe. She disappears in a semi dark room into thin air. I think there is a green light and she is sitting next to it in a brown chair. She is wearing a skin tight red dress and she is a Caucasian woman. The character might be Tricia Helfer the actress from Battlestar Galactica. I saw the scene in 2013 along with other scenes that day possibly on August 16 or maybe February 15.It was around 2:00 pm that day that I saw the scenes. In another scene a man uses keys or lockpicks to unlock a door while standing next to another woman that is panicking. The door was brown and both people were Caucasian. The man was struggling to use whatever was against the doorknob to unlock the door. It seemed like it was keys on a keychain or small lockpicks to get the door open with the correct device. The two actors were unknown in the scene. In another scene a man and a woman encounter a room with racks of weapons in a semi dark room. The room had a light green hue to it next to the weapons. The two actors are unknown.

17,"I live in NYC and I'm on a joint lease with 2 other roommates.  I lived in this apartment for 3 1/2 years without any problems, until my old roommates moved out and I got the new ones.  They moved in October 1st.  One is great and I like her a lot.  The other is awful.  She managed to get fired from her minimum wage job and didn't really look for a job for over a month because she ""needed a break"", but she assured us she had money for rent.  She paid December, but at the end of December it became clear that she didn't have money for January.  She did not tell us any of this until right before Christmas, so I spent some time that weekend having a panic attack that we were going to get evicted January 2nd (unless new roommate and I paid her share, which we really did not want to do).  Bad roommate hates us now because we confronted her about not having a job and told her she has to pay rent, and if she doesn't we will all get evicted.  She's been super evasive and we've caught her lying about a couple of things.  I am nervous.  She told our landlord that she got a part time job, but didn't tell me when I asked.  I just don't trust her, and I don't think I can deal with the stress of wondering if this girl is going to pay every month or not.  She said she got someone to give her money for rent for January, which she paid in the end, and February, but I have no way of knowing if that's true.  Meanwhile, my landlord is understandably unhappy with this situation and is making me anxious with what might happen here.  

I have started looking for other places to live to get away from all of this.  I just don't want to.  I like my apartment and my neighborhood.  It will cost me thousands to move, with a security deposit for a new place, hiring movers, etc.  Plus timing a move here is so tricky with giving notice and finding places where someone has already given notice is difficult.  I may have to eat a month's worth of rent to make sure that I secure somewhere else I'm realizing.  And I was thinking about moving to a new place this summer, but I don't know if I will be able to afford that now if I move right now to get away from this stupid girl.  She is unbelievably inconsiderate and self-centered. I've never seen anything like it in my life.  

I don't know what to do.  I don't want to spend my time looking for new places to live, and I really don't want to blow that much money, but I feel like I don't have a choice.  The longer I stay here, the more like I feel like I am tempting fate and I'm going to have to pay this girl's rent to avoid eviction, which is tantamount to rewarding her behavior.  I'm definitely not going to let her live here for free, so I would want to leave in that situation anyway.  Thanks to anyone who read this.",09Jan2020,1

In general, I'm uncomfortable to tell my friends about my crushes or hookups. Well, I tried to but they don't seem interested or they don't seem to care. I always listened to theirs. Tbh, they are kinda prudes. I don't know.

My cousin was my BFF and we could tell each other everything including our dark secrets. I wish we didn't drift away as we got older. I mean I know she did hookup and she did have her own mistakes so I'd be comfortable to tell her about mine. Too bad, we aren't on speaking terms in many years.

I haven't found a new BFF like her but some wanted me to be their BFF but it wasn't the same.

I know it sounds ridiculous because I shouldn’t let kids push me around but it really has taken an emotional toll on me. I’ve been at this job for a year and a half now and I knew going in that I would deal with bad kids, but I never imagined I would on the scale that I’m currently dealing with them. And if you think a kid is too young and innocent to sexually harass someone, you’re sadly mistaken because it’s happened to me on a few occasions. About once or twice a week, they push me so far past my limit that as soon as the last kid leaves, I just cry for the rest of my shift and cry on the drive home. This job just taints everything good about my life (which is literally everything else) and makes me feel sad and empty a lot. This job has also made me never want kids. As soon as I leave this job, I am never going to get any sort of childcare job ever again because it’s just horrible.

My name is Cal and I'm a comic book artist with a focus in history and mystery stories (mostly cold and unsolved cases). I am making this urgent post in hopes of the internet helping me find what I'm looking for in a short amount of time for a story pitch.

I am currently working on a story about a missing passenger plane that vanishes and never shows up to its destination in India after taking off from another country (still working on that part). With this project, I am in charge of creating the story, drawing the pages, and creating the advertisements for it.

What I need from the internet is I need to find as many Breaking News or initial news report videos as possible from around the world and reporting on missing planes. The oldest missing plane newscast I will accept is from 1998 and the newest is present day.

I am NOT looking for theories, articles/written reports, etc. If the video is in a news article, I will accept that. What I mostly need is any video news report that mentions something about a missing plane that has gone missing and there is no evidence of where it could be.

I need these as soon as possible and I will take most anything I can get my hands on. Thank you, internet!",09Jan2020,1

I have tried many times beforehand and always did not stick to it. My excuses for the gym were that because the gyms I had access to for free (my university gym and old apartment complex) I was super insecure about the people around me because they were super fit college kids. I moved a couple months ago to a family apartment complex and I went to the gym for the first time today. I was expecting to hate it and not last long..... 


But i truly enjoyed it. I was surrounded by “normal” people and I lasted much longer than I expected to. I thought maybe I’d last 20-30 minutes (that’s how long I lasted before) but this time I did it 45 minutes without any breaks on the machines, only breaks when switching. 

I have also been clean eating for the past week and I’m okay with that and have truly enjoyed all the meals I’ve made. I’m not restricting myself from the foods I eat too much, as I always ate pretty well, but I’m cutting back on portions. Which I have been really good with.

But the country is really poor and violent. In 2012 - 2016 they had the same casualties as a country in a war. And just last year they celebrated because it was the first day in a couple of years that there were no reported murders by gang members.

35,"It just happened. Very blizzard-y weather. Thick snow on the road. Late at night. I had been visiting my mom’s place, and when I got about 15 feet from her driveway, a modern looking sedan, maybe a Chevy or Ford, pulled out and got behind me. They got quite close which immediately got my radar up. I began to get a really sick feeling. Just a really strong feeling that there’s something bad going on. They follow me for 10 miles! I get to the first turn off that would get me home but decided not to lead them to my house. So I keep going. I’m thinking maybe I’m being paranoid so I make four right turns across some side roads. Well. They’re still on my tail. At this point I start getting angry that they think they’re gonna get a piece of me, so I pick up some speed. I live in a very rural part of the country. I’ve got limited options for law enforcement and a long ways the other way to the nearest station. I can’t go fumbling on my phone as it’s taking everything to keep my car on the road in this weather. So I’ve gotta try to outrun them. It’s 20 miles to the next town with lights on at this hour, and they keep on my ass most of time. I’m skidding my SUV on the snow to give me some distance and they’re damn near going off the road trying to stay with me. It’s winding roads and bucking hills the whole way. I get to the small town and drift and weave through some residential side roads until their headlights disappear from my rear view mirrors. I hop back onto the big road and head for the next town. I make a long loop and eventually head home once I’m sure I’m alone again. Made it home safe and now I’m just so angry. I mean what the fuck, right?",09Jan2020,1

This morning he texted me all weird saying how “when are you gonna pay me?” He’s normally not like that etc so caught me off guard and I’m jokingly like “uh actually I’m getting deployed rn and it’s top secret so I can communicate at all, I’ll see you in 3 years” and he’s like going more into it and I’m like “Jesus are you really struggling for money that bad” and he’s like na I just wanted to bring it to your attention (again we usually do this when I ask him to buy something we’ll go over how much I owe him) and even then I’ll have to be begging him to tell me how much I owe him so ya weird af

He was like “get Venmo” “set it up” “verity it” and I’m like “still won’t let me send” and rn after a couple of hours he’s like “did it let you send?” And I’m like nah and I’m like “alright ur poor af” and he’s like “we went over this already” 

But yeah... he’s being weird af about it either he’s struggling or wants to take an early vacation but then again doesn’t sound like him since he’s p responsible with money. I ended up just writing him a check",09Jan2020,1
37,"so im thinking to myself, worried about the potentiality of prostate cancer in my late age

my vigorous masturbation will greatly reduce my chances of developing prostate cancer

but if im just a slave to sex, attractive women, porn and the same repetitive pleasure, is it worth it?

so what, i live to 85 instead of 75?

i think when you look at your life right now--- it doesn't feel like that many years has really went by and actually with every passing year its as if they are happening sooner

i think this will be the same on the day its time for me to die

ill be sitting there like 'holy fuck where did my life go? it was like I was just born yesterday"" 

so is the extra ten years really worth it?

its as if whether you die at 50 or 90 its almost just as quick, the only difference is at fifty you have the existential crisis of thinking you haven't accomplished enough with your life

so it is really worth it to to masturbate under the guise it is perhaps helping my risk of prostate cancer

look at me acting as if i even have a choice in the matter

i feel as if to completely suspend all porn watching would be the same as kicking heroine, maybe even worse as you can be a highly functioning porn addict... i suppose the only difference is you die a slaves death instead of a free\*  death.",09Jan2020,1

44,"This story is a happy one.    

I don't even know where to begin, though.    

I'm a junior in college. I had an incredibly difficult time transitioning to college. I lost my high school sweetheart after moving, I never really developed a secure friend group, I have taken out buckets of student loans \*but on the bright side of paying for college myself, I've earned many scholarships\*, and I spend my time studying and reading and working my job \*but I am so grateful for the chance to attend college in the first place\*.    

I'm the first traditional college student in my family for the first time in a few generations. I grew up in a tiny, tiny town and moved to the biggest city in my state for school. The neighborhood I grew up in was infamous for a triple homicide, teenage pregnancies, high school dropouts, domestic abuse, drug abuse... you name it. There is nothing wrong with many of the things I listed, but everyone in the neighborhood kind of despised the idea of college and those who chose to go.    

So back to the beef. I have started commuting to campus which takes about 60-90 minutes one way to drive and park and all. This was a little bit of a challenge to get used to, but I am so, so fucking grateful to my sweet, generous sister, my brother-in-law, and niece for allowing me to live with them. They graciously invited me in and immediately set up the guest bedroom into my own cozy, perfect nest. My brother-in-law makes tea for each of us each night. I get to snuggle with all of them on the couch before bed. It is the most I've ever felt at home in my life.    

That being said, I still get snakes in my head. I get sad for no reason and think about ending it all because I'm not doing enough, or I think I'll never amount to anything, or I focus on how out-of-place I feel in this city. Logically, I know this is not true, but it is a fact of life that these are thoughts and feelings I have. (I have been medically diagnosed with MDD, ADHD, and anxiety so there is a cocktail of mental illnesses that contribute to this, but I am actively being treated and I am happy as happy as I think I'm capable of being). 

So, I was having one of those days where you convince yourself the day will be incredible. I woke up early and poured myself an iced coffee in a mason jar. I was dancing in my car while driving to school. I was singing and held my left hand out of the window to feel the air swirl around my fingers and palm. I felt amazing. But something happened when I got to campus- that existential fear and dread that comes from nowhere and wrings your insides like a wet rag. I parked and hyperventilated in my car until I absolutely \*\*had\*\* to go to class. Weakly, I grabbed my backpack began the trek.    

My classes are fascinating and I am in love with the course material of everything I'm taking. But, something happens when you have depression. That excitement and joy can be crushed in an instant. I've dealt with this my whole life, but it has become much worse since coming to college (to the point where I tried to end my life my sophomore year). I have A's and B's and my professors adore me, but I can't convince myself that I \*am\* what I (logically) know I am... \~\~I sound crazy. I guess that's because I am.\~\~    

After having my surprise freakout, I was feeling a little beaten down about myself and my day. My final class is from 5-7:30 p.m. and I was dreading going because I knew it would be dark when I had to walk back to my car and I would not make any friends because I felt too anxious and on edge after my Artax moment in the car. I always sit in the front of the class because I can focus best there, but I sat in a corner. My professor smiled at all of us, introduced herself, and whipped out the syllabus.    

While reading it, she notes that we only have two absences for the semester. She told us that she was in a moral dilemma about giving us two because in a 1x/week class for 14 weeks, if students missed both with no penalty, they would be missing 1/7th of the semester. Now, I am not one to miss class unless I am fairly certain that death is imminent from the flu, my tire pops, or \*I accidentally oversleep and lay in a guilty depression burrito for the rest of the day.\* Still, she said she felt that two are fair. She asked us to please not come to class if we were sick so we would not get others sick. Everyone agreed, but she continued.    

""If you are having a bad mental health day, if you are not feeling your best, if you are too anxious to focus, or if you are too sad to get out of bed... I don't care. \*\*Mental illnesses are just as serious as physical illnesses.\*\* If you are nauseous from the flu, no one will tell you to stop being nauseous. Why do people do that with mental health? If you ever need to miss a class or two because of this, I don't mind. I actually encourage it if it will make you feel better.""    

I tried so hard to keep it together. I did. I hiccuped and then the tears began to fall. I was so embarrassed. I felt my face flush. She continued talking through the syllabus with the occasional glance at my wrinkled face with furrowed brows. The moment she finished, she called for a 10-minute break and sat at the desk beside mine.    

""There isn't much for me to say other than any consequences I thought of that might come from the absences are worth it. If you want to talk, I'm here. I'm so glad you're in my class. Would you like some almonds? Scratch that- are you allergic to nuts?"" I shook my head no, and she briefly got up, rustled through her bag, and put a handful of almonds on a napkin on the corner of my desk and handed me some tissues. ""Are you ready to move onto the breakdown of the critique or would you like a few more minutes?""    

I thanked her profusely, I told her the break was perfect, and I wiped the rest of my tears away with the tissues. Her empathy was astounding. I have had the most unreal, incredible professors who have gone above and beyond to ensure I am successful, and I can tell she is going to be another one. Again, I know these things about mental illnesses. I know they are just as serious as a physical illness you can see. But to hear someone else say that so confidently to a room of people... I don't know. I have been fumbling with words in my head all day to try and string a coherent sentence that expresses even a fraction of the gratitude I feel for her and her words, and I am incapable of that.    

I feel so silly for blabbering on and on about this, but it was one of those pivotal moments that makes the world seem like a little bit of a better place.    

TL;DR: I started my first day of spring semester as a junior today. I suffer from a cocktail of mental illnesses (MDD, ADHD, and anxiety) which have made college rather difficult at times. I have incredible grades, I have maintained a job through school, and I know I am doing great things, but convince myself otherwise a lot. It has greatly impacted my time in college after attempting to take my life, and subsequently going to a mental hospital and getting on meds. My professor openly told our class that mental illness is a real illness and they are just as severe as a physical illness. She encouraged us to use our absences if we need them for illnesses or a mental health day. It means the world for someone else to give power to those words. I am so grateful.",09Jan2020,1
45,"So this happened in middle school. I was in my history class and there was this boy on the right side of me. I have talked to him before for a bit and he seemed really nice! I still didn't know him very well though. There were 2 (I think, if I remember correctly) people on the left side of me. We had our own table and we would talk. While I was listening to the lesson and writing notes, the boy on my right starts to get a bit closer to me and start running his hand slowly towards my thigh. I was so confused and shocked, since this has never happened to me before. He starts to sneak his hand towards my inner thigh and starts to get even closer. When I moved my seat away from him, he would just scoot his seat towards me and try to get closer. At this point, I am freaking out. I try to let it known to the others around me that this dude is touching me and I guess they just didn't know what was going on. Honestly forgot what happened after that, but I do remember that he did stop after a bit.

47,"As the title says, while I’m quite young (late 20s), when I was younger I was emotionally abusive to my partner. It’s unforgivable and I understand that, I don’t expect forgiveness. It took me a lot of time, and serious hardship in life to get to the point of admitting it and reflecting on my disgusting behavior. In no means am I trying to downplay the scars I gave people close to me and the suffering that I caused them. My realization catapulted me into a world where despite having a comfortable life after overcoming hardships I was ridden with guilt and shame. I felt I was undeserving of this quality of life and sometimes feel like a wolf hiding in a sheep costume. 

I was condemned and shut out by everyone I knew when my ex told people about my behavior and rightly so. But now that I’ve moved to a different place and have started to do better in life I find myself sabotaging my own life out of guilt. My ex told me that “someone like me shouldn’t be successful in life” and that I should never live down the damage that I’ve caused. How do I move forward? I’ve been torturing myself for years without any sight of a path forward for myself. Is there no path forward for shitty people who sincerely want to improve?

The rest of you have had about four years to straighten out this shit with me. Now that you think there might be a way to benefit from all this we're supposed to be on good terms? No, not happening. Everyone got the emails and the phone calls. My story never changed. That's the price of treachery.

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be cautious about. My world view these days is very Russian. Whatever is going to happen, will happen. It will either strengthen or educate me. The last four years have given me more adventure, education, strength, and insight than the last ten years of my life.

What killed this open door policy was a combination of two beliefs. One was that I had reached out to you people and I did not. You order a pizza and then attack the pizza delivery person for disturbing your privacy? Hmm. Second is the belief of potential trouble and questioning my conduct. That killed this in a heartbeat. Once I learned that I set aside time to author this. 

You don't call the shots on these activities that I'm involved in and I certainly will not get your permission to do them. These people don't even like Tracy which is a huge warning sign. And no, they never informed me of what the issue was. All irrelevant now though (shrugs). 

I look forward to finding and becoming a part of a large Muslim community somewhere. I think Knoxville, Tennessee has one. It doesn't matter to me if you're Shia, Sunni, or anything else. God created us both and we require that love and mercy to even exist.

50,"Recently I’ve been having dreams of someone from middle school who I hated (I’m in high school now and haven’t seen him for almost 3 years).  Okay, I wouldn’t say I hated him but they were like my “rival.”  He was better at me in everything and they were super cocky about it: asking for what I got on a test, always competing with me, bragging about his grades, etc.  Regardless of all this, we were kinda friends? We had band together and sat at the same band table, he always said hi to me in the halls, we had a similar sense of humor, and so on.  We were kinda friends but very competitive.  Honestly if you mentioned his name I could feel an irritation building up and there wasn’t a day u went home complaining about how much I hated him.  After we graduated, I kind of felt sad because I wouldn’t have someone to compete with and hate with a rivalry.  
Anyways, lately I’ve been having dreams about him.  They’re romantic dreams but not sex dreams.  My first dream was a few months ago.  I’ve never had romantic dreams about anyone before but for some reason he was in it.  I dreamed we were in Paris together on a date.  Paris is my ideal place to go if I ever dated someone special.  We went through the French villages, sampled food, and had a great time overall.  It was my perfect date and we even had dinner on the Eiffel Tower (I know, cliche).  It was my first romantic dream and being with him felt really special to me and it was a warm feeling that stuck with my from the dream.  
Today, I took a nap after school and had a dream about him again.  He came over to my house and we hung out.  I don’t really remember he specifics but we were playing video games and goofing off.  Just hanging out as friends but I got the same feeling from the first dream.  I liked being in his presence and it gave me this feeling I don’t know how to describe.  I wanted to be with him more and genuinely wanted to hang out with him again.
I’m really confused as to what this means because I dislike the guy.  He’s high on the list of people I never want to see again from middle school but I don’t know why I keep having these dreams?
A couple months ago, I actually saw him for the first time in 3 years since graduation because we have a common friend who had a party and invited people from our middle school.  I was really nervous at first but what’s crazy was that he looked exactly like how I envisioned him in my dream (not like the his middle school self).  I kept wanting to talk to him for some reason but couldn’t bring myself too.  I also felt really competitive with him at the same time like middle school and this burning feeling built up? I have to admit i felt a little jealous that she was  able to keep a close enough relationship with him to invite him.
The past few months, I’ve had a chance of seeing him because we’re both in Speech and Debate (only he doesn’t know I’m in it).  I might see him on Saturday at a tournament and for some reason it makes my heart beat really fast that I can’t sleep and feel excited that I might see him (even though I’m sure I have this bitter feeling against him).  I have no idea what the hell my feelings are towards him and it’s driving me nuts.  I personally think it’s just me wishing I had my guy friends back from middle school because I didn’t keep in touch with them.  Do I hate you?? Do I like you??

64,"My first relationship was an absolute dumpster fire. Abusive and toxic as can be. But I was so desperate to be “loved” that I tolerated it for two years. My coping methods afterwards were far from healthy. I then ended up meeting someone who I thought was my savior and my soul mate. I relied on that relationship entirely for my happiness which in retrospect was not healthy. 




When that relationship ended I was so heartbroken- and I am still sad about it five years later despite going to therapy, learning to love being alone, and developing healthy coping mechanisms. 



My next relationship just came out of nowhere and seemed to instantly click. We moved in together after about two months (also in retrospect not a smart idea). We have now been together almost three years. From early on I wondered if I was in a verbally/emotionally abusive relationship. Something didn’t feel quit right, but I have my own issues so I wondered if it was just because something was wrong with me. 



He has positive qualities too, but i became so deeply hurt and resentful of him and I simultaneously felt trapped (we moved across the country a year ago and I was alone with no social support and terrified to move out and be on my own). I made the huge mistake of falling into an emotional affair which later progressed to a sexual one. I never would have thought I could cheat. Despite my bf’s flaws he is loyal like a dog, and thought the same of me. I ended up coming completely clean to him. The pain and shame I have caused him is unbearable to witness. I hate myself. 



He bought a house a couple months ago and we just got settled and now I have to move out and start over. I regret the cheating whole heartedly. I feel incapable of being loved, or loving someone else. I feel completely worthless and wonder why everyone around me seems to be getting married, starting families, and progressing forward with life when i just feel so fucked up and damaged. And now have to live with knowing I hurt someone so badly they may never be the same. I hope I finally learn whatever lessons life is trying to teach me in these heartaches.",09Jan2020,1

Im currently struggling with finding that source of inspiration and have built myself into a rut where I feel like I have to get this thing done but it is typically not enjoyable when I set out to do it.

Maybe ive chosen the wrong career path. The part most infuriating is that I cant determine if I'm simply exhausted or if am truly in the wrong place in life. My only friend is a strong proponent of being mega productive and its difficult to have these conversations with him, so instead I thought I'd ramble on Reddit instead.

67,"Breakfast is a funny thing, see I have a pig pan so making a small omelette is hard, the egg gets to thin and rips when you try to fold it over or flip it, so I add more eggs and always wind up with these huge omelets.

Two pieces of toast, maybe some hash browns if there's potatoes in the house ""Haven't made homemade hash-browns in a while, better make a lot, I'll use the leftover bacon fat to fry them up perfect"" Now A real problem comes up, I have this crazy big omelet with a pile of hash-browns, eggs and bacon, oh and lets not forget the toast, it's a requirement to have toast with runny yolk. This is where having friends and family around is great ""Hey I made to much food! Come eat some!"" Problem solved, and bonus; Now your having breakfast with good people, food's tasting great, everyone's chatting, wonderful time!

I haven’t seen my father since I was 12 when I ran away after he molested me. I have an intervention order. I don’t know what his wife knows of me and don’t expect her to be very receptive to me but a part of me really wants to reach out and ask to meet her and then maybe my little sisters if she is ok with it. 

How on earth would that even go down? Like, hey your husband molested me (despite what story he might have spun for you) so that’s why you’ve never met me and I know you met my brothers (have they ever mentioned me?)  and you legally can’t actually tell your husband information about me (but I understand it’s a co-parenting decision if your daughters can meet me) but can I meet my sisters? 

A part of me then goes fuck that is a horrible idea to open up any slither of contact/communication with that slime ball of a man.

86,"Kind of a long post, so I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom for those who'd like that.

For a bit of background, I work at a library, where I was a student assistant for a long time, and now I work in the full-time capacity. This March will mark a year that I've been doing that. There are definitely parts of my job that I like and parts that I dislike, but it's the parts that I like that I am using as an opportunity for skill development. I am a writer by trade, but I've always had an interest in what basically amounts to graphic design, and luckily, one of my main duties requires design (book displays). 

Earlier this year, we lost our communications person, so a lot of the responsibilities she had fell to my current department to do--social media stuff mostly, but also the production of ""marketing"" materials. Of the people in the department, I did/was asked to do a lot of those types of things because of my interest in designing. Plus, I had already made some physical, informational things that people higher than me were happy to see being made (bookmarks, signs, things of that nature). I did a little of the social media stuff, but that duty was mostly passed to the co-worker in question, who I'll talk about shortly.

The communications spot has been vacant for months, and in fact, wasn't posted to the university-wide ""job board"" for reasons unknown to me. Red tape rules or something was my understanding. I'd been thinking a lot about applying when it eventually was posted, though I knew it might be a long shot. The description preferred people with a masters in communications/business marketing background, among other preferred qualifications. I'll say that the people here are pretty flexible in that regard and willing to let people learn on the job, so I thought I'd have a good shot anyway.

Basically, today I got called into a brief meeting with my boss that the ""good news"" was that my co-worker would be taking over the Communications job. To be fair, she has some things over me: a masters degree (not in their preferred list, but a masters nonetheless), and she's been working in the full time capacity for about as long as I was a student. But to be honest, I just don't share the ""excitedness"" that my boss has. I'm actually pretty annoyed. My boss said ""I've told everyone else \[in the department\] so I figured I should let you know,"" meaning I was the last to know. Funnily, at a different meeting yesterday, my co-worker's ""portfolio"" was on the main screen, and it was awkward to see one of our directors closing it without a word. I feel like I was intentionally kept in the dark until this was all said and done. I legitimately believed they'd post it on the employment site, and I've been in my current FT position for less than a year, so that's why I hadn't brought it up to anyone yet. But my boss has seen the stuff I've been making, and I've been explicit in taking on these jobs and telling her I enjoy doing this design/marketing/info organization stuff.

And now, the responsibilities my co-worker will fall to me and the other person in our position (three of us under my boss, but now two with this development), and we have to do a frantic search for a new person. I'm just feeling really shortchanged and this makes me want to just find a different job altogether so I can move on (after being here for so long anyway).

Maybe I'm wrong in my feelings? I'd love to know your thoughts.

tl;dr A job was empty for awhile at my current employer. Co-worker gets the job under the rug, and I'm the last to know. Sucks because it's a job I would have applied for as soon as it was posted (which it wasn't). Boss and others are excited, but I'm feeling negative about it.",09Jan2020,1
87,"When I was 19 my mom told me she won 10k in lottery. And she wanted to buy me either a car or a motorcycle. I already had bought and old 83 GMC Sierra for 800 bucks. So I told her I'd love a motorcycle.
My mother wanting me to be happy, bought me a 250cc curser. At the dealership they told me it was a brand new bike. And for the next few days to inspect that everything was working fine because they assembled it at the dealership and mistakes could happen. 
I road my motorcycle for 2 days. I was as happy as I could be. On the 2end day the clutch fell off. And my bike was stuck on 3rd gear.
I told my mother, so the following day we planned to take it back to the dealership to get fixed. Somehow I convinced my mother it would be safe for me to drive it to the dealership (15 miles away)
Everything went fine, I had just gotten off the expressway.
I was heading towards the stoplight.
I saw the light turn green
I never slowed down.
Then suddenly on the intersection I turned my head to the left.
I saw a car had ran the red light.
At that moment time stopped.
I thought to myself, ""oh fuck""
Then I T-Boned the car. 
I flew 50ft into the air.
As I was flying I thought to myself, ""shit IM NOT WEARING A HELMET!"" So I placed my arms over my head.
As I landed I rolled. When I stopped, I thought about my motorcycle. Then I tried to stand up.
That's when I felt the worst pain on my life.
I screamed, ""MY LEGS! AHHHHH""
I had hyperextended both my knees and has severe road rash.

I was lucky traffic stopped for me. The car that ran the red light stopped as well. When people approached me, I was so very happy. I havent felt that happy in all of my life. I immediately felt happy to survive. Yes my 3 day old bike is totaled, but I was alive. 

I began to look for my phone and the public kept telling me not to worry about my phone, but I didnt care what they had to say. In my mind I had to tell my mom who was following me to the dealership what had happens. 

My phone was broken but still functioned. I called and told her, ""Hey dont think I'm joking, but I got in a bad accident and I cant walk. I'm in the intersection of ___ and ___. There is a gas station on the other side if you get off on ___ you're able to walk over"" 

My mom didnt question it. She did as I had said. By the time she had ran to me. The paramedics had arrived. I was still in the state of euphoria. I was joking around with everyone. So much so, that my mom thought they had given me drugs for pain.

They hadnt and they never did. I asked both the paramedics and the hospital. And they told me because I asked for pain meds it was against their protocol to give them to me. 

Keep in mind yes I'm happy. Yes I'm not screaming in pain. But yes hyperextended knees and road burn to the point of seeing my bone. Does hurt very much. 

I stayed in the hospital for a month. I was never given meds. On one of the days, I begged the nurse for a pen and paper to distract my self from the pain. 

So I drew for a month. 
My mom slept in my room for the whole month.",09Jan2020,1
88,"Tw. Abuse, self harm and that’s it 


Growing up, my family wasn’t the greatest. My mother was 16 and house bouncing and my dad left to Chicago. When I was 6 my mother asked my father if during winter break he could take me in until she finds stable housing and delivered my brother who was supposed to die but didn’t. 
My mother claims that I was stolen from her, because my father a day before Christmas filed a protection order against her for abuse charges. She claims that since Chicago over powered my Texas residency my mother couldn’t go get me because it would be considered kidnapping. Growing up in Chicago with my father wasn’t the greatest. All he cared about was alcohol and weed. He has me stay at my aunts house while we worked until I was about 8, but they hated my guts. My dad got his own apartment but I had to stay there during the week because no one could watch me. They’d hit me, call me fat and more things. They intentionally made me an ugly child by making me fat and cutting my hair short. I was just a little girl. They said my mother was a whore and disgusting and then told me I was the product of her and I’m the same as her. 

I got suicidal and self harmed a lot growing up. I don’t know how I even lived through some of the self harm. My dad saw me as a depressed child but never really cared much, he only saw it as being “rebellious.” 

I was about 11-12 when I was able to watch and take care of myself in my dads one bedroom apartment. My father never spoke to me and I was really never allowed to go anywhere if it wasn’t with him or to the McDonald’s across the street. Our relationship was really sad, I eventually just became angry and unstable. Me and my father would tell each other things such as (ME: you’re a shit father, when your child is dead I hope you are fucking happy, I can’t wait until I get the guts to kill myself) and my fathers amazing response of (do it already then, stop being dramatic if you felt that way you wouldn’t be talking shit) I had to hold my dad while he was having a panic attack while I was bleeding out of my self inflicted wounds, I never was able to be a child. I never was allowed to be around stable people. 

It was that for a few years until I met my boyfriend, I’ll call him Xavier. Xavier messaged my mother who completely catfished me.

My mother was playing saint and savior, talking to me through text as I was going through these things with my father. She was my best friend, never showed me any of the sides I see now.
My boyfriend messaged her and told her that “the abuse thats going on in the house is not okay and I really want you to get her out” and that really motivated her to do so.

Now living with my mother, holy fucking shit I learned how to deal and cope with the shit in Chicago with my father 

This is just ridiculous 


She only is nice when she needs something from me. She acts like she owns me but hates the fact my father raised me and I’m not the girly little princess cheerleader she’s always wanted. She told me when I was 13 “I can’t wait to have a daughter I can raise” like she couldn’t raise me like I’m any different.

My brother gets better treatment, not only does she like the father of my brother more, she talks about him saving her life or whatever.
My mother is a compulsive liar, she words things in front of people and to people that make her seem right when it’s literally the most biased untrue shit I’ve ever heard. She belittles me and everything I do. She wants to get rid of my boyfriend who I’ve been dating for 1 year and 4 months when I don’t do what she says. She threatens to not buy food for my lizard anymore, she threatens to break my shit. I’m 18 in 48 days, and she expects me to stay in the house with her? 
My father paid for everything I own that’s not a bed and dresser. I like video games and such and she wouldn’t dare to buy me “toys”
She tells other people that she doesn’t want me to work because I need to focus on my last semester of high school, but then in an argument “you don’t do anything but play video games and be with your boyfriend.” And when I try to get a job she fights me and argues me why I can’t have it.
I can’t take a city bus either, SHES completely ridiculous.
Like I know this shit isn’t the worst but I raised myself my whole life I feel and why do I have to keep taking it? 

Me and my boyfriend are long distance and he lives in South Carolina and I do Texas. His family really loves me and considers me apart of the family. They call me daughter and shit like that. I really want to live with eli and his grandma but I have to go after high school. That’s not a problem, my problem is that my mother wants me to stay there with her because she wants to raise me or whatever but my time to be raised was when I was a child. I’ve been conspiring on how to live there without my mom hunting me down or whatever. I don’t know why I’m afraid to finish high school and just leave. I feel like I’m not allowed to and I’ll be in trouble or something for doing what I want to do for my own fucking mental sanity for once.

I don’t want to sound Like a cry baby, my problems don’t seem like the worst..but I just feel really scared of my mom and to leave and be my own person because of what might happen? But I don’t know what that is, I know it’s not good to focus on the unknown but sometimes not thinking about it makes me feel overwhelmed. 

There’s just so much shit she does, I don’t know how to say everything.",09Jan2020,1

90,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I really wanted to vent. 

Ever since I was younger, like dating and meeting friends in high school, I realized I romanticized things and attached easy. It caused a lot of toxic relationships. 

When I finally made it on my own in the world and moved away from home, I realized that many factors in my life, including abuse from my mother when I was a child (she is NPD and BPD), have caused me to develop an anxious attachment style — in every type of relationship in my life, including friendships, family and casual things. 

When I first meet someone, I’m chill. They tell me how respectful, genuine and relaxed I am, and they like me because I respect their boundaries... until I don’t and sabotage. 

Most of the time, I push away and ghost, but other times, I become this ridiculous person, insecure and emotional, over the tiniest emotional spark. If I have a NSA hook up with someone, I’m someone else, this calm, collected, cool, mysterious, fascinating person. But then the moment we find we have a lot in common or we vibe well, I start to feel vulnerable and it makes me act like a lunatic. 

It’s really embarrassing and it’s not me. Over years of therapy and medication, thankfully I’ve overcome a lot of self esteem issues, depression and PTSD, but I’ve noticed there are some remnants of anxiety and insecurities I am having trouble overcoming. 

Many of my past boyfriends have cheated on me or abused me, and many friends have come and gone without any explanation, and I feel this has torn me apart emotionally. I don’t want to be insecure. 

I mean, my life is insane. I work, I have several hobbies, I have things keeping me busy, and yet I fall into this awful behavior that makes me look bored, desperate and needy. 

I need to kick this crap to the curb, because I’ve met some really awesome people lately on friendship and potential relationship levels, but I can’t seem to “go with the flow” or “take it slow,” and I give off this vibe in the beginning that I’m pretty cool with all of that, and then turn into this over dramatic person. Texting too much, calling too much, overthinking every interaction. Wondering if they even like me. 

It’s so unattractive and embarrassing. 

I have to talk myself through everything, telling myself to chill, that they’re human and this isn’t even a huge deal, and I’m going to ruin it if I don’t shut up and go with the flow like I should. 

I hate to be a walking red flag. I hate knowing at any moment I’ll sabotage something good (before it even begins at times) because of this. 

Can someone help me understand this? I have been in therapy for four years and on medication for two. I guess I just have to keep working at it....",09Jan2020,1

I’ve never been one to focus on my social life . Growing up I was never very good at making friends and being part of the social system so I occupied myself with my academics and other professional development type  things . I was always good at those and they gave me my sense of self worth and meaning. I’ve essentially kept up this policy until today, I’m about to graduate college . I have a pretty difficult major and my standards for myself are very high so it’s not hard to let that part of my life consume all of my time . So long as I’m focusing on my work I feel somewhat at peace, but it’s a fragile peace because the moment my mind drifts to those parts of my life that I don’t focus on, relationships, friendships, etc etc, my mind floods with stress and anxiety, feelings of self loathing, the idea that I’ve never been good enough and never will be good enough  completely dominates my thinking and any self worth I might have from how good at school I am goes out the window, I’m nothing, garbage . I enter a very bad and very distressed emotional state. I essentially avoid this by shunning this part of my mind, focusing on what I’m good at and what I can control. I don’t see any way of ever getting out of this system. I don’t wanna be in that state ever, it’s really awful. And I know that ever making an active effort to date or even to expand my social circle past the couple of friends I have would get that dark part of my mind going. But that future in itself, never having a partner or real social life, living and dying alone, never having a full normal life is pretty dark in itself . But I just can’t see a way out of it.

100,"Whenever I feel insecure or bitter, I talk it out with my close friend(s) and through vulnerability and being honest with myself, I usually come to understanding and acceptance. I realise it's okay to feel the way I feel, I accept the insecurity for what it is, and usually move forward feeling positive.

This is a problem.

For a long time I didn't understand why humans would feel bitter or insecure - what's the point in a reflex that makes us feel shit about ourselves? Now I get it completely. I'm so fucking productive when I feel negative. I conjure a rage-based impenetrable drive to prove people wrong or show what I'm made of. I wanna reinvent my entire life and win a war. And as soon as I achieve self-acceptance or I'm supported through love and understanding, that goes. Then I just wanna have a cuddle.

The title of this post is a little hyperbolic - I don't really wanna feel insecure or bitter. But I do want to be motivated to do things, and regardless of how much self-help bullshit I read, I know deep down that I won't ever be as motivated as if I'm bitter.

102,"I’ve made so many bad decisions during my life as a child and adult. Age 11 chipped my teeth while being reckless on rollerblades which caused me to chip my teeth (this caused me to have an inferiority complex because my few peers viewed me as the guy with the ugly teeth). Early 20s, dropped out of several schools to try and not ignore my friends that weren’t worth it. Mid - late  20s, tried to try and get that visceral feeling of effects on by spending money on strippers and escorts. Early 30s I keep trying to become rich through the lottery even though I understand that it’s statistically impossible (what else are you supposed to do when you don’t have a girlfriend, friends or and prospects for the above?). 

So here I am sitting at a Hooters with a decent buzz during the middle of a week day.  I put in a vacation day from work. Not for any important purpose just because I don’t want to be cursed at by strangers at work and also don’t want my parent seeing me around the house on a workday thinking that I’m depressed and suicidal again. 

So I’ve kinda locked myself into 2 decisions for today, first is to drive 2 miles while buzzed to see a movie theater, watch a flick, sober up and then drop $100 on lottery tickets that’ll most likely come up empty. Second options is drive to drove 1 hour away to the next biggest city because somehow being away from home makes me feels like I’m more likely to win. 

Either way I’m wasting money on lottery tickets that I almost certainly will not will not become rich from. The real decision is if I’m rolling the dice after driving 2 miles after becoming mostly sober or driving 70 hours away while buzzed and then wasting my money.",09Jan2020,1

Kids at my middle school bully me for being Jewish, my mom is neglectful and selfish, despite my intelligence, I feel stupid all the time for no reason, and because of the Conservatism in the area I live in, I can't express who I truly am.

To go into more detail, my mom is selfish and always trivializes my problems with immature, crude, and malicious remarks. She refuses to get me and my brothers vaccinated, which rightfully infuriates my father, and she refuses to think about how her actions affect me.

While I'm very intelligent, exhibiting an above-average vocabulary, interest in philosophy, political science, and physics, and have a good logic and problem-solving skills, I feel stupid all the time, and I mean all the time. It happens when I make tiny mistakes or even simply get an answer wrong in class, which I rarely do. And kids relentlessly call me stupid but then will praise my intelligence when they want answers to tests from me.

And for the final one, me being unable to express who I really am, let me explain: Yes, I'm a male, but I don't want to live a traditionally masculine lifestyle. I want to be a cutesy and effeminate sissy and to wear leggings, female jeans, skirts, dresses, suspender jumpsuits, denim shorts, thigh-high stockings, and all of those adorable clothes, but the Conservative zeitgeist of my hometown won't let me.

105,"I started college in another country, which does not speak either my mother-language nor English, and so I have to learn its language. Seeing its simple rules in grammer, vocabs, etc and how many exceptions in words and stuff, I got or at least I feel I now I have a good eye judge on wither a language is professional and hard, or easy but not as sophisticated as other languages. Of course with less professional I dont mean its worse and it musnt be learned. Im not even mentioning what langauge Im studyig right now (I’ll allow you to guess in private messages if you want). Im just telling a slice from my life about what I think.  
  
You may say what you think, advice me, make fun of me, or do whatever you want. Im just posting to discuss or break the silence and monotony.",09Jan2020,1
106,"Like how I think that if you're being abused at a job, you should quit, even if people won't believe you about the abuse. At least you won't be getting abused anymore. Seriously, this is how it goes down;

&gt;Me: If he/she was being abused, why not speak up?

&gt;Others: Because no one would believe him/her.

&gt;Me: Why not quit anyway?

&gt;Others: He/she needed a job to feed themselves. Don't shame them for surviving.

&gt;Me: ??? 

It's stupid. Basically people say that their career is more important than their well-being.",09Jan2020,1

108,"So basically i got no ""real"" interests.
Only thing i do everyday is checking my phone (Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, YouTube) , either watching videos or memes , play games on my pc or watch videos on my pc . I also wank about 2 times a day ( sometimes im not even horny , just bored ) . I might go out once im the weekend but thats only of i have money to go out. I come from a average ( to money ) family in Greece ( not the most rich country either ) so i also might not even go out. I dont have any sport's or anything either. I think im kinda depressed because of all that and i low key dont mind dying ( not suiciding tho ) . Someone told be that basically im just bored of my life and should try to find some interests and hobbies, but that won't work for various reasons ( some mentioned ) . Im not asking for solutions but i could use ur guys opinion's or just ur point of view or if it's any relatable to you",09Jan2020,1

111,"I’ve always had strange dreams since I was a little kid and sometimes they would kind of predict the future. Small things basically. I never paid it any attention. But a few months ago I had two dreams of a person I barely knew in really life. We are from the same town and I knew them through mutual friends even though I had never actually officially met them. The weird part is that I had never felt any attraction towards them nor was I ever thinking about them. So, the dreams were two months apart from each other and in one of them I saw that I was kissing that person. Of course I woke up and I was like ‘wtf’. I forgot about it a few hours later. Three months after that last dream the person reached out to me out of the blue and we went on a few dates. I started feeling extremely attracted to them and we ended up hooking up. I was just wondering, has this ever happened to anyone? It feels bizarre. Does it mean anything? Or is my mind just playing tricks?",09Jan2020,1
112,Videos I saw don't help.  Text I read doesn't help.  Is murdering a pop-up blind a crime?  At this point they are twisted and refuse to lay flat.  Help?,09Jan2020,1

116,"I'm Puerto Rican and my neighborhood in PR isn't getting government disaster relief so I want to raise money for them. The people are sleeping outside(this is really dangerous. We have poisonous centipedes.) and they don't have electricity or running water. They have to poop outside and it's getting dangerous. People are scared of an epidemic. The river that's nearby(1 mile?) is dry because it hasn't been raining so they can't collect any. 


I live in Pennsylvania if that's important.",09Jan2020,1
117,"I'm really lonely and I kind of want to date but holy shit I'm scared. i can't fucking do it, I'm so scared of getting rejected and/or humiliated. I get eyes looks from guys already because my eyes look so fucked up. Sure I have a nice personality but physical attraction (and eye contact) is so damn important to people (you're lying if you think otherwise).

I feel so damned stuck and feel like I look like a freak. ! I can't fix this and I'm so sad. In don't want to talk to anyone IRL about this because there just going to tell me some bullshit to try and make me feel better (it won't!)",09Jan2020,1
