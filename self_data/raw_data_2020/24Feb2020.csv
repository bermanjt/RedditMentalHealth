0,"Title basically says it all!

I’ve deleted Tik Tom, Instagram, and Facebook. I’ve been doing this slowly over the last couple of months. 

I’m really proud and happy with this decision because I’ve noticed that I didn’t like who I was while actively using these apps. I got tired of having to always post super beautiful/filtered selfies to gain likes or followers, I didn’t like having to “spice” the reality of my life up to receive any notice, and frankly, I didn’t enjoy watching others push themselves sssssooooo damn hard to get noticed. 

I appreciate Reddit for its simplicity, for its anonymity, for its basic ability to provide connection with out strings attached. 

I’m ready for this next chapter and look forward to get real in the real world!",24Feb2020,1
1,"Honestly, I don't know why I'm this way, but I just enjoy it. I know it's stupid, pathetic, and gross...but I can't help it. For the record I may have autism, but as for as I know it's aspergers/higher-functioning autism...why do I enjoy doing this thing that low-functioning people do?",24Feb2020,1

4,"I had a fight with a sibling months ago and I decided I should apologize. It's been a while since we talked so honestly I'm terrified.

I know what I want to say and I've been trying for weeks but I can't.

Since they live in another country I have to text them, and every time I try to my anxiety takes over, I want to cry, throw up and it's hard to breathe, I have to distract myself to calm down.

I need to do it today, yes or yes, no reason in particular, I just need to stop procrastinating.

I need some advice or support please, I'm freaking out.",24Feb2020,1
5,"Man, being alone all the time scares me. I hate myself, cant connect to others, too uncomfortable, too not open, and theres almost no opportunities to make friends. Life feels pointless and im always alone. I really would love to have friends i feel comfortable around and like eachother and hang out and do things together. Im so sick of losing my mind at night alone and being scared all the time.",24Feb2020,1
6,I really hate cooking. i think it’s time consuming and I hate that you have to put so much effort into it just to have it ate up in 15 minutes or so. Have you found a way to make it suck less? I’d like to at least try to enjoy it but haven’t found a way yet :// everyone needs to know how to cook a few meals and I’m on the struggle bus in that department too,24Feb2020,1
7,"I’m a 20 years old guy who always had feelings for males since childhood. Before you call me gay, you need to know that I have some feminine characteristics in my behavior but not physically (unfortunately). I keep acting manly to everyone considering I have religious parents and a conservative, closed-minded society surrounding me.
I went to a therapist who stated i had no signs of being trans even though i have temporary dysphoria moments sometimes.
I am honestly very lost, am i trans, gay, non-binary, etc...?
Btw, i do not have any romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex, and yes i did try and the results were negative.",24Feb2020,1

9,"Basically I would like to join something like AA meetings, except I'm not an alcoholic. I just wish I was part of something where people take turns sharing emotional struggles and stories, and everyone else just listens, doesn't give advice or really respond even with anything but just ""thanks for sharing"". Because Im going through a lot honestly, and I wanna share what I'm going through with people. And also, I wanna hear what others are going through, or what they've been through.

10,"I’m sitting here at 2am in bed crying because I love my dad so much. He’s not perfect but he’s always there for me, me doesn’t so much for me and has given so much up just to make sure I’m happy. I’m living alone o the first time since 7 months ago and have seen them like once a mom month and it’s not enough time gonna go csee him next week after my lectures god I love my parents so much. I’ve have had loads of mental breakdowns but this is the firstf happy one because I was listening to that one James blunt song about his dad and I just got so emotional I’ve been crying for 20 minutes and everyone I knoww is asleep and my gf is at work tomorrow so I can’t talkd to here but fuck I’m so happy right not I don’t think I’d can sleep tonight I’m so motivated fuck I didn’t know what to do or where to go so I’m typing this here sorry if there’s any mistakes in crying over my iPad and the keyboard. 

Fuck I’m so happy we need to do more good in this world because everyone deserves a smile and I’ve tried so hard to get over my anxiety since moving out and it’s terrifying but I feel so happy like just make people feel welcome and help people because you don’t know what could have caused then to act bad,y or feel bad th world is so awful but people aren’t fuck",24Feb2020,1
12,"I am the kind of person that has these crazy dreams and they change with my mindset but I always return to one dream I have always had, acting. I love it, even though I have not much experience, I love the idea of being this person that may not be anything like you. What's really fascinating is that you become like detached from yourself and become this whole other person with thoughts that are not your own because you ARE this person. It's the idea that you're attached to this character and it's apart of you but it's not you, it's a whole other perspective you're gaining. Though I love acting I am scared shitless. I am scared to put myself out there and I don't want to be the one person that tried and failed. I have major confidence issues too that I have to work on also. But then I have this part of me that tells me to try because this is something I want, something that will make me happy with life. The part of me that wants to act is the one that is getting me to a place where I can finish school and it puts me in that mindset. Well I think I am going to try. And like actually try, without skipping any corners and not being afraid to talk about it. I want to feel comfortable talking about and I want people who often think that these kinds of dreams are unrealistic to know that I am scared shitless, but I am more scared of not knowing, and not taking a chance to be the happiest I can be in life. I deserve to try. I want to build off of my anxiety, and that's it. That's all I wanted to say. This is my penny in a well moment, it's my promise to myself, and it's a step towards my declaration of my pursuit of happiness.

Ps this may not make any sense to y'all but that'sok because it makes sense to me :)",24Feb2020,1
13,"Its long, read If u are insterested, im on mobile and english isnt my first language, Hello, i'm 15 years old, male, introvert, I think im tall (1.8 meters), im skinny, im virgin and will probably stay virgin for a long time, I dont socialize well, im an atheist, I may be spoiled, I may be edgy. I dont like my body. Im the smartest person in my class, only losing in chemistry and portuguese to a girl, but only in that. I am a bad person for many reasons, but today's talk is, Sincerely, im indifferent to people, I live with my mom and brother, I think that with effort I can go to high places in life, but im probably not going to invest effort,  my mom and dad divorced, but are still friends, my dad wants me and my brother to take a plane every year to visit him, and he visit us sometimes, I try to be in good terms with him so I can receive money and gifts and stuff on my birthday, Christmas etc, my brother visits him every chance, but me, fuck that place. Its the bottom of the world, Its Full of cockroaches, which im scared of, internet sucks and I cant bring my computer, yea, these are the main reasons why I dont visit my dad, when he asks why, I soften the words a little and say Its because I dont like the place, he says that I should visit him because of love, feelings etc and Someday he may not be there anymore (die) but I dont Care at all. He also says that im ignorant for being atheist, i had to reveal that to him through some weird masonry talk. My mom is a smoker, and I made her promise to stop because I hate that shit and It affects me, second hand smoking, not because I Care about her health, but I pretend its because I Care about her for better results, but she didnt stopped. I use the promise sometimes to make an emotional appeal so I can get what I want .I also try to be in good terms with her because I like living here, i have a good internet, good computer and I dont want that away from me. Also she buys me stuff. Do stuff for me while I have a good son smile and etc. I pretend to be a good son, When I get to be independent, im going to try to leave as soon as possible and stop contact with them, i hate socializate with all my family. My brother is a fucking failed person, studied all year and couldnt enter a good university, now mom has to pay a private one. I forcedly sucked his dick when I was a kid because of my innocency, he looks like a good son but I could reveal many things, some of his bad lies and etc, but If It was my word against his, I dont think people would believe me. We fight a lot, things get physical, one day I threw a knife at him but missed, My mom is the average fat old ugly boomer, she also talks a lot, its fucking tiring, shes racist and xenophobic, throw trash in the street etc. Both of my parents hit me in order to discipline, and believe in unconditional love for the family. I also made my mom cry and hit me because I Said really bad stuff, leaving home when 18 and etc and I Said Sorry for her and tried to redeem myself but Just because I want to keep my benefits, to get out of punishment and go to my computer again. I think that all takes to the main context, which happened minutes ago, I gave my mom money and asked her to buy a game for me, im waiting in my Room, she takes a while but come to my Room with the credit Card, she smells like shit, I can diferentiate when she smokes or not, her bathroom is 100% cancer, for years I have Said to her to stop smoking and If she did, dont come to my Room the smell is unbearable and I dont want cancer, i asked her to leave, she says she didnt smoked, I Said she clearly did and asked again for her to leave, she blew my face and my eyes burned, I felt the putrid smell of cigarrete and got really fucking angry, I asked her to stop and she did It again, we repeated that again 3 to 4 times then I couldnt Control myself out of anger, I got up, punched her in the shoulder (really, thats apparently where I most fucked up, but we all hit each other all the time, im not using that as an excuse or justification, Just explaining my reaction, and im not fucking Sorry for nothing, actually I think she deserves, after all, by their logic, im deciplining her. Im going to be fake Sorry shortly.) And pushed her away from my Room and closed the door, she came again angrily, slaped my face 2 times and Said some bullshit I dont remember. I keep scrolling my computer waiting her to come back, im used to these little fights, she came crying a lot, slaped me again and Said If I raise my hand against her one more time, shes going to expel me from home to live with my dad(maybe thats better than interacting with them) etc and other things I dont remember. Knowing her, she didnt mean it and is Just threatening me so I stop sometimes being like that, she goes away, My brother talks to her, he goes to my Room screaming in an angrily tone  ""do you have shit in your head?"" And repeated 4 times, each time slapping my chin, then smashing my keyboard and closing the door, then he came again screaming ""I Will break you"", repeatibg again louder. I couldnt fight back, im weaker than him and hes 18, things would only get worse. My mom came again, grounded me, I turned off the computer and here i am, going to sleep soon. Well, shortly, things Will get ""normal"" again, im going back to my computer that is my refuge, im going to fake It all again. Im Just wondering where my life is heading to, its tiring living in this hell I helped create.",24Feb2020,1
14,"So classmate I have never talked to started up a conversation at a coffee shop, while he was behind me in line. Then I go to pay and he pulls his card out and shoves it at the cashier. I’m standing there shocked cuz I don’t know him all at. Who buys random classmates a drink?

15,"At the end of last year I felt like I didn’t have a hobby of my own. I felt like I went to and from work, cooked, cleaned, watched a show and slept. My New Years resolutions was to try one new hobby a month and find something I can do. January I did my first embroidery piece and February I completed a calligraphy workbook. It feels so good to set aside time and try to find something I enjoy doing. My rules for myself are that it has to be under $20 and I have to finish it.

19,"Life is a real fuckin’ dollar coaster right now. I moved to Canada from the USA this year to do my masters in social work (aiming to become a psychotherapist) and up until November or so, things were going great.

I love the country, the people, and program but I’m so homesick. In the last week, I’ve found out my dad’s skin cancer came back and got dumped by my girlfriend. I just want to go home and hug my dad, but I’m 600miles away taking six classes and doing a very demanding hospital practicum.


I know it’s part of the program, but working a demanding job where I’m seeing people lose a family member, receive a terminal diagnosis, or perform counseling.... it’s just so much to take on emotionally.

My roommate moved out, so now I have to find a roommate ASAP so I don’t go broke while making nothing. 

So yeah, I’m burned out. As a student social worker we’re always told to focus on self care. So you know what? I did. I got a manicure, got my haircut, mediated and went out with friends for drinks.... and yeah know what? I still feel like shit.

Self care might ground you in the moment, but when your life is crumbling there’s only so much meditation and a haircut can do.


Luckily, all my friends are therapists and social workers. I’m going to get the help I need. 

I just want to go back to my happy-go-lucky self:/r/ but who has the time?",24Feb2020,1
20,"I apologize in advance if this is hard to understand. I struggle with really bad depression and suicidal thoughts. I was raped 10 months ago and have since become an alcoholic to cope. I do go to therapy and have friends I can talk to but I cant say its been easy.

All this is coming up because Friday I drank a lot with my friends. I mean a l A LOT. So much my friend called an ambulance and I was transported to the hospital where I got an IV, my stomach pumped... all that. And I dont remember any of it. 

The next day (Saturday) after getting discharged and going to a friends, I told my parents that I was raped 10 months ago. I told them how I've been drinking to try to cope with it. The secret I had been hiding from them was out. Thing is- I didnt tell them because I was scared I had ended up in the hospital and woke up all alone. That actually really doesnt phase me at all if I'm honest, which yes, I recognize should be a concerning thought. But I told them because I knew the hospital bill would be sent to them at my home address (I'm out of state in grad school) and they would see I went to the hospital. I needed to give them some explaination and with my friends support, I gave them the truth.

My parents were more loving and supportive than I thought they would be. But one thing my dad said has me racking my brain. He said I need to learn how to recover for myself and not anyone else. That I can't be recovering for them, for a friend, a significant other, my future employer... because all those people will eventually leave me and then who do I have? Who am I recovering for? I need to recover for myself because I am the only one I will always be with my entire life. And I get where they're coming from, I understand what they're telling me. But I don't follow along by it. If I lived only for myself, well I wouldve committed suicide by now.

I live for others. The thought that I would hurt people who care about me if I harm myself- the thought that other people would be sad that I've harmed myself and potentially see it has their fault, that they didnt do enough to help me and that they couldve done more- thats the only thing that has kept me alive these past 10 months.

I dont live for myself and my future. I dont live looking forward to the fact that in 2 months I graduate with my masters degree. I live so my parents can be proud of their daughter and happy for her, and with her, because she did it. I dont live looking forward to starting my full time job in 3 months. I live so my future manager doesnt get the news their old intern passed away and has to then break it to everyone else in the office. I dont live looking forward to friends of mine getting married in September. I live so she has one more friend standing beside her at the alter and so they both can be happy on the big day. I dont want her to be sad because I'm not there and regretting that she didnt do enough to help me. 

I dont know if this idea of living for other people and not for myself makes sense. Its hard to explain but maybe a few of you will understand. I just dont see anything as being worth living for anymore. Everything I do is for other people's happiness and benefit, not my own.

I'll be going to my therapist with this tomorrow. I just thought I'd also come on here and say all this in case I can get some additional support/advice. Thanks to everyone for reading this and your responses in advance ❤ much love to you all",24Feb2020,1

I grew up having literally no one to turn to when shit got bad and trust me, shit was always bad. For Christmas I grew up wishing to have one good day where I wasn’t thinking about death. Every day was spent wishing and hoping the next would be better even though it never was but I knew it wouldn’t be better.. I just hoped if I kept using that logic to survive eventually thing would get better idfk. 

The thing is, even tho I was legitimately alone growing up I never actually felt lonely because I didn’t have time to even think about it. I told myself, “the day I feel lonely is the day I don’t have anything bad going on in my life”

25,"Sorry in advance if this isn't the right place for this, I just really wanted to say this.


   Bella was without a doubt, one of the best things in my life. She was a golden doodle of 8 months. We had her since she was two. Whenever I come home, before I even walk through the door I, can hear her chain rattling and collar jingling. She knew I was coming home before my mom or dad did. It was like a tell tale sign. No matter how quietly I opened the door, she would still hear me, and she would shake her body, do a stretch, then start waiting patiently. When I finally did walk through the door, she would jump on me like she hadn't seen me in a million years. Despite secretly loving when she did that, I could never show her that I appreciated the affection lest she do it to a stranger who is not as appreciative. That's just the kind of dog she was, she would love to give kisses to anyone who would have her. If she saw a stranger on the street she would run towards them (forgetting she was on the leash) to say hi. 

I had quite a few nicknames for her : pubbie, pubbuh, baby, kid, baby-girl, etc. and she would always respond to any of them. Whenever I would call her I would also shake my belly doing a weird motion towards her, as she would open her mouth, stick out her tounge and try to give me a kiss. It was the most adorable and pure expression of love from an animal to a human as possible. Seeing her tail wagging and her mouth ajar in a position that made it seem like she was smiling was the highlight of my day. The feeling was honestly incomparable to any sort of gratification brought about by money or material possessions. It was a feeling safisfying on the most bssic level.

I forgot to mention, whenever I went to the bathroom, my baby girl would follow. She would watch me unzip my pants and start the stream (the little pervert) and sit down and wait until I was done. When I finally finished she would jump on me, wet hands and all, wanting a rub. She would then come back to my room where she would bust open the door and jump onto my bed, waiting for me to join her.

 My pubbuh was not mean spirited either. She didnt have a single mean bone in her body. She NEVER exhibited biting, growling, or any aggressive behavior. Thinking about the times that I lost my patience with her is causing me to break down. Although it was nothing too bad objectively speaking, just yelling and a light swat on the nose, I 
wish I could take it all back. 

Today my pubbie's heart stopped on the operating table. That means I will never see her smile again. I wont hear her chain rattling as I am coming home, I won't feel her soft fat belly on mine, I wont see her staring at me lovingly, or have the privildge of taking her out for a stroll. When people ask me if I have pets, I will have to say no.

Walking into my house (its not a home anymore) today and hearing the silence made me lose my composure. I want nothing more than to hold her and whisper into her big old grandma ears how much I love her and that I would do anything for her. But I can't. Instead from now on when I walk in all I will see is her chain lying motionlessly, and all I will hear is the reverberation of my own footsteps. 

Seeing my pubby's lifeless body under a winnie the pooh bear blanket has crushed me. I am devestated to say the least. All I have left of my baby girl is her collar and a lock of her hair. I can't sleep well, despite being physically exhausted. There is no consolation for me because I have trouble believing in any sort of light in this cruel, cruel world. One where the perfect example of loyalty, happiness, and joviality can be put down so mercilessly. I wish that this story had a happy ending, but it doesn't. If anything, I have learned that life is too short not to make the most of it with the ones you love. As cheesy as that sounds, I swear on everything I hold dearly I won't have any regrets about not spending enough time with a person at their funeral, and I hope you do the same.",24Feb2020,1

I think about that every day and how much he does for me. He’s done so much for me and I can barley do my chores, and he doesn’t even yell at me for not doing them, he just asks me to do them tomorrow.  I just wanted to express this here cause it’s midnight and I’m just in the feelings.",24Feb2020,1

Or even just ask everyday all the time, “are you okay” In the same cold tone you’d ask someone who is constant pain. I always answer the same thing, “I’m fine”. My doctors are kinda giving up on me and just give me to a new doctor. (Or just maybe I’ll forget Ill have a nerve disorder and not be in constant pain because it’s all in my head.?.!.?.! /s) I just smoke and crave more. I can’t drink alcohol my risk of becoming an alcoholic is so high it’s bad (genetics).

30,"Hey, 

I am a 21 years old danish female, currently living in Denmark (priorly spent 10 years; 2006-2016 living in Iran), and on my second gap tear after finishing the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme. I graduated from the IB in May 2018, and for as long as I can remember have always wanted to study medicine (okay, maybe my family's early indoctrination has a role to play). I applied to study medicine at the age of 18 in the UK (I couldn't apply for the course in Denmark since I don't speak much Danish) and I didn't get accepted. I then decided to just do well in my IB exams and apply to med school during my gap year. 

However, during my final year of IB I got severely depressed (after a cyber bullying incident where my private conversations were leaked, practically destroying my life),  missed 40% of the years' attendance, and essentially didn't study for the final IB exams (I had plans of committing suicide, so didn't think anything mattered anymore). Along with my depression, my OCD  also reached a peaking point, and drove me insane. Well, then came results day and I realised that I'd only scored 34/45 points whereas I needed at least 36/45 for med schools in the UK. I realised that I wouldn't even be able to apply to med schools in Denmark either since I'd need 39/45 to apply here (which, if I had secured enough points I could have, after learning Danish). 

During this time I was still severely depressed and my academic failure had only confirmed my resolve to commit suicide. On the 16th of July, 2018, I put my plan to end my life to action, however, I was unable to do so. Long story short, a phone call from my then best friend and now fiancé essentially saved my life, and forced me to rethink my decisions. After initiating a romantic relationship with him, I started to enjoy life. He helped me cope with my depression, and OCD. I can safely say that if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have been writing this today. 

So, in August 2018 I made the decision to retake 5 of my IB subjects in hopes of improving my grades. I didn't apply to any unis during the first gap year since I wanted to apply with achieved grades. I acquired my retake results in July of 2019, and realised that I had ended up with a score of 39/45 (slightly below my expectations, but was still happy). Subsequently, in autumn of 2019 I decided to apply to med schools in the UK (couldn't apply to any in Denmark because they don't accept retakes). 

Fast forward to now, I have secured an offer to study medicine in the UK. However, I am not fucking happy, which is so strange because this is what I've wanted all along. I no longer want to go and spend 5 years in the UK leaving my family (my parents and my baby sister and brother) and my loving fiancé  behind. I want to stay in Denmark. If I were to stay in Denmark there are two things I could do; 1. take an engineering course (offered in English) 2. apply to study medicine next year to Danish unis (after learning danish) through kvote 2, where they won't look at my grade point average and will only add up my score from an entrance examination and a written interview. However, this would require me to take another gap year (so 3 in total), and I'll be 22 by the time I'll I will enter med school. Then again, there is no guarantee that I will get into med school through kvote 2.   

The thoughts are racing inside my head. I think that I will be miserable in the UK. I feel that despite technically achieving what I've worked so hard for, I still find myself feeling the same way I did two years ago, when I was at the lowest point of my life. I feel like an ungrateful bitch. I feel depressed. The thought of spending 7 years (5 years of med school, and then 2 years of training after which I hope to return to Denmark) in another country seems so difficult and tiring with the current state of my mind. 

Please help me make a decision. Should I go forward with med school in the UK, or should I look for options in Denmark?",24Feb2020,1

36,"There’s been this weird shift in my life where I now have friends, get girls (sometimes lol, but better than before), have people to hangout, and just feel like I can connect with people a lot better. At the same time I’m kind of disconnected from myself and like I feel like I don’t really know myself anymore, but at the same time I get all my happiness from external things so it makes it hard to be deprived of this.

I went on a hike with my dog and me, and even then I had to post it on social media, but like i did feel good overall, but I used to spend so much time by myself and I don’t know if I was better than or now. Now I’m thinking like is it necessarily a bad thing that I’ve changed and I have progressed and improved in so many, but it’s been at the cost of just not focusing on myself as much.

I just don’t even know what to do really bc I have no role models and I just have fantasies or vague ideas, of how people I respect live there lives. I’m a sophomore in college, and it’s just like I’m not really passionate about college, my grades are meh,  and I am not really motivated about it (engineering major), but I feel like I should be and that it’ll pay off. I just can’t find it in me to focus, and I smoke weed most days bc I just get too tense and anxious, and this mellows and lets me bring myself together. I’m high rn actually and all this self reflection makes me feel better, but like I’m drinking every weekend, barely stay sober, and like I feel like something is wrong but I’m just masking it, under the guise of like chasing girls, partying and smoking. 

At the same time these things give me happiness bc it feels like I have to keep up with what’s expected of me, and life is short and I don’t just want to handicap myself.

With all this beings said I just feel lost and don’t know what the best route in my life for me, or what I value or want in my life.",24Feb2020,1

I turn 21 this year, and live paycheque to paycheque and have 27k in car debt and Student LoC to pay off and at my pay it will take 25 years to do so.

I want to live while I'm young, and be able to put the pieces in place to start a family with my girlfriend of over three years, and I can't do that with this debt and unstable income.

50,"I am sitting with some of my friends studying and one of these friends is this girl I was crushing on hard first semester. I had asked her out and she said no and things were awkward but we were still technically friends. Anyways me and her are sitting on the same side of the table and I am carefully managing space so I take less than half of the table length.

Suddenly she starts touching my arm. Like I'm resting my elbow on the table and she places her hands to type in a way so that her elbow is touching mine.

I'm sitting there like ""this is awkward"" so I move my arm a little away. She responds by continuing to touch me. I move my arm again and she brings her elbow to touch mine again. At this point I'm thinking ""how the fuck are you even typing your lab report right now.""

So anyways, I somewhat loudly say ""sorry"" and move my hand away. Girl is like ""oh, but you didn't do anything wrong."" And I'm thinking in my head ""yeah, but YOU FUCKING ARE.""

But it seems like she gets the point. Then I adjust my posture so my arm is across the table and again she moves so her hand is fucking touching mine.

At this point a couple of thoughts are racing through my head, but the first and foremost is ""you remember fucking rejecting me right?"" So I move my hand away again.

Now I start telling a story and for the first time in my entire godforsaken life I am actually kind of funny and my friends are laughing hard including her. At some point my hand rests at the middle of the table. This time she moves her ENTIRE FUCKING BODY so that the length of her back is across my arm and her head in on my hand.

Now I bring out the big guns. I start telling this story that is more than tangentially related to the time she rejected me. Now everyone is laughing there ass off except her. Now I think she definitely must have got the message but her body doesn't move. So now I am mentally screaming ""hey, Earth to Lady, you rejected me, get off of my fucking arm"" but girl just doesn't move. Then about 15 minutes later she finally has to leave and I am done.

53,"I feel like it makes sense to consider our existence from the point we're conceived, because when our mothers are pregnant (when they notice they're pregnant, that is), they acknowledge that we exist and refer to us, either as ""the baby"" or by name, so for them to say that we're, say, 5 years old 5 years after we escape the womb implies that ""we"" as referents didn't exist before that moment, even though they acknowledged us before then. It's a contradiction.

Hell, in for a penny, in for a pound - If the conception of a baby happens when a sperm and an egg meet, why not, if it were at all possible, track when the sperm and egg were created in our father and mother's bodies, and pinpoint the beginning of their coexistence as the starting point of your existence?

Even then, sperm and eggs don't just pop into existence - they have to get manufactured by the seminiferous tubules and germinal epithelia, respectively. And even those organs didn't pop into existence - they were developed while your mother and father were developing. Everything has to come from something.

Would any other girl get mad about ....

Their boyfriend liking a girls Facebook picture? Okay let me get more into detail ... the reason I’m pissed about this isn’t because he liked a girls picture but because he liked multiple pictures of this girl who he has talked dirty to while in a relationship with me he has asked her to send her pictures of her boobs &amp; a few other things that isn’t fucking okay to say to another girl while in a relationship he’s liked recent pictures of hers also a picture of her tits hanging out ... so would anyone else be mad? Cause I’m pissed and I basically told him to fuck off and to not dare come back home . I don’t have a Facebook but I find my ways to get onto his page and see who he is friends with oh and he never actually posts on Facebook he rarely if ever likes anyone’s pictures or posts but guess lately he’s felt like liking this bitches pictures.  I confronted him and he tried to lie and tell me that she has him blocked on Facebook and he knows I don’t have a Facebook so he thinks he can lie and say shit like that so I asked him what her last name was cause there were a few other girls with the same name as her on his Facebook and sure enough it was the same one &amp; Honestly I don’t think I can do it anymore it’s not just this that’s made me question being with him but a few other things &amp; I feel like I’m losing my mind &amp; my self.. all I do is think and think and wonder &amp; drive my self fucking crazy.

Yes that’s right! I just stated all these years because they are all important to me and I strongly believe that in all of these years i will find something new to love in you but, not because I don’t know you well enough and i will learn something new every year but because, love is a garden with flowers and you have to take care of it every day for a long period of time otherwise you will lose your gardens and at one point you are going to fall in love with the procedure of planting,watering and just looking the flower enjoying the sun. That is why i am expressing love like this because every year i am going to see you grow learn become someone better and then i am going to enjoy you in the sun when you are going to glow. I don’t know if this makes sense when you read it but, in my mind it makes perfect sense and this is a major thing about me, most of the things i say don’t make sense, people cannot turn them into pictures and that is what makes this love special, the fact that only me can see those kind of things and find a way to achieve them makes me who i am",24Feb2020,1

Once at the hospital, they did all kinds of tests. After the basic ones and a scan, they informed me that I had a blood clot in my lung.

I thought he wanted to end it with me right there but didn’t know how to say it. I straight up asked him if he wanted to keep dating me and he said he did. 

Ok, fine. I feel a little hurt and confused so I tell him once I get home how I felt and that it made me uncomfortable. Communication and discussion of the topic is sporadic throughout the next two weeks and left me feeling some type of way. I end up telling him eventually I don’t want to see him anymore because he’s giving me mixed signals and making me confused. He says he wants to keep seeing me and asks if he can please see me again. I end up giving in, ok fine. We see each other Sunday. It starts out ok but then it starts feeling kinda awkward. I guess becauSe I’m not feeling it as much anymore since I’ve been kinda disappointed by him but I kinda try. 

The date alternated between us talking and breaks of silence on our phones. I didn’t know how to fix it so I tried to just go with it but I felt uncomfortable and I could feel he did too. He starts telling me a story about some restaurant and I’m like oh ok cool. A few minutes later he uploaded pictures on his Instagram he had just finished editing of his ex girlfriend at said restaurant when they hung out a few days before. 

LMAO. Wait so you KNOW how I feel about this. How doubtful I was of continuing BECAUSE of you and your ex girlfriend, because even if u tell me you’re over her your actions had me thinking otherwise, you told me you’re also not really hanging out with her anymore but this happened like 4 days ago, AND YOU UPLOAD THESE PICTURES WHILE I AM SITTING NEXT TO YOU ON OUR DATE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BE PRESENT.

I got so angry that I almost left right there. Again, I’m left feeling like he just fucking wanted to end it with me but didn’t know how so he did this??? Wtf??? Why??? 

I really almost left but ended up sitting back down to calm down and he told me about how they’re best friends and part of the same friend group so it’s hard to not talk. Same excuse he gave me before. I see at that moment 2 notifications for messages from said girl ughhh. I wanted to strangle him right then. We ended up continuing the date and I tried really hard to end it positively and let him know we can be friends and hang out, but only as friends. Later i get home and see he had deleted the post.

But I left wondering why?? Why the fuck did he do it ugh if he wanted to end things why disrespect me to do it fuck. Did she put him up to it?? Did he not realize it was wrong?? Did he realize it was wrong but just didn’t care?? 

I’m left questioning his intentions",24Feb2020,1

I'm not going to tread water with some shitty job for my entire life, I need to give my kids the best chance possible, and to do that I'll need money.

I'm twenty now, and I was beaten on the regular till I was fourteen. That too was after so much struggle on my part, I convinced them that if they touched me I'd go and tell absolutely everyone they knew. And that stops them, really does. Image is everything. Nobody wants the neighbours to know they're child beaters.

And then starts the emotional abuse. I'm a good daughter, really am. Top grades, best college in the country for my subject, enroute a really good grad school. I've never beaten people up, I've never embarrassed them, never done shit. And yet it's somehow never been enough. What the fuck possesses a grown ass man to come beat a child, his own child?

But whatever, sometimes now I feel I'd rather he actually hit me physically than continue his cycle of emotional bullshit. At least then I'd know for sure what to do. Fuck this man, fuck his enabling wife. My younger sister, fourteen now, has to live with them full time while I'm off to college and jesus I feel so bad for her. Even though she doesn't receive the brunt of it, she lives her life in fear. It's terrible.

I can appreciate the sacrifices they've made for me. I can also understand at the same time that nobody asked them to; I absolutely never fucking asked to be born, for sure. Everyone has to fucking pay for their kid's school educations, they're not being extra special for doing that and feeding me food.

I went in on a present and spent the night feeling good about myself. 

I noticed she was being rude to me, asking to see him and not me when she was invited to our house and then when he invited her to a party we had at our house recently she was really rude to me. I felt devastated and confused as I thought we were friends. He told me drunkenly that I wasn’t invited to her party and he invited me instead because he felt bad and that she doesn’t like me because she thinks I talk about myself too much (this girl only talks about her mental health issues to my partner and ignores his so that’s contradictory) 

I feel really stupid and humiliated. Crashing a party thinking I was invited, my partner inviting her to our party at our house when she doesn’t like me and he let me think she does. I feel like I can’t trust anyone and I’m going into a dark place. I told my partner this and he apologised but is now not talking to me much and I feel so lonely and stupid.

 I am starting to get very frustrated about it because i am now in the age where i am supposed to have fun, travel, go out and live my youth.

I'm still a virgin but I've been in a relationship before which lasted for a year and I liked the feeling of someone loving me for me.

100,"A little less than 11 months ago, I (26F) was diagnosed with severe aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure, my body wasn't producing blood cells). I had a bone marrow transplant 2 months later. I spent almost the entire 2 months between diagnosis and the BMT in the hospital for infections and the like, not to mention a bunch of blood and platelet transfusions. We also had to put down my cat of over 17 years in that 2 months. Then I was in the hospital for a month after my transplant just so they could monitor me until I was safe to go home. I'm physically doing really well now, though I still have a while to go before I'll be considered ""cured"".

But I've struggled mentally a lot since then. I was out of work for 9 months (just went back parttime last month). A lot of my hair fell out from the chemo, so I cut it short to kind of hide how thin it got, and it worked, but now it's growing back and it always looks like a mess. I lost a bunch of weight from being in the hospital but then I came home and did nothing all day every day and gained it all back and then some. So my self esteem is almost nonexistent. I still have to be super careful about germs and crowds and what I eat because my immune system is like that of a baby and I'm on immunosuppressants. I ended up in the hospital from an infection a couple weeks ago after 6 months of no hospital visits and it felt like such a setback. 

But in the meantime, it all just feels like I'm going through the motions of living without being present. I don't get to go to the bar or a concert or things like that. I watch everyone get to do things that I can't do and go places that I can't go. And the bad part is that given the choice, I don't know that I'd choose to do those things and go to those places. I like staying at home. But I hate not having the choice. I hate feeling trapped. 

Last night I had a dream that I went for my checkup with my hematologist and she told me the transplant was failing and I had to go through it all again. And I had another dream where my hair was falling out and I had bald patches everywhere and my scalp was covered in scabs and scrapes but I had to go to work anyway. And I just felt so awful about myself. And it's like my brain just can't escape the constant reminder that I'm not myself anymore.  It's a lot of negativity and self hatred when I'm usually a pretty positive person and I hate it. 

My emotions go back and forth between ""I don't care about anything except my cats"" and ""Everything makes me cry"" and I feel like I rarely feel actually happy anymore. I have piles of mail that I feel like it would just be overwhelming to go through (no bills though, I'm good about that).

I want to start seeing a therapist but I don't know how to start looking and whenever I think about it, I just think ""I'll do that later"" and it never gets done. 

I just want to go back to my old self and I know I'm lucky because the odds are, I'll be able to in a few months, after I'm off my meds and re-vaccinated.

We have a schedule where 4 days of the week we work 7:30-5:30 then fridays is a half day, ending at noon. 3 months ago I experienced my first real loss in life...my healthy Pomeranian died while getting a tooth pulled and it nearly destroyed me. I still am having trouble eating and sleeping...I tend to stay awake until I am so tired that my head hits the pillow and I’m out. I get to work late...like every day.

I was embarrassed but yet here I am still running late. What is wrong with me?! I’ve always had issues especially in mornings but never to this extent...it used to be 5 or 10 minutes but this is causing serious stress in my life. I’m not sure if I should do us all the favor and look elsewhere since this clearly is making them very frustrated with me. They are now way more critical of my work and barely give compliments, most likely due to me being late. The worst part is before losing my dog, I was moving closer to work so my commute was to be cut in half and they knew that. So in their minds, this is ridiculous that I’m still running late.

Let me start by saying, I’ve always thought I had a decent handle on my emotions, thoughts and feelings and while I’ve gone through some bouts of mild depression (as anyone does) before I’ve been able to come out of it by practicing self care and utilizing healthy coping mechanisms. 

At this point, I feel like I’ve totally lost of my sense of self. I can’t seem to get a handle on any healthy coping mechanisms or silence the negative self thoughts. But I can’t even find the energy or direction or will to start taking the steps to fix it. 

To be fair, I’ve had some major changes happen over the past year and a half, including but not limited to - moving home, grandma getting diagnosed with cancer, starting a new (more stressful) job which includes a 1.5 hour commute, and more recently another grandparent dying. 

I’ve also got to take some responsibility for the shitty things that I’ve done since all of this started which have hurt people I cared about and is compounding guilt on top of depression.

So I’m 15f and have bad ocd and depression. Due to this I used to be really supportive of  awareness of mental health and neurological disabilities. However, when my cousin who’s real little got diagnosed with autism a year ago. I don’t know but I guess I was starting to get annoyed because my aunt started basically started posting about autism all the time. I remember my other aunt posted about my cousin too once and about awareness when she never did before. I guess that especially was a bit hurtful, I know it wasn’t justified hurt probably, but still, to me I’ve struggled with a bunch of this stuff all my life to the point where it nearly ruined me and been relatively quiet about it. I guess I felt hurt and jealous which is insane because I’m older I shouldn’t be jealous of how people treat a preschooler. I do love her a lot though and like being around her.  

I know it’s not a big deal but i every now and then used to say autistic except in the pejorative sense. Around this time I was beginning to go to a new school and i was having a hard time trying to find people to hang out with because I’m pretty shy. I felt bad every now and then because there would be certain people who had traits of autism and I was afraid I was mean if I didn’t want to hang out with them due to some behaviors they had that may be a symptom of autism I guess. It became one of my ocd obsessions where I’d literally analyze and ruminate over whether I was mean for preferring not to be with certain people.


I guess I began having bad thoughts about people who were autistic. It probably didn’t help that my ocd kinda left me ruminating on it and whether the person I didn’t want to hang out with had it and whether I was therefore bad for not wanting to hang out with them. And also I was put in a group at school long term with people who have a social or learning disability and i thought something mean while thinking about them even though im trying not to think bad about that anymore. 

my ocd is now obsessed with trying to not be biased or have those bad thoughts which is a good thing obviously but its been bothering me alot and making me feel like a bad person. I  don’t know how to get rid of biases though. Btw when i talk about how I had bad or “mocking” thoughts I don’t mean intrusive thoughts because I didn’t immediately push them away and get repulsed. I would like them or agree with them at first and then I’d feel real bad about them.  I needed to rant but If anyone can help then that is appreciated more than you could know.",24Feb2020,1
131,"So I grew up to adore my older sister, she’s my idol (Her opinion values very greatly to me), but when she came back home from school she gave me this shirt and I was like “Okay cool, imma wear this tomorrow so I can show off to my friends!”. So the next day I woke up late and had to take a shower in morning, so I rushed to put on some clothes and wore the shirt she gave me, but I realized it was too short so I wore a jacket over it to cover it up. When I came back home I saw that my sister wasn’t there so I just made the guess she was studying and went to my room and got comfortable and took off my jacket, I was wearing kinda high but not too high pants and the short shirt. And she came back a few hours so I came down to greet her and said to me “OP why are you wearing that?!” and I said “Cause you gave it to me?” and she replied with “Well it makes you look like a slut.” and I just quietly nodded and went upstairs crying. Later we went to eat dinner as a family and I just started bawling at the dinner table because yet again she asked “Why are you still wearing that?” and told my parents what happened, and left the dinner table. She just came to apologize to me before she left to go back, but I ignored her and she left. 
Should I apologize to her or just stay quiet like I usually do?",24Feb2020,1
132,"Is it bad that I (F24) need reassurance from my boyfriend (M26) a lot? My past relationships haven’t been as special as this and I don’t want to drive him away. Most of the time I just deal with it on my own but sometimes it’s overwhelming and I want advice on how to deal with these things better. We’ve been dating more than two years and have known each other almost 10 years. He’s special to me and I don’t wan to risk it. Let me know in the comments please :)

Thankyou",24Feb2020,1
133,"I skipped school today. I was feeling sick in the morning, so my mom let me stay home. Except now I don't feel as sick. I know I should have gotten ready and gone to school as soon as I started to feel better, but I didn't. I feel so guilty. I can't believe I'm such an ungrateful, impulsive baby. I'm supposed to working on an essay, but I can't think because I'm so ashamed of myself. I'm the worst, most irresponsible kid I know",24Feb2020,1
134,"So here’s a little background about my sister. My sister is pretty muscular, she’s been going to the gym for about 4/5 years now. She’s very proud of her muscles and I support her in it. And the fun thing is, I’ve liked muscular girls since I was a little kid. So I think it’s good for her to go to the gym gym, but just about a half hour ago a weird thing happened. She just came home from the gym and was chilling in her room. And about 20 minutes later I went into her room because I wanted to talk to her. Ask how the gym was, or how her day was. But when I walked in she only had her string on, so no bra or anything else. Don’t judge me btw, the door of room was open. So I could just see her pumped up pecs and muscles. Pecs are sort of muscular boobs on girls. She was laying in her bed with the blanket just onder her pecs, so you could see her pecs hanging over the blanket. And she didn’t even cover them or something like that, she just said what do you want to talk about. But I was a bit in shock and just stared at her pecs and muscles. So she was like; ‘have you never seen pecs before?’ And then she started to flex her pecs up and down. I was a bit confused but I also kind of liked it, because as I told you, I like muscular girls. And I felt my penis just getting a bit harder, so I just ran out of her room my room in. I haven’t said anything yet to her. What do you think about it? Do you’ve got some advice?",24Feb2020,1
136,I don’t know where to put this. If All we do in life is go to school or work and we only have limited time to do things we want to do but we constantly are worried about problems with work or school and everyday problems. There is so much distracting us like we have to do all the things we don’t like to do in order to just live. What is the point in living life when we can’t even do what we want. And we constantly worry about money because without money we would die because you need money for literally everything. Nothing is free in life. So what is the point in living life,24Feb2020,1
137,Is that weird? I've been able to do it since I broke it about 10 years ago.,24Feb2020,1
139,"I met with a cool girl on Tinder, started chatting, flowing great, I ask her to lunch, she agrees, I provide my availability and *unmatch*

Then a girl messages me on Bumble, conversation flowing great, I ask her lunch, she agrees but first asks to see my Instagram so I share my profile, *unmatch*

Seriously, fuck that... I'm the shit and I love myself enough to not out my emotions in the line for shitty online conversations and ghosting... also, I debated changing my Instagram after that happened cos it felt kinda shitty to think some random girl who was enthusiastic to go on a lunch date 2 seconds ago was suddenly uninterested after seeing my fucking Instagram, wtf? I'm keeping every post up, have some depth people, don't judge books by covers

140,"I recently asked a friend of mine why black girls were never interested in me growing up. She is black as well. She said it's because I am 'uppity' (acting like I'm better than my peers even if I am in a position of leadership). She also said that black women can tell 'I'm not interested and just like white women.' Then she said some people have seen me as 'anti-black'.

I'm not sure why this affected me so much. I'm sitting here thinking, 'am I really? What am I fucking up?' Because I love my people, I really do. But I feel like I haven't been shown the same love sometimes. Growing up, I was into all the nerdy shit (and still am, hell just look at my post history). I spoke differently. I didn't speak like I was from the ghetto, my mother worked hard to take me out of that environment. 

My own family has even made mentions of me 'probably being bullied in school cause I talk like a white boy'. 

My best friend of 13 years is black.  I have more black friends than I fr have had in a while. I love hip-hop and R&amp;B music as well as the history behind it. I mean it's what I want to go into when I get older. And as far as the girls comment, I've just always noticed black girls are never interested or sometimes a girl just isn't my type (standards?). Now make no mistake, I love white women, but I love all women regardless of race. My girlfriend is white, and I love her to death. So I'm just thinking in my head, at what point did I give off an anti-black vibe? Is it because I only did choir and theater in high school? Is it because I hung out with the 'nerds'? Is it my speech?",24Feb2020,1

142,"I got arrested on my college campus and I feel like I ruined my life. I wasn't arrested for drugs, drinking, assault or anything of that caliber. I was just skating.

There is this campus bike police officer who constantly harasses my friends and I because we skate, but our university allows students to skate campus as a way to transport themselves. I have been harassed by this officer on numerous occasions he has harassed me even when I'm not skating.

2 months ago I almost committed suicide, my father is terminally ill and I basically flunked half my classes because of all the family and financial stress. I was put into a psych hospital for seven days against my will after that happened. Then a month ago I was skating around my campus and this cop approaches me again. Stops me I ask why he is stopping me, he says criminal mischief and I ask him how could he possibly prove that. He demands ID, I refuse because I don't want to deal with this officer. he then immediately calls for back up. this other officer rolls up aggressively demands ID or he will arrest me. I begin having a full-on panic attack, I began having flashbacks to being put in a mental hospital against my will and next thing I know the officer starts grabbing my arms I told him I would ID myself and he just responded ""Too Late"" and handcuffed me and threw me in jail.

I now might get suspended from school and I had to spend all my money for rent and living expenses on an attorney... I don't know what to do anymore I still have a year before I graduate... this police officer ruined my life and I feel so helpless.

Could anyone please give me some advice? I have lost all my motivation to do my school work... I have a hard time even finding the motivation to get out of bed after this happened... I feel so lost :(",24Feb2020,1
143,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/f7sy7w/why_i_am_a_piece_of_crap_1_i_like_fast_food/)

I don't like being around a lot of people. I am very nervous being around new people. I always feel like people are staring at me. I always feel like people are talking about me. I always feel like people are laughing at me.

I don't want to be laughed at. I don't want to beg for acceptance from people who would laugh at me or talk about me negatively. I know that sometimes people can become friends after not liking each other. However, I just don't trust people to give it a try. I know this makes me abnormal and a piece of crap.",24Feb2020,1
