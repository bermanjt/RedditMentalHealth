1,"To give context I have been out of undergrad and the real world and trying to adapt to ""adult life"". Lately, I have just been feeling unhappy with the friends I have made along the way. I love my friends to death but I feel like I'm the one reaching out, doing new things, wanting to explore and everyone else is kind of just...content? I feel most of my friends are introverted somehow? I wouldn't classify myself as an introverted person, but I am not extroverted either (so ambivert). I'm tired of having friends who don't really care? Or want to do anything? I just wish I could meet my ""soulmate"" friends if that makes sense. I don't know, If anyone has input or has felt the same in the past.  I'm starting grad school but everyone ages are kind of all over the place...I've joined clubs and volunteer in my community but still haven't felt that connection...Idk what I'm really looking for honestly.

To add:  I know times are rough during COVID, but I even felt this way before the pandemic happened and now it's only made it more evident in my life. ",25Jul2020,2
2,"Create a space station but it is full of sperm and eggs and artificial wombs and we have robots and shit on there too. That way when we fuck up earth and can't live on it anymore, all we have to do is wait for the space station to detect when it's okay for people to live on it again.

At that point the whole thing activates and starts shitting out kids, which get raised by the robots which imitate people and can teach them all they need to know.

This is light years easier than trying to travel light years to some distant planet and then having to do so all over again once we fuck that one up too.

3,"Ever since I turned 19 my life has been going on a downwards spiral. Losing friends, feeling like dead weight, I've been plagued by dark thoughts almost every night. And usually the validation on my birthday helps. But yesterday I just felt.. empty.

Anyone with children knows first hand they are are harbingers of plague. If it’s contagious?

The kids are bringing it home from school. PERIOD. 

It’s like they want us to die. It’s like they are taking cues from the Georgia Guidestones during the worst pandemic this world has seen since the Spanish flu.

8,"I’m going to college and I’ve been looking at different clubs, sports and activities to see what is interesting. They all seem to promote being a leader, which is great, but I’m wondering if there is anything wrong with not wanting to become a go-to leader. I consider myself to be more introverted. I’m definitely not as shy as I used to be at all, but I still like to keep to myself some times. I have things I’m passionate about and am interested in learning more about, but I just don’t feel the need to become a leader of something. Sure, I’ll definitely jump in and help someone when they need it. I’ll participate and practice but I generally don’t have as much interest in trying to lead a group.

Now I'm using it as fuel for the gym. I kinda like it now when people doubt me and say I cant do something. Now I'm like oh you think I cant? Well I'm going to do it 10x better than what you thought I could do. Btw little about me, had cancer at the age of 16 in 2010, went through chemo for a year and then got pneumonia and in order to beat that I was in a coma for 22 days and spent 3 months in the hospital. Lost ALL muscles, couldn't even sit up. Had to relearn how to walk and everything. After going through all that bull, I had very little hope that I could be what I once was.

18,"Early on in the COVID19 outbreak, I thought COVID19 was like a slightly worse version of the flu. I didn't think it was serious and I was confident it'd blow over in short order.

Early on I didn't think masks were effective or even necessary. I felt that since I couldn't acquire N95 masks that it was pointless to wear a mask at all since it wouldn't fully protect me.

Its been sometime and I'm OK with saying I was wrong.

COVID19 is a very serious and deadly virus that needs to be aggressively attacked

Mask use does help in the prevention of spreading of COVID19 and everyone when in public shoudl wear one. Even if its not an N95, even a simple cloth mask will do.",25Jul2020,3
19,"I work from 7 am to 3 pm, with a 30 minute commute, so I have to get up at 5:45 am every day. And I have to take my girlfriend to and from work most days, and she works until 11 pm. I only need to make this work for a bit over a month more, but I dread each day. I am someone that really needs 7-8 hours at least to function properly, and every night I end up getting 5-6. So when I get home around 3:30, I have no motivation to do anything but sleep or watch TV. Is this what adult life is? I have more money now than I ever have before, but it feels useless. Every day is such a struggle. My job is mind-numbingly boring, and I get rude customers multiple times a day, and I feel pressure from my boss. I well up with tears on my morning commute, as well as each night before bed, and even if I have the energy to do things, it is plagued by the thought of going back to hell the next day. I'm so scared that this is just normal life. I hate it. I hate it so much. I've gotten rid of all my vices; I don't drink, I don't smoke weed, I don't juul. But I really really want to. I'm not going to, I know it would make things worse, but I crave an escape from my existence.

Tomorrow will be my girlfriend and I's 1.5 year anniversary. We were going to do something special, but we both know I'll be too tired when I get home to do anything more than have a home cooked meal. It'll be nice, but I'll be thinking about work.

20,"So, I went through a break up about a month ago.  Very sad, really thought she was the one, still do, was very sudden, but entirely my fault.  A host of reasons why I wasn’t present mentally for the last couple months of our relationship, but in short, just didn’t give her the love she needed.  As a result, I’ve been trying to better myself.  Come to terms with my issues, and solve them, so that they won’t impact my future.  It’s been a lot of things, and I’ve realized many of my issues are anchored to memories and past events that in some way scarred me.  Some have been other ex girlfriends, I’ve had a few, all of whom I hurt in some way.  Never abusive or anything, just me suddenly breaking up with them or something along those lines.  Just wanted to say sorry and make sure they understood it was never they, it was me.  All the convos went great.

Then, there was someone I really needed to talk to.  When I was a freshman/sophomore in high school, I suffered from absolutely crippling depression.  Nothing was truly wrong in life, I was kind of bullied but mostly to my own mistakes, but just didn’t want to be alive.  One day, I planned to end it all.  The day before, I made an obscure but intentional goodbye post on social media.  It caught the attention of one kid, who I never really knew well, but he reached out to the dean who then called my parents, who caught me just in time.  It was a grueling situation, but after therapy and changes, I not only recovered, but went on to live an incredible life so far.  I didn’t know it was him for years, I never knew how my parents found out until a year or two ago.  I struggled with wanting to talk to him about it, because it was so in the past.  But today I finally thanked him for saving my life.  I would’ve never experienced the incredible life I’ve had, the memories, the experiences, the love and even loss has been worth every moment of growth.  He was thankful for my reaching out, telling me he himself had just slipped into depression and needed to go to a facility.  I told him it’d all work out, we’re all human, sometimes we just need love and help.  Our convo was great, and a huge weight was lifted at last.",25Jul2020,1
22,"Today is my 19th birthday! I just wanted an outlet to tell someone that it’s my 19th birthday and what I’ve learned as a 18 year old. 

My first 3-4 months of becoming an adult was very stagnant. I’d already signed my contract for the Air Force so I was living with my parents until I got shipped out. Though I won’t go into much details into bmt. I just wanted to say that it was challenge to adapt to a high stress environment and that my first great achievement was becoming one of the honor graduates of my flight. My next big achievement was graduating tech school with an average test score of 97%. The award itself doesn’t mean much but I felt appreciated that my MTI and commander recognized my efforts which made me happy.

I’ve never had a job before and the AF is the only job I’ve ever had. It was hard handling earned money because as my income grew, my desires did too. I was in a trap hole believing that there was no hope in escaping it. I remembered when I was 16 I had a very distant cousin recommend me a book called The Magic of Thinking Big. I stopped reading it when I was 16 because I felt it wasn’t helping me at all. Until I stumbled upon the book Rich Dad Poor Dad I immediately read it in hopes of becoming rich. Just a few pages in I was hooked and have finally discovered how to become financially free while being able to obtain my desires. Everything I thought up until I read Rich Dad Poor Dad was that to become rich you’d have to be born into a rich family or lucky, which in fact was not true at all. I sought to look for more wisdom and that’s when I discovered self-help books, which have enlightened my mind. I finally found faith in myself, and that life isn’t so bad as it looks after all, it’s beautiful. Currently reading The Magic of Thinking Big again because I was too blind at 16 to understand what the author was telling me. I’m glad that life has pushed me to the edge and I resorted to finding practical solutions through educating myself by reading books. My relationship with my friends and family have improved drastically and at work I’ve been able to make friendship with everyone. I had a wonderful year as an 18 year old and I’m excited to keep learning. Last thing I want to say is that, always keep growing. Don’t get complacent because that’s where the mind goes to die.",25Jul2020,3
23,"Don’t believe me? Think back to high school. Odds are you guys either had a fight and stopped talking or, (in my opinion) the worst one, drifting apart. 

Like summer came around and you guys hung out frequently, college started and kept talking. Your classes got busy and almost completely stopped talking then one day you just realize “when was the last time I spoke to such and such?” You call them and they don’t answer because they’re busy living their life. Text em and they’ll respond “oh hey man how you been?” 

I’m not in HS, few years away from HS but I’m in the military and this is especially noticeable in the military. Either they’re sent to another base or they just get out and before you realize, “I wonder what happened to “

28,"I'm an older brother to one sibling, she is 19 and growing in her own way. We don't have the healthiest relationship due to the mistakes I have committed. I sometimes wish I could say its because I was never a brother before but that can't always be why. I'm not the best older brother. I have sold my sister out in the past and very recently upset her. I think I have learned to protect her secrets better yet being the only confidant will sometimes escalate to me as she puts it 'throwing stuff back at her face'. Today I threw back her running of a red light and being unlicensed when she yelled at me for moving my car behind her truck. She called me stupid. I thought it would be smart due to the upcoming storm (I'm in Houston TX). My concern was in case I needed to move my car out of the way, in case its worse than thought. I mention ways I have protected her secrets, like where she is on some nights. She goes to these truck meets where people drift at public places or blast loud music. I'm aware she had a relationship with a guy who had a family of his own, If I recall correctly. Yet I have never informed my parents of these red flags. She says I'm not supposed to due to our sibling relationship but that's a stretch. That it doesn't excuse 'throwing stuff back at her face'.

One coworker called me about a question I had asked over email. I was not in the mood whatsoever but answered and politely greeted them. Before even asking about work they talked to me about a funny situation that happened weeks prior and then what I was doing over the weekend. Whole mood changed. I was so happy to be talking to them, we chatted for about 10 minutes and while on the phone got the work they needed done.

I'm a 22 year old guy from Sweden, currently unemployed, It really does feel like no one (apart from my loving family which i am forever thankful for) loves me

Sure, people ""like"" me, I have like 1-2 people I can ""talk"" too

It feels like I wont ever have love unless I start bringing in tons of money, which rubs me the wrong way..

I would love to have someone I could spoil, but what's the point?

If they won't be with me when I am poor, I would just feel used if they get with me after the fact that I'm making money

I'm not a perfect human being or anything, I think I look good, I think I'm a nice person, been told that I'm very funny (I suspect this is why my friends keep me around, I am occasionally hilarious according to them)

It will be complicated and messy but somehow they will end up together. And normally I'd root for that, yay, happy ending.

45,"It's an abstract feeling, so hard to put into words. It's like you can't directly look at it, but you can see it on the corner of your eyes. I will try to express the feeling I am going through with thoughts you all may had at some point of your life. I would love to know if you ever had a similar feeling:

I am just a bunch of memories, did all of that happen? When, exactly? Is time only in my head? Was it really long ago? Because everything that happens gets lost, it no longer exists. Maybe I will be old and wonder if time really matters, because we can only live in the present. If it was 70 yeas ago or 7 minutes go, what's the difference? Both ""presents"" are gone forever. This kind of thing makes me feel like I am about to wake up and everything I have lived was a dream.

Have you ever had a dream that felt so real that it took you several hours, days, weeks or even months to get over it? I feel like I am about to wake up and grief the loss of my world, accomplishments and loved ones. I could totally believe that my life was just a dream, it doesn't feel real enough.

 I feel vulnerable, I feel like I am another different person everyday because the reality that took place yesterday is so far away, it no longer exists. I wish I could stop time and live forever in one frame for eternity, as horrific as it sounds, it scares me less than feeling how time is constantly pushing me to a non-existent place called ""the past"".

If everything is on the past as soon as it happens, is there really a present? Because it must be so little you could say it's meaningless. Every second that goes by becomes part of it. Sometimes I feel like I am getting lost in the past as I am living the present.

Reality becomes fragile, as we are working to have a ""great past"". I am working, building a family, just so I can be old and say ""It was a good life"". Was it? Where is it? Where did it go? At the end is just you, living one frame at a time.

In fact, I would keep rubbing myself if a man told me to even if it hurt or I wanted to stop. My focus was on pleasing him..... this perfectly random man who often times was just a penis on the screen. 

I also post nudes on gonewild and although most of the time I feel aroused by it, I sometimes post when I’m depressed and completely nonsexual because I feel this need to bring pleasure to men. I feel worthless or something if I don’t contribute to a man’s orgasm in some way. 

The same is true for irl sexual encounters with men. I don’t particularly like sex— I don’t hate it— but I absolutely NEED it in order to feel “good”. Once again not necessarily in a sexual sense but in this weird innate compulsion to do it. If I don’t, I’m depressed and unfulfilled. 

I’ve never orgasmed from sex and I’m okay with that. Sex to me feels satisfying because a man desires my body and I’m arousing him and I’m the one to make him cum. This makes me feel special and loved.

I consider myself very generous. I always tend to help others because I think everyone deserves a helping hand from time to time. There's this friend of mine, I've known her for 5 years by now. She struggles a lot in certain college subjects, so I've helped her through the entire career. Although she is my friend, sometimes I feel she's kind of ungrateful, sometimes she gets mad when I can't help her, and when I do, she adopts this forced friendly mood. This happens sometimes, not always. The thing is... I've come to realize I dedicate too much time helping her that there's barely time left for me...

Currently, I'm applying for a MD in finances but, in order to get my name on the list of acceptance, I have to approve some courses.  We had some exams and, even though I knew all the concepts and theory and stuff, I got some wrong answers, and my mistakes were kinda' dumb, all because I didn't sleep well... After I uploaded my exam (online courses are the worst thing ever, in my opinion), my friend (who also applied for the same Master's) called me desperately asking for help; she couldn't answer a question about the history of economics and wanted me to answer it for her... Which I did...

Later on I realized that she is going to get a better grade than mine because I helped her checking her answers while no one helped me, even though I made some mistakes... I know it's against the rules, that's something I've very clear... The real thing that bothers me is the fact that she is celebrating her good grade while I, the person who answered both exams, hers and mine, stood up until dawn studying, am searching for alternatives to save my history course... By the way, she only said ""thanks"" and that's all...

Maybe it's my fault... It's just, I always try to help others, even when sometimes they hurt me... And yes, I think that what I did is no help, but she asked for it and I delivered...

So I focused 100% on myself, I didn't talked to her, focused on my math test and answered all correctly (I think). After my exam, I didn't helped her to solve hers, all I did was to focus on my own stuff...

I don't know what to do, or if I'm right or wrong... She is my friend... but I'm forgetting about my own stuff...

Hello Reddit, today i'd like to share with all of you a story, one about myself, and the realizations i have had in the past month. However I believe with my story it is best to start at the beginning or close to. I was a smart kid, very interested in everything I could grasp onto an understanding of, I am not gonna lie and say I was some genius kid. I was a mostly normal kid with severe insomnia and a bad home life, and from a very young age, around 8 or 9 I desired to die. As time went on i started contemplating the afterlife, and creating and desired so badly to understand it i thought about it and suicide all day long, through school, at home, when watching tv, when doing anything. The thoughts of suicide and the afterlife filled my head. As I get older I accept afterlife or not. I don't fear death, but I believe all my time learning and attempting to come to a comprehensive understanding of the world leads me down a path where I feel a great disconnect with fellow humans.

As I grew older and older I feel I started losing it a bit, I'd stay up all night learning new things or taking things apart, attempting to understand more and more of the world. I'd come out of every long late night with something new. However i also lost my mind from time to time, i remember when i was 14 (2015) probably, i had stayed up all night looking at the way that the world and technology is progressing and i got so freaked out to the point that i felt in my heart that something big was coming that was gonna change the way everything worked. I freaked out 6-7 people needlessly, and I felt no regret or remorse for those people. They were and still are my friends, and they had learned to accept that I can become rather crazy at times. I was a violent and borderline scary kid and that continued on into my life. 

Around the same time as my meltdown about everything changing I became absolutely obsessed with death. I become obsessed with murder and the desire to kill, i got it so in my head that i was a sociopath, and a narcissist that there wasnt a doubt in my mind about it. I seeked therapy because I started scaring my mom. I knew how to make the therapist think what I wanted them to, my violent and murderous desires became depression and hatred for my father as far as they knew. My father is a sociopath, no donut about that, anyhow, i went to therapy a few times before i convinced my mom that she didn't like the guy and that i was agreeing. I was manipulative and controlling and I did it well, most people didn't (and still don't) see through it (people are surprisingly easy to control) especially my mother. I mean hell my dad did it for 20 years, she didn't even notice until they separated and i pointed it out to her, my brothers learned too but it took them more time, but i wasn't controlled as easily. 

Now moving on to more recent matters in my life, my insomnia was catching up to me, the headaches and fucked up headspace became hard to handle, when i was 16 i started using marijuana, and it mellowed me out a lot. I felt sane for the first time in my life, like i was fully in control, however this quickly made my angry depression turn into sad hopeless depression. I walked this earth as a shell of depression for 3 straight years. And it was worthless time spent, my love for information and knowledge slowly faded away and I became a pothead. In those 3 years from 2017- now i had only been sober for longer than 3 days 5 times, 3 of which were only for a little over a week, and 2 times when i was 17 for 2 week periods of time. However for the first time since then i've been clean for almost a month, i smoked a little here and there, but what ultimately lead me to quit was my tolerance. For some reason or another starting about a month before i quit every time i smoked i would green out, reach a point of mental chrisis, it could be existential where i could see everything going wrong with my life, or borderline psychosis, i could sit there for hours laughing at my own thoughts, or getting so in my head i literally thought i was mentally retarded. So i quit. 

One month later, and i feel like the same kid i was when i was 14 going crazy and sending people the ramblings of a mad man at 5am. I have started to think maybe i am unhinged, maybe i have more than a few screws in my head lose, but this time i have accepted it, i don't care who or what i lose any longer. I simply am, and i'm no longer going to fight this version of me, i accept me, maybe i'm losing it, or maybe i was never all there, maybe only time can tell",25Jul2020,1
66,"My intuition is powerful, and I always take it for granted until I received direct confirmation. I’m mostly talking about this within the context of romantic or sexual relationships. I always want to make excuses for the other person, and to think that I’m being crazy. It’s funny how I’d rather discount myself than trust myself. 

I had bad feelings about guys who were cheating on me (without direct evidence of the cheating). I’ve had bad feelings about guys I was interested in &amp; who were leading me on; I knew when they got girlfriends even though they were never upfront about it. &amp; I knew when he didn’t like me despite the things he’d say to me (“you’re so special” “I love you” “we have such a connection”). Something in me felt off. Something in me made me think, “should I cut him off?” I should’ve, but never did. I never needed to see anything directly. My intuition knew.

If I asked for relationship advice on reddit, y’all would tell me I’m crazy. I’ve asked for so much advice, but people usually think I am. But it’s hard to describe the little nuances as to why I know something as wrong, why I’m thinking of this as a bigger deal than it seems. I’m really sensitive to these things. Too sensitive. 

&amp; yet, every time I call myself crazy. I tell question myself I seek advice from others perhaps bc I trust the judgement of others more than I trust myself.

I want to learn to trust myself. To stop thinking I’m crazy when I feel something is wrong, even though to an outsider it may seem like I’m overreacting. I want to be able to disengage as soon as I feel that feeling. 

I’m smart in a lot of ways, but a complete idiot when it comes to matters of the heart. Like I’m handicapped in some way. Like the guy is always smarter of better than me at it. Emotions and desire for sex cloud my judgement. But then I realize that there’s always that gut feeling of mine— she’s always on my side and tells me the things I don’t want to hear. I may not listen, but that feeling persists until I’m forced to pay attention to it.. &amp; I realize the sad truth: I was right all along.

I just wish my intuition could kick in earlier, right at the start. I wish she could tell me “this guy is bad news” or “don’t waste your time” before I end up wasting my time, emotions, and affections on someone. But it takes time to feel it.. I don’t know right away, but then I know.",25Jul2020,2

71," After watching this video, I'll be recording the locations I buy tickets. 

Interesting video created in 2017 by Canadian lottery winner, on the difficulty of trying to collect on tickets purchased in Ontario, CA. He had to file a small claims lawsuit, and was threatened with legal action for calling the Police after they took his 2nd ticket from him and cancelled it. They wanted to know ""where"" he bought the ticket. The city name was not good enough. We all buy them at random locations. Not good enough. What if you bought a ticket for someone. They have no idea where it was purchased. He provides solid documentation. It's shocking what OLG tries to do.

94,"5 years ago, I had a chat with mini-me at 5 y/o.

Today, at 30, I’d like to have a coffee session with 15 &amp; 25 y/o(me).

If I had an hour with them, I’d wish to share some of perspectives I’ve gained through the years. It’s not supposed to be a ‘finger-wagging, hands-on-the-hips’ kinda moment, because I really hated being talked down to, regardless of which age I was at. It’s more of reflecting on the many pitfalls faced that was self induced.

To the 15 y/o Bryan:

1.	Aim low: Sounds counter-intuitive. But so far in life, you’ve always tried to strive at the highest possible level, fail spectacularly, and then wander off feeling helpless. Start small and slowly build up. Enjoy small successes and milestones. Every building needs scaffolding. It might not look pretty, it might not look like what you’re after, but it’s essential for growth.

2.	Work Ethic: Somehow through your teens, you’ve convinced yourself that you’re better (whatever that’s supposed to mean) and that you don’t need to put in as much effort as your peers.That’s like thinking you can stroll through the first 5 laps of 2.4KM and that the last lap sprint is get you over the hump. (Pretty much why you sucked at running) This is probably the biggest pitfall that you’ll face moving on. Because whenever you fail, you would always shift your benchmark down to the next peer who’s giving lesser effort, to the point where you are the last man; and always feeling lagged behind and helpless. The funny/ironic thing is that, when you are young, you always tried to put on the facade that you got by through sheer talent and no effort. And yet in your mid 20s, you cringed when someone told you ‘You have some much wasted potential; you could have been so much more’. Focus on consistency, not short burst of intensity. 

3.	Emotions. You used to think that you strive in volatility. You used to think that it’s a ‘trait’ that could be attractive. You’d need to lose a few close friends in life (and extremely close to losing a lot more) to learn this. Not every interaction has to end in extreme emotions. Not every broken relationship can be repaired by an apology.

4.	You will accomplish things that you’d never think you could; because deep down I think you never really did believe you could be someone. Yet even after the achievements, it never really did make you any happier. You just cannot rely on accomplishment (not that there will be a lot) to fill the void of unease in you. Learn to make peace with things.

5.	Stress/Anxiety: The things that make you anxious will never ever go away. Once you are done dealing with a problem, two more new ones pop up out of nowhere. You need to learn how to cope with stress. There’s just so much capacity in you to care before you get consumed, focus on the one’s that are important before you implode.

6.	You’re going to lose some of the closest people in your life. Some of them, at one point, meant the world to you(us). But as time pass, people do get distant (See point no.3). But even if I do get a chance for a do-over, I wouldn’t miss any of them (OK maybe I’ll pass on some of them double-crossing assholes). Stop trying to hold on to a moment that has passed, because even if you tried, the whole world will pass you by.

7.	CALM.THE.FUCK.DOWN. Enjoy the moment :)

To 25 y/o Bryan:

1.	Learn to say NO. You have the right to do so.

2.	Similarly, NO from someone else doesn’t always mean the end of a conversation. Get pass it. Learn to negotiate. 

3.	When something goes wrong, don’t reinvent your whole belief system. Don’t overcorrect. Take some time to understand the situation and make slight adjustments, try again. 

4.	Stand up for yourself. Being weak is not virtuous; being a harmless teddy bear on a shelf is not virtuous. You need to understand the dark side of you; to integrate with it, to make peace with it. Don’t be a people-pleaser (or at least don’t make that your priority). Because sometimes you have to be a lion so you can be the lamb you really are.

5.	Don’t ask for critique/comments from anyone/everyone. Not everyone understands.Not everyone cares. And not everyone is willing to tell you that they don’t have the answers to your question either. And even if someone checks all the boxes above, don’t ask if you are not ready to hear the harshest possible remarks.

6.	There will always be people that doubt you. They will always tell you that you’re just not as talented, and that may be true. There are a lot more people out there that are objectively better than you in every way. But it’s ok. Just push on, ignore the white noise and push on. Self-pity and self-victimization will never get you anywhere. If not, what other alternatives do you have?

7.	CALM.THE.FUCK.DOWN. Enjoy the moment 😊What about me? Life didn’t get easier, but I’m starting to learn how to feel optimistic moving forward. 

Life was become way harder after (25) I left school. The first few years of work life had me convinced that I will never get use to it. But in hindsight, it really taught me that most pain that I felt was only temporary. Even if it IS permanent, there is always the choice to walk away. 

I’m still learning, of course. Still learning how not to succumb to instant gratification; how not to have a knee-jerk reaction to everything that’s happening around me; still learning how to give others assurances while panicking deep inside; how to be patient; how to be forgiving. I’ve also made a lot of mistakes the past 5 years, stupid ones, shameful ones, costly ones and some, ultimately inevitable mistakes. I’ve also regretted not being brave enough, not conscientious enough, not meticulous enough, not appreciative enough (Think you get my point the list goes on). Hopefully I can reconcile with them and share them with you at 35.

Lastly, I’ve been trying to be stronger these days; physically, mentally and emotionally. Because from here on, I need to be the caregiver and no longer the sheltered little kid. In 5 years time, I’m probably gonna be a dad (fingers crossed), and I really hope I would live up to it. Sure hope I can bring him/her to meet yall at 35.

Thank you both for making them memories. When the going gets tough and there isn’t much to look forward, it really helps to reminisce the good days and try to visualize a better one ahead.  I’ll try at my part to make you proud for the next 5 years too.Till then, seeya.",25Jul2020,1

105,"We never lockdown or mask up when flu season arrives even though the average IFR of COVID when you take both T cell and antibody studies into account is around 0.1-0.2% (99.8-99.9% chance of survival). Median age of death for swine flu is 30-40. For COVID it is 85. Which is more tragic, a hundreds of thousands of 85 year olds dying, or hundreds of thousands of 30-40 year olds dying?

Flu kills around a million people each year and that's with vaccines! Yet everyone just calls me a Karen when I tell everyone this, they don't give a crap!

So when flu season comes, I'll wear a mask and possibly medical gloves too. If I see people not wearing a mask or going outside like normal during flu season, I'll call them hypocrites and tell them how many people worldwide have died of the flu.

I will then report them all to the police, and hopefully they can get 30 years life imprisonment for endangering us all!",25Jul2020,1

I have played far too much video games, and I always thought I was the hero, and yet even I might still believe it, because I am so desperate to catch up on all that lost time, my inexistent youth. 

People tell me I'm like a child, and I see them as themselves children, I can't even pretend to do otherwise as Lying is another thing I suck at.

Worst than that, I've been posting around on the internet my vitriol and crazy theories I didn't bother to check deeply, because I was desperate to create this story of the lost genius. We both know it doesn't hold and I'm full of shit. This is just the way it is.

I look around and see teenagers who speak twice as good as me, because my brain is fucked up from all the drugs I've taken. Now I'm clean, but it's taking years it seems to get back to baseline.

What can I say? I can't even read replies to what I post because it's always been negative.

She is in the healthy range for a dog of her breed but from the way my brother feeds her, i can see her weight becoming more of an issue. My younger brother (m14) insists on feeding her treats constantly and not always dog treats, sometimes human biscuits aswell. He feeds her way more than necessary, for example yesterday within 40 minutes he had fed her 3 chicken bone treats and can feed her up to 7 or 8 times during an average day. Even more alarmingly, a few weeks ago he was trying to feed her a haribo even though she clearly didn’t want it, he just laughed and tried to put it in her mouth anyway. He’s terrible at handling her, always picking her up in uncomfortable ways so her back is hunched forward and disrupting her when she’s sleeping. Whenever i (f17) or my older brother (m20) try to confront him about this he becomes aggressive and intimidating as he is physically larger and stronger than me (i’m 5”2 and he’s 5”5 and fairly overweight) and talks over and shushes me (basically being an all around arrogant and condescending asshole). Whenever i try to bring this up to my mom and dad they excuse his behaviour by saying that he’s an immature 14 year old and it’s something he’ll grow out of. They excuse his arrogant and condescending behaviour aswell saying that it’s something he’s developed over being away from school and that he’ll grow out of it too (even though he has always been like this but it is ignored because he is the baby of family). My older brother and I are doing everything we can to make sure my dog doesn’t become obese by taking her out on walks daily for as long as we can and not giving her treats throughout the day to compensate for how many my younger brother will give her.

119,"I’m just out here crying after a game of Valorant where I was reported for sabotaging the team. What makes me the most sad is that I’ve never excelled at any sport or team game. I am a drag for the team I play with. For a long time, I practiced track and field because it’s something I could do by myself. 

Meet the 4x100 meter relay, where I competed because we needed one more player and horribly lost. My friends went on to the nationals and I was placing last on a state level. We trained basically the same amount of time. I was decent at first, and I stopped improving. My friend whom I trained with got injured and we quit after 3 years of middle school and 1 year of high school.

In my high school we had a sort of “house competition” where they would split the students into four groups and have them compete in a variety of events. The last two years I didn’t participate in any event. I do well at school, so I am the team captain, however, that I still couldn’t participate. Even as a senior (at the beginning of the year) I was being left out. Only event I entered was Mario Kart. 

I am good some things like engineering and film making, where I’ve actually placed high in competitions, but I do believe it’s not because of talent, but effort.

I have stopped playing with them altogether. Even on the card game, Magic The Gathering, I always loose. Even when I have custom-made decks meant to be powerful, it’s me who makes the mistakes.

the last time i saw my papa was july 4. i saw him when he drove away from the house after spending the day there. i was at a friends house, i didnt spend the day with him, and i regret that forever. a few days later, my mom tells me that papa has covid but he isnt in the hospital and is just really sick. then the next few days were a whirlwind. he was in the hospital, then discharged, then brought back and admitted, then was moved to the icu, and was on a ventilator. this morning, his organs failed. 

my papa is gone. he was the most amazing person i ever knew. he opened and managed a huge homeless shelter that homed thousands of people who were in a bad place. he fostered kids that had bad home lives. he was such a big ball of love, and hope, and positivity. he was the head of the family. 

no one expected this. we knew he was sick, and struggling, and on a ventilator, but we didn’t think in a million years his organs would fail. he survived cancer, he served his country, and some fucking virus snuffed out his light.

129,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it.

131,"Hey everyone,
 I have been having a really rough time. My life went to hell this past year. I understand there are people struggling with a lot more than me and I really sympathize for them. I’m trying to not completely neglect or devalue my issues.

 Start off the year I lost my grandmother who I was really close to. My family is very separated and we all don’t talk. My grandmother was the only one who was there for me and always built me up when I was down. It was my first close family loss and It really has messed with me. 

 I was with this girl (let’s call her Jane) for five years. I wanted to marry Jane. I was dead set she was the one. There were issues with the relationship that were preventing me from being able to propose to her(she was married to her husband that she left two years prior to us dating and never got a divorce). I began to resent her after my grandmother passed. I wanted nothing more than to have my grandmother be there when I got married. I wanted to have a family and she kept making excuses on why we can’t.

 Things went downhill in the relationship that made me no longer feel wanted, no longer feel like I was worth the effort. We were not intimate. We didn’t fight because I was very non confrontational so it wasn’t like we were at each other’s throats. At one point I started talking to a girl. I hid it from Jane. We talked for a while and it felt great to be wanted again. Someone who seemed like they wanted to be around me. We flirted for a while. One night the girl and I sexted after Jane fell asleep. The girl said she wanted to meet me after we exchanged some photos. One of them was of Jane and I. The girl was interested in having a threesome with us. The next morning I woke up feeling terrible and didn’t know how to tell Jane. I knew I took it to far and felt horrible. I never met up with the girl and tried to forget about it happening. I tried to realign myself and be the person I wanted to be for her in hope that she would want to finally take those next steps with me. 

 A month later and into the Lockdown life Jane found some questionable stuff I posted online and wanted to see my phone. She found the messages. Needless to say she shut down and hates me more than anything now. We broke up.

 I felt horrible, I still do. She has erased me out of her life and threatened to get a restraining order if I tried to reach out to her. I’m not a violent person. I’ve never yelled at her or tried to hurt her.

 Since then I’ve tried to move on, tried to go out and enjoy things in life. But I’ve lost a lot of desire to enjoy anything. Things that once brought me so much joy no longer do. I feel helpless, I feel lost, I feel angry, and I don’t feel like the punishment fit the crime. I get I emotionally cheated on her but I never physically did anything with another person. I’ve began drinking more trying to sleep and escape this new reality. Every night I dream of her. I wake up angry and upset. My self confidence is gone, my self esteem is gone, I really hate myself because the things I did were not who I always envisioned myself even having the desire to do. 

 I am renting a place now. I still have my job that I’m grateful for with everything going on in the world and I really do sympathize for those who are struggling financially, lost your jobs and or houses. 

 I’m trying to find myself again, or try to get out of this rut. I heard a saying once that the only difference between a rut and a grave are the dimensions. If anyone can give me words of wisdom or help to get out I’d greatly appreciate it.",25Jul2020,1
132,"**TL;DR**: Passion is a dumb concept. 

Posting this mostly for myself.

We define passion here as: An activity or goal that serves as an individual's primary source of fulfillment in life.

We make two assumptions.

1. Passion exists
2. Everyone has at least one passion

If both of these are true then it makes sense for someone to look for their passion as early as possible so they can spend the maximum amount of time enjoying their life. However, what activities or goals can someone be passionate about? Some common passions are art, music, and helping others but are these the only possible passions? Can \*anything\* be a passion, or are there certain restrictions?

Let's look at two cases.

Case 1: Only certain things can be passions

If this was true then all one would need to to is look at the master list of passions and see which one resonates with you. However, where is this master list? Who decides what gets to be on it? It simply doesn't make sense.

Case 2: Anything can be a passion

This is the more interesting case. If anything can be a passion then it leads one to believe that some people will have mundane, obscure or socially unacceptable passions. What if someone has a passion for stealing? Petty theft, embezzlement, whatever, they love to steal. If they follow their passion then it leads to imprisonment. What if someone has a passion for writing with their feet? It's so obscure that they might live their entire life thinking they don't have a passion but they simply haven't discovered it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate that the narrative of following your passion simply doesn't hold up under any type of scrutiny. There are more issues with it than what I've posted here but they have been covered elsewhere.",25Jul2020,1
133,"So long story short my dad wanted me to go to the beach with my aunt and so I said fine. He said we had to leave like at 12 or 1, but today my sister wakes me up at 10ish and says we have to leave to the beach now. I normally wake up around 12, so I was just so tired.

My sister told my dad I didn’t want to go it’s too early and my dad comes to my room starts pushes me while I’m sleeping, yelling a whole bunch of shit like at the top of his lungs (practically screaming), he starts throwing shit at me, I don’t even understand what’s happening, and then he snatches my phone and starts running off with it so I caught up to me and he starts pushing me and so I pushed him back, but then he just gave me my phone back.


And like as I type this out I don’t understand like when he’s in a bad mood or something he just goes off, and the history of my relationship with my dad has never been good.

Anyways, I’m not close with him, this kind of shit has happened before, and I’m 20 years old and over I’d say the last 2 years I’ve been really working on my childhood trauma and shit. This kind of triggered all these past feelings, and I felt like a flood of old emotions and I just hate it. I started to just revert back to old habits and I felt so helpless and angry that I’ve had to deal with this on so many levels throughout my life and I’m still working though the after effects of how my dad treats me.

And I can go on and on about how this shit is fucked and the dumb bullshit I have to deal with, but I hate how I just feel helpless and angry, and like it brought me back to my childhood, and made me realize like all the fucked up habits (self esteem issues, anxiety, etc) relate to these experiences, and is just overall sad how much my dads actions affect me negatively.

And the worst part is he went from screaming and threatening hell, to wanting to play wrestle and wanting to go get a smoothie. Like he thinks I’m just some dumb little kid and at least I have the fact that I can see through his bullshit. It’s just at its core manipulative and it’s some good cop, bad cop shit that when I was younger would fall for. 

I also smoked a bunch of weed after this happened just bc I just wanted to numb these feelings and not focus on them. It happened today and I’m just at the beach high af with my family members taking to me and shit.

And my dad just switches everything up and he’s trying to crack jokes with the family and act all high and mighty now. I’m 20 yrs old and just feel diminished to like a 14 year old again.",25Jul2020,1

Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes.

He then went on to claim that the swine flu from 2009 killed millions of people and that our government didn’t do anything. As he left he said “don’t believe the media”. 

You have no idea how much I wanted to correct every single thing he was saying but I couldn’t. I can’t believe these people actually exist. I always hoped it was exaggerated but no. It’s entirely on point.",25Jul2020,1

I don't want this to be a positive spin on things. I just think this describes the world in its current state best.

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I’m very shy and quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’
Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again and she filled out the application form for me for it and I didn’t ask",25Jul2020,1
142,"Okay so I’m a woman and 23 years old I love to wear dresses and go shopping and all of those cliches.

However 👀

I was on my way home from grocery shopping earlier today and realized that maybe I’M too masculine to find a masculine man. I figured that maybe I’ve always felt like life is more easygoing and predictable without a man? (no hate to men btw y’all are great☺️). I concluded that my experience with men is, I’ve always had to “man up” for them in some aspects and it’s a big turn off for me because I do prefer my feminine side a lot more. 

I took a long test on a dating site a few hours ago so it could find my perfect match and it says I’m more masculine than my matches... and I had 85!!!! YA’LL this is a hot mess and I need advice ASAP!

Disclaimer!:
When I say masculine it has nothing to do with knowing about sports, or me drinking beer (I can’t stand beer) and i can’t name most of the car brands I see. It’s more that I take a lot of charge? And if the guy is slacking in for example planning a nice date then I’ll do it for him😬

My question is:

How do I turn my masculinity all the way down? How do I become more submissive and less dominant. How do I lean more into my feminine side? My true feminine side has only appeared with two men... but they were waaaay too assertive lol...",25Jul2020,1
