8,"Hello. I am seeking aid for a number of personal projects and magical workings. These may be different people, so if any of the following apply to you, I'd love to hear from anyone remotely interested or qualified.

Firstly I need help crafting occult erotic literature that will serve as sex magic spells. I can provide much of what is needed, characters plots, settings and themes etc. This is all based on my real occult life as a dom, so I have tons of detail, as the characters are based in reality. Yes, I fuck magical creatures and witches. Yes, I mean that, yes REALLY. So if you are an occult erotic fiction writer already for fun and profit, I have tons of material for you.

I am also seeking an ideal partner for deepening experiments with sex magic. Again, yes REALLY. The ideal woman.is highly spiritual and unashamed to enjoy sex. If you are a witch who happens to be into kink, I would like help codifying my style of domination into a complete magical system. Ideally I'd like my soulmate for this, but she won't mind someone keeping me busy and happy until she gets here.

Thanks for reading,

When I'm at school I work in the costume shop in the theatre department. The woman who runs the costume shop usually brings her dogs in. Today she was dogsitting so she brought that dog to the shop. He's a little white poodle named Hank.

At one point a group of people went across the hall to the dressing room and left the door open behind them. Hank followed.

A short while later someone asks where Hank is. I say he went into the dressing room. Dressing room gets rechecked. Hank is no longer there. Time to go on an adventure to find the little escape artist

I don't have to look for long. At the end of the hallway I can see him running around in a classroom. Students are getting in pets as he trots by them. I try beckoning him from the door so that I don't disturb the class. Hank will get very close then run away again.

I bite the bullet and enter the classroom, chasing this dog around as he does his best to enjoy his last few moments of exploration. The professor has not acknowledged me this entire time and has just continued on with his lecture.

Finally one student manages to get a hold of Hank's collar so that I can catch up to him. I pick him up and take the naughty boy back to the costume shop. He is instantly forgiven because he's just too cute.",11Sep2020,1

18,"I recently have started to suspect that I am a toxic person. But I am not sure so I would want to share it with you.

I notice it only through the relationships I've had. No matter how nice the current gf/all the exes is/were to me, I am always doubting her and whatever she is saying. I am very jealous, I need constant attention and whenever I don't get it, I have this feeling where I feel like I am being played or cheated.

 I have a habit of constantly checking the snapscores/snap maps if she isn't replying. And when I see that ""oh okay, she is online but hasn't answered for 15 minutes"" I can't help but think that she is probably texting with another guy or whatever. 

I don't know where is this coming from, but I always doubt everything and for some reason automatically think the worst. I've been lied to before, so maybe that is the reason, but idk.

 It seems so toxic, and I wish I could just ""chill"". Any advice? Am I a toxic person after all? Or maybe it is just the trust issues? I just got into LDR now, and the girl is nothing but nice to me and she really became attached. I don't want to ruin it, so I don't even bother bringing that up.

My boyfriend of 4 years and I are vehemently childfree. We are not in a financial or mental position to have children atm, and we have agreed we probably never will be (at least not mentally).

I am on BC, and have almost never missed a pill. I am usually VERY careful, but due to a ton of stress right now (working 3 jobs, moving house, COVID, etc etc), I missed a day and the morning of The Incident.
Needless to say, things got a bit carried away in bed one morning, and myself and my normally very careful boyfriend did not use extra protection.
This was 2 weeks ago, and since, I’ve had multiple instances of hot flashes, dizziness and fatigue, plus unrelenting nausea - and just today awful cramping and what I can only assume is the initial bleeding from implantation. I’ve never had my period early on BC but I’m not due for another 4 days, plus this was very light. 
So, alas the theory: pregnant. However, it is still too early to test, so now I get to spend the next 1-2 weeks in my own head freaking out about how to proceed. Do I tell my boyfriend? Do I wait until I know for sure as to not freak him out? 
Sorry for the TMI, Reddit. I have no one to talk to about this, because I am already sure that I want to terminate this pregnancy, if it is indeed one. None of my family or friends would understand my decisions, so I don’t know where to turn.

Of all animals, small rodents such as mice and hamsters are the most vulnerable to abuse, by far. Mice, rats, and hamsters are cheap, mass bred, replaceable, easy to obtain, defenseless, small, and have no purchase restrictions.

Anyone with 6 bucks can go in a Petco, say they need a live feeder mouse for their pet snake (existent or nonexistent) and get a live mouse in their possession with no questions asked. All that Petco stores do is require customers to fill out a paper form which is filed away under the cash register. There's no reason for this, except virtue signalling. Employees don't even check the files before selling to a customer. There's no electronic database to restrict sales across stores; someone who got banned from one store could just make a longer drive to another.

Its very possible that there are people out there with sick hobbies of killing mice for fun. All they have to do is say they have a pet snake, and they can buy as many live mice as they want. There are several news articles about sickos who bought a live rodent from a petco or petsmart, then tortured it to death on camera. This is just the tip of the iceberg, most people who do this wont post it online to get busted.

Petco stores will sell a hamster for 18 bucks to someone who admitted to accidentally killing their previous hamster by forgetting to feed it. This has been tested with undercover phone calls. Employees are not allowed to refuse sale. Managers will side with the customer because profits are important to corporate. Theoretically they would be happy to sell a new hamster every week to someone who repeatedly kills them, accidentally or ""accidentally"".

Theres obviously a huge vulnerability in the animal trade, so why does no one talk about this? The internet has very little discussion on small rodent abuse.",11Sep2020,1

There are plenty of things someone can value about themself aside from looks. I would never tell someone that I don’t think they’re attractive, but I only compliment people on their appearance when I genuinely mean it.

I also understand that attractiveness is largely subjective, but not entirely. Some people would just be considered attractive by a majority of people and some wouldn’t. It seems like telling someone they’re pretty if they aren’t always falls into the category of white lies, but I’m wondering if it should, because it just propagates the societal norm of telling everyone that they’re beautiful which is true for some, and not for others. I know I’m not an incredibly attractive person, and I’m at peace with that fact, but I just feel bad when other people my age (I’m 19), especially girls, constantly ask if they’re pretty and are told that they are.

I drove home after having dinner with her and parked my car in our garage, with our daughter in it and stayed there, engine running, and thought why not just end it here. I got out after a few seconds, no one was hurt but I told only my therapist the next day. The therapist had me hospitalized. They told my wife I tried to kill myself and my daughter. Once I was able to talk with my wife, she asked for space but I didn't give it to her. She couldn't process things and well here we are. She tried multiple times to make it work but apparently. It was too late. I'm hurt. Lonely. Scared. Angry. So angry. I feel awful. I want to be the better man and let the ex stay with the house. I want to do right by my daughter. But I'm so angry.

61,"
So I am absolutely terrified of the experience that I just had. To start off I wanna say that I had one seizure apparently before that I don’t remember except having to answer questions to paramedics at the house. In the end I just assumed this may have been because I had upped my medication maybe too fast and that’s what happens. This last one was completely insane.

I remember I was having a dream and then I woke up but was trying to stay asleep so I kept my eyes shut. During that time I got crazy paranoid about how the government was trying to get me because they had found out that I have learned a deeper meaning to life or some thing like that. Because of that intrusive thought I told myself to get out of bed and when I opened my eyes the whole room was moving. After that I started to freak out and wanted to go to my roommates room but as I was getting out of bed I noticed that I couldn’t stop rocking and my head would not stop shaking from left to right. Then walking to my roommates room my legs basically gave out but also we’re just Rocking back-and-forth along with the rest of my body. I sat down on his floor and try to explain to him that I was losing touch with reality as if I was on some REALLY BAD ACID TRIP. Everywhere I was looking was just moving completely and then I started freaking out even more and told my roommate to call 911. I then Crawled to find a Piece of paper and a pen to write down any medication that I was on in case I would somehow forget or just be unconscious and needed somebody to tell them. The weird thing about this all was that I felt like I was completely coherent and was able to explain what was going on but just acting really weird.

After that I guess I fell to the floor and started Staring at my roommate in a blank stare and convulsing almost slowly but very abrupt. I don’t remember that part at all but I do remember looking up at him and hearing the phone operator say that they were on their way with an ambulance. The next thing I remember is having the paramedic ask what year it was and I said 2018 (it’s 2020...). After that the paramedics try to walk me down the hallway and my legs were doing the thing where I was shaking and I was throwing up. Then when we got in the ambulance and they were taking me to the hospital I don’t remember even showing up, I just remember being on a gurney in the hallway of the hospital.
The hospital kind of sucks right now and my doctor kind of blew But he just Blamed it on me having a bad dream? Which literally makes no sense to me. My primary care doctor was worried and is sending me to a neurologist but is that what happened really? I don’t know how much of myself that I can trust. I know for sure but I woke up at the hospital with my lip swollen and bloody and my knees partially dislocated.

The crazy thing is I take Lamictal/Lamaj switching which is literally made to help people with epilepsy as well as bipolar disorder, even though I never took it for the Epilepsy.

I have been trying to find somebody with a similar situation and with maybe some psychosis before they start or hallucinations like mine but I can’t find any.

I can wholeheartedly honestly say that that was the single most terrifying moment of my life, because I felt like I was losing my mind and that my heart was God flow out of my chest. I was just like some kind of input or any kind of example that similar to mine because I think that would make me feel a lot better.

Also to add when I got let out of the hospital I still had the feeling that I couldn’t control my legs and then I threw up in the car home, and a couple times afterwards.",11Sep2020,1

Then two days after she told me it wasnt meant to be. Everything was going welk and all of the sudden she stopped that. Just a few days before my sister came back. Sister told me that girl might fear that she will lose her as a friend. And told me there was simillar situation before.

70,"2020, for me at least, has been a much better year than last year. I would say I'm actually at my highest point I've ever been in a long time. However, I realise I still have underlying issues about my confidence, even though I'm the most confident I've ever been.


Back in high school, I was bullied for a year and a half. Then when I reached college, I was largely ignored by my peers and although I did have a few friends in other classes (but not many), I spent most of my time alone. And of course, there was a girl I was pining for. I spent a month or so working up the courage to ask her out, which I eventually did, but she said no. I finished both high school and college on low notes and I left home pretty jaded after that.


Then I joined university and bam, I now have more friends than I have back home. But I can't help feeling that this is really the highest I'll go and eventually I'm gonna go back to being the runt of the litter. I'm basically trying to really milk this cow till it's dead right now because I have very strong feelings that its only downhill from here. I've spent so much of my life being below somebody else, that now I'm becoming a bit obsessive about reaching the top, and staying there. I don't want my spotlight stolen by somebody else, and I don't ever, EVER want to go back to being who I was, which I fear that one day I eventually will.",11Sep2020,1

Love is love irrespective of the attractiveness level of the people.

I’d like to know the versions of myself I put out so I can try and put out the version I love more and reduce the versions I dislike from showing. The main issue is I think I have anxiety but I have amazing coping skills for it in most situations outside of relationships. I don’t have a lot of experience in relationships but felt like I loved the version of myself when I finally put myself out there to begin one. My mistake was I was too judge mental and made one small aspect of my SO that I didn’t want to escalate into a mountain (she liked to get drunk with friends every weekend and I feel like I could have accepted her habit and not been as pushy) so I don’t want to make my next SO feel judged/like they have to hide their activities from me.

77,"OK, yes, I do get cold easily. But still, we should be getting highs at least in the 80's at this time of the year. It's the damn smoke, it's blotting out the sun so badly we're experiencing a mini nuclear winter. Yesterday the temp dropped 15 degrees over about 2 hours as a direct result of the smoke getting thicker.

If you haven't already guessed, I live in Oregon. I'm just north of the Clackamas/Multnomah border, and the worst of those fires has been heading directly toward me since it started. I assumed living in the city would keep me safe, but I'm not so sure anymore. They're already talking about evacuating some larger towns that are only a few miles away from me. Concrete helps slow it down, but Portland also has more green spaces and parks than most other cities. Shit, I live at the base of a wildlife preserve.

I've started venting about this at least 5 times, but I always end up deleting it because I know there's a lot of other people out there that have been affected by it way more than I have. But I can't hold this in anymore.

I've already been through this before. I know how unpredictable fires can be, and I know how hard it is to stop them. Every time I look out the window or go outside the dense haze and orange ambient light turns me into a terrified 4-year-old again. I don't care if they're not implementing evacuation orders, I'm gonna get ready to run. The last time I went through this my family waited until we were told to leave and we almost didn't make it out. Plus I don't know how much more of this smoke I can take, I have lung and heart issues.

I'm sure everyone is getting sick of hearing about the fires so I'll understand if no one responds to this. I just needed to get it off my chest.

80,"So it’s a brown recluse spider, they’re fairly common where I live, but this one was massive compared to others I’ve seen. I captured it and made a terrarium in a large jar for it to live in. I added some clovers and wood chips and dirt to make it feel like a natural habitat and the spider seems quite taken with it. There is silk everywhere and I know of at least one place it likes to hide. However, there is also one place where I find it sitting consistently when I remove the covering of the jar.(to keep it dark for the spider) 

It is almost always on the same wood chip just hanging out. Spiders have preferences, so there must be some form of complex thought going on for the spider. 

The conclusion I came to is that insects and arachnids and bugs in general all probably have complex thoughts, just not the developed memories to do anything with them. They probably experience fear, anger, and joy at the very least, but I’m not a scientist. Just a dude with a spider.",11Sep2020,1

**#JusticeForDrew**

[48 minutes of bodycam footage.](https://youtu.be/PfDvbTDVpNU) The tazing starts at 28 minutes and goes to 42 minutes. Very NSFL

The city had to be subpoenaed twice before they released this video. Two of the officers involved, Steve Schroeder (Jackson County Chief Deputy) and Brendan Zeimet (Maquoketa Assistant Police Chief), were up for election as Jackson County Sheriff this year. Steve Schroeder is still on the ballot. We're fucked.

Mike Owen is his killer.

https://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Report-Expert-says-officer-improperly-deployed-Taser-on-Maquoketa-man--569670031.html

&gt;• Owen and Schroeder arrested Edwards without first conducting a proper investigation to determine if probable cause existed for the arrest. At the time of the arrest, they had not yet inspected the apartment the assault happened in, had not yet obtained a written statement, had not yet obtained a coherent description of what happened, and had not yet determined with any certainty who was the victim and who was the aggressor.

&gt;• Owen and Schroeder decided to arrest Edwards for a minor offense when their training, experience, and department policy demanded that they either issue a non-custodial citation and remove Edwards from the premises or remove Edwards from the premises and later seek a misdemeanor arrest warrant once a proper investigation was completed.

&gt;• Owen improperly deployed his Taser at a time when Edwards was calm, only passively resisting, and threatening no one.

&gt;• Owen’s nearly continuous use of the Taser for 55 seconds (eight trigger pulls) violated every set of standards guiding the law enforcement community’s use of CEWs (conducted electrical weapons) and was thus reckless and excessive under the circumstances.

&gt;• Owen improperly applied his weight to Edwards’ head and neck to restrain him and then maintained that pressure for over 12 minutes, letting up only after Edwards had become unresponsive and was noticeably aspirating.

&gt;• Owen, Schroeder, and Zeimet all played a role in the restraint of Edwards, and all failed to follow their training and correct procedure by providing first aid as soon as possible once it became obvious that Edwards was in distress, Harmening wrote in his report.""

https://www.wqad.com/article/news/family-sues-police-for-wrongful-death-after-man-dies-in-police-custody/526-49d35bc9-de71-4fb9-9eff-f49f382483fb

&gt;""You can see in the video, he's not a risk to anybody,"" Attorney representing Drew Edwards' family, Dave O'Brien said. ""He's not threatening anybody, he's just going to walk away. Let him go home. Let him cool down, you can go back later and arrest him. He's not a threat to anyone. He never kicks them, never punches them, never hits them. Never does anything except try to get away from them.""

&gt;O'Brien filed a civil suit against the city of Maquoketa, Jackson County and three law officers in October. It names Maquoketa Assistant Police Chief Brendan Zeimet and Jackson County Chief Deputy Sheriff Steve Schroeder as defendants. O'Brien later says he amended the suit, adding Mike Owen as a defendant. O'Brien says he was not told the name of Owen until after he received the body cam footage.

&gt;The city of Maquoketa, Jackson County, Maquoketa Police, and the Jackson County Sheriff's Department declined to comment on the lawsuit to News 8 on January 24th, 2020.

https://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Body-camera-footage-released-in-death-of-Maquoketa-man-567282881.html

&gt;The suit alleges the officers knew about his prior hospitalizations and that Zeimet was involved in the two previous incidents.

&gt;“Despite the knowledge of Edwards’ heart condition, Defendant Owen repeatedly tased Edwards using both sets of taser prongs of a double-barrel taser capable of firing two separate set of prongs connected by wire to the taser and allowing two separate sources of electric shock,” the lawsuit states.

&gt;In the video, Owen and Schroeder repeatedly tell Edwards that he is under arrest. He told them, “Why would I go to jail if I didn’t do nothing.”

&gt;Owen then took out his Taser and ordered Edwards multiple times to get on the ground, before deploying his Taser, the video shows.

&gt;Schroeder and Owen had ""no reason to believe"" that Edwards was a threat to them or anyone else at the time they attempted to place him under arrest and no other officers present said Edwards ever hit, kicked, punched or threatened them in any way, according to the suit.

&gt;Zeimet went “hands-on” and assisted in restraining and handcuffing Edwards when he arrived on the scene, according to the lawsuit.

&gt;“None of Edwards conduct justifies the use of deadly force inflicted upon him in response,” according to the lawsuit. 

https://www.maqnews.com/news/local/justice-for-drew/article\_f2e7ed6e-aff5-11ea-9087-87829e1e9daf.html

&gt;Dr.  Bradley Randall with Dakota Forensic Consulting, who is an expert  witness for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit said the way Edwards was  restrained likely caused his death. Randall said that the way in which  Edwards was being restrained face-down on the ground by officers for  about 12 minutes caused asphyxiation.

&gt;While  he noted that methamphetamine intoxication and multiple Taser shocks  were contributing factors “… it is my opinion that had Mr. Edwards not  been restrained as he was he would not have died when and where he did.  It is my further opinion that had the law enforcement officers  terminated the restraint, with Mr. Edwards being placed either supine or  on his side, at any point prior to his becoming unresponsive, he most  likely would have lived.”

&gt;The city, county and other defendants have declined to comment on the case citing the pending lawsuit.  

&gt;Edwards’  sister and niece, Brenda Hayward and Janie Fitzpatrick, were at the  demonstration and said the family did not receive any acknowledgment  from law enforcement after Edwards died. 

&gt;“We were hoping to get some kind of condolences, some kind of apology,” Fitzpatrick said. 

Quotes from the video:

Drew Edwards:

&gt;“Why would I go to jail if I didn’t do nothing.”

&gt;Being tazed- ""Shower, shower!!""

Mike Owen and Steve Schroeder:

&gt;""46:25 - Body cam officer: I must have been way too high on him.

&gt;Second officer responds: Remember you're live (and points towards himself where his partner's camera is located)""

Brendan Zeimet and Drew Edwards:

&gt;""just remember you are still alive""

&gt;""yea""

Mike Owen:

&gt;""This is probably an excited delirium thing.""

&gt;""Drew, you're pissing me off."" 

&gt;""You can taze the fuck 100 times and he won't go down.""

&gt;""I'm tired of dealing with you.""

&gt;""He's still alive, we're good.""

Steve Schroeder:

&gt;""He's gonna taze you anyway so you better do it.""

At 40:19 you can hear all three officer-overseers laughing at Drew's struggle.

Even worse, the man in the video who called the police is the victim's  brother. You can hear how the officer-overseer keeps trying to push him to press charges but he just pleads with the officer-overseer to take Drew to their parent's house. I protested and met them. THAT would have been the place to take him. Not a jail cell he'd clearly been in and was suffering PTSD from. I wonder too what made him so afraid to even go to that jail for a few hours.

So my last resort is finding someone as screwed up and desperate as me and never let go... maybe because we’d both be afraid of being alone again, but that’s okay, maybe it’d just strengthen the relationship.

Many people pay a lot of attention to wear mask only in the mandatory areas like buses and grocery stores but I dont care at all. Which leads to some weird situations like me walking in an empty street with a mask on. People dont understand this and they bully me. Shouting out of their cars stuff like ""Can you even breathe motherfucker?"" or ""Watchout! The corona is coming!"". which is kinda rude.",11Sep2020,1
91,"I'll be quick because I don't like long posts :

My grand mother died a few days ago. Of course a lot of my family was really sad and the whole mood got really dark.

For context I live alone for now for my studies, in another city. My grandmother and I were never really close except maybe when I was a kid but I drifted away for various reasons.

The night I got the news, I of course cried but only twice and both times were only for something like 5 minutes. After crying for a few minutes I just stopped and felt all right. Even the next few days, I didn't really feel anything other than sometimes a feeling of missing something (kind of hurting). A few days passed and then everything was back to normal.

The other members of my family are all acting sad and trying not to think too much about it apparently.

The worst part would be that I don't even know if I cried because of sadness of because of the combination of sadness and the stressful situation I am in at the moment as a student.

So I'm wondering if I'm a psychopath or just normal for not feeling much after a few days.

Sorry for the messy english, it's not my mother tongue.",11Sep2020,1
93,"I (F21) wasn’t raised around children, so I have no idea why they are drawn to me. Can anyone explain?

Some examples: 
Yesterday I was in line at the grocery store and the baby in the cart ahead of us was staring and smiling at me. 
A few days ago a toddler was in a shopping cart being rolled into the store ahead of us. It leaned around it’s mom to smile and stare at me, then turned almost completely around to watch where I went in the store. 
Other toddlers have waved and babbled at me until I acknowledge them, but ignore the other women in the same shopping aisle. 
At work, some toddlers will run up to me and show me toys or ask me questions about what I’m doing. 
When I’m in a group of people, a baby will lock it’s focus on me even if other people are interacting with it. 

I don’t usually interact with babies/children in public because I don’t know how since I wasn’t raised around any. If a child waves or smiles, I’ll wave back or smile back because I’m not a monster. But I don’t interact with them first. Yet they always lock focus on me even when others are around me or when someone else is interacting with them. 

Why do babies/toddlers find me so captivating/approachable when I don’t interact with or acknowledge them first?",11Sep2020,1

I know it's for the best because she had zero quality of life left. Couldn't even go to the toilet by herself. She was such a proud, intelligent and private woman. She was the cleverest person I knew, and was a wonderful and caring person. We had our differences but didn't stop us from being the best of friends. I spoke to her every day, and more towards the end. She was a doctor and helped so many people.

I just hope my dad is going to be OK. They met at uni/work and had been married 34 years this year. She was only 60.

One thing I want to say to everyone is don't take your family for granted. That trip you want to go on? Do it ASAP. Those questions you wanted answering? Ask them. Ask your loved ones how they met. Ask about your childhood. Tell them you love them and look after each other. There is another post on here about OP's mum always being there for them. My mum was like that.

In a nutshell I've suffered with on off depression since being about 9 due to a family members abuse.
I grew up being extroverted and still am. I am fun and very positive and always have been, however depression has caught me badly many times. My dad killed himself 6 years ago and that caused me huge pain, I went through hell mentally, but four and a half years ago I met someone who is the best thing that ever happened to me. He's older than me but we fell in love. Lived in different countries but made it work, I got pregnant and we were so happy then lost the baby. We got through this with love and support respectively. Finally we moved in together in February of this year after years of planning and navigating red tape.
I have never felt happier or more whole. We are truly in love.
Then the pandemic hit. We both lost work due to the virus. I returned to the uk in June to oversee the rental of my house to help us financially. I rented it out. Had an exemption (after an incredibly stressful four rejections) and flight back booked for a week and a half a go. Flight cancelled. Now can't get another until end of October and I'm in constant anxiety incase that is cancelled, then the next and the next. 
I can't cope. I have no fixed abode. I can't feel secure in knowing I'll be back with my partner. I'm having self harm thoughts again.
I'm paranoid. I cry all the time. I can't sleep and what little I get I keep having paralysis which if anyone has had, is terrifying. I do try and speak about this with my family who are loving and supportive. I hate who I am right now which rationally, I know doesn't help at all. And it's ridiculous. I don't even know why I'm posting I suppose or anything. I'll probably delete it soon. I feel fucking selfish too because of all the people in worse positions than me. I don't know what to do I feel hopeless",11Sep2020,1

I have eczema. When I was younger I stayed over at my grannies for a sleepover. As I was lying in bed, was scratching away at one spot on my arm that was very itchy. 

Using the light from the hall, I could see I done quite a bit of damage. I also saw something was sticking out from the scratch (it was like a hole in my arm). It looked like a tube or a thick string but it was covered in blood so I couldn't tell. All I knew was that I didn't like it. Because I was young and stupid i clipped it off with my quite sharp nails. Like if it was nailclippers, I just snipped. 

I felt a weird sensation shoot up my arm and pain but the pain was to be expected. I then waited until the blood stopped and went to sleep. 

I kinda just wanted to tell someone this but also what the hell did I snip from my arm?",11Sep2020,1

101,"I'm going to share just one of the many experiences as a child I had with spanking.

It was late at night. My dad had to go to work in the morning, and we weren't supposed to talk, but my sister and I were whispering to each other. Suddenly, the door bangs open and we're being dragged out of bed by our arms. My dad bends me over his knees and starts hitting my legs hard, I want to scream but decide to be silent and ""zone out"" - this is what started my dissociation. ""If I show anything negative, he wins."" Next, he does it to my sister. I'm watching, still zoned out, she's screaming and crying and trying to cover herself, he hits harder. He tells her she should be in a ""home"" - as in, a home for ""bad kids"". We're about 4 and 6 years old. We go to bed crying, and still whispering about how much we hate him, now.

This was a regular thing. Once I was pulled out of the bathtub naked to be hit, because I ""wasn't supposed to take a bath today"". I was hit - again, naked - once, because while I was changing with my sister, I guess we got into a fight and I smacked her arm. So I'm not allowed to hit, but my parents are?

Maybe I view this as abusive because I grew up in an otherwise abusive home - my mom was constantly screaming at us that she was going to kill herself and how she would do it, and then run out the door and disappear for a while. She would have flashbacks and not know who we were and tell us that she wasn't going to let us hurt her. I remember my siblings hiding the knives in the house, because at their young age, that's all they knew someone could use to kill themselves. My dad would scream at us, drag us around, lock us in dark rooms for hours, threaten to tie us up or strangle us, call us names, etc. I was also sexually abused by a couple of family friends.

I just don't think you can hit a child in any way - whether that's spanking, slapping, smacking, etc. - without teaching the child that their body doesn't belong to them, that no one needs to respect them. I think I learned to dissociate under stress, I have the hardest time showing my emotions or communicating. I also jump when I'm alone in a room and someone comes in, and have a hard time with confrontation.",11Sep2020,1

Worst case scenario, if the two parties are both extremely passionate about politics, then I can see a future relationship being problematic. However, there are Trump supporters who are tired of how the Left has been acting. There are Trump supporters I know personally who are socially progressive individuals who are really looking at their own personal needs being met (generally fiscally).

And truthfully, if they start talking to someone and within the first two emails realize they are not with a progressive or liberal ideology and then they decide not to pursue, fine. I may think they're overreacting a bit, but at least there wasn't this overly aggressive, pompous attitude the reader had to endure.

108,"I have always been a really over-sensory person. Especially with touch; I am very sensitive to anything that physically touches me.  
Sometimes, when I am having an anxiety attack or in a depressive episode, I get into what I call ""sensory-freakouts"" when I become hyper aware of what I am feeling/touching. 

It could be little things, like a clothing tag being too uncomfortable or feeling a fly's leg's on your arm. For me (right now), my hair itself has been making me uncomfortable. It getting stuck in my shirt, sprawling about, it just being on me is sending nerves down my spine. I hate having my nails anything more than filed/cut down completely, so the feeling of my ""normal"" nails on the keyboard and clacking onto surfaces is also on my nerves. My hands being somewhat sticky from perspiration, the shirt on my skin, even the fact that there is a layer of dead skin on my body is making me want to cry. 

Maybe this has to do with my mental health and/or other conditions like insomnia or me being on the autism spectrum. It sucks and I can't wait for this sensory-freakout to be over.",11Sep2020,1

This year, I have taken exactly two weeks of annual leave. 

In March, I was going to visit my parents. My housemate announced that she'd come in contact with a positive case of Covid-19 at a house party. At the time, we knew nothing about it. I didn't want to take the risk to pass it onto my parents, so I stayed at home to protect them. The week after, one case erupted into twenty cases from my housemate's friendship circle. Then, the whole country went into lockdown. The death toll went up and up and up. 

Now we're in September, I live in a self-contained studio apartment. It has a shared front entrance with my landlord who lives in the main house, and then my own private door next to theirs (which is always open). I have taken my first annual leave since March. Today, my elderly landlord and his wife were babysitting their grandchild after school. The kid had a new and very persistent cough which (according to the parent) he picked up at school. What in the world would possess someone to drop off their potentially sick child with their elderly parents (one with a weakened immune system) in a pandemic??!! 

Anyway, I was going to go out for a walk to celebrate my annual leave, but the kid was running up and down the hallway, coughing all over the place, so I was like ""*nah, bud*"".

I know me and her have argued a lot in the past but that was a long time ago. You know just a few days ago so called friends were talking trash about her, insulting her looks &amp; body, just pretty much harassing her. I was literally the only that had her back in that entire situation which lasted about 5 days I guess. I talked to her made her laugh, made her feel better you know? 2 days later I see her talking to the same people who talked all that stuff about her and it pissed me off cause I tried to cut off her bad friends for her so she didn’t feel awful again. She then tells me the day she unadds me which was like yesterday, she believed them and I was so mad but I eventually brought myself together and proved I was innocent and she believed me. Today she left me on delivered for 8 hours, didn’t say hi to me when I joined a ft not even acknowledging my presence. Doesn’t even post pictures of me like she does with her other friends, and she says we’re “best friends” but doesn’t have pictures of me but would rather save pictures of someone she had just met 4 days ago.
