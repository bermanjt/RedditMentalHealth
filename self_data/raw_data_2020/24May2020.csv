0,"I’m a girl and the peach fuzz on my face is particularly dark because I’m Indian. I’m extremely insecure about it but I usually just left it alone and hoped no one would really notice it. But lately a lot of my friend point it out or my mom calls me a monkey and It makes me feel so ugly. Today I got one of those little face razors and shaved the hair and it didn’t make me feel any better. It honestly just made me feel like a fake or just shitty that I was born the way I was, that I had to shave my face in order to try to feel beautiful and just feeling empty when it didn’t. Idk if I’ll honestly ever be okay with my peach fuzz ://",24May2020,1
1,"Can someone help identify the affects of this psychological manipulation? I believe it is aimed at my subconscious mind and silencing it. 

When I the victim will fall asleep, the manipulator will deliberately cough periodically at a volume that my subconscious will take it in without waking from sleep.  Eventually I will wake up but theres a good 4-5 hours where that shits going straight into my subconscious. I wake up feeling on edge , confused, and angry.",24May2020,1
2,"I know that I’m a great partner, but that was my downfall. I didn’t try to prove it every day, I rested on my laurels.  I read through the texts from the last few weeks and oh my god I was horrified. How could I have a) been like that, and b) not realized? And looking back to the entirety of the relationship, it was the same, but our connection and willingness to work together pulled us through, but I hit the breaking (up) point without realizing I was approaching it. To be clear, it wasn’t _all_ the time, but enough to where it was noticeable, and then it all came to a head.

It sucks to actually see your shittyness, and it’s worse when you see who it was directed towards. I want to grow and be a better/more consistent partner and hopefully at some point, when I get there, she’ll see that I’m where I need to be.",24May2020,1
3,"I don't know if this fits here, but this just happened and my boyfriend is already sleeping and I really need to take this off my chest. 

So I (17F) work until around midnight, and used to go home alone, by bus or metro, but a few months ago my cousin got robbed on his way home (which is the same as mine) and my parents got scared and my dad stared picking me up after my shift ended. 

So here I am, waiting for him, alone, still in the street of my work place, which at night can be super creepy since there's no one outside, I hear some honk coming from a car, and then that same car comes to the street where I was. I was in the corner of the street, which I only noticed later and regretted it so much. And so the car comes. They honk again and stop right in front of me. The car was filled with dudes maybe on their 20s/30s and the driver rolls the window down, calls me a hooker and asks if 20€ was enough. 

I just froze. I wanted to be like those girls who scream at the top of their lungs and insult them until the car disappears. But I just froze. I watched the car leave already almost in tears. Then I look over and there was a group of 3 people, just chatting, a few meters away, that just watched and heard the whole thing. They just stared at me for a lot longer than I wish they did. And every time I looked at them to see if they were still looking at me I felt my tears closer and closer to come down. 

A couple minutes pass by and my co-workers and my boss (on their 40s) come of the work place and see me there still waiting for my drive, and they ask if I was okay and if I wanted them to stick around and wait with me till my father came. I said no but they still stayed there. It warmed my heart and helped me a little. But just the thought of ""what if I stayed inside waiting for my dad"", ""what if they came out just a little bit early"", ""what if my father left the house just a little bit earlier"" this maybe wouldn't have happened.

Luckily I never experienced this before, not alone, not at this ""scale"". I don't know if I'm hurt, if I'm embarrassed, if I'm disgusted. Maybe all. 
Maybe it's nothing and I'm just dramatizing cause I've been lucky enough to never had this happen to me before.

I just know that every time a car passed by me I saw their faces, I saw their car. Even if the car was completely different in every possible way, I saw it, I saw them. 
I just wanted the world to shut down for a few minutes and leave me alone. On our way home, my sister couldn't stop talking, my father was singing all the time, witch usually makes me smile but this time it was just making me want to scream to them so they could shut up.

11,"\*i would greatly appreciate anyone taking the time out to read\*

Ever since I was little, Ive been like unusually reserved and kind of stuck in my head. Ive seen a lot of things growing up and for as long as I can remember Ive just tried to lock myself up and focus on myself. My family is a very hectic Jamaican household so if you can relate, we're not that good at talking through anything just mostly yelling and family gatherings of food lol. At 8, my dad was murdered in Jamaica (he was a cop, and was taken by a well known gang at the time), and thats when most of my anxiety and dissassociation started because I don't think I understood what was going on. So even at the funeral it was weird watching everyone cry I was just blank. No one really did much for me and my mom just assumed ""I would talk when i was ready"".. ( she obviously had to fight a lot in her life too) .. Since then my house was just full of fights (I live with both grandparents, mom, aunts, uncles, cousins etc) and just really weird ways of dealing with things bc to them it was just normal, and therapy just wasnt something learned about yet. We just hadnt evolved that way in the world just yet.

Ive honestly always been the fish out of water sort of thing because I dont have an accent and they called me white because I talked weirdly proper and was good at school (it was a while ago they know better to say that now). The thing is that Ive physically shelled myself from a lot so for yeaarsl at family functions Id kind of be by myself and they, especially my mom, would always say its because I thought I was better than everyone else. And at that age, tbh I probably thought I was becuase I didnt want them to be my family when things started up. My mom has always been an amazing mother the best way she knows how as far as giving me opportunities and wanting to be there in my life to watch me succeed. Just growing up, and i cant even exaggerate this enough, the verbal and emotional abuse was insane (and especially bad with her bc shes ""the firecracker"" of the family). I just have to give her a lot of credit because shes truly growing in a lot of ways. And i know after everything she's hurt at the way I act towards her even now. Im 21 and old enough to reason, and say a lot of things to fight her logic and emotional reactions now (I feel like Im old enough to just defend myself). I know ive hurt her a lot with closing myself off and being unnecessarily rude/annoyed with my family at times, because ive struggled a lot w/so much in an d out of the house and even almost started therapy when I had a breakdown and HAD to tell her bc it my first year away at school.

Ive been so disconnected all my life (just locked up in my room since I started going to school back home) where there would be things going on and I wouldnt even hear until my mom said it. Like family groupchats, finding out my cousins would go over to my uncles wifes house, calls that are super ""familyish"" and I cant bring myself to do it all of a sudden. When I try now, I feel really ""white"" haha, and out of place. Family functions are super draining when Im alone with people and I feel like i have to push a little harder to ""be normal or fit in with them"". My mom tries to keep many of my ""indiscretions"" away from the family because they still see me as a kid sorta and she knows they can be judgemental. (Everyone knows idgaf tho lol) Im pretty sure most of them dont realize Im 21, or even really know me.. my closest little cousins literally asked me what my name was during our famiy vacay... It just feels shitty sometimes I dont want to feel even more like a stranger, I already struggle enough just existing outside of them as me, I just want to engage more.. Any tips? Talking to my mom is sort of my best bet. I acknowledge i hold a lot resentment bc of the way she handled/does handle certain things aggressively and it almost makes me not want to go to her. Sometimes I feel she doesn't like me.. and trust I understand why. Im older, and I truly dont want to have a consistent attitude all the time. Any tips (besides therapy)--im working on just opening up and taking action for rn.

TLDR: Im at this point (where ive been time and time again) where im 21, and I want to take full control of my mental health, working actively at atleast trying to engage with my family, and possibly starting therapy again once this Q is over. Ive started learning to cook in the house, cleaning more often, working (but not just as a getaway from the house) and just trying to spend more time in open spaces outside my room little by little. Any tips on casually talking to family members on a less weird way just to be more friendly (maybe Im just weird about it)... the only backfire is i dead hate when people call me or yell my name in the house LMAO its A LITERAL instant trigger where I just naturally answer rudely and have to catch myself all the time i hate it haha... AND it'll be a completely different vybe when my grandmother gets back from JA after quarantine bc she's sooo stuck in her old ways and i honestly feel the need to assert myself aggressively bc she has sooo many control issues even with my mom, and people in general.. so I just refuse to let her take advantage of me like she used to do my cousins growing upp.. but most times I just look at her and feel so sad that I do that..",24May2020,1
12,"Some important background information:

So i have this weird reaction whenever i get called by my mom or just in general by people with a similar voice. Basically when i get called by my mom all of the worst thoughts come into my mind and usually (not always) i get physically shook up (happens by itself i don't really know what it is) my entire body literally shakes for a good second. My mom is really scary and it haunts me (literally), so when she calls me up for the most mundane stuff i get terrified af.

Anyway, a secret i try to keep away from her is that i like romcom anime (kaguya-sama: love is war, for example, but i watch a few more sometimes). If she finds out i watch this stuff? Maaaaaan she will be too disappointed in me and i wouldnt be able to even imagine the outcome of that lol. I also partly watch this stuff because im kind of a loner and since ive never had any luck with girls, this show kind of fills up that dark hole inside my heart.

Now to today:

Today i was watching love is war and she came in the room and i physically shook when she entered and called my name lol. then she kind of snapped and told me that she hates it when i react like this, she has tried everything and it doesnt work, and she just wants me to stop reacting like that and stop being scared of her. For me, from my pov i was just hoping i wouldnt suffer any repercussions because i was extra terrified when she snapped.

And then she was like: ""you know what? i think i have an idea. I will never talk to you again or do anything else with you. Bye.""

And i was like: ""no please dont do that blah blah"" (basically my response was worthless)

I havent heard anything from her since. And this has lasted the entire night.

Im 20 if that info is important",24May2020,1
13,"Sup! I turned 20 around 9 days ago and I’m officially an adult now! With everything happening my mom who’s been financially supporting me through college got laid off and my older brother has been helping her with the house. I saw them in the middle of March and went back to the state I’ve been going to school at back to the apartment with my partner and roommate and chose to stay when my family tried to get me to move back.

(Before I continue if the way I describe my mom sounds weird it’s cause I love her but due to her working a lot, both of us being depressed, and her disapproving if me being gay we aren’t the closest in my eyes but I’m her favorite company it’s weird)

Anyways I got super depressed with everything going on like everyone else has. My mom got laid off and there’s no way I can take on the loans cause honestly there’s no job I’d be able to get that would ever pay them off. My commitment fear is triggered by the fact that if I wanted to leave I couldn’t cause I’m barely getting on my feet as a financially independent adult. I was unemployed but now I’m in a temporary job that’s dancing between “you’re gonna be released/you’re not gonna be released” and I’ve been kind of too young (and a bit reckless) to have savings to help me (my family can’t really give me a lot of the things I’ve needed/wanted over the years other than food and a roof which is great but it meant a lot of my money from part time jobs got shoved to necessities and things I wanted but say need because they emotionally fulfilled me more than anything). 

This is long and super stupid but now I’m 20. Life is weird and nowhere it could’ve possibly gone before. I’ve been depressed since I was 9 and it got worse.

But I’m trying to take care of myself now that I’m more in a high than a low so I’ve just been happily dreaming cottage style life and I’m kind of trying small things that make me happy. Like everyone else I made bread (I’ve made it before and always enjoyed it) and some homemade strawberry jam. The other day I planted strawberry seeds from the strawberries in the jam and some lavender seeds I bought. They probably won’t last but if they do, more strawberry jam/milkshakes/etc. and I want to make scent oil and press flowers from the lavender and use the oil to make homemade candles. And today I used a new facewash and lotion and some old face moisturizer I had before. It makes my face feel nice. And I made sun tea with a new glass jar that I’ve been staring at at work. It tastes alright. Next time around I want to try to replicate my favorite drink. 

Soon I’m going to buy a queen sized bed and headboard to replace our futon.

17,"Trigger Warnings; suicide, mental hospital, depression, etc. 

So this is long and complicated which is why I created a throwaway account to post this. I have a feeling most people will think this is bullshit, or that I will get lots of hate for it and I didn't want that on my main account. 

Okay so... I don't know if I want to live anymore. Since I was ten years old I created a plan to kill myself once I turned 18. That's how completely afraid of growing up I was. I was set to follow this plan until I was 15 when I had the now common mental breakdown. I was in a mental hospital (bEhAvIoRiAl HeAlTh CeNtEr) for about 5 weeks and I had to drop most my classes in high school, which wasn't the biggest problem since I was in all honors and AP so going down to regular classes was like being in middle school again. I could handle it. I got on meds to help with anxiety and depression and was doing okay. Doctors kept playing with my dosage to find the right amount, like tuning a violin. During all that I was hospitalized again for another 4 weeks. 

Therapists and doctors, along with my meds and friends, got me to give up on my plan to kill myself at 18. My family never knew about the plan. 

When I was 17 my father raped my mom while I was in the same room. We were sleeping in bunk beds for a family vacation and I was on the top bunk when it happened. I was frozen with fear and I couldn't do anything. He wasn't the kind of person you made angry and I was too scared to stop it, what he would do. She was black out drunk and had no idea it happened. I had to tell her the next morning. 

At that point in my parent's marriage my mother was just with him ""because that's what you do"", even though she knew about dozens of his mistresses and how he was secretly taking thousands out of the bank account to pay for prostitutes and strippers. Needless to say I never observed a healthy loving relationship growing up. After I told her about what happened when she was black out drunk she asked him to leave the house and he has been gone for about 3 years. 

Ever since, though, she's used me an an emotional crutch. I love my mother dearly but I can't stand this, and any time I try to bring it up she will deflect or get so angry she stops talking to me for a few hours. 

At this point I think I should mention that I am 20 years old, but cognitively about 16 according to my psychologists, doctors, etc. I had about 5 concussions  within four years that severely fucked my head up, this was when I was 12-16. I got off pretty easy all things considering. I've seen the awful things that happen to people with concussions and while I do have some effects, none of them are too bad. Doctors think the concussions is one of the things that is stopping (?) my mental development?  

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm mentally a 16 year old, but the repercussions of that are only starting to catch up. But even besides all that I don't have a clue what to do with my life. My 'mentor' of sorts has told me repeatedly that I owe it to the world to do something great because of my intelligence (which I don't even know if I can still mentally develop?) . My mother and family agree and say I have to do something great with my life. This is why I made this a throw away account. I don't want to sound like a narcissist or incel when I say this; I am really really smart. I do not think this makes me a better person or anything like that, but so many people have been pressuring me to do ""great things"" because of my intelligence. This type of smart runs in my family too, my cousins are the same as me but besides that I can't really think of anyone else. 

But I don't want to do anything great. I don't want to take the time to get a doctorates or masters or really do anything. I have no passions... I'm not the biggest people person and I don't to do anything that works with people. I don't want to be a doctor or a psychologist, or a politician, or any fucking thing. But everyone I know says the same thing; that I have a responsibility to the world because I was born with so much privilege that I have to do something with it. That I have to give back to the world. 

I don't want any of that. I don't even like being alive. For about a year now I've started to think about my childhood plan of killing myself. I don't want to be an adult. I don't want some stupid ""responsibility"" just because of my smarts. I don't want any responsibility and even the thought of being independent makes me nauseous just like when I was a kid.

I'm just so scared of being an adult even though I technically am. I'm so scared of growing up that I think I would still rather just die.

this part of me disgusts myself and i have trouble falling asleep just remembering all the lies i’ve told. I grew up in a traditional, abusive family where lying was the only way out of getting in trouble, so it became a habit.

I’m about to turn 18 and i still struggle with it. I make up lies about who i am, what my parents do, my finical status, hobbies, it’s so strange. I made up that i play horse polo and actively box. I’ve never even ridden a horse and i don’t actively box. These are things i ofc want to do in the future.

I’ve been doing really well! i’ve apologized and explained things to the people close to me. But i still find that i have trouble when it comes to talking with guys. I always feel the need to embellish myself. Why tf can’t i just say that i’m interested in these things instead of lying and saying that i’m talented at these things.

There’s this one guy that i’ve known for a while. Before I realized a compulsive liar I had already told him many lies. Including that i’m a good boxer, stellar grades, and getting into certain colleges. He brings it up and idk how to stop getting sucked into more lying. 

I really want to change. I like me, there’s so many cool things i do. I want to say that lied but he’s gonna think i’m insane. Part of me thinks that i should just let him go and make sure this doesn’t happen again, but how is this any of his fault?

Selflessness is putting others before yourself, the opposite of selfishness. The definition of it based off google is “concern more with the needs and wishes of others than with one's own”

Is it better to be selfish sometimes, even though you been trained not to ever be selfish?

33,"When I was 16 I went on a European tour with my aunt. We were part of a tour group that lasted about 2 weeks and traveled to 5 countries. We had a couple days in London, then started the tour. We were on the ferry from Dover to Calais, and I was just standing there looking out the window when a guy asked if I knew how much longer it would be. When I answered that I thought we still had a couple hours, he got excited when he heard my American accent. I'm from outside Los Angeles, he was from the Bay area. We ended up talking for the rest of the ferry ride. He was a couple years older than me, had just graduated high school. He decided to ride his bike to Rome. I can't remember where he started. It was sort of a pilgrimage for him, a way to find himself before he started his life. I still have my journal I kept from the trip, but can't find it right now to see if I wrote down his name. There was nothing romantic about our interaction. I know it seems weird, but I've thought about him every so often over the years and wondered what ever happened to him. I wish we had exchanged contact info so I could see how his trip went. But times were a lot different back then. I think this would have been the summer of 1994. Cell phones weren't really a thing. I tried a long time ago on some missed connection site to see if I could track him down, but had no luck. I'm new to Reddit (I don't know why I never joined before now), but figured that maybe someone here knows someone who knows someone, or something along those lines. r/mmissedconnections is down, so I figured I'd just post here and see if I have any luck.

So, bicycle guy, I hope I find you and that you've had a good life!",24May2020,1

But I'm the breadwinner, the household manager and main parent to my disabled child. My mom helps best she can, but lords it over me that she does the laundry and I have the audacity to ask for help with the household bills.

I’ve never met a girl with a voice as high as mine I hate it. Plus my friends even mention how annoying my voice gets.

45,"Throwaway because I don't want this on my main.

I'm the oldest of six children. This brother was born next to me. I don't know why out of all siblings who were all raised the same way, he's the one with the most annoying attitude and always comes off as an asshole. He's fine sometimes, but it's more often that he irritates everyone with his awful attitude.

In my culture, respect to older people is emphasized. He gives the littlest respect to me and my parents. Even my aunts and uncles. Given that we only have a one year gap (he was born 2004, I was born in 2002), I could understand why but with our parents and relatives? I feel terribly ashamed in behalf of him and it's always me or my mom that initiates apologizing in behalf of him because he doesn't want to do it.

Whenever we have family gatherings, he will throw a fit if things doesn't go his way. For example, if it's a pool party and my mom forgot to pack an extra towel, instead of borrowing or sharing with someone else, he will throw a fit and shout at my mom.

He doesn't hesitate to throw a fit anywhere. He will shout if he wants whether we are in a mall, with friends, with relatives, in other people's house, etc. This is also why I stopped coming to places and gatherings when he is there. If I do come, I make sure I stay faraway from him because I don't want to get involved with his bullshit.

He also doesn't respect other people's things. He once lost his phone because it was stolen after he put it in his pocket while riding on a very packed bus. After that, my parents weren't able to buy him a phone right away because we're not that well-off and the income is budgeted strictly. He borrowed my mom's phone to watch YouTube and chat with his friends. It lagged (it was an old iPhone) and he slammed it on the table and the screen broke. Luckily, my mom was still able to use it for a few more months before it completely died.

Back then, I try to tell him why he is wrong and why he should apologize. I felt like as his older sister, I should at least help him realize his mistakes, even if it's just sometimes. However, all those attempts just led to him shouting at me and telling me to shut up and to stop sticking my nose into his business. So I stopped.

I think the thing that infuriates me the most is the he refuses to help out at home. When he finishes eating, he doesn't clean after himself. He doesn't put his dishes on the sink nor does he wipe the table. If he does, it's usually because he's the only one awake at that time but when there are others, he rarely cleans after himself. He doesn't take care of his hygiene well. His armpits stink as fuck and when I once asked him if he had taken a shower and put some deodorant because he smells, he got mad at me.

My parents used to try to discipline him. Giving timeouts when he was younger, grounding him, even spanking, but nothing worked. When he was given timeouts or he was grounded, he will sneak out. I remember the time when he was 11, he went out to play and didn't come back at dinner time (this is his curfew). My mom was so mad because it wasn't the first time, so she locked him out. He just climbed over the gate and kept slamming the door until we opened it. He still did it again after that. When he was spanked, he'd be more angry. Nothing my parents did taught him a lesson and when he turned 15, I guess they just stopped trying. I couldn't blame them, even I had tried to coax him into not doing these things, but nothing worked.

I can't wait to move out. I cannot stay any longer with him and his asshole attitude. I wish I can get in to a far enough university because I really want some peace of mind. I don't know whether it was my parents who were wrong, or if I was ever lacking as a sister, but I just really want to have nothing to do with him. I would still help him out, but I do not want to be in the same house again when we are older. I just wished he would change because his attitude would bring him no where especially at his age.

Sorry for the long post, Reddit. I just really wanted to let this out.",24May2020,1
46,"As time goes on I keep realizing things that were wrong in my previous relationship, even long after I thought I had figured everything out.

A lot of the time it’s little things, like, I remember I had shared this post with him on Twitter that was like “rank the seven deadly sins in terms of how much they apply to you”, and we were joking about which member of the friend group would be which sin, since there’s around seven of us.

It was all stuff like “oh, so and so would be Gluttony because he owns so many sneakers” and yada yada yada, and we were trying to figure out what I would be. I remember him saying “you’d be Greed, because you try and take up all my time”, and I remember the rest of his friends laughing along, saying that was a fitting label.

The weird thing is that it didn’t make me sad, because in the moment I believed it was true. I just kind of accepted it as part of me. It’s not like it was the first time I’d been told I was greedy, or at least, made to feel that way.

Whenever he would come over and we’d hang out he’d always chide me about not letting him leave sooner. He’d be putting on his shoes and I’d ask for a hug and kiss before he’d go, and in response he’d sigh and say “you always try to keep me here, why can’t you just let me leave?” And in my mind I’d just go “ah, I’m being greedy again.” And I’d tell him that I’d be better.

It wasn’t until I got with my current partner that I began to realize the way my thinking had been stuck like this. The two of us were hanging out and I asked them if they wanted to watch an episode of something, Better Call Saul or some other show, before they left. They went “yeah, sure!” but I asked a couple more times to double check, like, “are you sure? if you’re too tired and need to leave you can tell me, I don’t mind!”, but they kept insisting it was alright. “I want to stay here as long as you want me” I believe they said. And I realized that I’d been so used to me being the only person wanting company. Some part of me didn’t even realize that someone reciprocating that was an option.

But what really did it was whenever I sent them that old Twitter post, the same seven deadly sins one I mentioned before. They started to rank theirs, and I went “oh wait, I think I have a copy of mine when I did this a long time ago!” and pulled it up on my phone. It was a list of all seven, and I think I’d put greed at the top, or maybe second to lust (my ex used to complain that I was needy and obsessed with sex, and would make me feel ashamed for wanting intimacy, but that’s another story). Either way I sent it over, and to my surprise they were shocked. I remember them going “what?? Why’d you put greed so high? That’s not you at all”. And it all just clicked, all at once the synapses in my brain popped off and I just went “oh shit, oh my god, I used to think I was greedy. For wanting to spend time with my ex when we were together. We were looking at this same exact post once, and that’s when he said it to me”. It all just hit me at once, the fact that I really had believed it for so long, genuinely believed that I was a selfish person. It got to the point where it didn’t even bother me that I thought of myself as a burden, I just thought it was who I was.

My partner in response promptly told me that was bullshit, and that I was one of the most giving people they knew. “I can’t believe they would say that to you,” they told me. And I just started to cry.

It pains me, thinking about it. I hope nobody ever makes me feel that way again. All I want is to be around people who love me and value me just as much as I do them. Words cannot describe how degrading and sad it feels to live without that.

Anyway, fuck Hunter.",24May2020,1

We were alone for a bit and she asked if I wanted to kiss her. I really did want to but I said no, I felt like it would be unfair to her seeing as I'm heading off to college in a few months and she still has another year of highschool, and seeing as my college is in a different state, I felt like if I kissed it would start something that would lead to me having to abandon her.

I am not afraid to lose my life because i believe if my story can help many others like me out there who are on the verge of suicide and self harm, depression and anxiety just like I was and fought back and still fighting, maybe it will be like I saved myself again a hundred times more even if my story reaches even just one person out there.

54,"About a year ago, my life was put into a down spiral. My grades fell as my interest in school dropped to an all time low. Most of my endeavors in academics was for the sole purpose of making money. It got me far, and I went to the best university in the state. But, I quickly realized just how little it all meant to me. I wasn't disciplined, I wasn't ready, and worst of all, I wasn't hungry. I had no true interest in pretty much any field. It was all, ""what can make me the most money?"" And when I realized I didn't care about money anymore, everything fell apart. Big reason why you don't chase after shallow goals.

After dropping out, I sought out a small community college to continue for the purpose of making my family happy. That didn't go well either, I barely got grades above a C, and I hated every second in class and out. I wasn't the academic type, I wanted more than to just sit in a desk and write down on paper. Or to be at my computer lazily typing up essays. And yet I pushed on wards cause I didn't want to be kicked from my own home.

As this went on, I had a part time job at a warehouse. It wasn't too bad, I was great friends with my manager and coworkers, and it taught me to push my body to its limits. Some days, like around Christmas season, were brutally difficult. It opened up a new venue, I always thought of myself as weak, fragile etc. But as months went by, I felt myself getting stronger, and a light bulb went off: Military. I virtually worshiped the Marines growing up. I had one for a father and his stories stuck with me till today. But I never took the decision cause it always seemed beyond me. It was for those stronger and more able minded than me. While I had desire, I still had hesitation and fear. It was not just difficult, but a commitment for the rest of your life. Once a Marine always a Marine.

And so I stowed the thought away in the back of my head. Something to consider, but maybe I should try school first (yeah right). More months went by and I became stuck. A loop of just working and working, squandering my money away and staying in my room all day. Until it happened, I was visiting friends to hang out one day, when I rear ended a car after a sudden stopped proved too much for my old cars brakes to handle. It did almost nothing to his car, but destroyed mine beyond repair. At the moment, I felt like dying. Without that car I lost the ability to go to school or work consistently. I'd lose my job, and with credit card debt racking up, it was enough to drive me to panic.

But when I calmed down, it became clear. There was no reason to hesitate anymore, no reason to fear anymore. If all I had left was to become some useless vagabond, or a corpse, then I could let my desire free. I could put it all on the line without holding back. And so I went to a recruiters office, long story short, I ship to San Diego Tuesday. 

If I never crashed that car, i'd most likely still be working for measly scraps while wasting away time on video games. And after really taking things into account, things couldn't have ended better. This was the life I feel like I wanted all along. Pride, belonging, adventure, physical challenge. Come Tuesday i'll be put to the absolute test for the next 13 weeks. See you all when I have that ega!",24May2020,1
57,"My 4 year old sister dotes on me and is the only family member I have that shows any affection or concern towards me. She’s my biggest cheerleader even though she’s small and just 4 years old. She follows me around at the store like a duckling, even if my mom and other sister are around. She comes to me when she gets hurt or sad or needs help. She knows that I won’t overreact when she has an “accident”, so she comes to me for that too lol.

 I don’t cook or bake as much as I’d like to, because I spend most of my time upstairs in my room trying to avoid conflict with family. On a rare occasion I did manage to step down to the kitchen, I baked mini fruit tarts and allowed my sister to help me crack eggs and make shapes with cookie cutters. Baby sister LOVES them and eats so many of them over the days. When they finished, I made some more at her insistence. It fills my heart up that she loves me this much and thinks my fruit tarts are absolutely delicious (I must say that they are). 

 On an unrelated note, my little sis will declare that I look cute or beautiful randomly out of the blue.

 I really think I’m her favorite sister, and possibly favorite person in the family. I don’t yell at her the way my other family members do and I don’t freak out on the stupid things little kids tend to do.

I'm really getting to the end of my nerves. Classic topics, love and envy.  
I'm really close friends with this girl for about 3-4 years now. Like best friends. We've helped each other through some rough times, had fun activities together and have some really good conversations together. She's the most beautiful living being i can imagine right now.  


Problem is, i don't think she's feeling the same for me. And by ""i think"" i'm really sure that way, because about a year earlier i kinda already told her pretty plain what i am feeling, and she told me she's not. And she has some convincing arguments why a relationship with her wouldn't be a good idea. We live about 700km away from each other (i moved for university 1 1/2 years ago), so it would be a long distance relationship. Second, she's a pretty rational type, so she's asking herself ""What benefit do i get from a relationship with xy over a friendship?"" and i don't seem to give one. At the point i would be moving back, she would be moving away for her Master's Degree, so we won't be living near each other for the next 5 Years or so.  


My biggest Problem is, that this is a new kind of love for me. I just feel shitty without her. And normal with her. My heart doesn't make big beats when i see her, like love used to be for me, i just don't feel down when i'm talking to her, and i feel down when i'm not. Second i envy a lot. When she told me she kissed a more-or-less random guy from some party it broke my heart, when she tells me there's a new guy in her friends group and she's not sure what the deal is between them, it hurts a lot in my heart. I'm so envious and i just want her to live a good life and have fun and be loved and loving, and want to feel happy for her, but i can't! But why can't i, i used to be able to...  


Talking to her becomes more and more difficult. We don't have many hobbies or interests we share and because of the distance we don't get to do much things together. It's mainly our mindset and view of the world that's connecting us.  


What would be the point of telling her, what i feel? It likely wouldn't change much, and if, would it be for the better? I like our friendship and don't want to ruin it by my envious love. We've supported each other for a while now, i don't want that to end. Imagine yourself in her position, could you be talking freely about your life, if you know that the things you are telling are hurting the other person? I don't want her to feel that way.

Oh, and because it's cake day... I'll be baking this Apple Cake (later) today:

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients:

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
* 1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 cup white sugar
* 3-5 dashes of cinnamon
* 1/2 cup butter
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup coffee or whipping cream
* 1 1/2 medium apples

Instructions:

* Add the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix well. 
* Add cream and eggs to a mixing container while you're warming up the butter. Mix the wet ingredients well. (The warmer the butter is, the better.)
* Mix everything together until nice and smooth. Add cream if necessary. Let the batter sit.
* Cut the apples and add them to the batter. Mix thoroughly.
* Put batter in baking tin/whatever you're using. Spread as evenly as possible, but don't worry too much about it. The batter will settle while baking.
* Bake for about 30-45 minutes depending on baking container and amount of batter. (I've had to bake a double load in a pie form for about 50 minutes.)

I dropped the hint which led you to find my account in front of N on purpose. I wanted to know if they were feeding info to you despite outright denying talking to you about me at all the first day I was back at work. I'd found yours months before that (constant commenting). I knew you were keeping tabs on me because my gofriends post got 8 up votes (unheard of on that sub), now here we are 

So it seems like you especially really really want to know two things:

Am I transphobic? I don't even know why you'd think that but Nah homie investigate the overlap between autism and trangenderism and then consider that I'd never ever ever speak about anything persoal with any of my coworkers. They've proven themselves to be nothing more than easily manipulated toadies; a whole pack of} nasty little bullies who are too stupid to get the grammar right on the day-1 Spanish class phrase they used to mock me to my face? Yeah, they're all too fucking dense to realize that I actually don't give even a single molecule of shit that they ""no me quiere."" 

So no, I was never going to give them any information to get back to you. You were never going to be able to gauge my feelings second hand through them. If you want to know about me you're going to have to talk to me. 

Most of all I think you want to know my body count. I won't ever tell you until after you're already on that list so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  balls in your court my man

There has been way too much lying and too much manipulation from you especially considering I would have slept with you the minute you asked at literally any point at all since the moment I met you. No, that's no exaggeration.

I think maybe we could/could have dated and maybe that would work or not who knows... But the sex would have been great no doubt in my mind. And if you really wanted the job back too it's not like they won't let you if we're sleeping together.

I'm worried about how this'll affect my life, my education etc. but I am not yet comfortable with talking to friends about it and I don't know how to deal with it. Getting really anxious about what this'll lead to and so here I am asking for help.

Anything about how to get through this or personal experiences or whatever would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance.",24May2020,1
68,"I was awoken this morning by a bird outside my window.  It was quite loud.  As I stirred from my slumber, about which I was rather unhappy, I noticed that the last part of the bird's call was a strangely unnatural eeeeeee sound.  It sounded contrived or strained.

I laid there in bed cursing the rather loud bird, and realized it was singing, ""get your keys, and get your guarantee"".

Reddit's sleuth squad was the only place I though might be able to cover North America to find a car dealership which had an annoying loud car dealer jingle like that.

It may not have been a car dealer.  The ""get your keys"" part was less clear.  The ""get your guarantee"" part was clear as day though.

This was a song bird of some kind.  In Ontario Canada, so they could winter anywhere in North or South America.

I dont know anything about music to describe the jingle.  It was fairly sticatto at the start and ended in an upward inflection with a drawn out eeee at the end.

Da da.        Da da.      Deeeeeeee.

Get.        Your.       Guar. An.  Teeeee.

Rae.        Doe.        Mee. Fah.  Soooo. (Not sure about this part)

Probably doesnt help.  Or confuses it more.

To me the jingle is likely from the USA.  I've never heard a jingle like that and it may be that you aren't allowed to advertise guarantees like that in Canada.

Also have to ask if birds are all speaking jibberish to each other because their brains are infected by our radio jingles.",24May2020,1
69,"So idk if this is the right community for this but So I was with this girl for 4 months and I really liked her, like I felt as though I was in love.   Well about three months into our relationship a girl from her old school dm’ed me.  Me being the respectful partner I am immediately showed her and didn’t respond.   The next day my ex told me how they were shit talking back and forth and then the girl said I looked like ima cheat on her.   After I was taken back by that my girlfriend kinda just looked around for a second then agreed and said I look like the type of guy that would cheat.   Now I take cheating strongly and that shit hurt.  Bad.   From that moment forward I haven’t styled my hair the way I used to. I actually cut it recently trying to look less like that and my self confidence dropped a lot.  Am I being a bit** about this?  Like I know it’s jus words but coming from her when she knows how I feel ab the topic killed me on the Inside",24May2020,1
71,"Yesterday my dad called me to let me know his mother may not last another week. Her body and mind have just given up. She was a lifelong smoker, quit about a decade ago but I guess it caught up with her in the end. Lung cancer, spread all over. Nothing to be done but make her comfortable and wait.

My Granny’s name is Wanda Maezel. She is 78 years old. She was born in Texas but grew up in rural Missouri. Her father was a poor farmer and her mother was dutiful but unhappy in her marriage. One of Granny’s sisters was actually the result of an affair between their mother and her recently-deceased sister’s widow. I know one of her brothers, Uncle Billy, was a child molester. I don’t know if my Granny ever experienced that but I know she wanted to get out of her house as soon as she could.

When she met my grandfather, she was a chubby 14-year-old and he was a strapping young army man 7 years her senior. They were married when she was 15 and by the time she was 21, she had 6 kids and they had left everything they ever knew in the Midwest behind to settle down in Miami, Florida.

I never really knew any of this until she got sick. Sad to say but Granny and I did not have a close relationship for most of my life. As a child I thought that Granny did not love me. She was very strict, very religious and not at all affectionate. She was very judgmental and harsh with her tongue.

She did some kind, sweet things like making mango jam or sewing dollies for me, but it always made me feel sad knowing that she lived a block away from us kids and wouldn’t come to visit. Sometimes she would pick up yard tools from my dad and not even drop by to say hello to us, either.

It was very different from the relationship I have with my maternal grandmother, my beloved Mema. To this day I still fall asleep with my head in her lap while she plays with my hair. We adore each other and have a special connection. I can tell her everything and she was nothing if not brutally honest about life. She has always been my biggest supporter and taught me to feel empowered. Mema was a very successful woman in her day and did it all as a single, divorced woman with 4 kids. She not only made a lot of money but had a lot of influence in politics and South Florida society. All while being the matriarchal rock our family depended upon. So she was, in addition to being my ideal of strong love, my ideal of a strong woman. It seemed to me Granny and Mema were polar opposites.

As Granny got older she became very hateful. She spent a lot of time on Facebook trashing other people. She became very racist and homophobic, a very avid Trump supporter. Our family became distant because of political drama and infighting. For most of my life I was embarrassed to share blood with her.

But I understand her more now, knowing her story. I used to think she was a weak woman but I see now she was a strong woman in her own way. I can’t imagine going through life like her. Growing up so poor in the Midwest. Having children when you are a child yourself. Leaving your home and family behind forever. Thinking it was her duty to provide her husband as many kids as they could make—no matter how little they had to provide. Trying to raise six kids on a lowly painter’s income. Getting an abortion when she became pregnant a seventh time and couldn’t do it anymore. Losing her husband after Hurricane Andrew. Being a widow. Trying to keep your family together as best you can, when truth be told you’re not naturally a maternal person. Fighting a terminal disease at an old age.

There are a lot of things about her passing that will come as a relief. Foremost that she is not suffering anymore. But also I accept that it’s part of a larger scheme. The people of her generation are passing away and the more intolerant “ideals” they cling to are passing with them.

There also comes a lot of regret. I wish we had been closer. I wish I knew more about her personal life. I wish she could have taught me how to sew or make my dad’s favorite banana cream pie recipe.

But I’m glad that I can see now that I’m older that my Granny did love me, even if she had trouble showing it. And although there is never an excuse for being a bitter, nasty person I can understand what made her that way. I’m glad I got to see her when she still looked healthy and her personality had softened by the realization of her own mortality.

And finally I can say that I am no longer embarrassed to be Wanda Maezel’s grandmother. She was not a perfect woman by any means. But she was still a heck of a strong woman in her own way. And I just hope she finds some kind of peace now.",24May2020,1
72,"I’m a 25 year old married woman with a toddler. Also, I have only learned to speak English a few years ago so my apologies for any mistakes.

Recently(pre-COVID), my husband managed to get a promotion at his job. Considering the substantial amount his salary has increased, we both decided to change things up at the house. I would quit my job and take care of our daughter, while he would continue to work and provide for the family. I was excited at first, because that would mean I could spend more time with my daughter and I could finally quit the job I hated. That all changed after a while, however.

In the months leading to COVID and during the quarantine, I was a housewife. I cleaned the house and cooked all the meals for my family, took care of all of my daughter’s needs, and general bustling around the house.

Now that my husband is working from home, I see him hard at work and in meetings all day. It makes me so grateful that he is providing for the family, but it leaves me feeling so inadequate.

Sometimes I get breaks during the day when there’s nothing left to clean and the little one is either asleep or occupied and it makes me extremely guilty to even sit down and do nothing. I have to be constantly milling around to stop the intrusive thoughts reminding me that I’m not doing enough and I have everything easy because I just clean all day. My husband works so hard and I can’t bear the thought of him doing all the work while I just lounge around, even if it’s just for a few minutes.

I know it’s not healthy to think this way and stay-at-home-moms/dads are an integral part of the family, if the family chooses to incorporate that job into their lives. But no matter how many times I remind myself that I’m helping, I know deep down that I’m not doing enough and it brings me so much guilt and shame. Has anybody else gone through this?",24May2020,1

I miss the people, and I feel like I didn’t realise what I had until now that I’ve officially lost it. I can’t switch back now because my teacher told me not to change my mind again, and I feel like I just made a decision that I suddenly really really regret.

89,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence / :",24May2020,1

113,"Hi /r/self, I wanted to share this little event yesterday with you guys. I recently picked up journaling, and really enjoy writing, so the post is way longer than I intended. I don't normally post anything, but I hope you enjoy and I'd love to talk to you guys! What do you guys think of asking a stranger out or for their number? Have you guys tried it? What has your experience been like? My experience is detailed below.

I was at my weekly grocery store trip, wanting to buy some ingredients to make Taiwanese beef noodle soup. Since there are still quarantine restrictions in place, a line to limit the number of people inside had already formed by the time I got there. I had my earbuds in playing my favourite podcast to pass the time in line.

I take my place at the end of the line. As the line moves, more people line up behind me. Out of the corner of my eye I notice a girl with her 2 friends a few spots behind me. I glance over, seeing a petite frame dressed in a loose faded blue buttoned shirt and gray shorts. Turning her head, her two beautiful eyes and striking eyebrows above her mask come into view. Even though I couldn't see her whole face, I thought she was pretty. But it was just another person that I would never get to know or talk to, I thought. So, I went about my day, going into the store when I reached the front of the line.

Beef tendon is on sale! That's exactly what I wanted. It looks like racks of pork spare ribs are also on sale. So I grab some of those too, thinking I can dry rub and slow roast a rack in the oven. As I go around the aisles, I run into her and her friends separately, both in the snack aisle and the produce section. Eventually, I collect everything I thought I needed and queue up to check out. I pull out my phone to check off things on my shopping list and realized I had forgotten star anise. I leave my cart in the back of the line where I thought it wouldn't block anyone, and pace towards the spice aisle.

When I returned to my cart, I see one of her friends circling around my cart to get in line. I tell her that she got here first and that she should go ahead of me. I'm now directly behind their cart. She rejoined her friend and they've now gathered around their cart as we move along the line. I start to contemplate whether I would approach her. I take off my earbuds to make space for my thoughts. She was within reach, about 6 feet away to be approximate.

We're now at the front of the line. They're up for the next available cashier. One of her friends is no longer around. The other friend is in front of their cart checking something in a freezer out. She's standing behind her cart. I'm standing behind her. The only things between us were my cart and my inaction. There could have been no better opportunity. Her friends were away and we were almost in talking range.

My thoughts start to take over. After almost 3 decades of my existence, I've never done anything like this. I've never had the balls to do it. My mind is telling me to move, just like the characters in anime where their body had been broken, but their mind remained unyielding or they had been stunned by fear. ""UGOKE"" If I don't do this now, when will I ever? My heart was racing and the beats were the only thing I could hear.

I push my cart forward a little towards her side. I lean over my cart to be on the same head level as she is. I say ""Hey, excuse me"".

Snapping her head around, she says ""Oh, sorry"".

I respond ""No, you're fine.""

I haven't been here before. This is outside of the Milky Way for me. I don't know why I'm here, but I am now. I managed to utter ""I was wondering...""

I held her gaze for that moment and my mind went blank. I look down. If I ever blushed in my life, I'm sure I did right then. By now, the cashier on aisle 2 is now available and her friend gets the go ahead. Her friend goes ahead, and I felt the pressure that she needed to move on. I think she was smiling. I didn't know whether she thought it was funny or that she was pleasantly surprised. I attempt to recover from what felt like an age long stumble. I make eye contact again and say ""I know these are weird times, but I think you're pretty and I was wondering if I could have your number.""

She waits for me to finish and replies ""Thanks! I think you look good too. But I'm actually seeing someone right now.""

The globe that Atlas was carrying disappeared from my shoulders in an instant. I was rejected, but I felt that she was somewhat interested, which was way more than I could ask for. I didn't even think about the scenario where she rejects me. At the very least, she wasn't creeped out by me. In order to not hold up her or the line, I respond to her ""No worries. Have a good day"" with a smile.

""You too."" She says, before pushing her cart towards the cashier on aisle 2.

A few moments later, the cashier on aisle 1 opens up. This meant I would have to walk past her and her friends.

I walk towards aisle 1. She notices me, looks up from her groceries and waves. I smile back, not realizing if she could see it or not since I had my mask on. I finish checking out pretty quickly. I look over and it appears they were still checking out. I proceed to make my way to my car, which was parked right outside the storefront.

As I was bagging my groceries in my car, they exit the store and make their way to their car, which was only about 3 or 4 spots left of mine. At this moment, I realize I asked her for her number without really knowing literally anything about her. Do I follow up at this point? I finish loading up my groceries and am now facing my car from the driver's side, away from them. My mind is telling me to talk to her again. I take out my phone in an attempt to look natural, look at the shopping list and tick off the last item on there. It was star anise, the ingredient that made the stars align for an opportunity to talk to her.

I turn around and walk towards her. She is now in a circle with her friends around their cart and behind their car. She notices me. I wave. I approach her again and I think this caught her off guard.

""It just occurred to me that I didn't ask you your name. What's your name?"" I say, much more naturally than I did before.

""My name is L."" She says with what I think was a smile underneath her mask from what I could see from her eyes and hear in her voice.

""L?"" I ask to confirm. She nods. ""My name is D. Have a good weekend, L."" I say before turning around and walking away.

Her friends didn't seem to want to participate in the conversation and didn't acknowledge me. I unintentionally didn't acknowledge them either. I hop in my car and drive home. So many thoughts raced through my head. I was thinking I could've made a joke about how I thought she was pretty even though she's wearing a mask or how I should've talked about something else before asking for her number, but I didn't have that much time to work with. I was also thinking about how I stumbled.

Despite my thoughts, what I was feeling was pure ecstasy. I had a stupid smile on my face. I shouted in excitement in the solitary confinement of my car. I was rejected, but I felt a ton of confidence and optimism, or what I would jokingly describe as big dick energy. I was content that I did what I had never done and thought I would never do. She said I looked good and she sounded very genuine. A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

I am now at home typing this up while my beef noodle soup is simmering in the kitchen, watched a ton of anime fight scenes to find a scene that had characters monologuing to themselves about how their body couldn't move. I can't wait to eat my beef noodle soup.

TL;DR: I ask a girl that I don't know for her number. I didn't get her number, but I felt great despite it.",24May2020,1
114,I’m high risk for corona and so are two of my household members. I live in America where it hasn’t been handled super well and everyone is trouncing about like there isn’t a virus at all. Not to mention my state decided to reopen most businesses a few weeks ago. I’ve been struggling with my mental health and being cooped up in the house for now four months. It weirdly helped that everyone else was restricted too. Obviously ideally everyone wouldn’t be and this virus wouldn’t be a problem but while everything it’s getting reopened for other people my quarantine is still indefinite. There’s no end in sight. I’m just stuck here waiting. Day in and day out. And I feel lonelier than ever. My boyfriend is a healthcare worker and I haven’t seen him in five months. I would never restrict him or tell him he couldn’t go out but with things opening up he’s been going out again and I’m so jealous that he can. At this point I feel like I’m more dead than alive. I usually try my best to be optimistic and look at the bright side but it’s getting harder and harder.,24May2020,1

I  followed everyone's favorite advice aka: do what you love so you won't  think too much about it and be happy still. That only works if you at  least have the ability to enter a relationship and feel companionship  from time to time.

I'm a 33 year  old virgin, got shot down every time I asked someone out. I don't blame  them, I'm far from beign an interesting person. But doing everything  alone, even what you love, feels empty after a while. Why keep traveling  if I have no one to share it with? I come home to the only room in my  house I like, the bibliothek, to read so I can forget about my own  existence.

My only good memories  stem from books, video games, music, theater. In other words, from  stories that don't exist, of my real life I have nothing I can look back  upon with pride. I respect and like characters in books, I am unable to  understand people when I see them face to face.

I  got fit, joined clubs, went to therapy, all in the idea that even if I  don't find someone, at least I will have done/learnt something, and for a  while it worked. But after 33 years, even that doesn't mean anything  anymore. I'm human, I want companionship, it's a basic part of  existence.

And if I can't have  that, then I will quit life on my own terms. I put my date at 35, it  leaves me time to finish some books and finish refurbishing the  bibliothek, and then I'm off. Because a lonely life isn't worth it.",24May2020,1

I am looking for a job for ages now but nothing so far and I know, I know I should enjoy every moment at home with my babies but I just crave some time for myself. I just want to be challenged again in a good way, have something for myself and myself alone, have the feeling again I am a human being and not only a mom.

118,"I say ""almost"" as in, these people do represent some groups who form communities within themselves, radical ideologues and the like (islamists, nazis, incels etc...) 

Now, to the point of this post. 

We see it all the time. Someone makes a stupid video, says they don't like one hobby or another, they criticize something from an outsiders perspective that's riddled with mistakes or they just make a bad spirited bullshit claim about a community specifically to fish for these reactions to put themselves in the limelight. 

But so often we see this happen and we hear representatives of these groups that the death threats are coming from stepping forward and trying to "" call off the dogs"" so to speak. But it has little if any effect. Why? 

Because most of those making death threats and the like, aren't part of these communities. They're outside actors. They are attracted by drama, tension and conflict, they insert themselves into these communities and act like they're a passionate member when in reality, they're just there to get their kicks. They get a thrill out of wanting to make someone scared. These cretins can be found in every community, those who are just looking for a reason to go after someone, people just looking for a target, they are the same people who gatekeep and try to perform ""purity tests"" on members of their own communities when not given an outside target. 

These people are highly prevalent within extremely popular communities like gaming and sports, toxic gamers are more visible online because gaming has always had a presence online, the internet is it's home. But you see this same toxicity when fans of different teams have punch-ups at sports games and hurl abuse at eachother. However these people do not make up anywhere near a majority of either communities, but they like to kick up a storm and make a scene so they're more visible than the regular people just enjoying a hobby or activity.

121,"This is going to be a lot, so thank you to whoever sticks with me. 

After 15 years of actively searching for whatever my problem is, I was diagnosed with ADHD. My then psychiatrist curiously prescribed Adderall, and about 2 hours later, I saw the world for the very first time. While I continue to fight ADHD on a daily basis, without this development, I would not have achieved the level of functionality that I have.

Despite this life-changing revelation and the significant progress that followed as a result, Quarantine came into effect weeks later. 

My father, who makes good money and supports us diligently, is beginning to think he'll lose his job by the end of the year. He's got money saved so he says we're ok. I'm relieved that he'll have the house paid off in a few months.

All of this has progressively made me think more and more about getting back to self-sustainability. Living through a crisis and managing ADHD on a daily basis has me teetering all the time, and while I'm exceptionally good at keeping myself level now, I find that I'm absolutely terrified whenever I look into my future. I have no idea what I'm going to do; I don't know how I'm going to make money, how I'm going to get my own place, how I'm going to fall in love, how I'm going to be my own person. I'm scared because I'm lost in familiar territory. 

Let me be clear: **I am not suicidal**. My psychological state is a fragile one for many reasons, but I have a strong understanding of who I am and I value him intensely. I have *far* too much to do in my life before I go anywhere, I just don't know how I'm going to *do* it. I know that this involves focusing on your strengths, your weaknesses, and figuring out how to capitalize on them, but *I have ADHD*. On the list of my strong suits, ""focusing"" and ""paying attention"" are starkly missing. Imposter syndrome doesn't help either. 

I'm not worried that I'll never get there; I know I will. I want it too much. I just have no idea where to start. So, please, if you can provide any insight or guidance, now's the time I need it most. 

Thanks again for sticking with me.",24May2020,1

124,"Hey guys. I just need someone to talk to so I thought I'd write this out. I just feel so lonely right now  I have a couple of online friends but I still feel so distant from them. I don't feel like there's much of a connection.

I don't know how I would stop this feeling, people just don't seem to like me very much. My online friend told me the other day that I radiate shyness, and it's really obvious. That made me feel so bad because I've been really working on improving my shyness and social skills, but it never seems to get better.

Last summer I met this girl and we went on two dates, nothing happened and I think she only went because she didn't want me to feel bad.

I miss her a lot because she ghosted me soon after the second date. I didn't even know her super well but I still think about her all the time, even though it was a while ago that it happened.

I just really thought we had a connection, but it was just all in my head. It made me feel so bad. I'd give anything to get another chance with her. 

So anyways, I just wish there was someone who I could have a real connection with. I have felt so alone for years and years. I'm in college and don't even have any real friends. I just want to cry but I can't.",24May2020,1
126,"I've noticed over the past year that I tend to tear up and cry over the smallest things... I could be perfectly fine then someone would speak to me in a different tone and I'd start tearing up

for example my mom would ask me how I'm doing in a class and I'd remember the last quiz we had and that I did bad on it and start tearing up... even though I'm not worried about my overall mark, that one quiz would get me down. I wasn't even upset when I first got the mark back but it was when she asked about it I suddenly felt disappointed in myself and my mind would head down a rabbit hole of how i'm a failure

another time was when I lost a package from the small online shop I'm running and had to refund the buyer... I was ranting to my dad and he commented that it was ok since I wasn't going to make that much money from it anyway which was true and i know he was just trying to make light of the situation but I started crying bc I felt pathetic for making so little and contemplated closing my shop since it wasn't a real job

sometimes I'd be on social media and see all these good looking ppl and feel really bad about the way I look to the point where I start crying... sometimes I'm fine and love appreciating how everyone looks and love seeing ppl confident about themselves but other times I take it personally and get really down and end up thinking about how I have nothing going for me

if my bf doesn't call me when we usually do or just sounds bored talking to me I'd feel really sad wondering if he really likes me or if I did something wrong and start crying

I know these are all irrational things to cry over and I do my best to try to ignore them and not let them affect the ppl around me but I'd still feel sad and start wondering what's wrong with me... it's hard bc the things I think to myself that really bring me down are true...

127,"I am on Reddit because I want to find people who will challenge my beliefs in a good faith effort to help me expand my thinking.  I've found this doesn't work too well in the Reddit world because many people downvote others simply for having a different belief than themselves.  I have seen some subreddits that are managed to avoid new accounts to limit this kind of trolling behavior.  I think that is a good goal, but it has worked against me in that I am not able to get to the Karma level required to participate in those subreddits. 

I suppose the easy answer is to go to a subreddit where you know most people agree with you.  Perhaps I need to do that.  But that would be unfortunate because I hate putting myself into a bubble environment where everyone believes the same thing.  That is how people become brainwashed.

I hope to find some friends who have different beliefs from me that will participate in civilized and intellectual discussions about meaningful topics.  Obviously, politics, culture and religion are important subjects, but I'm open to other topics.

So we spoke and I let her know, and she let me know she is concerned about how things would progress as she doesn't want another close person in her life that has an illness, so I think shes out of being anything with me since her texts now come off as dull and uninterested and hasn't reached out to me...the slow ghosting.
