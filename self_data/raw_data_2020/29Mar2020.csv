My future sister-in-law's boyfriend has been asked by his family to social distance as his family have high risk members, and as much as I want to spend as much time as possible with him, my mum relies on me for travel to and from work, and essential shopping. Therefore we have decided today that when I go home on Monday morning to work, that we stay apart in our separate homes until the UK government lifts the partial lock down. Not only for everyone's safety but it's not fair for sister-in-law not being able to see her boyfriend but her brother can see me. 

We hugged, we cried, he got grumpy and quiet, but we both knew it was the right decision to make for everyone involved immediately and peripherally.

There's no real point to this other than this all fucking sucks my dudes. Stay safe out there in this really strange reality where you have to queue up to get into a supermarket and make essential journeys only.",29Mar2020,1

My True Story of DCFS Care written by Circusbabyisqueen

May 17 2018, I was taken out of the house for mistreating my mom and she called the cops and I was eventually taken to Lincoln Prairie Behavioral Health Center and about 2 weeks later at the end of May,  I was told by my mom that somebody had called DCFS and they came to my home and forcefully took me from her.   


 June of 2018, this one kid named Antonio was bullying (this is when the bullying started). I was being hit, I was being punched in the head, and stomach. Sometimes I was even bleeding from the nose so I had spoken with my mom and asked her what to do about this and she told me to tell the staff to move me. So they eventually moved me to the little kids side for a day. The day after I was put back even though I said I didn’t want to go.  
 September 2018 i was finally moved out of Lincoln Prairie and was put in Campagna Academy which was *HELL.* For the first couple of weeks I was being aggressively punched and hit and had continuous nose bleeds and was thrown to the floor and got hit in the stomach and I had to eat out of the trash cause the kids were throwing my food away.  I was crying and being in my rooms 99% of the time i was also thinking of running away even tho i know now I had nowhere to go i was getting referral after referral so i was moved to Cottage 5 but i was still at Campanga Academy.   
\-October 2018 I was crying in my room all the time and was having fits.   
\-November 2018 I was improving little by little but iwas still having bad thoughts and sad memories of c4.  
\- The next couple of months the other kids were fighting the staff and messing up the place and I was trying to stay calm but I was having some trouble staying in peace because of all the trouble the other kids were doing. I was hitting some of the staff and was still trying to stay calm by listening to music.  
\-September 14 2019 I was moved into IAG which is where I am now and I am having a lot better time but I’m still sad because I can't go home.  
\-October 2019 I started back at school in the 11th grade and I was having fun until a couple of days before the last court meeting.  I was being a jerk and threw a fit and almost hit a boy but I calmed down after.  
\- Next couple of months I was having fun and playing games and going out a lot and now im hoping I can come home soon so I can get out of DCFS.  
\-Okay, as I said in my last sentence “so I can get out of DCFS” there supposed to be caring and not let people hurt kids. But why am I writing this? it's because they have been mistreating me and I feel I have some rights to the DCFS care, right?

Since the beginning of our school year, I had this idea that I will record some clips throughout the year and compile them together to make a video. Im upset that I wasn’t able to get any more clips, but I was able to make it work. 

As a result, I’m personally really proud of this project. I know some people can easily take complications of videos and turn them into one full video, but it’s something different when you do it yourself.

18,"White Fragility is a sociological term created by Robin DiAngelo, a white sociologist, to describe white people's seemingly inability to discuss race, caused by their avoidance and consequent discomfort of the topic. Here's the definition of White Fragility in her voice:

""[White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes 	intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include the outward display of 	emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and 	leaving the stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial 	equilibrium.](https://libjournal.uncg.edu/ijcp/article/viewFile/249/116)""

Here is the opening of a New Yorker article on the subject:

	""In more than twenty years of running diversity-training and cultural-competency workshops 	for American companies, the academic and educator Robin DiAngelo has noticed that white 	people are sensationally, histrionically bad at discussing racism. Like waves on sand, their 	reactions form predictable patterns: they will insist that they “were taught to treat everyone the 	same,” that they are “color-blind,” that they “don’t care if you are pink, purple, or polka-	dotted.” They will point to friends and family members of color, a history of civil-rights 	activism, or a more “salient” issue, such as class or gender. They will shout and bluster. They 	will cry. In 2011, DiAngelo coined the term “white fragility” to describe the disbelieving 	defensiveness that white people exhibit when their ideas about race and racism are challenged—	and particularly when they feel implicated in white supremacy. Why, she wondered, did her 	feedback prompt such resistance, as if the mention of racism were more offensive than the fact 	or practice of it?""",29Mar2020,1

We do more phone and video check ins with friends and family than we used to. 

And tonight, with our close group of two other couples that normally trade off having dinner and drinks at each others’ houses, we had a Zoom (web conference) dinner and drinks party. It was awkward getting used to a new medium, but it worked! We told the same silly jokes, ate dinner in front of each other at exactly 6 pm, laughed at each others’ quirks, kept refilling drinks, lived through getting bumped off the Internet multiple times, etc. At the end of the night my wife said “that was a lot better than watching a movie alone!”

And she was right.

31,"The US has decided to go down the unemployment insurance route and in turn millions are laid off and only get $1200. 

It would have made more sense to fund the businesses’ payroll in order to ensure employees aren’t laid off. This would have kept the American economy stagnant in terms of human cost of living —a good thing in a time like this. 

Unfortunately, 3.5 Million are unemployed due to mass panic and the lack of block grants appropriated towards business payroll. Now Americans will be receiving a non-recurring $1200 check from Uncle Sam and unemployment checks of at most $450 a week.

And I didn’t know what you expected from me if I’m being honest.  I was so happy to be talking to you for the first time after 7+ years.  I had thought about it for a long time.  But I was afraid you would be disappointed by the person I’d become.  That on top of how bad I felt about how I acted when we ended things and how I acted in general when we were together even though it was years ago now. I’ve wanted to apologize for all of that for so long but I’ve never been able to say it. I was young, dumb, selfish, immature and many other things back then to say the least. I regret all of that on a daily basis now.  Unfortunately I can’t change any of that.  Part of me really wishes I could just say that to you and who knows maybe we would make plans to meet up again but a bigger part of me feels like I shouldn’t say anything because I don’t want to come across as weird or overbearing, irrationally emotional, etc. and I just feel like it’s too late now. But I also know I’m never going to stop wondering about it....I’m not sure if I will ever have feelings for anyone the same way I had feelings for you and honestly that hurts a lot to think about and the fact that I can’t say that to you hurts a lot too. I know that a part of me will always care for you no matter what happens even if you don’t have the same feelings and that’s fine.

34," This is what I tell people who can't understand why I don't speak to my mother. I know some people have the mindset thinking that you should always love your parents and parents always love their children. But that's not realistic. 

 I spent 32 years asking myself why the person who is supposed to be hardwired to love me, does not.

I spent 32 years thinking that if this person who is supposed to be hardwired to love me, does not... then obviously it's because I am a piece of shit. I am unworthy of the love of the only person who (I thought) was supposed to love me unconditionally, therefore I am unworthy in general.

32 years trying to get my mother to love me really fucked me up. It is so hard for me to accept that anyone likes me. it's really hard for me to accept that anyone likes anything about me or anything that I say or do.

I'm 35 now. In three years I've come so far. I realized some things about myself now that I don't have that overwhelming feeling of being not good enough...

I can sew. I can embroider. I can cook. I'm very good at editing images and creating digital art. I'm a good friend and a loving girlfriend. And most of all, I can clearly see that the people around me do like me and do love me.

This has netted me a lot of money, especially as a student struggling to pay rent.

I've been facing a lot of ethical issues such as whether or not this is considered price gouging, if i should be taking advantage of this crisis, if its wrong to be taking advantage of public fear, etc.

But, there’s one thing (or should I say person) that’s been putting a damper on this situation. My boyfriend’s friend, we’ll call him C, has been staying at our place on and off for the last three-ish months (since we moved in). Normally, I wouldn’t mind, if it wasn’t so often and unannounced. Plus, it’s not like he doesn’t have a place to stay, he has a room with other friends of ours. 

Lately I’ve been getting pretty uncomfortable about it and I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend about it too. He agrees with me, but won’t do anything. 

Anyway since the corona virus has been going around I haven’t been able to go to work so I’ve been at home all day everyday, and so has C. I’m a type 1 diabetic and I have asthma so it’s really not a good idea for me to be around people like C. C, for work would play music in bars or would go do some cow and sheep stuff out in the country (we live in rural Idaho). But he comes and goes as he pleases and I really can’t take the chance to get sick. Plus he drives me batshit crazy:/. 

He uses our shower stuff, eats a lot of our food, and sleeps on our couch all night and part of the day. I can’t walk around my house without wanting to pull my hair out because his crap is all over the living room floor!

It’s hard for me to put my foot down, C is my boyfriends friend, and I don’t want to hurt C feelings or make him think that I hate him. I like him with normal circumstances, but I need this to stop.

48,"Who are you, who you are

I’ve realized a lot, which would be surprising to most people considering I’m only 18 years old. I’ve learned about pain, struggles, happiness and so much more. Yet, the biggest thing I’ve come to learn is that your age, ethnicity, social status, disabilities or anything like that. They don’t change who you are. 

I for one tend question myself a little too much. Whether what I’m doing is right or if what I do will please others, how it will impact their and even my own daily lifestyle. Yet none of that is important. We come to love many people and despise even more. Yet at what cost? Temporary joy and love only leaves one hoping for more, for something they may never acquire. As well as hatred leaving one broken and feeling as though life or they themselves have no meaning. 

Yet we are all only human. We have and always had a troublesome history. Even with so many clear solutions. We tend to think that forgiving means forgetting. That letting go of an old grudge means that someone who you once felt a sense of hate for can be someone you allow back into your life. That’s far from the truth. 

The truth is that there isn’t one set standard of life. There isn’t one way of viewing things or just one meaningless or even meaningful way of living. I for one catch myself judging those around me for not meeting up to my standards when I’m reality, my standards aren’t even proper. If someone chooses to follow a path in which they believe in God, while others choose to believe in things such as The Universe being the one and only thing allowed to control and judge. Whatever religion or belief or life someone lives. Is up to them. 

Some people do live their lives calmly allowing others to follow their own path while other tend to enforce what they deem fit and true onto someone else. I just want you to know that even then. Whatever you choose to do, whoever you choose to be, whatever you choose to follow and believe. Life will always be hard or easy in the eyes of many but stay true to yourself. If it works for you, if it is something that makes you happy then no one has any right to judge you for what you do because we all see life differently. That doesn’t mean that murder or anything malevolent or malicious is okay. Yet it does mean that who you are is. 

Live life true to yourself, be who you are and what you are. No one is better than anyone, no one deserves more than anyone and no one is entitled to more than another. At the end of it all, rich, poor, or any skin color that one can think of. We are all only human, and as such, we all bleed red. Love and respect those around you.

She picks fights bout the stupidest, smallest things, gets into everyone else's business, is VERY moody, and the only thing she does around the house that's useful is make dinner once in a while.

She always says that she wishes that she could work, and that oh yeah eventually she'll stop smoking and go to the gym, but HA that's BULLSHIT. With how much shes been at smoking, she can barely walk a few steps without breathing like a dog, probably as bad of breath too. She sits on her old fatass all day watching tv while coughing up a shitstorm, and complains everytime either of us leaves ONE FUCKING BOWL IN THE SINK, jumps to conclusions and blames everyone for something that wasnt true, and she looovvesss to talk bout herself and how disabled she is, and so on and so on.

Well my bf got fed up with her cause she told his mom something he said that he didnt actually say, and she says shit like that all the time, so he confronted her and told her to knock it off and THAR SHE BLOWS. She is the #1 worst when it comes to yelling and screaming cause she'll yell at the top of her lungs. She kept insulting him and straight up telling him that he should continue to ""take advantage of me"" with the money I got from the government. (I make a little more than him atm, I just like to make sure my man has something to eat).

She has the audacity to mention the only free money I have ever gotten, which saved my ass on bills and I am thankful for, when she doesnt have to do SHIT. She just magically gets it for being disabled. She tries to use my benefits against him in the stupid argument. That's when he fuckin lost it. He was yelling and throwing a couple things cause we all have to put up with her shit and we've had it. And her bringing me up in the argument triggered him like how dare she. She keeps saying in every big argument stuff like ""yeah go ahead! Hit me! Do it!"" And its fuckin annoying, especially when she says it in the corner of the kitchen next to the hallway to her room like a fuckin coward.

Whenever I'm mad, my mind goes into a blur, words dont form or stick good besides some cursing or insults, I'm just incredibly angry and that makes me want to physically lash out. Except I cant just hit people without there being consequences, so I am in this very agitating, frustrated state of not being able to do anything. I yell at her to stop while his mom tries to keep him from charging over there. It eventually ends and she goes into her room and slams the door.

He calms down, but I dont. I hate being so controlled. I get so pissed off that I end up not doing much or embracing my rage at the moment, but arguments always happen fast and out of nowhere. But next time she picks a fight or dares to try to complain to me about something, I'm going to give her a nice bitch slap, esPECIALLY, if she taunts by telling either of us to hit her cause of course she doesnt believe either of us will. Well guess what u cunt, I dont care anymore. I'm not going to ignore confrontation or problems, or pretend everything's fine, I'm going to give her what she fuckin deserves in the form of a bitch slap if not some hair pulling to pull her to the ground and kick tf out of her fatass.

Im not going to tolerate any more verbal abuse and stress and anxiety from her anymore. My mental state has effected my physical health once before, but it's gotten even worse these past couple weeks because of the financial stress I was under. There isnt a day that goes by where I dont feel a lot of mental pain or physical misery because of my anxiety and depression. I just want to sleep in an actual bed again(we pull a mattress up from the basement). My own place. Without it smelling like smoke. Alone with my bf. Not having to live with a fat whore anymore. Just a couple more months at LEAST, then we'll be able to move out. And yes if you haven't noticed, I have anger management issues lol.

Does anyone else have similar experiences? Any knowledge of anything besides drinking like medications I can take without a prescription for my anxiety so something can help me not give as much of a fuck as I do and help calm me down? Any tips to help anger or how to deal with bitches?",29Mar2020,1

59,Hello I’m new to reddit and of August 2019 is when this situation emerged into my family’s lives and I just want to know what you guys have to say about my family’s situation. So basically my father who is in his 80s was accused of touching my sisters when they were younger which he went to jail for and got out with bond. We are adopted so we are young for having pretty old parents  which are both in there 80’s. When everything went down I went to go live at my friends house while my 3 sisters moved in to live with my older sister who has an apartment. My sisters apartment has no room at all so it’s not like I could move in with them so I’ve been currently living with my parents which I’m allowed to since I’m 18. I talk to my parents as least as possible sometimes going a couple days without talking to them and sometimes small talk every now and then. Also forgot to mention my sister told me my mom knew about my dad fondling my one of my sisters. I’ve never felt close to my family even before all this happened so now that this has happened i feel even farther from them. I don’t talk to my siblings much and don’t visit them much. Is something wrong with me since I’m not close with them? I’ve thought about it and I feel like it’s maybe due to them not being blood to me and i always have trouble talking to my sisters even before all this stuff with my dad happened. The only told I felt close was when I was at a young age.,29Mar2020,1
61," honestly i am not looking for boosting my ego, but

i feel way more attractive around guys than around girls

im not gay, but i just can't help but feel how my presence affects other guys.

some of them get nervous, some of them feel uncomfortable, many of them are nice to me for no reason. tho also some of them get triggered by me easily, want to fight me, have eyes full of hate. all in all, i get way more attention from guys than girls

girls have treated me shit all my life

also another question, can a girl ignore you or even treat you badly in response to you not caring about her?

cuz honestly, i have noticed that lots of girl have started liking me only after i started paying attention to them (by paying attention i mean just maybe making a brief eye contact)

i have never ever called a girl ugly (even tho they have done it to me) but they have always been mean to me like i actually have done it. honestly, i really haven't cared much about most girls around me all my life, cuz i honestly i didn't think that they were attractive, i didn't take them seriously. tho again i have NEVER directly said it, did they sense it and did it trigger them?

its so weird and frustrating. lowkey girls are the reason why i had/have some insecurities in my life, cuz they have treated me like shit.

like, i always get that vibe from most girls. like they're doing it on purpose, like they're trying to prove something to me. just to piss me off.",29Mar2020,1
62,"I recently just completed my last prac at a highschool in a low socio-economic area. This school has 72% of students from different countires who barely speak English, however I had one student who is deaf on top of this and never learned his first language. He has just started to learn some English and works along side a teacher aide to get by in most classes. On my final class with him in it ( it was a drama class), I had the whole class playing theatre sports and he was a little quiet at first. We were playing competitive charades where two teams were competing to show a secret word (it was cat) and he was the first one to call out cat. The whole class (very small class) was very shocked because he doesn't often speak, but they erupted in happiness for him, so did I! He was included in every moment of the class and the rest of the students encouraged his participation in games. It was really wholesome to see. His teacher aide told me it was the happiest she had ever seen him in any of his classes and I'm just really happy I gave this student a fun lesson when he felt included by his peers.

63,"My dream is to be an English teacher in Japan. When I look at the JET program (a program for foreigners teaching foreign languages in Japan) I'm confused by the warning of, once you've been applied, having to teach in Japan for at least a year, and you need to be ready for that. I'm more than ready, in fact I'm willing to spend five years in University studying to become an English teacher in order to achieve that goal. The problem is that even if it's something I wanna do (and have wanted to for all my 3 years in high school), I feel overwhelmed. Like I won't make it or I won't be able to handle a classroom setting.

(I am, of course, Swedish, or I wouldn't be able to go to university in the first place since it's for free over here)

It has nothing to do with me secretly wanting to do other jobs, in fact every job feels like it's too much for me, even working as a janitor feels like something I'm completely incapable of doing.

65,"Some of the parents and teachers in the district had been circling a letter to be signed as a form of petition to encourage the school board to start the high school day no earlier than 9:00am. 

Studies showed without contest that teens biologically need to go to sleep later than child, or even adults, as their biorhythms adapt through puberty. 

The official scientific position on this issue is that academics and morale improve when students are able to fall asleep later and wake up later to get a full eight hours. 

Why did the board reject the petition? Because then they’d have to potentially pay to install flood lights on the practice athletics fields, not just the game one, and because (I’m actually quoting verbatim here) “That’s how it’s always been so why should we change it? Never too early for these kids to learn that life isn’t fair.”

Our community members in positions of power saw an opportunity to better the lives of our students by making a single decision that could be immediately implemented, and they pass up on it because they didn’t want to eat into the sports budget and “life isn’t fair.” 

Three doctors and two sleep researchers Skyped into the school board meeting. Brave, impassioned students spoke up. Parents organized together to promote this measure. And it meant nothing to these people. 

I am bitterly disappointed in the solipsistic short sightedness of the school board. We should no longer label ourselves as student-centric if we don’t do things we know to be in their best interest because “life isn’t fair.”

76,"It's only day 6 of lockdown where I am, and I'm already losing the will to live. I feel really guilty for complaining because a lot of people have it a lot worse than me, but I am struggling 😭

I live with my dad, but I've only been here for a year since my mum and stepdad moved 100 miles away and I didnt want to follow after I finished uni.
So I'm currently in lockdown with my stepmum who I dont have a lot in common with and have only known about 2 years and my little sister who is fast approaching the terrible twos.

My stepmum expects me to be free childcare since my office is shut until further notice, and my dad expects me to do anything he ask me to, since hes still working.

I have to be a specific version of myself when I'm here that pleases them, and it's getting so tiring. I get made to feel guilty for doing my own thing, I always have to be ON and ready to chat or discipline or play or cook or clean. It's so tiring.

I'm getting really irritable because I just want to do my own thing, but of course I cant show it because I dont dare be arsey with my dad, and it's not worth the shit off my stepmum if I am with her.

If I'm even the slightest bit different you can bet I'll get a comment about it the next day, for example on fridays morning I woke up naturally at 10:30. I didnt think that was too bad considering I dont have any responsibilities, and it wasnt horrifically late like post 12pm. But apparently it wasnt good enough because last night my stepmum told me to not stay up past 11pm on Facebook video chat to my friends, because ""obviously you'll end up in bed most of the day again.""

Its just not necessary, I'd already sat freezing in the garden for 2 hours on the chat because I couldnt be downstairs because it would distract them from watching telly, and it would wake my sister up if I were upstairs. I came inside after they went to bed and stayed in the chat with a headset on so I could talk quietly without disturbing anyone.


As I'm sat here typing this my sister is terrorizing the cat and my stepmum is ignoring it so once again it's up to me to discipline her.

God help me when the new baby gets here in a week or so, and when my stepmum opens  her childminding from home again for children of key workers, I've already been told that ""you'll be fine looking after the kids because the girl that's coming is your sisters age, so you know how to look after them."" So I'll be doing her job for her.

I'm an American, now living in Weihai, China. I'm honestly feeling something along the lines of ""survivor's guilt."" My city here just ended a 2 month lockdown and while I should feel relieved, I've been still been as anxious as before - but now I worry for everyone else. Seeing what's being done in the US makes me so sad because I actually *know* it's not enough as I've seen the actions it took for my city to fight the coronavirus and it was next level.

I've tried to find some purpose in this by posting articles/tips/advice to help give others encouragement, but I still feel very helpless.

I hate how it's not fair that I can just go to the pharmacy downstairs where I live and buy hundreds of masks while there are medical workers in the US who are wearing trash bags and grocery store workers wearing nothing at all. I hate how I know just one factory alone in my city can produce 70,000 masks while Americans are having to sew their own. 

I know how effective masks were here when the whole society was wearing it, so I'd love to just send masks to everyone in the US at this point - not just the essential workers. Except - aghhhhhh - *LOGISTICS.* 

I donated 200 3 ply masks last week to my parents in the US to distribute amongst their friends and other family members. That was easy because I was able to eat the cost and I knew who to ship them to, but my husband said we can't afford to do that again.. 10 regular 3-ply masks masks cost $4 while just 1 KN95 costs $2. Shipping costs $38. I want to send more but I don't know how to do this on my own.

**YOU CAN SKIP TO THIS PART: ACTUAL QUESTIONS**

I'm confused by how to go about sending PPE like masks, gloves, goggles, temperature guns, etc. Do I create fundraiser? (^(But I feel weird accepting money directly!)) And then there's the how? Facebook? GoFundMe? Who do I send everything to? Do I contact hospitals directly? City halls? Would everyday citizens even bother to wear masks if they were sent? What kind of masks are needed for essential workers?

i had troubles opening up with new people for a while, for most of my teen years. people used to think that i was being a dick, or cooler than them when i didn't share much stuff about me, and it fucks you up to, being misunderstood. basically around 16 i started overcoming it and now at 18 im surely fully over it. but it kinda does mess you up. beats you off of your rail. and its hard getting back.

tho i got way good at it, probably, knowing that it was something i sucked at i concetrated all of my energy on it and thats why.

anger and hatred definitely helped a lot. it definitely drove me a bit crazy, but it definitely gave me that killer mindset.

also, i do get nervous when walking past a group of guys. tho isn't it kinda natural? its not that i go crazy, but a bit of adrenaline does rush in. i mean it happens in animals too. if a lone lion is around a whole pride it will have the same reaction, anyways.

honestly, it might be just a teen thing, cuz i do see lots of similarities in other peers as well, getting nervous around others. but i still get this thing being on the streets. waiting for a bus for example. thoughts in my head are like: ""am i standing weird?; should i sit down somewhere?"" and etc, imagining certain people laughing at me, honestly it depends on the day as well, and even when it kicks in i can handle it, tho my palms still get sweaty. honestly it didn't used to happen to me as a child, even after getting bullied, so puberty i guess.

also, i do get nervous when walking past a group of guys. tho isn't it kinda natural? its not that i go crazy, but a bit of adrenaline does rush in. i mean it happens in animals too. if a lone lion is around a whole pride it will have the same reaction, anyways.

its not that im afraid of anyone or anything like that. it has taught me lots of things. honestly, it made me a bit too harsh, but still.

btw, is it weird that before leaving home i have my fucking fighting spirit rise up? am i not overreacting? i mean im just going out.

tho honestly, i always catch everyone's attention. and if i show that im scared they strike. don't know why but i literally attract that type of negative shit. but again, i literally am ready to kill a man when i leave a house. that's how my mindset has changed.

honestly, it might be just a teen thing, cuz i do see lots of similarities in other peers as well, getting nervous around others. but i still get this thing being on the streets. waiting for a bus for example. thoughts in my head are like: ""am i standing weird?; should i sit down somewhere?"" and etc, imagining certain people laughing at me, honestly it depends on the day as well, and even when it kicks in i can handle it, tho my palms still get sweaty. honestly it didn't used to happen to me as a child, even after getting bullied, so puberty i guess.

also, i do get nervous when walking past a group of guys. tho isn't it kinda natural? its not that i go crazy, but a bit of adrenaline does rush in. i mean it happens in animals too. if a lone lion is around a whole pride it will have the same reaction, anyways.

its not that im afraid of anyone or anything like that. it has taught me lots of things. honestly, it made me a bit too harsh, but still.

btw, is it weird that before leaving home i have my fucking fighting spirit rise up? am i not overreacting? i mean im just going out.

Anyways. I still have to go to work and it's from 4 am to 11 pm now. I did not a single thing there because I am the one who takes appointments. Since most customers will call or write a mail, I had nothing to do. I draw in my office the whole time till I was allowed to leave.

At home I didn't do shit either. I am a hobby writer and author and I two weeks I didn't write a single word.

I drank energy drinks, I had a bit more sex then usually and I spend most of my time on the couch watching movies with my kids.

This situation is putting a lot of strain my my body and my mind. I am tired at 6 pm and that's very unusual for me. I don't go out since there are too many people out there (still) and I care about the health of my kids. We ate mostly just fruits, instant soups and stuff from a delivery service, since neither I nor my girlfriend want to cook and it's a mess at home because no one wants to clean up.

I still feel proud. I am not one of these ultra cautious people who walk around with a mask because I don't really fear the virus. It's feels like holy days on a cold December. You just don't want to stand up or to do anything, and still feel good every evening.",29Mar2020,1

Why do I have to be worried when I go out and have my guard app all the time that I can’t even relax. Life would’ve been easier if I was born a man.
I do housework cuz I’m a girl and my brothers does nothing to help but instead they trash and I have to clean after them even thou they’re all adults over 20 years old and have a job and I’m just 16. Whenever I ask my mom she tells me I am a girl and they’re guys ! But why do I have to fucking fold their clothes and put them in their own closet ? Can’t they do that? Is that too heavy for them ? Even thou the go to the gym and be all muscly and puff . I can’t go out if I want and I can’t enjoy life because im a girl. And no matter what I do men will be “ superior “ I’m always in wonderland in my mind that when I come to reality it slaps me hard as fuck and I feel like I’m done with this shit. 
I just sometimes wish I was never born so I don’t have to go through this. My parents are divorced , I was abused by my father and now I’m a maid. My mom does give me allowance and bought me a switch when I wanted one but tbh she can have it back if she’ll give me freedom and not make me work. The problem is my sisters are brainwashed so I’m the exotic one here and now I just never talk back and I just feel frustrated inside. I fucking hate my life . I don’t wanna keep living like this. If I weren’t born it would’ve been better . I wouldn’t have gone through all this and I’m only 16 ! Isn’t this the age that I should be happy and carefree? Why am I going through all this already ? I’m just ducking done with all this shit. I’m done. I hate seeing women being raped all over the world and no one caring instead people be telling these women to cover themselves so they don’t get raped. Women have to go through a lot and I’m not strong enough. I pretend to be strong but tbh I can’t handle this anymore and I don’t have to handle all this shit. I’m fucking depressed and I can’t even tell anyone fuck. Why have kids if u can’t look after them ? Why have kids if u won’t give them the emotional support they need ? I’m a very emotional person and I live in fantasy a lot so my mom called me crazy once I laughed but that really hurts. I act everyday like I’m happy but I’m not . I act dumb to forget all the shit going on . Nobody knows what I’m going through and I don’t want anyone to know. Sometimes I wish to disappear quietly .

146,"I've been an asshole with girls through my life. Like I act really creepy cause ima nerd but I don't look like one I guess. So here it goes.

1st incident goes back to my school days. This new girl joined our school in 7th grade and she was damn cute. Luckily she was my next roll number so I had few topics to talk about her randomly as well cause we both used to sing for thee school band. I was good with jokes and I never confessed but I gad a huge crush on her. So after the school ended I mean 4 years later we both got into different universities and still we talked we went out once and one day I asked her if she'd marry me if we both were 40 and single. It was the dumbest thing I did like I was 17 I guess. So it was awkward and she obviously laughed at it and said no and I we just stopped talking frequently but still now we talk sometimes over text and now shes got a boyfriend. Getting over her was not so hard cause we are close friends.

2nd incident is in my pre Universities. Saw this girl with curled hairs and I'm really bad at talking to girls randomly. So I didn't till the pre Universities was about to end. Everyone soul in my campus knew I liked her and my friends really forced me to tell her and I did and one who told me to tell her got to be her boyfriend later. Also she was taller than me so this was obvious too. She ran away when I went to talk to her infront of everyone so that was embarassing and I lost my confidence to talk to girls ""In real time"" that day

3rd incident is my universities first year. Saw this girl liked her, my entire class got to know somehow. No guts to talk to her so I just stared and now I'm a creep. I'm in my final semester haven't talked to her yet and won't either.

4th incident and the one that happened today. So as I couldn't speak to them in real life. I started talking to ones I could never meet in my life online and I met this one in September. Saw her here on reddit and texted her, she liked my posts too. We took off really good. Made offensive jokes and sometimes she liked when I made offensive jokes on her as well she roasted me few times too. We got to instagram. We got to whatsapp we got really close. I sorta was falling for her and then I had too much pressure around January sorta felt down so I was always sharing it with her and all of a sudden in Jan end she says she didn't like talking to me anymore and blocked me. So instead a being a gentleman and leaving her alone I made few fake accounts to talk to her and asked what the reason was. She scolded me I asked sorry multiple times I told her I was sick lies to her that day about a thing first time too I literally begged that day and she told me I was toxic and taking to me gave her anxiety. I once made a joke about suicide and she told that was the reason. Really felt bad that day cause I lost a best friend. But she was still following me through her art account and yesterday I accidentally hit video call but ended it and she saw that. Today I texted she said the same things ""talking to you gives me anxiety"" and just blocked me there as well. 

So those are the girls I've given mental torture to in my life. I just wanted to confess. If you've read this far let me hear your thoughts.",29Mar2020,1

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more fulfilling than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years so that the world might experience a radiant bundle of happiness and love. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it amplifies the joy everyone she meets shall experience when she greets them and takes precious time from her day to make theirs a little better.

Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? Everyone. Strangers on the street get a friendly bystander that will wish them well, the homeless will get a wealthy and intelligent girl that runs shelters to feed them and find them honest work to get off the streets. The lucky man or woman who marries her will get the perfect partner, and you'll benefit from gaining a second child in her spouse, one who will be a dear friend that thanks their lucky stars you raised such an astounding woman.

As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to grant your wondrous, miraculous daughter and all the people around her a better life. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL reward. Think about it logically",29Mar2020,1

157,"I've never wanted to be ""cool"" in a school. I wasnt a looser bit was neutral and everyone saw me as an ""book-person"".....while my actual life was amazing like a film or a story while my classmates life was doin nothing/drinking alcohol....Thats why i wasnt famous in a school. Time past and im in a university now. I started to show everything i have in life (in social media, i mean ive started to take more videos and fotos to share the happiness with an audience) im popular in social media now, im a successful student and also ive had an amazing glowup (forgot to tell that visually i wasnt attractive in school while now people even confuse when they see me) so my life become the same i always wanted to be. But now classmates are texting me and sayin ""You had uninteresting life why you are pretending like it was good?"" and even if im higher than them in almost any cases (facts only) it hurts me and i domt know why, the old thiughts and feeling surround me and can you give an advise how to ignore?",29Mar2020,1

160,"She's had it since she was 6 (she's 20 now), drinking a sip of water leads to anaphylactic shock, she has to drink other liquids like milk because the fats, proteins, sugars, etc. help to hide the water molecules from her immune system, so she can stay (sort of) hydrated. She has reactions internally but also on her skin as well. She's not allergic to chemicals in the water but to the actual water molecule itself (they did tests to confirm this when she was younger).

So she was feeling down because of this corona stuff going about (she can't drink water so she had to hoard juice and milk before the lockdown) so I bought her some DVD's and games and I also made her this stuffed toy plush of a water molecule that has a cute little face on it. It looks very similar to this pic (which I used as a reference!) https://imgur.com/a/oLLg2P0",29Mar2020,2

Women and men both deserve rights. It’s really not an opinion at this point, it’s just the right thing to do. Whether you are a guy or a girl or black or white you are still a HUMAN and nothing is going to change that. When people say that all men are rapists is absolutely dumb, those people are the people who think that standing less than three feet away from someone is rape. Most ideals and things taken as facts are wrong. Another note is that women can and have raped people before, it’s not like your “separate species” is pure and never causes crime. When women didn’t have right men didn’t treat them as equals butler didn’t treat them BAD. I mean at this point these feminists thing men are the spawn of the devil but in reality there are plenty of things that you couldn’t think about not having that men probably made or own the rights to. Also, no matter how much you think, the wage gap isn’t as bad as you say. Yes there are some dudes that are bad guys but most dudes aren’t anything like that. Some guys and girls would protect you no matter what. Police serve and protect everyone no matter if they are a boy or a girl. Maybe if you think there should be more girls in a job then maybe sign up for it yourself. Some jobs need certain skills and if more men or more women have those skills more than the opposite than that is just fine. Equality is what’s fair, and do what you can for your community whether you are a man or a woman but don’t try to do something you can’t or you could do more harm than good.",29Mar2020,0

164,"I had one similar to this last year where i was in a dream and torn between my bf and some random dude in my class and i couldn’t decide bc i “liked” them both in the dream and so the next morning i felt like an awful gf even tho i’ve NEVER thought about my former classmate in that way. Last night was similar, I was started seeing and falling for my friend’s crush whom i have NEVER EVER even thought about or considered attractive in my perspective but apparently my brain made me think i did bc i kept being affectionate towards him and we tried running away together but before we did i went to try to fix things with my bf (who wasn’t the same in the dream) and we did fix things by me telling him  “Hey i think we should go to dinner and talk so we can interact like we used to i really miss doing that” and he said “ Yeah sure i would love that!” so i AUTOMATICALLY was drowning in guilt bc of my “affair” and so i left the other dude and stayed with my boyfriend. The ONLY thing my brain got right was that i do miss talking to my bf in real life bc of the quarantine and school work so i guess that’s why it was in there but everything else has me speechless. Anyone might know what my brain is trying to tell me or if i’m seeing a vision??",29Mar2020,2

173,"Hey all, I’m looking for some ideas, advice, critiques, whatever you’ve got that could be relevant to this. 

For a few years now I’ve been growing cut flowers to make fresh bouquets. This year I had planned to begin selling at a farmers marker which means I’d already planned my garden out to have at least a hundred bouquets each week starting in roughly 7 weeks until the fall. Instead of doing the market (they might not even exist this year anyways) I would love to donate bouquets to people making a difference or perhaps just those who need cheered up. I’ve already got so many different flowers started or planned, and I just received over a hundred Dahlia tubers. I know these beautiful blooms can help make someone smile during these scary times. 

What kind of local places would be feasible for this? I’d like to first reach out to those making a difference during this pandemic, such as healthcare workers, foodbank volunteers, overlooked essential employees, etc. I know flowers aren’t anything life changing, and I do not want to trivialize the contributions of these people in any way so please let me know if you feel this could have a negative effect. I just really think some people out there could benefit from a little beauty, this summer especially. 

Now that germs are a huge consideration for everyone I want to mindful of that as well. I don’t want to make things worse by someone thinking they’re going to get contaminated from the bouquets or the act of receiving said bouquet. I’m a member of an awesome floral association that has been in touch with many guidelines and protocols, so I’m confident I can create these without endangering anyone  else. I just am unsure of how to best distribute them since I don’t want to inconvenience those receiving the bouquets in any way. 

Thank you so much for your feedback. Stay safe. 😊",29Mar2020,1
174,"To FIGHT and Pevent new Covid 19 virus:
Follow the steps and your common sense , improvise and substitute, research what was used instead in Old times. MOST IMPORTANT WASH YOUR PHONE ABD SANITIZE IT ALL THE TIME, and DONT DRINK COLD BEVERAGE IT WILL DECREASE IMMUNITY RIGHT AWAY TO ALLOW DISEASE TO GET THROUGH 

The main thing never panic it all be OK:
1. If there is no sanitizer or alcohol, others can be used like : Bleach, hydrogen peroxide, windex, even Drinking clear alcohol. They all wipe to nasty bugs out and safe if let it air-ate

2. No face mask no big deal. You can sew your own or use clean washed your own scarf . It works perfect as a barrier. Some barrier better than none
3. Remember your best defense is your own super fighter immune system . It and only it will prevent you getting the virus and let you get better. Make it better: drink Vitamins, Echinacea, Rose Hips tea. Have good amount of protein and fruits and vegetables. Take Valerian to stay calm . You ll be strong you ll fight everything off

4. Zinc and quinine are great so drink Tonic water. They are not complete cures though keep it in mind

5. Drink sips often , you will swallow the virus and it will be neutralized by stomach acid instead of breathing it in
The most important remember it all happened before nothing new. There were worse pandemics in the world. Read into history and see how people dealt it WILL CALM you",29Mar2020,0

179,"M23, we’ve been dating a while and I’ve always had a ‘problem’ I guess you could call it? I’m noticeably too sweet, lots of compliments and surprises, holidays and the sort - I live to do it, I love the reaction and it makes me happy to make others happy but here’s my problem - it breaks my heart that I never get it back (not the monetary side of things). It’s mighty selfish of me to expect my partner to reciprocate, but I’m not talking about the gifts or the holidays I just mean kindness, you know, wishing me goodnight or saying good morning, it the little things I wish for. Now, she’s amazing but she’s very closed off and cold - it’s just who she is but we are so compatible, I guess the only difference is this; I’m at a bit of a loss because although it makes me happy to see her happy it’s breaking my heart that I’m not feeling the warmth that she gets, I’m jealous of her in a way, I wish I was dating me! Just a few side notes she doesn’t ask for things, she’s content no matter what I just like to do things because it makes me happy to make her happier. I’m not clingy, there’s a difference because I’m not on at her every 5 minutes, I like my personal time to play games and go out etc. I don’t want to break up with her, she makes me happy - it’s me who makes me unhappy and that’ll remain the same no matter who I’m with.

180,"I must start by saying that I love helping people with little things: making dinner for my family, explaining somehing which is unclear to a classmate, offering moral support to my friends (and even to strangers) whenever I can. I genuinely feel a huge satisfaction after helping someone and I’ll always encourage anyone to be kind and compassinate to others. Knowing my desire to help others, I’ve naturally thought about becoming a doctor or a scientist in medical field (adding the fact that I liked natural sciences in high school), but I’m dreadfully afraid of that. 

I spent almost two years of my high school thinking and rethinking about what I want to do for a living, what career would suit me and what are my interests. I loved subjects like biology, chemistry or psychology, but I used to immediately become anxious whenever I thought about a related career. I would imagine myself having a huge responsibility for people, doing a job that directly impacts human lives in one way or another and I felt incapable and too stupid for that. I would probably mess things up or I will ruin someone’s life. I don’t think I have the intelect to do that. 

To offer a broader view of my situation, my parents used to tell me I’m stupid when I was a kid. I was very slow learning mathematics in primary school and my mom was very short-tempered, so I clearly remember that she called me dumb and compared me to other classmates. I was absent-minded or inattentive and did a lot of mistakes, so I was constantly shouted at by my family and my teachers.  My intelectual development was slow because I was born prematurely (6 months of pregnancy), but now I’m doing much better at studying. I still have some minor learning difficulties and, well, a low self-esteem. 

This is the reason I don’t think I deserve to be let do any job that directly impacts people. Sometimes I feel like I have a mental deficiency or that I’m too clumsy for this world. 

I eventually chose a degree in Computer Science, but I’m not happy with it at all and I clearly don’t want to sit at a desk all of my life. It hurts to know that I only made this option because I won’t be an essential worker, so nothing tragic happens if you make a mistake. However, I still read a lot of books on medicine and psychology in my spare time, but that’s bitter-sweet. 

Is it such an unusual feeling? Has anyone felt the same at a given point, that your career is “too much” for you? 

PS: I’m sorry if I’m incoherent. I have a tough time organising and putting my thoughts into words.",29Mar2020,2
