0," I of many have decided that the whole masturbation thing should come to an end. At one point in your life, you have to come to the conclusion that maybe, jerking off to other people having sex isn't such a good idea... I for one have taken that step. I have made video diaries and I hope you'd do the same. I've only made these diaries to go back one day and look how far I **Came** from the person I am now.

I also didn't partake in getting my dad a present (I have 4 siblings, although only 3 shared the cost). I barely have a relationship with him as it is.

It feels good to being putting up these boundaries, but super weird and *wrong* at the same time.

My mom’s love language is acts of service, she’s never been one to show affection but her actions have always been enough to prove that she loves me and my sisters. Right now for instance, she’s aware that I’m going through another bout of depression and she does little things like buy me my favorite comfort food and cutting up fruit and bringing it to my room. This may not seem like much, but it means the world to me. 

My dad was always the one to show affection, not a single day goes by without him telling me how much he loves me. Unfortunately, he’s deported and living in Canada right now, but talking to him makes my heart smile. I don’t let my dad know what I’m going through right now because he’s dealing with his own struggles in a country that is foreign to him, where he is all alone but he still manages to uplift me no matter how much hardships he’s facing on his own. He calls me and gets teary eyed telling me how proud he is of me and how great of a daughter I am, and it’s bittersweet because I wish he was here and I could hug him, but just hearing his voice and knowing how much faith he has in me makes me feel so much better. 

I don’t want to ramble too much, I’m just really thankful for my parents and their conscious and unconscious efforts that make me feel better. I hope you all cherish your parents and the things they do for you or just the people around you who strive to make your life a little sweeter.",21Jun2020,5

17,"I am currently wondering what options, or route I can take to get my child back from her mother that is refusing visitation right. My daughter is only 2 and a half, and for the first year of her life, I was the primary caretaker ie. changing diapers, bathing, feeding, watching, staying up at night with her, everything that a parent is supposed to be doing while unbeknownst to me, her mother was out partying with friends, doing drugs, and cheating on me with at least one other person that I am aware of. Our relationships came to a quick end after I confronted her on it, and am now in a much better place mentally with someone who actually cares about family and has 2 sons of her own. For the next year, my ex and I have been pretty good on getting her half and half of the time going back and forth. But it slowly started to get worse over time as in me seeing her less and less. It came to a day when I was messaged over Facebook Messenger with her asking me if I wanted to give up my parental rights and allowing her to have full custody. I absolutely refused and asked where she would even get that idea to ask that question, AND SHE SAID HER MOTHER TOLD HER TO SAY THAT. I told her I wanted equal shared custody, offered to have the paperwork typed up and notarized to be official without having to make it a court matter and she accepted the offer. Now the Corona Virus has made it a little bit more difficult in getting something like that made up, but a month ago, I went to check the mail and found out she went through the process of setting up a court summons for next month. Since April 4th, she has had our daughter and refuses to give her to me because our 2 kids at home here might make her sick, and she doesn’t want her around other people. But I know for a fact that when she goes to work, or her boyfriend goes to work, that she is either babysat by her sister, or her mother which makes absolutely no sense since that is just putting her at risk even more isn’t it? I have tried being polite, and biding my time until next month without telling her that I have taken screenshots of every single message she has sent to me stating that I am not allowed to have her, even for Father’s Day tomorrow because her and her boyfriend have made plans to spend it with her family AND NOT EVEN CONSIDER ASKING IF I WANT TO SEE HER. I told her I am not going to come to her grandmothers house just to see my daughter just because she can’t agree to let me have one day with her because personally, I might make a scene and cause an argument if I have to be around her family who thinks it’s okay to prevent me from seeing my own child. Her only offer is I can come there for an hour then leave, or force me to have a FaceTime relationship with my 2 year old daughter. I’ve told her countless times that we have equal custody currently, but she’s not making the connection that she is digging herself a deeper hole for the 23rd when I present these messages to the judge. I want to have a day with my daughter, but what do I do in this situation?",21Jun2020,1

20,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",21Jun2020,0

27,"When the pandemic hit I stopped going to specialist appointments because I was afraid of the hospital's crowded elevators and increased risk of infection.  Last week I started deteriorating mentally and had to phone my psychiatrist to discuss the fact that my meds seemed to be losing effectiveness.  Her secretary told me the pdoc was working from home and doing only telephone appointments, and the earliest one was in the last full week of July.  Okay, so I figured I'd hang in there until she could talk to me and maybe adjust the meds.

Next day I have a major upset and am lying in bed trying to ignore the whole world because it feels unbearable.  My phone rings three times within half an hour, but I can't motivate myself to answer it.  When I check voicemail it's my psychiatrist saying she had a cancellation and can keep the appointment that day.  The last message is that the time slot elapsed and we're back to waiting for the previously scheduled appointment.

Now that I'm to the end of the week I'm stabilizing for no known earthly reason and it feels like the damned meds are working well again when they weren't before.  If things remain this way then I get to tell my psychiatrist that I was feeling like crap but am not feeling like crap now so I apologize for wasting her time but it doesn't look like a med change would have a consistent effect since no goddamned med change didn't have a consistent effect.  I'm grateful for the appointment and grateful that I'm feeling relatively well again but still pissed off that I have no idea what was up my ass last week when I couldn't get out of bed to answer the phone from the very doctor I thought I most needed to speak to.  I'm not sure she can do anything for me given the limitations of psychiatry.

34,"So i’m nineteen, and know i’d never make it through college. Not sure what to do. This scares me. (Warning: long, unrewarding post ahead)

School’s always been extremely hard for me. I found it difficult to learn basic concepts in math or science. I’ve always had major problems focusing/staying attentive... and without rambling on about that, i’ve tried to seek help, but found that the “answer” is always just meds, of which i’ve already tried a myriad of throughout my life, to no avail.

I passed every year of school (definitely had to retake a few classes) by the skin of my teeth. From 6th grade to 12th. It’s a miracle that i’m sitting here with a diploma, no joke. I probably have more exact 65’s than anyone thought possible. I even spent the last three years of high school at our alternative school affiliate [for anyone not aware- a very small school for troubled kids who wouldn’t be graduates in normal high school. I affectionately dubbed it the school for potheads &amp; parolees. Think no homework, no quizzes/tests other than the state’s standardized exams, just grading kids on participation, classwork, attendance.] and even then, I barely passed with a GPA of 70 on my final transcript.

The tricky part is, i’ve been fed this “you’re the smartest one that our family has had” horseshit by my family since I was a child. I apparently have a 134 IQ, a number I simply cannot forget since it’s been hammered into my head. Since I was in the advanced classes in elementary school, had an oddly advanced vocabulary at a young age, and have always enjoyed writing, i’ll supposedly just get it together one day, and I only barely got through school because I wasn’t applying myself, or something.

Don’t get me wrong, I know there’s no ill intent there, but I don’t know why this narrative persists after all this time. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. And i’ve now shown for like seven or eight years that i’m just not the sharpest knife in the drawer. I’m genuinely not that smart. I never have been. But every time i’ve ever expressed anything like this i’m met with loud, exaggerated sighs and aggravation.

That brings us to today. After doing virtually nothing with my first year post-high school except working a little bit, I’ve started an online summer course offered by my local community college. For about $800 out of pocket, I’ve spent the last month reading about Hammurabi and writing about Martin Luther’s impact on the development of western civilization. At nineteen. I’ve been doing awful on everything discussion or report related. I don’t care about this stuff. Today, after spending what feels like the fifteenth straight day forcing myself to read lifeless paragraph after lifeless paragraph about medieval Christianity, I admitted to myself that I can’t pass four semesters of community college. This is just one class, what’s to say I won’t be exactly who i’ve always been when I have a full week of classes? I haven’t taken a math class since I re-took 9th grade algebra in 10th grade, why am I acting like I can handle college math?

I regret verbally committing to pursuing a college degree this upcoming school year. I did it just to get everyone off my back; I can’t believe that I let the short, stress free period of time that came with everyone thinking I was about to start school- as if that meant everything was perfect now- convince me that I was on the right track. I know I wouldn’t last a year in community college. I know me. I have the track record to prove it. I’m ashamed that I allowed myself to turn a blind eye to realities that i’ve been aware of for so long, just to appease a few people who think they know how ‘smart’ I am more than I do, even if I knew it was going to end up a waste of time and money.

I’ve got no path. I’ve got no useful skills. I like to build planters with scrapwood sometimes, does that mean I’d be happy pursuing carpentry? Before wasting my time with this class, I read for a few hours everyday, does that mean I should be a librarian? I’m passionate about politics, but what the hell would I even do without a degree? I don’t know, man. All I do is try to make positive changes in my life, i’m sober, and i’m trying my hardest to overcome this awful social anxiety I hate even acknowledging. But it’s hard to keep it up when you know that you have no idea what you want to do with yourself once you accomplish those things.

I’ll stop the rambling here. I don’t have a TL;DR. If you don’t wanna read this nonsense feel free to downvote me into oblivion. Reading it back, this was very “I, I, I, Me, Me, Me”. Sorry for wasting everyone’s time. I don’t even know what I’d want out of a response from you, but thanks in advance for literally anything. Anyone ever felt like this before?",21Jun2020,3

Ok so I’m currently unemployed. I’m a 20 year old college student and I’m looking for a job at a hotel as a housekeeper. Here’s my problem, I live with my mom and she is extremely judgmental and if she finds out I got a job as a housekeeper, she is going to make me feel so bad about myself. I do plan on getting a job in housekeeping bc I’m extremely depressed and I have social anxiety and I really don’t want to deal with customers. However I’m afraid of the shame that will come from her. I plan on lying about my actual job title. For example, even if I work as a housekeeper at a hotel, I’ll tell my mom that I’m the receptionist or the cook. However I’m afraid she’ll find out or somehow see through my lie. Another option is to lie about where I work. I could say I work at a retirement home as a caretaker, since housekeepers and caregivers both have to wear the nurse uniforms. What’s the best option.

37,"My life has been a mess for as long as I've been alive, but this'll be long enough as it is so I'll start when I was 12, I was a somewhat smart 6th grader so I always had free time to do whatever I wanted while the class was finishing whatever they were currently working on, I listened to a lot of 90's rap and I thought I could make a few songs, I wrote like 3 or 5 throughout the rest of the year, i never thought it would go anywhere but it was fun and I had nothing better to do.

7th and 8th grade were ok, at that point in my life school was my happy place away from home, my parents were divorced and I'd go to my dad's place on the weekends, they'd use me as the messenger so they could argue with each other without texting, my mom's husband, who to this day i still don't consider my step dad, would yell at me for no reason and I just hated life, nothing was enjoyable for those 2 years.

High school started and life started getting good again, I stopped seeing my dad, the only connection we had was that he paid for my phone that I got a month before 8th grade ended, I was in a class called latinos in action and l was more patriotic because of it, life finally felt good, i was happy for the first time in a long time, i met a girl in my lia class, we became good friends, after a while I asked her out, she told me her parents wanted her to be 16, so I decided to wait, on valentines day that year I got her a giant cupcake with a plastic rose on it, she told me she loved roses, i made sure to remember that.

That same year I got back into my music, I synced up my phone amd saw my old songs, i read them and they were really good, i realized I had a chance at making rapping my career, I went for it, over the course of that year I made like 20 songs, around the same time I found out a few people somehow stole my music, i put weeks of my life into figuring out how they stole my stuff, I never shared entire songs, only a screenshot to snap and insta, the only thing that I could come up with is that they hacked my phone, way back from when I was 12, because a few songs I wrote back in 2016 were stolen and posted in 2017, I still don't know, but thats my best answer.

I had my phone taken away 2 weeks before 9th grade ended for reasons I don't wanna get into because of how long this is, I had it taken away for 9 months, I only got the phone im using now back in February because I got a job and I was paying for it, I missed 1 of my 4 high school summer breaks, I missed out on hanging out with friends, I missed out on all the memories I could've made just because my mom took my phone.

Sophomore year was decent, I was back in my lia class and although I didn't have a phone at the time, life was somewhat good again, I was talking to all my friends again, getting closer to her, when I got a phone again I went right back to my music, i wanted to buy recording equipment but I was stupid with my money and didn't save, I found out that she started dating someone that lives 2 states away over summer, that hurt me slightly because she was still 15, but I talked myself into believing that it was because her parents didn't know, on valentines day that year I remembered that she told me she loved roses, so I got her a bracelet with 12 roses, around the same time I found out she was single, so I took my chance, prom was around the corner so I decided to ask her, over the past year or so i became an amazing chef, im going to be on guys grocery games when the world opens up again, so I decided to make a cake, icing and everything, from scratch with fondant spelling ""prom?"" It was a Sunday when I decided to ask her so I texted her asking when she would be at church, she said 12:30, so I went to her house at 11:30, she said she was already at church so I left it at her door and went to work, when I was there she texted me saying that she was having a bad week and that made her day but she already had plans, that hurt but it is what it is.

A few weeks after that our class went on a college tour, on the bus ride she was talking about prom, i couldn't hear her but someone yelled out ""wait, i thought (my name) asked you to prom"" so that let me know that she told people, but with that guy asking, everyone in the class knew, besides that the rest of that day was terrible, the tour was nice, while I was walking home with a friend he asked if I saw her story, I said no, he showed me that some kid asked her to prom and she said yes, she blocked me from seeing her story so I wouldn't know, she didn't have plans, she just didn't wanna go with me, I cared enough over 2 years to do everything I did, and she didn't even care enough to be honest, im only 16 but I mean this, i loved her, i wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her, I thought about what I wanted to name our kids for fucks sake, i loved her, and she didn't even care enough to be honest,she still has the pan because I didn't wanna ruin the cake to take it out, im a better cook than baker, i don't wanna talk to her just to ask for it back, I went to work that night and I got fired for something that wasn't my fault, I've been looking for a job but because of the pandemic I haven't gotten anything.

And here's where I am now, just a 16 year old trying to get my life together, I don't know what to do, and I don't think I ever will, I just want my music to take off but with it being stolen I doubt it, and i need to do like 22 packets if i wanna graduate.",21Jun2020,1

if u want more info, look at my post history. but i know no one will read this lol. but it feels better to say it somewhere, because i can’t say it to anyone else. 

hi 🤍 quarantine has given me time to really, REALLY reflect on things, and i think it’s been for the better despite the pain it has caused. i’ve been analyzing my childhood, which seemed perfect and—at the time—felt perfect, but it’s all falling apart now. 

i’m almost 22 years old, and for as long as i can remember i’ve been my father’s daughter; i’m the spitting image of him, our mannerisms are identical, etc. but earlier this year my dad had an episode where he blacked out, reverted to being a kid again, and recalled some horrific childhood memories. he hinted at being raped, though he refuses to talk about it. 

as my dad has completely unraveled, i have started to unravel too. i am his twin, as he says, so it makes sense that i inherited all his mental health issues and more: i have ocd, adhd, bpd, and i was hospitalized for anorexia. i’ve attempted suicide. 

but my family life was perfect. he (my dad) tried his best and MORE, as did my mom. my dad was physically sick when i started to show signs of mental illness at 4 years old because he blamed himself. despite all of this, i had everything i ever wanted. a good house, friends, and we had enough money (at the time lol) to live comfortably in our little midwestern town. 

but something was wrong. i’ve known it this whole time, but it’s been bubbling under the surface for over a decade. 

over the past 4 years, i’ve realized that my body remembers something my brain doesn’t. childhood memories come back to me in flashes: strange fantasies, a preoccupation with rape at a very young age, an encounter in early childhood with boys my age... 

i have every sign of a victim of childhood sexual assault. i’ve tried to have sex and i feel like i’m going to die every time. i keep having memories of my brother and i doing strange things to each other when we were BOTH too young to know what we were doing. and my brother and i, we both have the same issues with sex. we’ve both had physicians ask my parents if we’ve been assaulted. our parents said we were just anxious kids. but my body remembers. 

i feel alone because i have a jumble of memories, but i can’t piece them all together. i feel alone because i can’t put a face to the pain, shame, and guilt i feel. i feel so alone, but i know i need to know more to heal. but for now, i’m on my own.",21Jun2020,1

For some reason, I thought it was just some weird physic thing dealing with force and going in a circular motion and what not. I'm not that into physics so I didn't bother to dig deeper than what I assumed was the right answer.

Well, today, I found out how much of an idiot I was. The story began when my family's old crappy lawn mower finally broke a week or so ago, and the grass was getting to be more than a foot high. We decided to say screw trying to fix the mower because, honestly, none of us know how to fix anything beyond turning it on and off. 

So today, we headed to the store and were inundated with a bunch of different options. I was really partial to the ones where you sit on a chair and just make the mower move around like a go cart, because I'm pretty much the only one to cut the grass and ya girl is weaker than a day old puppy. Obviously, we didn't get it since they're all over a 1000 bucks and neither our lawn or wallet is big enough to justify the cost. We decided to go look at the usual push ones. 

That's when my dear, sweet, absolutely mindbogglingly amazing mother said, ""Why don't we get one of those self-propelling ones like one of my friend has."" When I said I stopped and stared at her for a solid minute, I'm not joking. This woman had watched me struggle thoughout the years trying to push our crappy old lawn mower all over the damn yard, helped me try to put the wheels back on when it came off every five minutes as I'm coughing the whole time from the black smoke that would occasionally emit from the engine, and didn't tell me that there were lawn mower- ones you can buy for the same price as a normal push mower, that can freaking move itself?? Why the hell didn't we switch out our mower and got that instead? Wouldn't our life have been so much easier? Our lawn so much nicer if everyone didn't wait for our lawn to grow to the size of a small forest because that shitty lawn mower was impossible to push even if the grass was barely two inches tall??? 

So yeah, we got a self propelling mower today, and my future never seem brighter, because I know years from now, even after I have college and have a career of my own, I would still be called back home just to cut the damn lawn. 

Sorry for the long post about what is probably a very boring subject to most of y'all, but I just had to let it out. I needed to rant because the idea of a self-propelling lawn mower amazes me after the struggle I been through with a shitty push one.",21Jun2020,1
51,"For decades now MSM and popular culture has painted rural America as a shit hole backwards place full of idiots.

Unsurprisingly this has led to many of them becoming disenfranchised with what could be called the establishment and the rest of the country.

This arguably led to the election of Trump. Since then, the attack on rural parts of the country has only intensified.

Figure heads of the left and MSM continued to create a caricature of these rural communities to use as a punching bag. These communities are facing huge poverty, drug, and social issues; not only that, they tend to have high immigrant and minority populations.

Attacking these communities is by definition: ""punching down"". These people are less privileged than most of the people attacking them.

You're not smart or clever by insulting these communities; it's intellectually lazy and wrong.",21Jun2020,1

53,"A lot of us, including me, have a default approach towards money. Frugality is our go-to approach. The first thing we want to do with our money is to save it. And spend as little as possible, always. I can't say this for everyone, but I grew up with this approach. And now, it is ingrained in my behaviour. My friends and family know my love for frugality. Legend of my frugal behaviour goes around. 

But after so many years of semi-unconsciously practising this approach, I have come to this not-so-sudden realisation that frugality is misleading. 

Take a breather, don't panic. Let me explain. I'm not discounting the approach as a whole, neither am I questioning its existence. Frugality will always have its place, a very important one in fact. Besides, no matter how much you and I try, we won't be able to root it out. So, trust me when I say this, it won't do you any good as a default action. And I'll tell you why.

First, whenever you are successful in saving money, irrespective of the amount, it gives you a small high. Which is caused by a shot of dopamine being released in the brain. So, this behaviour in itself is very addictive. But what's wrong with this is, you are feeling accomplished as if you've built some wealth, even when you haven't done anything. You can save only as much as you earn. If 10,000 rupees is what you earn, you can save only that much. By no amount of magic will you be able to save more than that. If building wealth is what your goal is, you can't achieve it with this approach. What you might need is another source of income or a raise in your existing one. Besides, putting the effort in creation rather than saving will get your desired goals.

&gt;Also, have you ever seen anyone building wealth through frugality alone? 

Second, frugality robs you of the pleasure of guilt-free spending. Once you've set up a financial system for yourself, which by the way everyone should, you can afford to do it. Approaching our finances from a strategic place, rather than a place of scarcity puts us in a much better position. You might discover there's no need for haggling over everything. Moreover, spending on things we love brings a lot of joy. And if saving is all that you're gonna do, then there are high chances of the 'victim mindset' kicking in. Soon you'll start to think it's you against the world. Another zero-sum game.

Third, there are chances you might never learn to invest. Invest in yourself, in money generating systems, in a better lifestyle. Looking at potential gains, beyond the initial investments might be particularly tough. 

&gt;A type of behaviour also called 'penny wise and pound foolish'. 

Another thing I observed about this type of behaviour is that it is born out of fear and even scarcity. Fear of running out of something. In our case, money or resources. Summing up, I propose reevaluating our approach towards handling money. Not letting frugality take over, by default. Unlearning the frugality approach that we might have passively picked up.

Right now, I'm in a stage of life where I'm reflecting on my own behaviour, habits, reaction approaches, nature and [beliefs](https://www.suyashdevgupta.com/post-1/beliefs). The example of frugality being misleading is one of the many behaviours that I have passively learned. Such things are incapable of serving me any longer. Sadly, unlearning them is much difficult than it was learning. But that is where [growth ](https://www.suyashdevgupta.com/post-1/7-skills-for-life)lies.",21Jun2020,1
54,"I was thinking about it. I really enjoy talking to friends over discord, and playing games with them. I enjoy texting them and having a laugh. But I really don't enjoy physically hanging out with them. I don't know, it's not much different from our usual talks and stuff, it's just physically being around them makes me uncomfortable. I don't think it's because I don't like them. I love my friends a lot. It's just something about being physically around people and having to converse while in the same room with them. I don't think it's their fault at all either. It's a me thing. I know this probably isn't normal but I'm not to sure what to do about it. I feel like the only way I can get these things off my chest it by doing is anonymously over the internet since I know if I say it to someone, they'll probably take it as me saying I want their therapy or something, but I've noticed that stuff never really works.

56,"I judge people as it’s what I’ve been taught to do growing up around judgemental people. In my heart I see no issue with any group of people. I don’t look down on anyone. For example, the lgbtq community which some of my friends are unaccepting of. 

I don’t vocalize it nearly as much as I used to. It is usually for laughs or to make myself feel better in an uncomfortable situation. Judging others is basically looking down on them. And although when I do judge them I don’t feel like I’m looking down on them, it’s exactly what I’m doing. 

I understand a lot of people judge each other. But I believe that I’d be much happier without it in my life. It’s negative and unnecessary. I guess I need to figure out exactly what makes me judge others and why.

59,"This might be long, sorry. My family and I have had a rocky relationship since I was 15 and was outed by my cousin (earlier than I wanted to be out) to my family. My mom was not pleased and I was kicked out. This was in 1993. I managed to make it to adulthood without tooooo much trouble and I later daysed right out of Wisconsin as soon as I was legal. 

At 26 I moved clear across the country because I needed to live somewhere that it was safe to be Queer and to transition (female to make). 

Contact with my family over the last 15 years has been sporadic at beast. Then covid happened.

I called my mom and sister to warn them. Since I was in Seattle, the original US epicenter, I had a jump on information. As Covid made its way to the Midwest my mom and I began to talk everyday. At first it was all Covid talk and any personal talk was strained. She called me by my birth name and used the wrong pronouns, but I didn’t care so much, I just wanted to keep talking to my mom.

As she got laid off from her job and I filed for her unemployment , which I do every week now, she began to really rely on me for help. 

We began texting, which is where most of the emotional talks have taken place. She asked me questions about my life. I found out she loves gardening, horror movies, true crime, and cooking, just like me. We began sharing pics of what we made for dinner. We started taking about deep things in the phone.

She told me stories about my dad who died when I was six. She called him her one true love and told me that even after my brother and sister were born, I was the apple of his eye. Apparently we shared a really close bond and though I remember clips, I no longer remember too many full stories. She told me he was incredibly hardworking and just wanted a good life for his family. She told me how he wanted to be a fireman but backed out when the hiring person told my dad “I’d love to hire you over the (N word) who also applied”. My dad wanted nothing to do with that racist dick. My dad believed in equality, second chances, hard work, love and kindness. She told me story after story and I felt like I knew my dad again.

We talked about me being Queer and Trans. She told me she liked the name I picked and that I look just like my dad (I do). 

My birthday came in April and I received the first birthday gift and card, addressed in my legal male name, from my mom since I was a kid. I will cherish that card for my entire life. She wrote that she was proud of me and loved me.

I hadn’t heard my mom say I love you  in 27 years, now she tells me everyday on the phone, in text, or both. 

My moms not too healthy and as a realist I know she’s not many years away from passing. Our new relationship is running on borrowed time and I’m here for it. I’m here for the phone calls where we’re both bored and don’t have much to say, I’m here for the calls where she’s stressed and worried, I’m here for it all and I’m acknowledging how blessed I am for every moment of this

My moms amazing. She’s bright, curious, open to learning, a bit dark like me but optimistic. She’s definitely my mom.

I’ve not been perfect in life and I’ve made some poor choices in the past. I’ve really turned my life around this year by jumping head first into therapy, getting my health in line, building honest and true friendships, working my ass off to have a decent future. I thought I didn’t deserve a family bc I’m Trans and the black sheep, turns out I do deserve them and I love them.

A while back I had a dream (lucid in the end) that was quite active, most of it is unimportant. It’s the ending that really gets me even to this day when I think about it. I saw numbers together on a lit up board and had a memory from a tiktok about seeing numbers in dreams. So I decided for some reason I needed to say them out loud. When I finished an alarm went off and red flashing started then where the numbers were changed and the words “You’ve gone too far, initiating forced wake up... NOW” showed up. When the word now shows up everything starts getting sucked upward like there’s a powerful vacuum and I feel myself start shaking in my dream. In reality I violently shook awake with a cold sweat and my body was numb for a couple of hours. I still can’t explain the dream nor have I had one like it since. However now when I’m getting ready for bed, as soon as I close my eyes I seem to start dreaming and can see the visuals start in black and white and slowly progress to color.

69,"Don’t get me wrong, It’s normal for people to have disagreements—if anything it’d be weird if we all agreed on the same things. However, when it comes to human rights and social justice matters, it utterly breaks my heart when I see people arguing against the various matters. I’m in tears right now due to some things people have said regarding black lives and it hurts me most that they aren’t even willing to listen to the other side. These people see “black lives matter” and assume it means white lives don’t matter, or that black lives are the only lives that matter. So many people fail to see the overarching goal of the blm movement, and they refuse to understand the various issues at hand. I personally know people, who are a part of another minority group, that are against the movement because they believe “black people don’t have it harder” and that “we all have the same rights”. These individuals come from a culture and group of peoples that have been continually oppressed for centuries, yet they fail to acknowledge the oppression faced by blacks in this country. The hypocrisy pains me. 

Listen, it’d be different if people were willing to listen and understand the true goals of the movement. However, there’s a huge difference between ignorance and a lack of knowledge. The people that voluntarily choose to rebel and argue against blm are the issue. It doesn’t make sense to me at all. Some White people are arguing against blm, even though they live a life of privilege that no black individual can ever experience, regardless of social status. I posted a question on r/askreddit recently asking why some people were anti-blm and some of the responses truly broke my heart. People choose not to understand and it just sucks. I feel like it’s hopeless arguing with people about this because how do you argue with someone that we all deserve equal justice? If they don’t believe it in the first place, there’s nothing you can say to change their minds.

70,"
as my username suggests, im an international student in japan. introverted. i do like talking to people but i dont really know many people (i do know quite a few people, but most arent people i'd talk and open up to). for me its not about having many friends, but its about having quality friends.

i arrived in April 2019, lived in a dorm, had a few friends. i moved to an apartment to live alone late July, and by the end of August, all of my friends have gone back to their home-countries. it was only in November that i started feeling isolated and lonely. it is something that fluctuates, for some periods im good, for some periods it makes me feel depressed - as i am writing this, i am at a lonely period, ive had difficulty focusing on my online lectures and completing other tasks. my gym has reopened and i thought id be extremely happy about it. i am, but not as happy as i thought id be.

ive had zero motivation at all this week and some uni stuff is piling up, its stressing me out.

having no one to talk to for a very long time, is surprisingly, only the minor cause of my loneliness. one of the main causes for me is lack of physical touch. id describe myself as an affectionate person. id hug and cuddle my friends, cook for them and etc...and not having someone to do that to is hard. not having someone do that to me is hard...though i dont really expect people to do that anyways.

i've lacked affection so much, back in jan my lab mate tugged my arm so i can move to the side and let the guy on the bicycle behind me pass through, and it was a strange yet positive feeling for me.

i'm so touch starved that even when the fingers of the cashier hands me my change and touches my hand, it feels good.

ive never heard the cashiers here say ""take care"" (in japanese) to other customers. i dont know if there was a look on my face, but on my bday (that i celebrated alone and took myself out to eat), i went to a convenience store  and got a ""take care"" for the cashier, and that was enough to put a smile on my face.

another source of loneliness is a bit difficult for me to explain. in probably all of my friendships, i play the big brother role: making sure everyone is ok, being there when needed and etc. i dont expect anything in return, but as of lately, i cant help but wonder what it feels like to be looked out for, to be cared about, to be considered...to be the little brother. aside from my parents, no one really checks up on me. I've been alone for slightly too long, i cant remember what it feels like to meet someone who makes me feel cared about.

I also realize that the lonelier i feel, the more I resort to using social media. I also realize i tend to watch more porn and masturbate more when Im feeling lonely (sorry for the info)

I miss my old self. I use to not use social media so much even though I had it downloaded on my phone. I miss my old self who was a badass who didn’t feel like he needed much attention from people. That person was productive and unstoppable. But now, Ive been seeking happiness that requires other people, and I don’t know what to think about it. All i want is someone to ask me if I’m doing ok, if I’ve eaten, if i want to do something on the weekend, someone who thinks about me. I never knew loneliness could be this debilitating.

on the plus side of things, ive been taking a break from instagram (it was consuming my time) and it has allowed me to reconnect with myself. ive remembered some goals ive had but forgotten, ive been becoming a bit more mindful and enjoy-the-moment ish, ive started to enjoy hiking again. its not all that bad, but the lows can be.

I haven't really touched Viola since, and I miss it. I miss the whole atmosphere, I miss the fact that I was actually pretty decent at playing, and can still remember how to read sheet music as well as visualize bow motions in my head.

77,"I am a really skeptical person when it comes to anything that has to do with deities and what not, so I see them as nothing more but mere fairytales of the past; myths. However, it wasn’t till I had a dream of which my time spent there was around six to eight years, yet in the outside reality I spent what is known as my usual sleeping routine of eight to nine hours as I try to fall asleep before the clock strikes eleven at night and wake around 7:30 A.M. instinctively. This dream wasn’t like any other dream I’ve had before, and the ones before were strange in itself, mind you, but this dream was more vivid than any other lucid dreams of mine. In this dream I could smell, taste, feel as well as hear clearly and see just the same. My actions weren’t hesitant nor sluggish or abnormal, no, I had the same will power and control over my body as well as my thoughts as I do presently. Before I go deeper into my experience, I thought you should know, at some point in my eighteen years of age I began to dream of this girl of dark wavy hair and fair pale skin. She was beautiful in appearance and her voice was serene which made me feel safe and at peace. I dreamt of her three times. Once when, again, I was eighteen, and the other two, when I was nineteen. Every time she appeared in my dreams everything that was going on around me would simply come to a stop. We would talk mainly about how we’ve met each other before and, well, we had actual conversations minutes and hours long. In my last dream of her, I remember coming into “my best friend’s room” which for some odd reason I was having a sleepover with. The room looked like an interrogation room, but with the commodities of a hotel. It had two doors, one of which me and my friend came in from, and the other which was open and led to another room involving the interrogation window, so I could not see through it unless I really focused. Somehow I was able to see the silhouette of someone behind the window, so I asked my friend who else was there with us, but when I turned around, he wasn’t there. In came the girl and all we managed to do was smile from ear to ear, embracing each other as if we haven’t seen one another in ages. We exchanged a few words here and there and a few minutes later we shared a slow and peaceful dance together. I remember feeling this heavy weight in my chest, knowing well I’d wake up soon and not see her probably ever, but as though she read my mind, she assured me we’d see each other again, yet she did not say when or how soon. So I woke up. You might ask, “Did you ever ask for her name or who she was?” Dear reader, I did not, for I only remember feeling as though I had already known who she was before and that there was no need for me to ask, in fact, we would only address each other as “You,” when we would first see each other in the dream. Now, resuming back to that one unusual dream of six to eight years. I had turned twenty-years old on September 2019, and one night I clearly remember opening my eyes to the sight of this beautiful field of grain which laid before me. At first, I was slightly confused as I somehow knew I wasn’t quite in a dream, at least not in a normal and common dream all of us humans usually have. Like I said before, this dream felt very much real. The next thing I remember after studying my surroundings and even my hands at some point, I turned to my right and from a distance I saw Her walking towards me. A pure and joyous smile growing across her face once she saw I’ve noticed her. To keep this story short, I am able to say that throughout those years we fell in love, and we built this life together that was full of magic and wonderful adventures. We lived in a cottage next to a forest that was inhabited by fairies, fauns and other critters. The other half in which the entrance of the cottage faced was the beautiful field of grain. At some point, I even got to meet this one old man who was related to her. What I remember the most about him was his soft white hair, long beard, and that his wardrobe strictly included blue as its dominant color. His eyes were gentle like Hers, and when he spoke to you directly it was always lovingly. At the end of this extraordinary dream, I clearly remember being at a festival in a somewhat closed village where the walls were all white and the rooftops of buildings were standardized to be covered in red clay tiles due to its “architectural maintenance of themed beauty” as I recall. There was music all around. In the center of the village, enclosed by its walls with an archway entrance, was a rectangular pool with a fountain placed in the middle of it filled with pure crystalline water which glowed a beautiful neon blue at night. The girl and I found ourselves walking around the pool, simply enjoying each other’s presence as we held hands. We laughed, danced and sat down at the edge of the pool, but we never did go anywhere else. I remember looking at her and thinking, “Wow,” just “Wow”. As the night grew older, we decided it was best to start heading back home, but as soon as we passed the archway entrance, she bent forward almost abruptly as she held her side in pain. At first she said she was okay, but when she tried straightening herself she bent over once again and fell to her knees. “You’re not okay,” I remember telling her, “We need to get you help, now.” Picking her up in my arms, I began to run, hoping to recognize a medic, but realizing almost at once that a medic might just not even exist here as something like this had never happened before. Then from a corner came the old man I’ve mentioned to you earlier, and as though he’s seen this before his expression turned worrisome the moment he noticed Her in my arms. He gestured for me to follow him, so I did, I believed we were going somewhere to find help. I did not quite pay attention to where we were headed as my eyes were mainly focusing on Her while only glancing upward once in a while making sure I did not crash into someone or something. As I held her in my arms, I remember feeling anxious and extremely worried. My arms were growing tired and my stomach was churning, yet I refused to pause and regain my energy afraid that if I did, if I so dared to let my guard down, she might just slip away and not from my grasp. My legs then could not go any further, so I fell to my knees still holding on to her. My eyes swelling up with tears, I had the desperate urge to let her know how sorry I was. I wanted to let her know how much I loved her even though we’ve told and showed it to each other time after time, but no words came out. However, somehow she understood the expression in my face and with her free hand she reached out and stroked my cheek devotedly. With her constant change of colored eyes she looked into mine and with a bittersweet smile she said, “I am going to be alright.” Then I woke up, or rather, sprung up and scanned my surroundings almost immediately, but I was in this sort of trance at first, filled with disbelief along with other strong emotions. A few days had passed and the lump in my throat remained in tact, and trust me dear reader, I very much wanted to cry, but for some reason I never did. My sister took notice of my glum appearance, but she must’ve thought nothing big of it as she did not ask me what the matter was and simply tried to make my day better as she usually does when I am down. Note that, till this day I have not told a soul except for my best friend about the dream as I truly think I might just be called crazy, and I definitely do not want to come off as one. However, now I don’t know what to think or what to believe in since I’m seriously thinking that my dream was more than just a dream. I even thought it unfair. For a while, I used to lay in bed and pray I might just see her once more, maybe even live eight more years along her side if I was as lucky, but nothing seemed to work. I’ve kind of stopped doing so as I started to feel silly just think about it, yet at times when I do remember about the dream and of her, I begin to miss her and the life we had, very much. 
A part of me believes she might of even been a deity, but that would be nonsense, or would it? And if she were a deity, what kind of deity was she? Who was She? I did a few research myself based on my ancestral history, which resulted quite interestingly. I’ll post that as a different draft though. Please, leave your thoughts and comments below. I’d like to know what you think and if you yourself might’ve had an experience similar to mine. Thanks for reading, - thelastferguson.",21Jun2020,1
78,"Hi Everyone.

Background: A closeted Bisexual or Gay (IDK yet) 16 year old guy, from NZ, in his last year of high school, who is overweight, balding, generally ugly, an asshole, has an extreme hatred of therapists (from experience), and is a result of failed birth control (a mistake)

I’ve been feeling really down recently and have almost been slipping into suicidal ideation. I don’t know how to change or how to do many things but I want to learn how. I suppose I’ll just list the problems I have and I will be eternally grateful if anyone has some advice.

School:

I’ve got less than six months left at my current high school, but everyday feels as if it is killing me. Because of COVID-19, a lot of pressure has been placed on me in terms of assessments, and that’s fine, but the chill atmosphere I absolutely despise. It is extremely archaic and conservative. We have whole-school meetings/assemblies everyday. During these they constantly tells us how “we don’t have rights” or that “our opinions don’t matter.” I’m constantly harassed for the length of my hair, even though other teachers think it’s perfectly fine. Everyday feels as if I’m being forced through an ideological meat grinder. This week is particularly bad as I’ve got a University exam for my English paper.

Family:

My brother’s suicide was a tragic event for me, though due to others’ requests I hid it. It was on the 8 Dec 2015 and I was 11. I was told to be strong for my older sisters and my mother, but I didn’t want to be. Now all of that bottles up guilt and grief has hit me tenfold. I prefer to grieve alone and don’t trust my mother enough to share my grief (she spreads information like butter). I was a horrible little brother, but I loved him. He would be the one there when my parents weren’t there. In my younger years, he was there more than them. He was my best friend and after he died I’ve never really engaged with people. My most prized possession is a watch he gave me a few months before he died. Not long before he took his life, I remember him asking if he could build a LEGO set with me, and I said no. It seems pathetic now, but that small action is currently one of my greatest regrets. My family is a mess. My mother has a severe victim mentality (probably due to the horrible treatment by my father) and is hypocritical. I can be a bit mean to her sometimes and I wish I wasn’t, but she says whatever she wants and insult me in front of people, yet when I defend myself, I’m someone who disrespects her in front of people. She once called me a fag who will have a “loose asshole” later in life, in front of my older sister and my nieces and nephews (who are all younger than me). For the record Ive never talked to her about my sexuality and she always claims she “isn’t prejudiced” but frequently uses homophobic and racist slurs.  They other day she also claimed that I have no empathy. My father is someone I haven’t had any contact with since 2016, through an expensive court case ($22,000 which my mother paid, and complains about often). He was an abusive prick to my mother and my siblings, but strangely only hit me once. He cheated on my mother leading to separation in 2013. During my first visit with him, he kissed the woman he had an affair with (I call her the village bicycle - because everyone gets a ride) in front of me. On one of my last visits he called me a “disrespectful cunt,”after I called him out about why I never wanted to go to my brother’s grave with him. He always used to say “If the shoe was on the other foot, and you’d had died the same way, wouldn’t you want your brother to come visit you.” When he said it the last time I went apeshit crazy and asked “How would you feel if your father cheated on your mother with a fucking whore.” That was a day before my 12th birthday. I have had pretty much zero contact with him, but my life is still greatly impacted by the feelings surrounding our relationship. When it comes to my older sisters, I don’t really trust them because everything I’ve ever told them in confidence has gone back to my mother and been used against me in an argument. My mother often threatens me telling me that “If I don’t like it I can go and live with him (my father)”, but obviously I don’t want that. After my parents’ separation I was forced to take counselling, but my experience was terrible. My parents attempted to make me take counselling after my brothers’ death but I refused


Personality:

I think I hate the way I am. I want to be someone that people can find support in and lean on, but I just drive everyone away. I pretend to be this confident guy who believes in himself and just gets the job done but in reality, at night I curl up in the fetal position and cry my eyes out. I’ve created this confident persona but I am bustling with insecurities. I’ve always hated the way I look. For as long as I can remember, I have been overweight. I’m currently 6’ 2” and 100 kg. I was bullied for my weight when I was younger but I was never affected by it. I just hate being overweight, and am lucky that I’m tall. Whenever I plan to diet and exercise, people either tell me that I’m too lazy to succeed or I give up without trying.  I hate the way my face looks, with its lack of symmetry and large flat nose. My hair is a major source of my confidence, but for the last year my hair has been falling out, thinning and receding. My father is bald and am already becoming like him at 16. It is my greatest insecurity. My dream job in the entertainment industry is quite dependent on looks, so I feel a bit defeated. My teeth are fairly straight, but the colour is gross, and my “enamel hypoplasia” causes problems regardless of frequent brushing, flossing or rinsing. I was starting to get forehead lines, so bought a bunch of skincare stuff, and now my skin is healthier than it has ever been. However, my family calls me a “girl” or a “fag” for caring about it. 

I do love certain things about myself though. I love my ability to transfer my thoughts into writing, and the colour of my eyes. I love the little birthmark on my knee and my sense of style. I love my wittiness and my random pieces of useless knowledge.


Career:

My dream career is to be a singer/dancer/actor, but the problem is I lack drive or motivation. I take singing lessons atm but I don’t think I’m developing quickly enough. I also have a deep voice so it’s more unlikely that I’ll succeed. I’ve never danced but I love the emotions that are expressed through it and would really like to learn. I suppose I’m just afraid of judgement. I’m afraid of being judged because I’m not very good or I started too late. I’m afraid of being told that I’m useless or that I’ll never amount to anything. When it comes to acting, I suppose you could say I’ve had plenty of practice, but no actual lessons. All my drama teachers over the years tell me that I have a natural talent for it, and I would like to develop that into skill, but again am wondering it I should even bother.

For my whole life I have been preparing for university, and until a while ago I was certain that that was the path for me, but now I’m not. If I was going to take a degree. I’d want to major in psychology as I find it really interesting. My goal in life, no matter how I achieve it is to help people. I want to be there for them when they need someone. I want to help them confront and embrace their emotions. My dream is to do that through music and writing, but if my dreams crashed and burned then I’d go for a more traditional approach

Overall, I’m just tired. I feel burnt out. Every day feels like a chore, and every problem feels like a mountain to climb. Just today I had to look for shoes, but I searched my whole city and they didn’t have anything my size, and I looked online and they don’t have anything in my style in the whole country. For some reason, such a pathetic minor thing causes me to spiral. I feel that the only way I can feel better is through distraction, but my resting feeling is defeat.

If anyone has any advice on how I can tackle my demons. I would be really fucking grateful.",21Jun2020,1
79,"I got lead on by my ex of 1.5 years during isolation, jt sucks and she toyed with my emotions. People like her always talk to people on Snapchat etc and she’s already “talking” to this guy and I’ve heard people saying how she thinks he’s so cute and all. I’m actively attempting to move on but I’m just finding it really difficult, what me and her had wasn’t great so I want to move on. I want to talk to new people and think about things that aren’t just her. I’m alone. I’ve got this gut feeling she’s been ranting to all of her friends about how shit I was (when really the relationship as a whole was a failure) and it’s got to me. I don’t know what to do to forget her.",21Jun2020,1

83,So yesterday I had an altercation with my neighbor and I asked him if he could turn his music or whatever he was playing down so my mom could get some sleep.. acting all cocky like “who do you think you are? It’s my house I don’t care about your f-ing mom!” So I told him to normal before i would start litting this guy up. He was like: “Oh yeah? Alright wait here..” so I didn’t know what was happening and all of a sudden comes 5 guys out of nowhere who looked like they were in their late 20s early 30s (keep in mind I’m 16) and we came face to face and this one dude started swinging luckily I dodged and I pushed him to the nearest car and was about to end him but then 2 guys pull me from behind to the floor and started kicking the sh*t out of me.

86,"I’m a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 

Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again and she filled out the application form for me for it and I didn’t ask",21Jun2020,1
87,"19 F hi, I’m seeing my father for Father’s Day at 9am at a taco cabana because he has Father’s Day plans with his wife and kid that I’m not allowed to see. 

I just woke up hungover from a party where I over drank because I was drunk. Safe ride home and stuff but the heartburn is real and I’m embarrassed that I needed to go home by like 10pm. Definitely was white girl wasted and that’s a yikes for me 

I’m also going through a break up. He was my ride, and I stay with him most weekends so even though we’re broken up I am still at his house. He’s a kind guy but I’m heartbroken. When I got back from the party drunk he had tinder downloaded. All I asked was for him to wait till I left, because I get it that that’s moving on for him but not me. And I thought I deserved more respect than that even though he’s doing a lot letting me still stay for the weekend and picking me up from my friends bday 

I need to buy a car, I have one that is breaking. This is a constant headache

I just got my hair done but they layered it weird so I’m like feeling insecure Bc it looks a lot off

My nanny position is full time and I thought I had job security but some shit went down and I’m definitely not valued like I thought I was in the work place, so fuck me right, I’m looking for a new job right now for more stability and have no idea where to go or what to do to make decent money

My body hurts from sadness it’s like I have arthritis flares in my forearms wrists and arms and my throat swells it’s emotional pain I just feel it physically if that makes sense 

I’m dealing with a legal case having to do with sexual assault by my brother and shits gonna go down with my parents Bc well idk how they will react knowing I put their son in jail and I’m terrified to lose my nparents because I have no support system but therapy and having them to ignore my calls and play phone tag atleast gives me something sometimes when they do show up and talk

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bite to me about how much she smells.

110,"At a previous job I had in college, I ran into a few issues that resulted in my boss kicking me out and threatening to call the police if I ever contacted them (students or employees) again at the end of one of the semesters because others were feeling uncomfortable around me without telling me, even when I asked them. He said I could contact him through phone/email to discuss things, though. But he didn't make the specific issues clear to me (instead giving me vague hints at things), and, when I explained that, he wouldn't listen. I lost my friends, my job, and much of my sense of security that resulted in guilt, fear, shame, and regret throughout the rest of college.

After I graduated, I've discussed this experience with a therapist extensively, and he's revealed how they gaslit me and their reasons for kicking me out were made on huge jumps to conclusions. He advised me to notify the university about this.

* The boss actually had a lot of red flags I didn't understand until looking in hindsight. The workplace was mostly white college women (many dealing with abuse/trauma from relationships), and I'm a brown Muslim man. The director, an old white man, would act/talk cute in front of them, hug them and tell them he loved them all the time, get intimate with their personal relationships, act like a boyfriend by being so emotionally supportive to them, and let them call him ""Dad."" 

* He would do things like telling me to ""back off"" when I became friends or emotionally close to them or called them in the evenings in fear that I'd take advantage of them, even telling me not to discuss my issues and experiences of racism and Islamophobia. He was being more protective and subservient to them to make it seem like he wasn’t doing anything wrong. He manipulated the white women into thinking I was a threat to their safety. My therapist even said the boss, an advocate for women’s rights, was depicting me as a sexual predator to hide from the fact he saw the women as his harem. 

* After he kicked me out, he'd avoid discussing the issues with me and, instead, blame me for everything (even the intimate, personal feelings of white women that they didn't tell me about). When I requested clarity on what happened, he would say, ""If you don't have clarity, I don't want you coming back."" I'd try contacting the boss to ask if I could reconnect. But he would try to arrange meetings and not follow up on things and, instead, give excuses like ""Sorry, I'm busy,"" hang up when I tried talking. He'd make things more difficult. He even gave me the silent treatment on multiple occasions, sometimes just giving me a nasty, intimidating look without saying anything when we were supposed to discuss things. When I'd tell him things weren't made clear to me, he would disregard my testimony and say, ""We told you you multiple times."" 

* He'd hold me to different standards than others such as not letting me raise criticism of white women (while letting them criticize me on anything), not listening to my concerns of racial discomfort (while responding fully to the discomfort of white women), policing my behavior outside the workplace or with students who had already graduated even when those students were ok with me doing that, and generally treating me like an outsider (e.g., calling me a ""loner,"" referring to the complaints against me as ""workplace issues,"" but retaliating against me when I raised complaints against white women, etc.). He'd let others confide in him while not letting me do so. 

After I graduated, I discussed my testimony with the Office of Student Conduct, the Equal Employment Opportunity Office, and the Office of the Vice President &amp; General Counsel. They validated my testimony. Unfortunately, the boss had moved to a different city, but they asked me what I would want, and they made a remediation plan for the workplace. I'm still discussing things with a therapist. I legitimately thought it was normal workplace/social behavior. 

I'm still struggling to move on. If anyone has advice for moving on from a gaslit job, I'd love to hear. I'm still trying to adjust to normalcy. I have a new, prestigious, amazing job right now, but I still feel agitated about things like meeting my boss's expectations and trying to follow rules properly. Sometimes I still feel worried or anxious around white women that I'm going to hurt them.

112,"Anxiety

During this pandemic my mental health really got worsen, it started when i found out that i kinda cheated on my girlfriend i hitted up a couple of people but i didnt replied coz i realized sooner what im doing is wrong and so i opened it up to my girlfriend and alot of things happened, but right now is i feel like i have so much baggage that i carry, from certain guilts and such things, and its really really getting hard for me, heck i dont even know what im going thru its just i get trigger when i see the word guilt maybe i got traumatized on how i guilt-tripped myself to open up the wrong doings on my relationship, someone told me im being anxious, and right now i dont know how to contain myself or get back on the track ive been smoking to get it off for a short period of time and nothing’s changing it feels like its getting worser and worser and im getting uneasy about so many things, this post might be hard to understand but im trying my best to explain it, its hard to explain something you dont understand, maybe i can tell guilts that im having and sometimes i beat myself up for these guilts

114,"I was at my parents house visiting with my family. I was walking my daughter down the driveway to see some horses across the street. I see a car driving by real slow. Then it backs up and rolls down the window. I figure they need directions. It turns out it was my ex-fiancé and his kid. I hadn’t seen him in at least 10 years. 

We chatted a couple minutes but my toddler was having a little meltdown so I had to keep it short, thankfully. 

When we were together he was very controlling and emotionally abusive. So I haven’t been dying to catch up. 

Later that day he find me on Facebook and sends some messages and wants to catch up more, ask about my life. Then asks if I thought there was something wrong with him when we were together, I tell him in the most straight forward way I can. He proceeds to tell me that after a deep depression and a couple suicide he attempts he was diagnosed as bipolar and borderline personality disorder. This is a lot to take in for me. I’m not sure how to respond. I think he was looking for sympathy. Especially when he added that he has to take “5 pills a day to feel like a person” what to even say??

I tell him that we were not right for each other and that I’m glad we realized that ( although i was the driving force behind our break up) and that I was able to restart my live in a neighboring city and that I was very happy with my life. 

He sort of apologizes ( without saying sorry) and we talk about our kids for a minute and say goodbye. 

I am so thankful that I dodged that bullet. I am so thankful I met my husband and that he is the father to my daughter.

117,"This is a difficult story for me to tell. It was both a parenting and a life lesson for me, a huge one, about assumption and prejudice, patience, and love. The cost of the lesson was high, almost unbearable, but that only makes it that much more valuable to me. I share it today for all the parents in the world that love their children.

After relocating to a new home in 2005, our budget was tight, super tight. Maybe not Ramen noodle tight, but close. We needed a kitchen table, and while it was a huge expenditure for us at the time, my wife and I found a nice one we both liked for about three-hundred dollars at an outlet store. Though I didn't recognize it at the time, I was far too concerned with keeping it in its like-new condition. It was the first kitchen table we had purchased with our own money; we had always used hand-me-down tables from family. The expense meant there were other things that we had to do without or put off for a while. I should have cared far less about this table, and I regret it now, but at the time, that's not where my head and heart were at.

I don't recall where I had been, but I came home one afternoon to find my sons, ten and twelve, using hammers to crack open black walnuts on this table. The damage to the tabletop was not what I would call excessive, but it was damaged to be sure, not only from hitting the walnuts but also because they'd missed many times and hammered the table directly. It embarrasses me now, but I was livid. I like to believe it takes a lot to anger me, and this is one of the few times I can recall in my adult life that I was really, truly angry. I think I may have yelled, I honestly don't remember, but I know that whatever I did made them fearful of me that day. When I calmed down, I thought I had a brilliant punishment: if they could not respect the furniture in our house, they would lose their privilege to use it. Yep, I took away furniture privileges, for a week I believe it was to be. No chairs, no tables, no beds, no furniture whatsoever. I remember thinking that I had shown great wisdom in handing down a punishment that fit the crime, that would not harm them, but would make the point in a way they would not forget.

It was maybe four or five hours into this punishment when my wife approached me, she was probably waiting for me to cool off a bit. What she told me changed everything. It broke my heart and shattered my soul into a thousand tiny little pieces.

What I didn't know was that a few days earlier, my two sons had overheard me talking to my wife, telling her how much I love black walnuts, but how hard it was to get them out of their shell, and how I'd sometimes just sit with a rock on the sidewalk for an hour and smash them and eat them.

*They were cracking the walnuts open for me.*

**FOR. ME.**

They had learned that I loved black walnuts, and of their own accord, out of their love for me, their father, they chose to surprise me by gathering a bunch and breaking them open for me, so that I didn't have to work at it, I would have the pleasure of just enjoying them.

Fifteen years later and I still cringe and shed tears when I think of this. It is one of my most painful memories to recall. I felt really, really small. If I could have shrunk myself down to the size of the tiniest, ugliest microbe, it would not have been tiny or ugly enough. I had allowed anger to blind me to truth, over an entirely inconsequential material possession, and in this blindness had rebuked my children's attempt to express sincere love for me.

A LOT of crying and apologizing ensued, the crying shared all around, the apologizing ALL mine. I damaged my relationship with my children that day in a way that took a long time to restore. While I do my best, I am and have been far from a perfect father. Most of the mistakes I can forgive myself out of just inexperience mostly, but this particular event tears at my soul even to this day. I think it still might be a traumatic experience for them---it is for me!---but there is no question it changed me.

I vowed that day that, in ANY circumstance, whether it involves parenting or business or personal relationships or ANYTHING, I would always seek the full and complete truth with an open mind before making decisions or taking actions. What I had thought was wisdom had been little more than prejudice born of pride and ignorance, and it took an exquisitely painful lesson for me to become aware of them in my life and recognize how dangerous and destructive these things could be to me and the people I love.",21Jun2020,2
118," I’m a guy and I was working as a waiter on a quiet midweek day and I was taking finished plates back to the kitchen when I felt a stare and immediately looked to my right and 1 of these 3 girls was smiling/smirking at me and looked me down at my side/arm when I looked at her   (im tall and lanky and my arms looked a little bit big too because I was had a few layers on tinder underneath is that laughable?)  it was for about 3 seconds and then as I walked out of sight I heard a slight noise (couldn’t make it out) a bit later 2 of them were ordering food at the bar and  on their way back I felt a stare while I was standing at the kitchen gantry bored and looked over to one of them girls (the blonde friend of the girl who smiled at the start) on her own walking back to her table looking over at me and when I noticed  she laughed hard and put her hand to her mouth still looking at me then I looked away.

There is one more way that sounds appealing though. I’ve always loved the idea of being a YouTuber. I don’t hate the camera and I know again it’s taboo but I’ve done research for years and I genuinely see no reason it wouldn’t be a good job for me.

Well it felt like my mouth was massive and my tongue was very small to top this off it felt like I was laying flat I know I was lying flat in my bed but it felt like I was looking up at the ceiling even tho my head was tilted forward and it also felt like my entire body was floating so that all happened and then about 20 minutes later (40 minutes in roughly) after I pretty much dozed off so if I didn't doze off I probably would have started seeing hypnagogia so anyway, after those 20 minutes my arms started to feel like they were floating and I'm not too sure what else happened but now just as I decided to get out of bed and Instead of continuing to do this technique like I planned. I still done a reality check when I got out of bed and I also found my thigh muscles hurt a little bit almost as if they were about to go into paralysis.

Not to mention this happened 40 minutes into me not even sleeping instead of what everyone else says where you have to go to sleep and wake yourself up to do it.

I only saw mild hypnagogia this time and not as strong as the last time I done this technique but also at some point as I was trying to get into this state at the very beginning my left arm felt like it popped not like in a bad way but it felt like it popped just like a snap of awareness shortly after my right leg done the same and then my right arm done the same as if each part of that body was about to get put into paralysis which it didn't.",21Jun2020,1

I don't know if I can go on. Today being father's Day hit me hard. I've always wanted to be a dad, I thought I would have been one by now. But it was always something that was used against me. ""You can be a dad if you don't do X"", ""you're not ready to be a dad as we don't have Y"". I don't know. I just feel at 30 I've had my chance at a family and I won't get another.

I live in a single room with most of my stuff. Every day is a reminder of what I lost, in a bitter way. Sure I was abused, but at least I had family, at least I had purpose. Now I have nothing. I have things. I have no one to love, or to try make happy.

147,"A girl I’m close to opened up to me about the horrific way in which her reputation was ruined by the consequences of a sexual assault. Last night I heard firsthand the horrible way people talk about her, and it’s made me so angry


So basically this girl I like a lot and I have got pretty close over the last few months. We’re both 20 for reference. We’ve always kind of been in the same social circle for years, but a few months ago we started talking more on nights out, I kind of realised I had a bit of a thing for her, etc. The night that really cemented for me how I felt towards her was one night her and I were out with some mutual friends, but we had to help out one of my friends who was way too drunk and really emotional and depressed. She was sitting telling him how she gets that way sometimes too, how she gets how he feels, and was just really open, compassionate and caring towards him when she probably didn’t need to be. She’s a pretty emotionally closed off person, or tries to be, so I really saw a whole different side of her. I could tell talking about that kind of stuff kind of got to her a little, so after we took care of my friend and got him a cab home with his girlfriend I suggested her and I cut the night short and grab some food.

While we sat and ate she really opened up to me, about how she struggles with depression and anxiety (I do too, it was really nice to be so open and honest about it with someone), how she struggles to open up with people, but the main thing that stuck with me was that she kept asking me if I thought she was a slut before we kind of became friends. When I told her I don’t and asked her why she thought I would, she told me that she’s had that reputation follow her for years, and a lot of it stemmed from a party she went to when she was like 15.

She told me she was fooling around with a guy upstairs, and he wanted to go the full way and have sex with her. She told him she didn’t want to go that far, told him no over and over again, that she didn’t want to go any further, but he wouldn’t stop, and the guy raped her. I could tell she really struggled to talk about it, her voice was so shaken up, I had never saw her like that before. One of the girls at the party in question had a thing for the guy who done it and had saw them go into a bedroom together, and started a rumour that she slept with that guy and 3 others in the one night at that party. That same girl confronted her at the party itself just after she was assaulted, and she couldn’t even start to defend herself because it would have meant admitting what had just happened, so instead she just broke down sobbing and had to leave. Ever since that rumour spread from that horrible incident she’s been unable to get rid of that reputation.

I felt fucking awful for her, I could tell it took a lot for her to talk about it. We had a really open, honest and real discussion about our struggles and stuff, and that night we just majorly opened up to each other. I remember going home and just thinking about what a kind, caring, and insanely strong person she really was under her kind of tough, closed off exterior. I was attracted to her before that, but I found myself really caring about her since then.

In the months after that we’ve became really close, to the point she said she feels like she’s closest to me out of all our mutual friends, although we’ve never talked about that since. We do talk everyday though, and I’ve found myself caring about her a lot, to the point that it’s kind of an open secret to everyone we know that there’s something going on there. I was sitting in a friend’s garden yesterday with a few beers, and he saw I was texting her and asked how things were going between us. This guy who is like a friend of a friend who I don’t know all too well chimed in after hearing that saying ‘you’re talking to her? Good luck with that, I could tell you some fucking stories about her, she’s been around a lot’, and went on to mention the story of how she ‘fucked 4 guys at a party in one night when she was only 15’.

I didn’t say anything and kind of just ignored the comment, when I probably should have said something, but I was so fucking angry and sad for her in that moment. I felt like just shouting back that even if that was true, it wouldn’t matter, but the fact is that story stemmed from what had to be one of the worst nights of her entire life and it ruined her reputation and destroyed her mental health for fucking years. She had however tell me that night when she told me all this that she’s moved on, that she doesn’t want to ever dredge up the past again and knows if she ever tried to ‘clear her name’ she’d have to revisit it all and she doesn’t want people seeing her as a victim, and doesn’t want to go after the guy who done it. So I just bit my tongue, even though I wanted to stand up for her.

But fuck man. It’s just so fucking sad. Deep down she’s probably one of the most caring, funny kind, thoughtful and just genuinely good people I know, and even to this day when her name gets brought up people only associate her with the reputation around her sexual history that fucking started from the same night she was horribly assaulted, and don’t even think about who she is underneath. It makes me fucking sick, and it’s even sadder to me that she’s had to just move on from it without any closure at all even when it tore her life apart for so long. I’m genuinely amazed by how strong she’s had to be to move past all that, but I heard first hand how people talk about her and view her, and it really fucking boils my blood. I don’t even know what the point of this post is really beyond sharing how fucked up the way people view each other is, and how little people usually know of what someone’s actually had to deal with. I had no idea she’d dealt with any of this before she opened up to me, but I can’t stop thinking about the fact that if she hadn’t told me, I might have just ended up being another one of those people who heard that story and maybe even on some level judged her for it. People can be fucking awful to each other and so judgemental to women over shit like this, I don’t know how she manages to deal with it.",21Jun2020,1
148,"Hello again. After putting my dog down I was in some serious depression, so I made the stupid fucking decision of getting a puppy (from craigslist). First four days were great! I named him Sunny and true to his name, he was a ray of sunshine in my life. Then come day five he's not acting right. Loose stool, throwing up, not eating or drinking-- very lethargic. Day six, he's the same way, actually he seems to be getting worse so I take him to the emergency vet. He's got parvovirus and had to be hospitalized. 

That was the 18th, it's the 21st now and I have paid $4432 for him to be hospitalized for 48 hours. He's not any better, there is no cure for parvovirus, it literally just has to run it's course and you have to pray that he doesn't die of dehydration or some other virus/bacteria/parasite while his immune system is attacked by parvo. I can afford one last night then that's it. My only option is to take him home at that point, try to nurse him back to health and take him to my day vet and pray he lives. I am literally out of money after if I pay for one more day, I don't even know if I'll be able to afford my day vet. 

I am an unemployed student, I have to pay for my school in three days and *I don't know* if I'm going to be able to do it because every cent I had has been put into Sunny's hospitalization. 

I feel so absolutely hopeless and drained. I feel like I'm spending $4000+ to have Sunny euthanized because unless he miraculously gets better in the next 24 hours, the odds of him surviving out of the hospital are slim. 

This year just keeps getting worst and I'm sick of it.

149,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

I’m 6ft tall and thin and lanky and she’s very pretty tbh",21Jun2020,1
150,"so here goes, I have Friend 1 that I met this year, and we vibed with each other, but lately like he's become cold and distant. I don't know if I said something wrong. Then you have friend 2 which we met during february. 

we all live on the same street I live on campus and they live like 5 minutes away from my place and 2 min from each other. So we are having our finals right now and just to relieve stress we go out on night walks, it's kinda our thing. So yesterday they excluded me from it, and today proudly said that they went on a walk. 

my backstory : foreigner in a western country, always had a hard time to make friends and the friends that I had turned out to be backstabbers. 

Today I asked both of them whether they wanted to tag along; friend 1 never got back to me. Friend 2 said nah Im too busy. Now Friend 1 started a live stream where he was chilling with Friend 2. I mean at this point why do they even lie like that? This kinda hurts me you know? 

sorry for the whole web of texts but am I just overthinking the situation or am I right in ghosting them after my finals?",21Jun2020,1
151," I am 20 years old and I go to a University in New York. I have 3 sisters and 2 of them are older than me(10 years older and 6 years older). I don't have a job. My sister and my dad has been providing for me for the last 4 years. I did have a job for 2 months but had to resign due to SAT. I gave the little money that I earned to my sister since she's the one who's helping me all these years. I usually struggle a lot with my studies as there is a language barrier. I can't seem to memorize the things I read. I still asked my sister if I could have a job but she and my parents always declined saying I need to focus on my studies. I am basically failing all my classes and haven't been meeting up to anyone's expectations. I was 16 years old when I came to the States and my parents left me with my oldest sister so I could get a better education. She had a great job back in my country but she quit it because she wanted to give me a better future and her child. I grew up in a poor family and seeing my two sisters and my mom fighting all the time. from attempt of suicide, screaming, yelling,hitting  and every other physical, verbal and mental abuse was there. I was 8 years old when I got a little sister. I was extremely happy and wanted to protect her. I didn't want her to get close to the horror I went through but I failed miserably. I am failing everyday and now I have become the awful monster I wanted to get away from. My older sister worked really hard for me and basically had to sacrifice everything for me and did jobs for minimum wages and night shift. but it has been a hell for me to live with her. My sister says that I've mentally abused her and broke her completely. I have high anxiety and depression from a very young age. And there are things that causes me to have panic attacks and stuff. My sister will always do the things that she knows will tick me to be unstable. I am not violent when I am unstable. I mean I may look horrendous but I don't hurt people physically or verbally when I'm like this. I just cry and feel extremely unwell. Now I realized that coming to this country was a mistake. my younger sister had only me as a friend as she's always being bullied by other kids and my parents are no help either. Life back in my country was no good either as my 2nd older sister is very selfish. For example she didn't let me learn music or poetry as she told my mom that she thinks it's no good as I am young and if I learn then I will be better than her? Umm I don't really know but my mom told me to stop doing the things that I was passionate about. But it was still okay because I wanted my younger sister to have a good life. I have no friends or life anywhere basically but now it's worse because my younger sister has lost the only safe place she had.  Now we(except from my dad) are all stuck in this pandemic in a small studio room in new york for 2-3 months and things have been going awful. I am again going through the same trauma from years ago and feeling helpless as before and knowing that I can't stop from creating another good for nothing suicidal piece of trash. I desperately want my younger sister to have a bright future. Before at least when things went bad I could take my younger sister outside with me which is not possible anymore. I feel like an extremely toxic person living in a toxic environment for years. I don't really want to be alive sometimes but I push these thoughts away as I need to be alive for my younger sister and my parents(since they are old now and pretty helpless too) I still have 3 years to graduate and with the result I have I'm not so sure if I can ever really take care of my younger sister. What should I do? Is there any way I could save my younger sister? I also apologize for this meaningless rant I just really want to get better and help my younger sister with severe trauma and depression, anxiety. Thank you and those of you who are going through things, I hope you guys are alright too.",21Jun2020,1
152,"I KNOW I’m going to get so much hate in the comments, but it’s my truth. WHERE ARE THE NICE BOPS ABOUT LIKE feeling stupid, being successful, etc?? There’s so little of them compared to love-related ones, and I’m just like ‘omggggg stffuuuu’",21Jun2020,1
154,"The first time I read the myth of Sisyphus it was like finding Petroleum in my backyard, I was 17 and everything made sense for that time...This whole pandemic situation is very surreal for me. I started a new job at the beginning of it, and it is bizarre.  Having a hard time being accountable or responsible on working hours, drinking alcohol at meetings Taking naps or playing COD ..it is weird.  

I always had the feeling that life is a game in which you need to come up with tricks for you to get away with things..whatever the scenario is.  

The most successful people (money/ or career-wise) I have encounter is always people full of shit, they always felt so fake. The type of people who will say your shit or their shit smells like flowers for them to get away with their goals...

And I always wonder how they do it. How do you believe in yourself so bad that you become the CEO on a company or your own company? Like I know I'm capable of accomplishing whatever I want but somehow I sabotage myself into thinking that I can't. And In the end I just an observant of how others do it... 

In a way, this whole pandemic is a good thing. For once in my life, I'm facing my own shit, my problems but somehow get lost in my inner dialogue and always get to the conclusion that life is absurd. And end up wishing for the impossible, like a drug that will make me accomplish my goals..like these stupid Bradley cooper movie that I forgot the name lol 

Camus really hit the spot with this theory, but how can you adjust it to these weird times and feelings and somehow find that silly hope for you to keep going? 

In the search of the meaning of life..when you get to the point that it is absurd as fuck...how do you find the will/courage/purpose to keep going, to be your best self...without being a complete imbecile full of their own shit. Is that even possible? 

(Not sure if this makes sense, is kinda like a rant. But lord these are some fucked up times, and Reddit is like free therapy in a way haha)",21Jun2020,1
156,"I haven’t been able to focus in years please help

I haven’t been able to focus for years is this add

I just finished my freshman year of college and ended up with a 1.7 gpa. I know it’s horrible. The thing is I know I’m smart enough to do better. I’ll randomly do amazing on an assignment and get the highest grade on a long research essay because I’m able to focus for some reason. But I feel like this hyper focus only happens once or twice a semester. The more I take classes the less motivated I feel and the worse I do and I’ve been going downhill. I wanted to retake two courses over the summer but ended up doing bad in them again because I just screwed everything up. It’s hard because I always start off the semesters wanting good grades but can never achieve it. I know I’m motivated I’ve worked really hard in my jobs and care about things and people and succeeding but it just feels so hopeless. I have trouble with organization and understanding how to do my coursework successfully and have trouble listening when people talk. In high school I use to completely tune out in class but have worked on not doing that but it’s really hard. Idk if I’m just lazy or this is adhd or anxiety or something.",21Jun2020,1
157,"I've never made them myself before. But I found a recipe online after getting a bit bored of frozen roast potatoes to go with my Sunday roast dinner.

So I par-boiled my spuds for 8 minutes, and while they were bubblin' away I poured a bit of rapeseed oil into my roasting dish and whacked it in the oven to get all nice and hot.

When the potatoes were done, I drained them and then shook the hell out of them to get 'em all nice and fluffy, and then added them one by one to the superheated oil. Sizzle sizzle pop crackle. Threw them in the oven for half an hour, took them out, had them with some pork chops, mashed potatoes, mushy peas, carrots, Yorkshire puddings, and pork gravy made up with the water I boiled my carrots in.

Delicious. I'm a roast potato convert!",21Jun2020,1
158,"The ones who hate being called out for their racism and bigotry, they use this bullshit to disguise their thinly veiled insults instead of actually sitting down and thinking about what's really being said, and people react like theirs is actually a fair assessment of things and that's just equally bullshit.",21Jun2020,2
159," 

From 0 to 18-19 I was a pretty normal guy, people found me interesting or particular, but at the end of the day I was just another dude. Yeah I was funny, I could act and talk interesting and mysterious in a way but in reality I was pretty standard, I'm not the type to cry at museums, I'm not artistic or creative, I like standard food, standard movies, standard books etc. not that I didn't like myself or that I'm shaming myself for being too normal, I'm just saying that I was the type of person that people would find interesting and difficult to describe, but in reality I was not.

Early on, I'm saying like &lt; 10 years old, I was a very intelligent kid, but later on I have had to come to terms with the fact that I was just an intellectually precocious kid, not an especially intelligent person, not that I care much about this.

Without raving too much about my life from 10 to 18, we can just say that, at that point, I was a guy like many, not especially bright or successful in any way, not sports wise, friends wife, girls wise, school wise etc, but I also didn't have any trouble in any of these areas. I was a typical sarcastic, decently smart guy, half-way shy (I wouldn't really consider myself that but some would), funny, calm, but ultimately without ambition or real goals or things of that nature. Maybe I knew strange stuff and people knew that I had an interest on the most disparate things, but I wasn't really passionate about almost anything.

But I also honestly didn't have a problem in the world. I was a decent looking guy, didn't have any type of social or familiar problem, I knew how to make a friend, wasn't really insecure with girls or anything, wasn't stupid or not knowledgeable etc. Mentally, I was as sane of a person as you could meet, I wasn't anxious, wasn't an hypochondriac, didn't have anger issues, wasn't an overreacter, didn't have an addictive personality, I didn't have any need, I never get bored, I wasn't prone to depression, I could handle things, I honestly think that I had life to a tee as far as mental stability.

My only identifiable problem, and that is ultimately what led to my downfall, is that I hate, absolutely hate conflict especially with my family, I hate to let my family down, I hate to ruin their day, and I'm hyperaware and absolutely can't stand them having a bad opinion of me in any way. That and also a bit of a lack of willpower.

When I finished school, I went to university. There wasn't ever a doubt about that. I didn't really have a faculty that I loved or was passionate about, but I chose one that I tought would be good for me. I wanted to do good. During my school years many times I lied to my parents about my grades, which was my biggest problem, like genuinely the worst times I had in my life before the bullshit I'm about to tell you are the days after my parents found out about these lies.

So, when I started uni, I had my distractions as far as social life, other things I read about and was interested in, coding etc, so it's not like I was the hardest worker in the room, but still I was well intentioned to do good, but unfortunately shit went south: I legitimately studied for an exam that wasn't there: there was this class that had the exam at the end of the year, and not at the end of the semester like I tought, it was for second or later years students who didn't pass it in the first year, so I wasted so much time to take an exam I couldn't take, and then I had another exam I prepared but I still have no idea how I didn't pass it, I still don't rule out that the professor just didn't understand what I wrote, since I have terrible handwriting, but idk. So, basically, first semester wasted like that. I tried the other exam a couple of weeks later but I had 0 expectations, it was the most difficult one and I had little to no time to study because I wasted time on a non-existent exam and on another one that I failed mysteriously. That hurt me. That did make me lose a bit of motivation. But, most importantly:

\-I never understood what people meant when they said that a book, a movie etc changed their life, but it's honestly what happened to me with a blog (which I don't mention). In my usual wandering around the net, I stumbled in this blog that I quickly read in his entirety. It made me passionate about futurology, technological singularity, the blockchain, and starting from there I became passionate about subjects. A lot of subjects. No need to list them here.  
I started to write down things that I wanted to learn, things that I wanted to accomplish, things that I wanted to experience, things that I wanted to learn how to do, a whole lot of stuff. A lot of good stuff too, like ways to help people, enviromental issues etc, things of all nature. I started to write down what my days would look like etc. I became a passionate person, which was honestly what separated myself from being a great, bright person: ambition, passion, motivation.

\- During my school years, I was always into the redpill, lookism world. Not that I was mysoginistic or things of that nature, but I liked to read about looks, their role in life and relationships, evolutionary pshycology stuff, things like that. During that time it matured in my head the idea (that will make me look mentally ill to some but it's just because I will put it very bluntly, but I absolutely believe that given enough time to explain my motives, everybody would, I'm not saying agree, but at least understand) that life, in my current condition, wasn't worth living. Not in the sense that I might as well have killed myself, but that it just wasn't worth it to live that way. This is honestly the most important part of the story. I just decided that, that life wasn't enough. Going out with the usual friends, doing the usual things, getting to know some guys at uni, getting shitfaced, hanging out doing the usual things, playing videogames (which I really didn't do, not much of a gamer) eventually getting a girl and have a relationship, or going to parties and make out/have sex with a girl out of many tries (for a lack of a better word, I don't like saying tries but whatever), committing to know people to be in better social circles, working really hard for uni, not that I have any problem with this normalcy, I just decided that I wanted more, I wanted to live better. Yes I know that with hard work you can accomplish that ""more"", that there are terrible looking guys who have the most amazing lives etc, but it doesn't matter. This is where it gets tricky for me in this post. I don't want it to look like I have this view on life with normal people, losers at the bottom and rich, good looking guys at the top, with hot girls, parties etc, a là dan bilzerian, it's just that I wanted more. I didn't like my day to day life and my expectations, and I tought (and still think) that I wanted to live in god mode. I wanted to be instantly liked by people, approached by people, go to parties and be liked by every girl, I wanted to be extremely attractive, I wanted all the benefits that that brings to you. I wanted to BE BEAUTIFUL. I know how shallow I sound. I totally understand, but it's deeper than that. I just wanted that, man. I was also just self-conscious about some things, for example I have terrible teeth and I can't smile and I can get self-conscious just talking if I think that people are noticing them, I just wanted more, man, or at the time I was constantly super constipated for a condition that I have (but I later dealt with) that other than just being super unconfortable gave me a super nasal voice. That's it basically, I tought that that condition wasn't good enough FOR ME to be worth living and that I wanted to live in what I call ""God-Mode"".

So, I figured that, until I reached those things, I would put my life on stand by. I wanted to get a nose job, to put on dental veneers (honestly the biggest thing), and other minor things. Obviously, I would have never asked for money for such things. Side thing, but, a part from the fact that I'm a decent looking guy, I'd say I have a great base, as in, I have great facial structure and things of that nature, I just have some flaws that keep me from being a great looking guy. Again, I understand how shallow this may sound, but looks are a huge part of human life and an even bigger part of my story.

So, moving on, I let that year go to waste, and in the summer, I gathered the courage and confronted my parents about what I wanted to do. Very important, I didn't want to take a hiatus just for this current-life-isn't-worth-living-I-want-GodMode idea, it's also that I had other interests, I wanted to do things, learn how to code, help people, experience stuff, I just had different outlooks, I wasn't that prone in that finish uni as fast as possible, get a decent job mindset. I didn't like that at all.

So as I said, obviously I left out that ""lookism"" part, cosmetic surgery part to my parents, but, as the year was going to shit anyway, I told them that I wanted to leave uni, take a year, 2 max off to: learn how to code and other skills, while working online (you know that stuff, appen, leapforce, lionbridge, clickworker, those kind of things, I ""had a job"" with appen, I don't know if that would have lasted the whole year but I got it, did the test and everything and got selected and the pay was good, I mean it was like having a job while having to work like 20-22 hours from home I think). I was also opening a shopify and did ton of research on that. That was the plan. I told them. I was fucking ready. They took it bad AF. Bad as hell. Understand that my parents are good people, I love them to death and they love me to death, they are very loving, supportive persons etc, but unfortunately they are scared persons, they aren't the most open minded persons, they just couldn't do better than take it that way. The following days were terrible. The mood was terrible, It was like I became a totally different person to them, they barely speak to me some days and even between themselves, it was horrific. Obviously a lot of yelling and some crying too. I get that they were also ashamed to tell other people that I intended to leave uni. I don't wanna make them look bad. it was totally out of nowhere for them, and they never imagined us doing anything other than going to uni. But I tried to push through. To not give up. Then my older brother, who wasn't home when this happened came home. I hoped that he would support me, but he was like a third parent in that situation. It was hell. I couldn't stand it. Not that they beat me up, disowned or things of that nature, but I just couldn't stand the mood, the not talking to each other, everything. That's what I hate about my parents. They are the ""you let me down, now You have to rebuild our trust type"". Dude I'm the same person as yesterday. I'm still a kind person. I still fucking love you. I still wanna hug you. I still wouldn't say anything to make you feel bad. I still go out of my way to not people feel inadequate. I still try to better situations, to calm people. I know I made a bad thing, and I'm more ashamed than I should honestly be for it. But I'm still the same person as before. Our relationship shouldn't change for this. They never got that.  
Not that they are strict parents or anything, they just have this fucking thing. For example, at 17-18 I came home drunk a couple of times. They made the biggest deal out of that. Days of not talking. Things like that. I mean, I understand that I shouldn't have come home drunk. But things like that fucking happen. Matter of fact, I got drunk about every time I went out at that time. It's just that those two times I came home still drunk. Again, I'm the least prone to addiction person ever created. I just liked getting drunk, it made hang-outs so much better. I never put myself in any risk or trouble, I didn't drink and drive etc. I didn't have any health issue. But for them, it was the biggest thing. I'm still the same person as yesterday, I still fucking love you.

So, after a few days, I gave up. I gave up. Biggest mistake of my life. I went to my mother and said ok, mom, maybe I could get back to uni. I fucking failed. I couldn't stand my ground. I admire people that have the ability to be their own man, thrive in conflict so much. I couldn't. I wanted to get back to feel loved, to see my parents happy, I wanted the days to turn back to normal, I wanted that fucking weight off my back. I decided to go to uni (a different one). I figured okay, I don't have to be 100% committed to uni, I can do multiple things, maybe I will take more years to graduate, but that's what I will do. Earn some money online and go to uni, and try to learn Coding and other subjects more lightly.. Initially I meant to start uni mid-year or something like that, but eventually I did what I needed to do to sign up earlier, like one month after the start of the uni year.

During the previous year, I was totally set on not telling my parents any lies. This time it was different. Since my parents, given what happened, were totally on my neck, I needed to start with the right foot just to keep all of that away. Keep in mind, I've still got that appen, shopify, coding etc on my hand, and I wanna at least get seriously started with those things before I seriously commit to uni. And this is where I made my second mistake. Since the first ""wave"" of exams was due in 2-3 months, and then the ""extraordinary"" session basically to recover those ones was in another 2 months, I figured okay, I have time for my other shit, I can lie about doing a couple exams now and then I can easily do them later, it's not like we are talking about 10 exams or things of that nature, it's not that big of a deal. So I have the time to do those other things and see if they really have a future, and then I can commit to uni. Doable. And this is what I did. When I was ready to seriously commit for uni, I learnt that many of those classes had mandatory presence at the lessons. FUCKING KILL ME ALREADY. I don't remember if every one of these classes had mandatory presence, but yeah about everyone. I was totally screwed. I lied for the whole year, I said that I made 5 exams. At the end of the day, that's nothing that you can't recover. Like, 5 is more than 2, but it's not like it was impossible to handle. But I fucking hated those lies. What I did was just edit the grades page with inspect element, the 2 or 3 times they asked me to show it to them. All I did. I couldn't stand me for doing that. I felt bad every single time they asked me to talk about uni etc, I even deleted the edited pages and came close to being caught because I fucking hated it so bad, even searching my uni on the browser made me ansious and all of that, this thing changed me.

Also, I still had those other things on my hand, like, I wasn't in the mindset to tell to myself okay, you are in this situation, you screwed up, from next year on you put all of yourself into this and that's it. No. That's not what I was about. So, I figured that the only viable way for me was to get back to where I was the previous summer, before giving up on what I wanted to do. I just had to tell them tham I'm leaving uni for a year etc. But I couldn't do it. I just couldn't ever do it. The whole summer passed and I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. When like october came, I said them that I was gonna pay for the first (out of the 3) installment for the university fee (instead of them doing it as usual). So I had a bit of time for myself to either talk to them or sign up and fucking try to recover. I never did any. I was always like okay, next week I'll tell them. Next week. Next week. Then I couldn't handle that stress so I said okay, you can enjoy your days for a bit, you'll tell them after christmas holidays. But I never was able to do it. I never came close to doing it. In march, I finally went to uni to see if I was still on time to sign-up, just because at that point I knew that I never would be able to come clear to them. I was like 99,99% sure It was too late, and I was ready to give them a made-up story about me not signing up on time because of some random disease that messed up my life etc, but surprisingly, maybe because my faculty has like 20 sign-ups per year, I could. I said ok, I will be back tomorrow with the cards etc. I never went back. I didn't want to do it. On top of just having to put everything aside and just work hard to recover for all the exams I said I did at that point (I'm guessing maybe 8 at that point?), I just would have had to operate between so many lies, and at that point that lie had already changed me as a person. You have to realize, I wasn't liying to my parents to be chilling and have a good time. I stopped doing everything. I didn't went out, I didn't talk to my friends, I stopped playing sports, going to the gym, I stopped living. I couldn't do anything with the weight of the lie on my back. All day I was in my room at the computer, either reading or watching netflix. That's it. For some weeks I struggled with the decision to just go back to uni, I mean if march wasn't too late, april or may probably weren't either, but I didn't.

From June or so, I mean from when I didn't have the option to sign-up to the year, I basically accepted the possibility that I may have to kill myself, because on the tax declaration my parents obviously have to declare university taxes (which I sent them the screen of my fake payment with inspect element) which are obviously non existent, they would have already done it but covid delayed things, and there's also another thing that would expose me in a few days, as my mother wants to apply for a scolarship/grant (I don't know how I should call it) that requires my first year grades which are non existent, so I mean I'm screwed. During the months I considered all the possibilities, like I tried to educate myself as much as possible on the process of tax declaration to see if there was a chance that they woudln't catch us/me with the fake tax payment but that's impossible in 2020 and then my mother came forward with that grant thing so I have 0 possibilities of not being caught. Since I have realized this I consider myself a dead man walking. I don't even consider the possibility of telling them about my lies. The 2 roads for me were: killing myself or running away. I tried to push in my head the idea of running away but It's just not a possibility. It would be totally uncalled for on my parents who love me and tried to do everything as well as possible, and also I can't live as a runaway lol.

So since some weeks I just figured that I needed to commit suicide by jumping. I figured I would jump from a building, but since I can't deal with having to search for a building to jump from and mine's roof is closed (like you need keys and I don't have them or something) I decided to jump from a bridge. I chose this one from a nearby town a couple of weeks ago. I try not to live my days thinking about this, which I do very successfully, like, my mindset has been to live normal day by day until the time comes. So, a couple of weeks ago I took the train and went to this bridge, also to see if it was accessible or things like that. I went there on a saturday. It's a great spot, sorry for using the word great, but for my purpose, it's a perfect spot. But I couldn't do it. I came back next monday, but ultimately I decided to go at a B&amp;B nearby and commit the deed the next day or the next one. The next day, my cousin called me and asked me to do a thing for her, so I came back to my city and did it. I went back to that town. I spent so many hours on or near that bridge, both coming to terms with what I was about to do and waiting for people to go away, I wanted to be completely alone. At the moment where I was the most ready to jump (you also have to climb to get up there to jump, so you can't just jump in a moment), and I was finally about to be alone, this happened: for the previous 20 minutes or so, the only person who could see me was this woman with a dog, if she went away before anyone else came I was finally be totally alone. When she finally started walking to go away and she was midway in the bridge where I was, she stopped where I was and she talked to me, she asked if everything was okay, what was I doing there etc, and I totally opened myself to her, she invited me home, she has a kid, she's the only person who knows what I'm going through. I love her for being so kind and caring, the world needs people like her. She proposed me that she tells my parents what's going on or we do it through a pshycologist or something like that, but unfortunately I tried to consider the option but I just can't do it. I can't even consider the possibility to come clear, I'm sorry.

So, the day came, tomorrow I'm gonna do it. I'm fucking sad that I'm gonna have to kill myself, not just because well suicide is terrible and for how sad people that love me are gonna be, but also because I fucking love life, I love my family, I'm totally well with everything apart from this fucking situation, if it wasn't for that everything would be fine, the future was my biggest passion before becoming a dead man walking, I wanna see the future, I want to be apart of it, I love everything, I can't stand that I'm gonna have to do it.

Also, I hate that so often this thing has made me ashamed and feel like the worst person in the world. Yes, I screwed up my parents and lied and did a terrible thing. I lied and lied so many times out of this thing. But I'm a fucking good person. I'm as kind as I can be, I go out of my way to not hurt people, to not let people feel inferior or not knowledgeable, to not hurt them, to compensate for other people's attitude, I care about people, I sacrifice myself for people, I sacrifice myself for principles, for example I go out of my way to don't impose to other people a different view of myself than the one they have because I think that people should totally let other people be, I don't try to interfere with people, I really go out of my way to try to do what I think it's right. And I also had the potential to be a bright, great person. This is sad.",21Jun2020,4
160,"I know this probably seems ridiculous compared to what's going on in the world right now but she left me after 8 months and in that time she slowly became the only person I would talk to regularly and her home is like a second home and her family is like my family. We've had such an amazing time over the past 8 months and have done amazing things together but only a few days ago did she mention she was feeling unattached from me or anyone and today she called me and broke up with me completely randomly 15 minutes before I had to leave for work, I'm now sat in my room drunk and crying because no breakup has ever been this bad, she still cares about me and loves me but just can't be with me so I've lost someone who loves me rather than someone who has cheated on me like in the past, I am absolutely devastated and i know it sounds stupid because it's only an 8month relationship but that relationship was more to me than any other relationship. I didn't even feel this shit when I was dumped after 2.5 years.",21Jun2020,2
161,"There was a post on unpopular opinions, which I understand is a very conservative subreddit, but damn. I don’t understand how me celebrating my mother affects anyone else at all. 

I absolutely understand where you’re coming from. I am one of those people who celebrates both mother’s and Father’s Day with my single mother.

My perspective is this: my single mother gave her entire life to me and my (severely disabled) sister. My father was never around post 6 years old. My sister was only 2 when he left. I celebrate Father’s Day with my mother because she, essentially, was both of my parents. 

Not only did she provide me with her motherly love and care, she also taught me how shave when I hit puberty early. (Mustache in 4th grade). She didn’t know how to do this, she fucking looked it up and practiced with me, so that my 10 year old self wouldn’t be embarrassed about my partially existent facial hair. 

My mom encouraged me when I’ve wanted to play sports. She came to my football games, and my soccer games. She fucking played Halo 2 with me! She was terrible at it, but she played 
it. 

Like I said, I understand where you guys are coming from, I just don’t really understand how me celebrating Father’s Day with my amazing single mother is taking away from you celebrating it with your father.

I have taken what would usually be a very sad holiday and made it into an enjoyable one. My mother is a god damn champion, and I am going to celebrate her whenever I can!

162,"Hey guys, my fiancé is 8 months pregnant and honestly I was wondering if I truly count this one. Also if anyone has any tips on the whole being a good father thing I’d be happy to hear them :D I can truly say I have no clue what I’m doing and I’m kinda just winging it day by day. I’m 20 if that matters. Anywho, thanks guys :) happy Father’s Day ✌️",21Jun2020,0
163,"**TL;DR** My coworker and I both got laid off. We’ve been friends for a while, but I’ve had a crush on her for a long time. I want to tell her that I like her. How do I do it?

I’ve had a rough couple of months because of covid-19. I’ve had the disease, two family members have died and this week I also lost my job because my work had pretty much dried up. All of this sucks, but this is not that kind of post. I’m telling you so you know I’ve got a lot on my mind right now and that I’d appreciate some advice on this (simple) question.

Emma is a girl who worked at my office and who I have always liked. She moved to my city with her long-term boyfriend a few years ago and we’ve casually hung out at work (sometimes after) since. It was always as friends, even though I developed a crush on her early on. But because she was in a long term relationship and I never wanted to date someone from work I never acted upon it.

About a year ago her relationship ended, but because we worked together I didn’t want to ask her out. I also didn’t think it was appropriate. 

So then covid happened and we both lost our jobs. I asked her out for a coffee last week and we had a really great chat. We’ve always clicked and she definitely likes and appreciates me, but I don’t know if she has or could have feelings for me.

So now I’m in a position where I want to let her know how I feel. I don’t know what the future will bring and I don’t know how this would work in the current situation, but I think she deserves to know and I really want to tell her.

But how do I tell Emma? Do I ask her out again for a coffee? I worry having a coffee is just not the right setting to let her know. We’ve been having casual talk over coffees for years now and I think it’s just a little awkward to tell her “hey, btw I also have a crush on you” over a coffee.

Or do I ask her out for a proper night out? But then I’m not sure what she would think, since it probably won’t be clear to her that I’m asking her out on a date. Do I ask her out for a walk or picnic in the park? We both have lots of free time now, so that might be a better thing to do? What would I say? “Hey, btw I’ve always liked you. Do you like me too?” Or “Can I ask you out on a date some time?”

It’s just that this situation is so unreal to me right now. Whenever I’ve dated someone it’s always been obvious that it’s a date and that we’re romantically interested. With her it’s different since we’ve been friends for a while. She definitely likes me as a person, and I think maybe I’ve seen some interest from her side but who knows.

I’ve thought about not telling her. I figured I’ve got so much stuff going on right now that maybe it’s best to ignore this and sort out other things in my life. But I’ve made up my mind that I’m going to tell her. Because it is always nice to hear these things (especially now), even if you don’t feel the same way. And because I know I’ll regret not telling her for the rest of life. It’s happened before and I still regret it to this day. “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take”.

Also there's always like 1 piece of trash that comments being aggro an doesn't understand the status right, if you're that trash just fuck off, get some self control",21Jun2020,1
165,"Not sure where this should be posted/what I even expect a response to be, maybe off my chest? But feel it's more self and just words that I needed to type. 

When I was 12, I was infatuated with a guy who worked with my sister. He was 18 and we met frequently and he fingerrd me in a park, I was a very lost child and although this brought trauma, when we just talked after it brought happiness which made me return - I've overcome this with therapy and a few ayahuasca sessions as well as a lot of memory disassociation, and rarely think of it/when I do it feels more like a movie or memory that happened to someone else. After watching the movie 'bombshell' tonight which I highly recommend some old feelings started to creep up on me, I always question if this was sexual assault as I went to the police at 15 and nothing came of it 🤷‍♀️

The biggest part is when I was 12  I asked my mum if a guy fingering you could get you pregnant. I was so niave and I'm sickened that my mum didn't even question why if be asking this question at this age.",21Jun2020,2
168,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask this. 
I normally have thoughts about things that I don’t agree with and have a hard time controlling them. I often have to force myself to think about something else or shout out a random word or yell “Stop!” in my head to stop the thoughts. I’ve had this problem since middle school and I’m currently in college and am just now addressing it as I realize it could be a real issue I should get help for. 
It happens mainly at night but overall at any time. It’ll be the most random things. 
For example, a little background first, I’m not religious but have struggled to figure out what to believe in. I respect religion overall and feel like anything could be a possibility so I try not to say or think anything that’ll mess up my “reputation” with the higher beings in a religion even though I don’t follow or practice the religion if that makes sense. But for example in regards to Christianity, I’ll think things (mainly at night before going to bed) like, “F*ck Jesus.” Or chant “666” in my head. And I’ll have to force myself to stop because I personally am not against Jesus but I think stuff like that and I don’t know why. 
Or I’ll think about messed up and perverted sexual things that I would never practice but it just comes in my head and I have to force myself to stop. It’s very frustrating and i’d like to know if anyone else has or had similar issues and how to stop it.",21Jun2020,1
170,"I haven’t had the best relationship with my brother in the past, but I’ve been really working through it in therapy and we’re working towards a really good relationship. We’re not there yet, but I am optimistic. Anyways, I’m going through it with this guy and other things in my life, and he was worried about me so he drove 45 minutes from his house to bring me coffee at work and make sure that I was okay. He even told me I was welcome to stay at his apartment if I needed to. At least one positive thing has happened today, and I am glad that he’s there.",21Jun2020,1
171,"I know what a lot of you are going to say but I’ll give some background. I’m 18 and currently living in France, because I left my home country at 15, it’s been an uphill battle, language and what not whereas in England I excelled in my studies and reached great grades! Ever since coming to France all I’ve had is crap and I really want to just go back home and work then take an access course to he when I’m 19. However with the whole situation that I won’t name,  should I bother quitting School and go back to England to have maybe jump start a career or Should I stay home with my parents and grind another year of which I’ve lost all motivation? 

tl;dr My life so far in terms of education for the last 3 years has given me only Stress, should I drop out, move out and get a job?",21Jun2020,1
