0,"This is a throwaway account, I don't want to post it on my main one. tl;dr at the bottom.

Everything just culminated in a giant mess. 2020 was already a hard year for me(22m). My grandfather is stuck in the hospital and there are no signs for him getting better again, he might die. 

Now it got worse. My parents are getting divorced because of my dad. He is a manipulative, stalking, controlling sociopath who is making life for all of us hell. His behavior got worse since my mother started at her new job. She is doing amazing but he, of course, has to maltreat her for that being an egoistic and jealous idiot. My sister and I could not bear that anymore, so we tried to get some help from our family to calm things down or help somehow. It just made it worse. The only person living here with us in the same country was my grandmother from my father's side. But she just supported him for doing his things. This made it explode into a giant fight with the police and other things involved. He got a restraining order for 2 weeks and things calmed down. We got a new appartment and distanced us from him. His side from our family is practicly now dead for us. 

To make things even worse,my girlfriend of 3,5 years broke up through text after the escalation. Her reason is, that she has no feelings for me anymore. I do understand that and don't want to make her feel even more uncomfortable being stuck with someone she doesn't love. But it hurts so much. She was everything for me, I supported her in every way I could. She was my first girlfriend, I loved her from the bottom of my heart and still want only the best for her. And now, where I have it bad, she just made it worse. Doing it through text was horrible for me. Not even doing it just for me, leaving the easy exit for her just like that. I asked her at the beginning of our relationship, that if she ever wanted to break up, to do it the right way. Not like this. I guess she just didn't care anymore for me.

I feel so alone. I lose everyone close to me and have no one to be there for me. I try to be there the best I can for my sister and mother, they are really traumatized from all the recent events and can't expect them being there for me while dealing with all that shit. It's good that they also went ahead to get professional consouling since they were more the target from all that maltreat. But I don't know who to go forward. With another lockdown going live on tuesday, I feel like I am going to be even more isolated.

Sorry for lamenting here on reddit, I normally don't post about these things here, but I don't know how to deal with everything. Thank you kind redditor for reading!

tl;dr my grandfather is in the hospital, probably not going to make it; my parents are getting divorced after it escalating with violence and maltreat; my girlfriend of 3,5 years broke up a few days after over text messages; another lockdown is going live, I'm going to be isolated from friends; I feel so extremly alone and don't know how to go forward.",02Nov2020,1

2,"My own mother just told me to leave America after I told her I think this country is a dumpster fire right now and I don’t want to vote because I don’t trust either candidate. (She asked me if I was going to vote, I said I don’t know if I want to, the conversation was sparked.)

Thinking negatively of America right now doesn’t mean you suddenly don’t appreciate the good things about America, it just means you are seeing the bad things and acknowledging them instead of pretending they don’t exist and pretending America is some type of utopia. The world is laughing at America right now for a reason.

This country is a steaming pile of hatred, unrest, violence, and pettiness right now, and it’s okay for you to acknowledge that. An American citizen with a negative opinion of the country right now isn’t unpatriotic. They’re honest.",02Nov2020,1

15,"Okay, some context - I'm a 14-year-old with Asperger's syndrome and above-average intelligence (I'm not lying, my IQ is 125). I can't stand what I see in the mirror each morning.

I'm a tall, hairy teenage body with long, curly brown hair, brown eyes, glasses, and a Sephardic Jewish skintone (because I'm of largely Sephardic Jewish ancestry.) My skull is large, and my face is small. My mouth is narrow, my nose is huge, and my hairline is far up on my scalp.

Every day I wake up and I loathe what I see. I don't want to be a werewolf - I want to be completely clean-shaven with smooth skin. I want an Asian skintone like this girl in my English class named Ali. I want a larger face, smaller nose, and larger mouth.

I want long, black hair partially dyed pink. I want breasts and a plump butt. I want way smaller hands and a more feminine face. I want a vagina more than anything in the world.

For the love of God I'm so sick of wearing puffy Nikes shoes, sweatpants, and t-shirts. I wanna wear dresses, tutus, thigh high stockings, leggings, Vans, skinny jeans, sweaters, makeup, boots, overalls, crop tops, cat ears, makeup, jewelry, etc.

Why can't I ever be satisfied with myself?",02Nov2020,1
16,"I miss last year when I had things to look forward to in my senior year of high school. But, the only thing I don’t have a pessimistic view about right now is my own life and I hate it. Yet I have no idea how to combat this with the tools I have been given this year. 

Before this year, I was working on injecting positivity in my life a little by little for myself emotionally and my mental state. But after everything that has happened this year the little optimism that I have built up as well as the stability that I have achieved in my mental state has been slowly chipped away at by stress and anxiety over the course of the last 10 months until I had a mental breakdown recently. Now I’m back to being my old depressed pessimistic self with a precarious mental state, that is reminiscent of my middle school years, also with a side of I feel like I have to cry all the time. 

But I think I will be okay. It’s gonna hardest thing I have had to do in really long time, but I think I can build my mental house again brick by brick, wall by wall still it’s as solid and stable as it was before.

I really hate everything happening this year and I hope nothing of the same scale happens next year.",02Nov2020,1

21,"I don’t have anyone to tell this to (because of coronavirus) so I am gonna put this on here.

My uncle is a good businessman, he owns a few companies and he is doing well for himself, but in the 90s he was at a convention, and a guy came in, he told the people there about his company, and a few people invested in it, my uncle was contemplating it but he thought it wouldn’t go anywhere.
A few years passed and he never heard from the guy, so he thought he made a good decision in not investing, but after a few months he was checking the stock market and saw Amazon was there, he did some research and he was amazed to see that the guy that he didn’t invest in was a multi millionaire, he regretted his decision of not investing, but he didn’t know how big Amazon would actually get.

I feel the last one is a bad excuse but sometimes I just get distracted with stuff and end up doing work for school at like 12am.

I'm worried I'm going to do badly in school, and go on to not get far. I'm hoping to be an animator/ something to do with art.

The party where we were both drunk and she said “do you think you’re a hotspice” ( referring to British slang, meaning attractive) and as I’m walking away saying “coz you’re not”, this was all said in a video which I’ve had for years but never caught on. The time at the bus stop when a guy approached us and I responded to him and he said “I wasn’t talking to you” to which her response was to laugh. I feel like a bitter realisation has come to me and even though she doesn’t seem to be like this anymore, I can’t help but feel hurt it makes me feel like the bond that I thought we had was not real? I don’t even know if I have the right to feel like this anymore.

Most of my friends were international students who left. I don't have any in-person classes until at least September 2021. I try to socialize as much as I can at the library, but it's not enough.

I can't go to the gym anymore to channel my frustration since they've closed (and yeah, working out in my tiny room doesn't feel the same). I don't have a girlfriend. I don't have a lot of friends either.
I just feel completely forgotten by the Government and most people. I'm depressive and other than meds, I don't have any support as I can't afford therapy anymore.

Tl;Dr: I think my dad kicked me out after constant arguing and him recently stopping his anti depressants. I hate living there and living with my mom isn’t an option (her and husband are emotionally abusive). I’m staying at my GF’s house right now and don’t know what to do. Idek if I was kicked out or not. 

I live in West Virginia if anybody has any help to offer (programs or anything) 

First, background. I dropped out of WVU a few weeks ago. I was majoring in Electrical Engineering. I withdrew and enrolled to start community college classes in the spring for EET. Recently, I’ve decided to just become an electrician and I know the process in order to do that and plan on starting soon. 

I got a job lined up at UPS and I’m waiting on them to call me to start anytime this month. I spend time at my girlfriend’s house when I’m not home, and that’s about it. 

My dad:

My dad owns a trucking business he is very busy with, he recently started tapering off his antidepressant he’s took for years. He tapered for two weeks and stopped yesterday. I’m facing the effects right now. 

I also can’t stay with my mom since I moved out there two years ago because her husband ignores me and they both are very emotionally abusive. My dad is too but it took time living there to realize it. 

Yesterday I hit the side of my truck’s wheel and broke it while driving (went off the road a little and just knicked the rim on the pavement) and broke it. Nothing major. But, since my dad decided to buy such a huge lifted truck the wheel cost $450. It happened right in front of GF’s house, and he showed up screaming at me and going crazy. We took the wheel off and went home. He threatened to take all my electronics and music instruments but I talked him out of it.

Last night after all this he started going off more and I told him he can’t stop taking his pills in two weeks. He did this when I was younger and broke my Xbox by punching it. He told me I was stupid and I’m not a doctor, and I can’t tell him what he can and can’t do. Even after I said I’m just looking out for your health. 

This morning he left and was real smart and angry when he asked for the car keys. He came back home and yelled at me angry to help him outside. I was carrying my phone and his checkbook back to the house and after my confusion from what he said (called the checkbook my laptop) he said he couldn’t see straight and told me to help him inside. Then said help me outside. I asked inside or outside. 

He yelled at me to leave and go away. I texted my gf and said it might be time to get me. Her parents are really supportive of me and treat me better than my mom or dad ever have. He saw I said that and threw a fit screaming and yelling. Called my mom (haven’t spoke since the divorce) to get me and asked if I wanted to live with her. I said no and he told me to call her to get me. That’s when he yanked the phone out of my hands and saw the texts. 

He got even hotter and started screaming more then called my mom. I grabbed my toothbrush and hairbrush and took off running up the highway. My neighbor saw me and picked me up. He took me to the store where I met my gf and her mom.

I walked around in my pajamas everywhere and have no clothes here. I ran down the highway and had cars honk at me. I called my mom to explain why he called her and she said I asked for it when I went to live with him. I don’t expect any help from her anymore but wow that was really mean. 

Me and my dad live with my grandparents and his sister and her husband. I got screamed at this morning by my grandma, since i broke the wheel in front of GF’s house. My entire family hates her and her family. 

My dad told my mom on the phone he’s tired of dealing with me since I don’t help (he treats me like a servant I cook and clean after him) I won’t get a job (waiting on ups to call me I can take the test for my electrician apprentice license in December) and honestly I can tell he doesn’t like me. 

We argue all the time and he gets on my last nerve. He treats me like a little kid and only speaks to me to tell me what to do. When he gets mad he screams and my therapist told me I’m better than that. So when I stand up for myself he gets even madder. My whole family sticks up for him since he has always had his way and is babied. 

I have a feeling they won’t get a hold of me and now I’m stuck here with my gf and her family. They are poor and don’t have a lot so I feel bad staying without being able to support myself.

My moms mom who lives in Tennessee also offered to drive up and get me and let me live with her. She said she can get me a job easily and I can start my life or career or whatever there.

I don’t really want to leave my gf and her family since i already know I have something here to support me.
I also don’t know how I can get any of my stuff out of my house, since my dad will claim none of it’s mine even tho I bought some music stuff. He will say it’s his cause he paid for it.

The first thing he said to me when he saw the truck wheel was “take that stupid s*** off) referring to the button up I had on since it was cold outside. The house behind us caught on fire with me inside our house and melted our siding. He rushed home from work to make sure everything was okay and our house didn’t burn down, and didn’t even stop to see me first he went to grab his computers and business stuff. He also took all the money off my debt card earlier before I could get it out at the ATM.

I feel like he hates me and he doesn’t care. I think this is it and now it’s time for me to start taking care of myself. Idk what to do and I’m sorry this post is so scattered I’ve had a crazy day and I have to get it all out.",02Nov2020,1

I've hit a wall though, I can't will myself to work even harder to make a savings, even though I've gotten over the major anxiety of working again, this seems like a wall I can't get over. Every time I try to push myself, my mental tanks and I get really depressed and I might end up not working for a week or two, and I can't afford to have that happen. I feel like I'm balancing on a tight-rope and I'm stuck in the middle on the way to terrafirma (College and a job).

52,"So my gf sent me a picture of herself of her face paint for Halloween. And it’s just an average picture y’know no obvious trying to look good just “oh here ya go” kind of thing. Thing is, I can’t stop looking at it. She’s just too beautiful (and yes I know that corny af but please shut). It’s like she looks amazingly good for just a simple photo and I can’t figure out why. She isn’t even smiling and yet in my eyes she’s absolutely gorgeous and I’m lying here at 1:20 in the morning looking at this and thinking “how did I end up with this angel of a girl”. It’s stupid and probably all you see are the ramblings of a love struck teen but for the one person who understands this like I just can’t stop.

54,"The lockdown left me with a lot of time to think, and I started thinking about my past and I realized that I subconsciously hurt people.

In my childhood I never had to work hard for anything and I didnt go through any hardships, and left me with being lazy and low self esteem. (Im kind of blaming my circumstances for this, and I know its immature)

I was kind of a rat when it came to making friends, I always wanted to be friends with the cool kids, but was too scared to approach them, so I just was friends with people who I didnt like to not be lonely, and abandon them when I got the chance to be with the ""cooler"" group.

This behaviour left me with no close friends in middle school, so I just isolated a played video games, because it was easier than building friendships.

So now everytime someone gives me attention I get attatched to them, because Im really lonely and crave human attention without giving in any effort to get it.

And most of the time these people are girls who have an interest in me, and I pursue them in the rush of emotions, and it usually ends up with me breaking their heart.

Im so disgusted with myself, and I wish to change, how can I stop being like this?",02Nov2020,1

57,"I probably will sound immature and stupid for what I’m about to say... but it’s true. 

I’ve been with a man who I’ve come to love more than anything only for about 4 months now. He is my other half. I will never find someone again that’s so good for me in my life. When he met me, I was addicted to fentanyl. He helped me get off, and really start my life. He taught me so many new things, helped me through so much. I have so much to thank this person for. He’s done more for me than anyone besides my father has in the short period of time I’ve known him in. I love this man with all my heart. I want to be with him for the rest of my life. I want to be his wife and the mother of his children. I don’t want anything else. 

But we keep fighting. Some would say he overreacts from time to time, but it’s only because it builds up. I just keep fucking up. I can’t help it. Fuck up after fuck up. I just keep saying things I shouldn’t. Like telling him what to do, giving him attitude, just being a bitch, having these junkie tendencies like liking drugs, etc. It sounds like not a very big deal but if you understood how frequently and how exactly it’s unraveled you would understand. He’s kicking me out tomorrow for the second time in a week. 

HELP ME PLEASE!!! What’s wrong with me??? Why can’t I keep my fucking mouth shut sometimes?! What can I do to remind myself to just think before I speak!? It’s so insane, I don’t know what’s fucking wrong with me 😭😭😭😭 all I know is that if I loose this man, I don’t know what I’ll do. I don’t know. And I feel like I have no more chances, like if I can’t fix this all right now I’ll loose everything. I don’t want to do this without him. I’m not strong enough. Please help me.

Has anyone ever had a similar problem... please help me. What should I do?? He’s not being unreasonable. I’m always negative.. sometimes I can’t help it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.. 😭 I just hope and pray that I can fix this now and my relationship will be saved. He’s the love of my life. I hope everybody finds someone who matches them as good as my baby matches me. Cheers to those that believe in true love... hopefully it will get me through this. 

Please tell me what I should do to remind myself that if I say the wrong thing it will start a fight and I will loose, not just the fight but everything. Please help me. I can’t loose him. I feel like it’s going to end if I can’t fix this now.. he wants to give me a chance but I can see in his eyes he’s not sure if he can or should. I just need to prove to him I can stop these bad habits. Please

65,"I'm so fuckin tired. I haven't slept for more than 4 hours straight in 2 or 3 weeks. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist soon, so maybe she give me something to help, I don't know. I can't seem to stop these racing thoughts about random shit. It's hard recalling the all because they happen quickly and I'm groggy in the moment so it slips away. I know I worry about my relationship with my girlfriend, not that it's bad it's just I have some worries about things like everyone does. But it's stuff I don't feel like I can talk to her about, I think. Than I think about my dad and our relationship, and I've made posts before complaining about my dad but the reality is that I'm only mad at him because he hurts my feelings a lot. He's super inconsiderate and treats me like a small child sometimes. I work for the family business, with my brother and dad, I cook food for a marketing campaign we have going. He called me up friday night at 7:30 and he said, ""hey, what are you doing?"" I told him I was watching a movie with my girlfriend and he goes, ""Didn't I tell you to try the food you make before you film it?"" and I say, ""Yeah why? which one didn't you like?"" and he told me, but he told me the vegetables were so gross he couldn't even eat them and ""why is the stuffing so sweet? it's not good."" But I liked both of those recipes and in the video I'm not going to say to use honey cornbread (hence the sweet) but it's all I could find locally and I didn't have the time or the desire to make my own cornbread. He tells me this friday night, after I've spent the last two and a half days recording for a video that goes out this upcoming friday. My dad and I have a rough past, pretty usual story really, but basically what he means when he calls and tells me this kind of stuff is that I fucked up and I need to redo the whole thing. I'm a one man crew on this and that makes the mistakes increase and the stress increase dramatically, that I can handle, what I have trouble dealing with is when my dad is in a bad mood and calls me to take his frustration out on me, which used to happen all the time when I was a kid but as an adult I think it reminds me of being a kid and not having any control of my life. I'm 27, and I'm sure some people will read this and say something snarky, but it's hard when your dad is verbally and emotionally abusive to you for most of your life.

&amp;#x200B;

One particular memory I have is my dad asking me to find something when I was maybe 5 or 6, I couldn't find it, he comes downstairs and looks in the same drawer (it's a huge drawer btw, it's like a coffee table that is supposed to hold blankets but we used it for other random shit at the time) he looks in there and finds it right away and screams at me for not finding it. Fast forward to last week, we had some stressful shit happen at work and he wanted to sample a product in the middle of it, don't know why, so I cook it up in a pan and tell the guys to come try it. First thing he says is that I overcooked it so it's not going to be right. I didn't over cook it, it's turkey bacon, the shit gets crispy quick and that's also how I like it. Which I told him, and he ignored as per usual, and he told the guys that I overcooked it. Which is embarrassing considering my whole job at this company to cook and one of my passions outside of work is cooking. If I can make pasta from scratch, alfredo from scratch, and make my own Italian sausage (stuffed into casings as well) than I can cook a piece of fuckin bacon. So that was frustrating, then he tells me to microwave a couple pieces because he wants to try it. He tells me this as we're on the phone, I didn't hear what he had said and I asked ""how long?"" He starts talking to the guy on the phone, I stand there and wait a sec and he looks at me like ""what the fuck are you doing?"" I ask again, he says something but I can't here it because one of the guys is talking to the other guy on the phone. I ask him again, he ignores me, I think, ""I guess 1 minute then."" I cook it for 1 minute and it's too cooked for him. Again. The he gets pissed at me, in front of 2 of the employees, and he starts to yell like he did when I was a kid, but stops himself because there are people there, but he gets out, ""why'd you cook it for a minute, I didn't tell you to cook it for a minute, why don't you listen? You never listen to anything!"" Now, normally I would yell back and we'd get into a huge fight. But that isn't acceptable behavior for a business environment. So I grit my teeth and bare it, but I'm definitely pissed and everyone there, my brother included, can tell. So I stand in the breakroom for a couple minutes before I decide that I don't need to be there and I walk back to the office I share with my dad and brother. So I can't get away at all. Now, I get that we were having a problem at the office, and it was a big one, but that isn't an excuse.  Everyone was worried, but as the family who owns that company it isn't just my  dads ""ass on the line,"" as he so aptly said, it's ours. It's his and my brother's. And mine. This is just as much the business that I am included in. Just because I don't do sales or transportation or warehouse work anymore, and I more on the marketing side doesn't mean that I don't care about the shit that goes on there. Not to mention how he is about money, I once saved up, from working in our warehouse where he paid me below minimum wage and took half of each paycheck and put it into a bank account against my will at the age of 11, I had saved up to get an xbox 360. My friend came over and my mom took us to go get it. When we got back tot he house we had my friend sneak around the side of the house where there was a window and I ran down to the basement and opened the window, took it and then went and let him in the house. At the time we made it into a spy game type deal and it was fun, but the real reason my mom suggested it and I went with it is because we knew he'd scream at the two of us in front of my friend. So we acted out a game. So I could bring in something that \*I\* purchased with money I had earned. He would've screamed because he hates video games and thinks it's why I am fat (I wasn't overweight until my mid twenties, I look at pictures of myself then I wish I was still that skinny, but I am dieting and trying to work out now), he thinks video games are a waste of money. Once he got mad at me for spending money and told me that he got made because it's still like his money. The company paid me, and he \*is\* the company and I'm his son I guess, i don't fuckin know. By that metric every dollar that anyone ever makes ever isn't their money, it's the company's money, himself included. Anyway, I bring this up because I saved up for, and preordered, the ps5 and I guess my brother told him and then my dad told my mom he was disappointed in me or was upset that I was wasting money because he perceives me as either being too poor to spend money or wasting all my money all the time on frivolous things. Which I rarely do. Honestly, in today's climate, how many people in their 20's, or people in general, can say that they have almost 10 grand in their savings and 4 grand in their checking? Not Many. 4 thousand of my savings is left over college money, but it's still left over from what I didn't spend. So, since I started paying for all my own bills except phone bills because he loses a family plan if I go on my own plan, I've raised and saved almost 10,000 dollars of my own. And it's actually more because I've gone out to eat (which almost never does, like maybe 1 once a month, maybe), I've bought games, I've upgraded parts on my PC, I've bought online classes, I've bought other random things that I enjoy. And I've still managed to save up a lot of money, I've not fallen behind on any bills, I have no debts. I'm in a position where I can pay for rent and all my bills and my girlfriend doesn't have to chip in, and I still can put money in my savings, and believe me when I say that I am appreciative of my position to be able to do that. It is an expensive purchase, but that hobby of mine is far cheaper than his love of cars, I can tell you that shit for sure.

This has been a long self post. This has been a stressful 85 minutes of typing slowly while I wish I was sleeping. Work that I will be at in two and a half hours, is going to be stressful. all I want is to sleep. All I want is to be able to ignore my dad and not wake up at 4 oclock in the morning every night and think about him talking like that to me in front of the people at work. I don't want to think about how he makes me feel like an over weight piece of shit all the time. I don't want to think about how he doesn't treat me like his son that he's proud to have at the company but just another employee. I don't want to think about how he thinks I don't listen. I don't want to think about how he told my mom that she raised me wrong, which really gets to me because it implies there's something wrong with me. I don't want to think about how he wanted my mom to abort me when she was pregnant and how knowing that effects my entire outlook on how he treated me my entire life. I don't want to think about he's gotten mostly better, but sometimes he still cracks and freaks the fuck out at me (not at work, when I'm at his house or something). I don't want to think about how worthless he makes me feel. I don't want think about how unwanted and unloved I feel. I don't want to think that everything I do has to be seen as acceptable in his eyes. I don't want to think that he didn't want me to be born because my mom and him were different religions(she converted, it was incredibly difficult for her though because so many people treated her like shit). I don't want to think. I just want to sleep. I don't need to contemplate  all this shit, and much much more about my mom and my girlfriend and my relationship with my girlfriend at 4 O'clock in the morning. Or 6:09 in the morning.

69,"I have an online friend whom I've known for 2 years, and they are in a relationship. I have had a crush on this friend for a long time, which for the most part plays in the background and can go unnoticed for the majority of the time. Not usually an issue, until recently. 

This friend has been struggling with their mental health for a while, and seems to especially be struggling over the last few months. It seems it's a combination of low self esteem, and discontent with the level of communication in their relationship. They have been confiding in me, and talking to me about what they are struggling with, which I can relate well to (it turns out we're very similar people and are often saying 'me too!' to almost everything). 

So, it's such a good feeling to be that person for someone, and to be understood in return on a deeper level. This is what's overwhelming me recently, and im feeling more intense feelings toward them which I cant seem to shake it off. I'm thinking about them all the time, even listening to music that reminds me of them. I have other things to be focusing on (school, work, real life stuff), so it's not like I dont have distraction from these feelings.. I just crave telling them how I feel - obviously that's a dick move which I know isnt a good idea as they're in a relationship (and they're in a different country to me so not very realistic overall). I also dont want to stop communicating with them as they're struggling right now, and I dont want to take away our friendship if I'm able to help them feel better/gain clarity with their personal problems. 

So, I'm wondering if anyone can give me some advice on how I can deal with my feelings without doing anything drastic (cut communication/tell them how I feel)? Is there something that can help me process my feelings in a healthy manner that wont impact our friendship? Or do I need to be harsh and take a break for a while?

81,"So I’m not sure where to post it, but since it’s about me, here is an appropriate place I guess. Around 6 years ago I’ve decided to change my life and switch careers. It was a tough decision, but a good one. A right one. I was scared as hell since I was leaving my dad’s place and he always wished that I continue what he does, but I wasn’t interested at all, more so I was constantly miserable working at that place. I took the leap, learned programming, got employed as a junior at some sketchy place first, then moved to a better one, but the thing is... 

Through almost 6 years working in IT I’ve lost my interest in it. I seriously don’t care about programming languages, frameworks, front end, backend, infrastructure, etc. I got to know people that work in the industry and I can’t find anything common with them, I don’t get them. 
But here’s the problem: all my life I wanted to get in, I love computers, I like working with a nice software and hardware, and I like tinkering with it, so maybe I’m just burned out or haven’t found my place yet? But after loosing my interest in this field I just can’t bring myself to look for a new job or learn a new toolset, even though I try to get back on track. I don’t have any friends with common interest and I dislike people from the industry that I know through the work, so I don’t really know to whom I can talk to about it. Because of that, recently I grew extremely anxious and socially awkward. 

For about a year or two now I’ve started to think about getting into truck driving. When I used to be a kid I’ve played a ton of games about hard trucks and enjoyed it, but then just kinda forgot about it while growing up. My dad used to own a few trucks, he haven’t driven himself, he was more of a business owner, but he’ve taken me a few times to some truck stops where I’ve had a chance to sit in a truck and pretend that I’m driving. And since he has some experience in this field I’ve decided to ask what he was thinking about this job and he said I was out of my mind. And I get it, we are not US or EU. Here in RU it’s considered a low paying, hard as fuck job, where plenty of asocial persons or ex-convicts work, where hours of service regulations are overlooked and cops try to bribe you at every chance. My girlfriend thinks the same. We build our relationship where I’m a perspective IT guy, not a truck driver that visits home a few days a month. Meanwhile I can’t stop watching videos about it, learning about life on the road and considering trying it.

So it all tears me apart, and I feel paralyzed. Sorry for any grammar errors.",02Nov2020,1
82,"This virus is completely putting my life on hd. Before all of this started happening, I was in a stable job, excelling in college, and learning to drive. I had my theory test booked for April, and my instructor had faith that I'd be ready to take my practical test as soon as I passed my theory.

Then came lockdown. I was put on furlough, college was closed down, and my test was cancelled. I was at home with nothing to do, getting extremely lonely, but I managed. As we started coming to the end of lockdown, my employer contacted me, to say that they needed to cut costs, and that I would be made redundant without pay. 

I went back to college with very little money, paying for bus tickets and food and things like that. I managed to rebook my theory test and pass ot first time. I then spent about a month trying to book my practical tests, stuck in queues of over 100,000 people, with the website closing down before I reached the booking stage. 

Eventually I booked my test, the earliest available slot being in November (which was about 3 months away). I kept waiting, spending obscene amounts of money on driving lessons to keep fresh. I also applied for a new job, and had a trial there. 

The job trial went well, and I was given a starting date. Then came the second lockdown. I was less than a week away from starting my new job, and less than 2 weeks from my driving test. The test has now been cancelled, and the place I was supposed to work at closed down. So now im back to no income, and facing another extremely long wait for my test, all because some selfish assholes refuse to follow all the government guidelines",02Nov2020,1
84,"TLTR: I am 22 years old and get migraines. I am writing this to share my experience dealing with this. and what it feels like.

How it started

I remember exactly were I was when I got my first migraine. I was 13 years old and a freshman in Highschool. I was sitting in my English class. I usually would seat near the back. The teacher was writing notes on the board and we were copying along. I remember at some point I look down at my paper then look back up and notice that the middle of the word on the board is missing. It was extremely strange. I keep trying to read the board and take notes but every word I look at is distorted. I couldn't really read the middle of the word something like this ""Som\*\*\*\*ng"". A little bit of time goes by and this get worse, my vision is now really hindered and I get scared and ask to go to the nurse. I need a class mate to help me walk there because I couldn't really see. The nurse asks me if I have hit my head or something which I didn't. She calls my mom to pick me up. In the mean time while my mom is heading to pick me up my head starts hurting extremely bad to the point were I start to basically projectile vomit into the toilet. It was horrible and very scary.

Fast forward almost 10 years and I still get migraines occasionally. It is very random and I have not been able to discern a trigger for them. I also very rarely have such intense ones were I start throwing up. I have gotten very nauseous but I cant remember the last time I threw up from one. I have gone a few months without getting one and sometimes I can have like 2 in one week. It happens randomly at random  times of the day. At first I thought it would occur if I haven't eaten for a while. Like if I didn't really eat the whole day and have a small meal, then proceed to not really eat good the next day because I'm busy or something and would get one. But that doesn't seem to be it. I also thought at some point that it was stress induced. But that as well doesn't seem correct as I get them completely randomly. At times when I am extremely relaxed, at work, during the day or night. even while I'm sleeping it doesn't matter. As I am writing this I woke up in the middle of the morning with a migraine in full swing. This shit sucks ass.

The symptoms

The only good thing about this is that there is a sequence of events that always happens, and I mean always! Every single time I have gotten a migraine it is the exact same process. like textbook these symptoms will occur in sequence so I always know when I'm getting a migraine and can try to act fast to take some medicine to at least reduce the pain or something. 

First my vision gets distorted. It starts small at first. Its like a little blurriness in the middle of your vision super small but noticeable. it slowly gets bigger and bigger till I'm basically half blind. The best way I can explain it is you know how if someone takes a picture of you with a bright flash and the light kinda sticks to your eye for a while. Like the flash is burned into your eye and you can see it where ever you look. Its kinda like that. This effect will last for a while 30-40 mins. and then it will go away gradually. Once my vision is cleared the pain begins. The pain is always mostly located in one of my eyes. Either the right or left I think its random Although I have a theory. The pain starts slightly and gradually grows to immense levels. My eye and its concurrent top half of my head will hurt like a bitch. I cant stress enough how much it hurts. The best way I can try to explain it is it feels as if someone reached into my skull and was squeezing the fuck out of my eye like a grape!!!!. Or if you are a male and have ever gotten kicked in the nuts really hard or something, imagine the testicle is my eye. That's how it feels. This pain will last a few hours anywhere from 3-5 on average. I think each migraine rotates the affected eye. Like one time ill have it in my left eye and the next it will be my right and so on but I am not completely sure. 

As of right now after all the research I have done I have not found anything to really help/stop migraines. The only thing that sort of works is some Exedrin migraine medication. Its basically a pill containing  **acetaminophen, aspirin** and **caffeine.** When I first notice the eye blurriness at the beginning of the process I try to take it to at least alleviate the pain that is coming. This does not stop the pain at all but I think it lightly reduces it. Either way once I see that blurriness I know I'm in for an ass swooping of epic proportions!!! I mean I'm clapped as fuck!!!! I have to lay in bed and just deal with it. It sounds weird but sometimes I like to take my pillow to the bathroom and lay on the floor with the lights off. The complete darkness helps as light bothers the fuck out of me when I'm in the thick of it. 

After a few hours the pain will gradually go away until it is completely gone but the migraine is not gone. The reason I say this is because some effects last around 24 hours. For example even after the migraine subsides and I no longer feel pain, If I make a sudden movement with my head like turning it to the side real fast or bending over to pick something up some pain will occur. Almost like my head and eye is really  sensitive. Honestly it ruins my whole day. I am out of it the rest of the day and just feel groggy and shitty. 

Its hard dealing with this because it feels like no one understands. Even when I tell my friends and family about it they look at me weird like I'm being a little bitch or something but they just don' get it. I don't think anyone will understand unless they feel it for themselves. Sometimes it can be a real hinderance. There have been times when my friends are throwing a party or we are supposed to do something and I have to bail because of a migraine and I cant be around people or loud noise or lights. 

I should mention that I pretty healthy for the most part. I only drink water and occasionally alcohol, normal college student shit. And my eating habits are not too bad either. I am not overweight and I seem perfectly healthy for the most part

I hope this can teach someone about migraines or help comfort people that are on the same boat as me. You are not alone! Even if your specific migraines are different (and they probably are since everyone feels symptoms differently), just now that you are not alone. All you can do is sit through it and deal with it and come out the other side you know. 

Also if anyone has any advise on dealing with this I am all ears. comment any medication or treatments or any thing really!

Thanks for reading if you did and have a great MIGRAINE FREE day! lmao",02Nov2020,1
85,"I want to die. But if i die i know im going to hell. I hate myself. The pain just never seems to stop, even after death. I wish i was never born.

87," You don't need it to live. You can't eat it, you can't use it to build anything, all you can do is trade it in the Hope's that the other person finds value in it. 

And if a situation comes up where the economy collapses and money no longer has any value ( which it doesn't already) then no one will take it and you won't be able to attain any real essentials. 

On the other hand if you spend your time trying to live without it, help the poor, and share whatever wealth you have with other people, then you will no longer have to worry about where your next meal comes from. God himself will feed you!",02Nov2020,1
88,My gf and I just adopted her this week from shelter. She was 3 months old and she was so adorable. Then suddenly she got sick. We went clinic yesterday.

89," About 10 years ago I was rushing to catch a ferry (boat) and I missed  it, I was waiting for the next one and had time to kill. It was a cold  February evening and getting to be kind of dark, I felt compelled to  drive down a particular road I had never been to and ended up at a  public park. It was absolutely deserted, and I got out of my car and  decided to walk down to the beach area. When I walked through the park I  noticed a pile of clothing and shoes piled up on a picnic table near  the beach, which was absolutely strange for a Canadian February. I saw a  man wading out into the water, and I felt my heart sink. Having  struggled with depression myself, I knew what this man was doing. I  called out to him but he ignored me and just kept looking out into the  water, he was in up to his chest and shaking. I called the police, there  was nothing else I could have done at that point. I kept trying to call  out to him and ask him to come out of the water, he clearly didn't want  an audience and exited the water and walked away from me, I followed  him at a great distance and he tried to circle back to the cliffs  overlooking the water and the police reached us just in time. They took  him away in an ambulance, and the police later contacted me and told me  he was trying to kill himself and he had been in the water so long that  hypothermia was setting in, if I hadn't found him he might have actually  died. I still think about how if I hadn't missed that boat, and then felt that strong compelling feeling to go to that place, that man could  have died. It felt like divine intervention.",02Nov2020,1

95,"Ok so yesterday I was supposed to go do groceries with my mother; or at least, that's what she thought. I didnt want to go, I had been at work all day and I just wanted to go for a run, take a shower and go to bed.

For some reason though, as we were discussing what we needed to buy, there was a miscommunication and she thought I wanted to go with her.

I didnt know this.

She knew I was about to go for a run, so I guess her plan was to let me go for a run before we did groceries, but theres no way I'm coming home sweaty and dizzy only to leave again for groceries, an activity that can be done by one person. 

So I went for my run, and since it was snowing, I felt the smart thing to do was to stay off the road and use forest trails; so that's what I did. I ran for 40 minutes in the woods, then took my time coming back because I was listening to an album I wanted to finish before I got home.

That's when my mom called me asking if I was almost home. I guess I misunderstood her concern, because usually I only run 5k which takes like 25 minutes, so I shouldve been home by then; however, these days I've been doing 8k and so i took around 40 minutes. I figured she was just scared that I got injured or something because again, it was the first snowfall of the year.

So I assured her I was ok, and kept taking my time coming home, not realizing that she was calling because she wanted to leave to do groceries soon.

So I get home tired and sweaty and head straight to the bathroom to take a shower. As I'm washing my face, and waiting for the water to warm up, I can clearly hear her and my step dad talking, one of the things I remember her saying specifically was ""I dont know- how do I address it?"". She then immediately knocked on the bathroom door so I figured they were talking about me. She asked me if I was ready to go to the store, I said I was gonna take a shower and that she could go without me (which I expected her to do anyway) and she responded with a disappointed ""oh... ok... if I knew that I would've left a long time ago"". 

Of course at this point I felt bad so I apologized and she assured me it was ok, but since then I feel like shes still upset with me; but I dont know why.

Theres two ways I've interpreted the situation.

1. She was looking forward to doing something together and was ultimately disappointed when I seemed to not want to go. This is unlikely as I've spent a lot fo time with her recently.

2. She thinks I didnt want to go because I was on drugs, and thus assumes that whenever I go for a run that means I'm going to the woods to do drugs. This would explain the ""I dont know-how do I address it?"" and her current behaviour toward me (this morning all shes talked about is how I need to save up more money, get a better job, move out and go back to school or she will continue to raise my rent. I'm 18 and currently taking a semester off to figure out what program I want to go into.)

I know if I mention it to her I'll come off as paranoid or neurotic, which is just another reason for her to assume I'm taking drugs. 

So how do you interpret the situation? Am I overreacting? Am I in the wrong? I've thought about this so much it barely makes sense to me anymore, I spent almost the entire night awake thinking about it but I cant tell if it's a severe enough situation for me to bring it up. What should I do?

Full disclosure, I smoke weed regularly, but not that much, the equivalent to drinking a beer after work (my lungs are really sensitive so even if i wanted to smoke more i wouldnt be able to get it down without vomitting)",02Nov2020,1
96,I was in bed thinking about all the bad decisions I’ve made in my life up until now because of which I couldn’t achieve anything worthwhile in my life and I just slapped myself really really hard 5-7 times. It felt kinda good . It hurt me a little physically but didn’t affect me at all emotionally. But if someone else were to slap me even with half the force I would cry for days out of emotional pain and embarrassment. This made me wonder why does it hurt so much more when someone else physically harms us . And so much less when we do it to ourselves even with twice the force . Why don’t our brains react the same when we self harm as the way it reacts when someone else harms us.,02Nov2020,1

99,"So the neighbours cat sometimes visits me at my window. He's a cute little gray-black tabby with fine short fur. He's usually quite friendly and eager to be petted when he comes to my window. But last night he came to my window and ran away when I came along like he was scared of me. Something else also looked odd about him. He looked more scruffy than he usually does. I know it's him because it's impossible for any other cat to get to my window being as high up as it is and only connected to my neighbours window.

I had suspicious paranoia that maybe they were harming the poor cat being as scruffy and fearful as he was. But then I might be worrying too much. Hope he's alright.",02Nov2020,1
100,"hey everyone, i just wanted to ask how  i can get through to my mom that i am in fact almost an adult and shouldnt be babied.  my mom seems to be adamant about a 9:45  limit for electronics, but i think its silly:

1. as said above, i am almost an adult, i have  been employed, i get good grades, i dont do drugs or drink alcohol. 
2. many of my friends are on discord chatting till much later, and i feel like i am missing out a lot by not being present.  we have alot of fun. 

3. at this point in my teenage years they should  loosen the reigns a bit and not really care about what time i go to bed at (within reason, lets say 11:30.

its just really frustrating and i feel like i should be able to exercise good judgement and not have to bow to such a weird rule at 16.  i get that i am still technically a kid, but its frustrating and stops me from talking to my friends.

now my mom´s side is that i need to chill without electronics before bed and that  the screen colors effect how soon you are able to get to sleep. this is bullshit because phones and laptops now have a buit in setting that doesn't emit light harmful to   sleep cycle´s.

101,I'm not American so can't vote in the election. I really want Biden to win but I placed a bet on Trump winning. This might sound odd but hear me out. The odds are thankfully quite low for me winning. I placed the bet because I'm super unlucky when gambling and I'm hoping somehow me placing a bet on Trump means that I won't win and Biden will become president and the world will be slightly better? I basically want to do something practical and I obviously can't vote so I feel like me placing a bet when I'm really unlucky is my own way of trying to change the path of the universe.

103,"Aside from medications or health problems that would lead to weight gain of course.....

What’s your opinion of this? I always find it cringey when I see a couple on their wedding day...supposedly the highlight or best day of their lives, and they both look like fat slobs. Not even trying to be mean 🥶 I know it sounds harsh, but I just feel like....really? I mean especially two obese people. It just seems like they skipped the part where they’re suppose to take care of their health and appearance first. Not just for their partner, but more importantly for themself. How do they just give up on their health and appearance...and then parade around all happy on their special day? Because the majority of the time, you’re not going to look as good as you did on your wedding day after that. It’s usually all down hill from there...so if one cannot even muster up them motivation and energy to get in decent shape and health for their wedding day...? Then wtf man? When I see two obese people getting married...I can’t help but to feel like...damn...these people really just don’t give a fuck do they? Like..they are totally okay and accepting of the fact that they are both lazy, whales, who most likely have no plans to change or better themselves....yes I know, I know , I sound extreme lol but isn’t it kind of true?? If a persons wedding is usually one of the most important days in a persons life, and they show up at the alter a whopping 50-100lb more than they should be...don’t you think that’s a major red flag? It shows a few obvious things about this person...like the fact they don’t respect or honor the body they’ve been blessed with, and that they’re not motivated....so unmotivated that they couldn’t even put in some hard exercise and dieting to look somewhat fuckable on their big day. Or how about that they don’t respect or care enough about their partner to show up and look good for them and their visitors on a day that will be remembered forever, while being heavily photographed. Listen, I love the fact that they’re obviously showing acceptance, because that is a good thing. But I can’t help but to feel like their both accepting all negative things. Accepting laziness, lack of self control, complacency, future health problems, etc. I know a lot of people hold such heavy value in getting married to feel that acceptance and the feeling of being loved...but I personally think they are skipping a few steps in life and are searching for love that they are missing in themselves. I think if you genuinely love and care for yourself, you put your body and your health first. You honor the amazing gift you’ve been given and choose decent foods for your body. You exercise not just to feel good, but keep off extra body fat so that you don’t create imbalances and potential health problems. I just don’t see how a relationship between two fat/obese people can’t be toxic, if they are not working towards becoming healthy and better themselves, therefore bettering each other.

110,"I really need a place to vent about this friend where I know she won't find out. Advice is ok, but not necessary.

I have a friend ""Jane"" that I've known since I was in high school (about ten years ago), and we've kept in contact pretty consistently since then. We were close but never really hung out a lot in person due to differing schedules: it didn't help that Jane and I had long stretches of time where we weren't in the same state or were too busy to talk. We were both appreciative of each other's presence in our lives, though, as we were both eccentric outcasts who were extremely nerdy.

Jane had lived a troubled life: her parents were abusive; she was severely bullied; her many mental illnesses negatively impacted her quality of life (she is bipolar, autistic, and ADHD); she didn't have many friends because of her mental illnesses that made her a prime target for bullies; her sister got cancer; and she had suffered long-time abuse from a boyfriend. Thankfully, she has overcome most of the trauma she faced (she moved out of her parents' house; she got a therapist to cope with the bulling and the mental illnesses she has; she is properly medicated; she is pursuing her passion in music and art; her current boyfriend is nurturing and supportive; and finally, her sister beat cancer and is currently in better health). 

However, the problem is this: Jane keeps bringing up her past trauma in graphic and intense detail during conversations where it's only tangentially related. I understand that this past trauma defined her and shaped her. I am deeply and intensely sympathetic, and I don't think anyone should have gone through what Jane did. She is now living a happier, more stable life that she so desperately longed for as vulnerable teen. My problem with Jane isn't that she's trusted me to vent, or that she's proud of what she's overcame, because I love that Jane has found enough peace to talk about her trauma more openly. I have a problem with how often, openly, and graphically she brings up her trauma. I don't know how to enforce boundaries with her and I feel like I can't stop Jane from talking about her trauma because, despite my discomfort and unhappiness, venting makes her happy.

but yeah, she is probably still adorable and i didn't and do not have a shot in hell. have a good night.",02Nov2020,1
130,"I try to keep busy with hobbies, but when I let myself relax, I have this sinking feeling that I’ll never actually be happy. 

I’m not sure why I feel this way. 

I have a good, well paying job. I find it very boring and purposeless, and it’s hard to stay motivated to be productive a lot of the time, but I’m glad to have a fairly stable job in light of this years events. I’ve been very lucky in that way. 

I have a relationship that’s really good. I do struggle with shame and feeling like I’m not good enough at points, but he’s reassuring and reliable and we are able to talk through it. 

I also have hobbies that I enjoy. 

But regardless of all this, my default mode is to feel very very hopeless &amp; empty. 

A few things about me - I’m 28, very introverted, ADHD, and pretty sure I have CPTSD from consistent emotional abuse as a kid (based on what past therapists have said).  I also don’t have a stable family. Everyone has split off and we havent had a family unit for almost 10 years now. I think some of my feelings comes from feeling very lonely, even when I’m with people. It often feels like there’s a glass wall between me and everyone else.  

Sometimes I think about quitting my job because that does contribute to my unhappiness, but I also feel that this won’t fix anything. I also worry that I wouldn’t be able to “pull it together” enough to find employment again. 

I also think world events have worsened things for sure. Things feel unstable, even as someone in a very lucky position like me. 

But ultimately, this all feels like a problem with me and how I see things. I’m in therapy again and sometimes I think it helps, but I also am struggling to see how things can get better. 


I worry because if it weren’t for my bf, my few friends, and my job stability, I really don’t know where I would be mentally rn. Even in my current mood, I have entertained the idea of ending things but ultimately I don’t won’t to give up just yet and I am also scared to do that.  I would also never want to put family and my bf through that. But if this nagging feeling we’re to get much worse or if circumstances got much worse, I’m not sure what I would do. 

I’m sorry, I know this was dark. I’m just struggling and don’t know what to do about it.",02Nov2020,1

132,"TL:DR; did 325 mg of DXM, read a poem, was awesome. Miss that feeling over a year and a half later.

I don't ""do drugs,"" I don't even drink alcohol. However, the summer before last I was feeling terribly apathetic. I had just started my first ""real"" job in the form of a corporate summer internship, and I was facing that existence for the next 40+ years. This fact depressed the hell out of me, I don't think I have ever been so numb.

Not even a month into this internship (which was pretty cushy in hindsight), an idea formed- I'd ""trip"" on DXM. I completely forget where I got this idea, but I remember thinking about it on a Wednesday and two days later I tripped. Because I like to think ahead, I decided I would buy it on Thursday, which I tried but the Walgreens cashier denied me since I wasn't 21... a day later I was at CVS and, despite this cashier eyeing me, I got the goods.

I won't go into specifics of the trip itself, other than I had no idea DXM lasts so long in the body (which resulted in me staying up late into the morning). However, one thing that I did find lasted after the trip was how great music sounded. I could hear all of the instruments, separately. This lasted like a week after the dose. It was awesome. I know the ""afterglow"" isn't supposed to last that long, but I was just at peace for this time. I easily beat back intrusive thoughts, and I was laid-back.

But the greatest, most memorable part of the one time I ""did drugs"" took place 4 days after I tripped. My parents were having a party so I decided to go on a walk to the library and listen to music or surf Reddit. I went up to the quiet floor and sat at one of the solo desks in the corner, but I decided to check out some of the books in a nearby stack, and I saw a book of haikus.

This book of haikus wasn't your standard ""haiku"" book, the entire point of it was to show that haikus don't have to follow the classic form of a haiku to be haikus. The first poem, where the author tried to illustrate his point, was a 2 line poem. The first line described a black crow, which might not sound like much but I could easily envision that crow. It had life, it was flying. I wasn't hallucinating, I could just imagine it very clearly. This line was pretty good to the after-glow-version of me. But the next line threw me for a loop- this line described two mountains, where the crow flew between. I could see these massive, snowy, mountains that were littered with bare trees. The scale between the huge mountains and tiny crow was awe-inspiring. I had never been so moved by a poem before.

Anyway, I rented the book and showed it to my friend, but they just weren't impressed, but I was reminded of the poem today. My science professor was trying to explain the beautiful intricacies of math, and compared it to how a poem might not seem like much, but that's only because you don't know what to look for- even a 2 line poem can convey meaning through structure and composition. The only other time where I could ""envision"" landscapes and whatnot in my mind so clearly as I did that day was a few months later when college had started back up, and that time coffee was to blame (something I also don't drink that often).

Remembering back to it, it makes me sad. I've always sort of struggled visualizing fiction in my head. I don't really intend on doing DXM again for other reasons, but that afterglow was something special. I felt motivated, and what's more, I finished that internship. I want to be a fiction writer some day, and it's hard for me to visualize things well. Hate to see it. I have considered trying mushrooms for this reason.",02Nov2020,1
133,I’m about to confirm a coffee date with a girl I’ve been texting for a week. We met at a party when we were both drunk so I feel like we’re meeting for the 1st time again. We both describe ourselves as shy so we agreed to get coffee as something low pressure. I was wondering if someone could give me some do’s and dont’s to leave a good impression (:,02Nov2020,1
134,"I know they're just insignificant mice. But they were with me through all my phases of being a teenager and they meant so much to me. 

They're at my dad's so he takes care of them half the time. He called me to tell me that Cami had died, nothing more. I was shocked but I had been ready for this because they are old. I constantly had anxiety whether they would be alive or not whenever I would go see them.

I imagined that she had died peacefully of old age, but my dad told me the truth. She was brutally torn up and ripped up in pieces. That's when I really broke apart. 

It seems that Fizz, who had grown up with her for 4 years, killed Cami. They were inseparable and I'd watch them cuddle and sleep together all the time. I can't get this imagination of Cami being a bloody mess out of my head. And I don't want to see Fizz anymore. 

I looked at pictures and videos of them from the past. I just can't bear to look at them anymore. Putting memories of them with what had happened today puts me through indescribable pain. I can't stop crying and I want to go up to the cage and see them peacefully sleeping together.  

Tears just wont stop coming down my face. I just want to see them nibbling on snacks. It's just so daunting to me that my little fuzzy best friend ended up in a bloody mess. 

I can't handle this, I've just been out of it the entire day and I feel so cloudy. I could have handled it 200x better if she had died naturally, but it ended up being so gruesome. I don't even know what I'm feeling right now. Just so empty.",02Nov2020,1

Name

Set-Up: Two guys and one girl want to go to a house recently on the news that for the owners leaving all of sudden. Rumors are that it’s haunted. The three are in a car heading towards the house.

Characters :

Chase - Jason

Cameron - Baxter

Julie - Rey

Fade In:

In-Car - Day

The camera is moved around in the car as Jason picks it up. He cleans the camera screen. Jason points the camera out in the wilderness.

Fades Out:

Fades In:

In-car - Night

The camera is on the dash pointing inwards towards the backseat. Baxter is driving while Rey is in the backseat with her phone. Jason is staring out the window.

**Jason**

Hey, do you actually believe the stories?

Baxter is not paying attention to him but Rey speaks up.

**Rey**

I don’t know

They all wait in the car. When all of a sudden Baxter hits the breaks making a squealing sound and everyone in the car moves forward with the sudden change of speed. The camera falls on Jason’s lap. Jason picks up the camera and puts it on the dash again.

\***SCREECH\***

**Jason**

What was that for man? You could have broken the camera!

**Rey**

Yeah seriously

**Baxter**

There was something in the middle of the road what am I suppose to do?

**Jason**

What do you mean? There was nothing there?

**Baxter**

There was something in the middle of the road I swear

**Rey**

Calm down were almost there

Not even a few moments later the group pulls up to the house, it’s pitch black but the lights on the outside frame. Baxter pulls into the driveway and stops the car.

**Rey**

So what is the story of this place?

**Baxter**

A week ago some news came out that the family living there were seeing unexplainable things. Like objects moving around, doors closing, lights going out, footsteps. There was one encounter with what the Mom explaining was a figure in the very back room when the lights were off.

**Jason**

You could of just say ghost in the house and we want to find evidence of it.

**Rey**

Even simpler “Ghost”

**Jason**

Let’s get this started then

Baxter grabs the camera and gets out of the car. As the others get out (out of frame) heading towards the back. They all meet at the back of the car and start gathering their equipment for this exploration. Baxter looks up at the massive garage and starts walking towards the gate on the side.",02Nov2020,1
137,"I haven't been able to wrap my head around my loss and I can’t really talk to my three babies about it. I posted on a different sub and was told I was the one in the wrong because why would my dad keep a “bunch of my shit” for years?? Weeks of waiting for him to come to his senses turned into years. I NEVER thought he would let her throw away something so valuable. Jokes on me though, right?  I can’t take a hot shower and cry about it. I can't call the police about it even though I wish I could. How would one even go about calling the police? “Hey my dad's new wife ransacked my clothing and makeup with her daughters, took what they wanted and threw away the rest.”

Then sometime between 2011 and 2020 she took it upon herself to throw away my memory box that I got when I was 10 years old filled with every birthday card, movie ticket, ribbons/awards, vacation penny &amp; postcards, photo albums, my unicorn scrapbook, newspaper clippings of the accidents freshman year that resulted in my friends dying, yearbooks, even the silly valentine cards I got in grade school that had a extra heart on it from a secret admirer.  My homecoming/prom dresses, my dance competition videos, and maybe most important, my great grandmother's diamond ring.

 The ring was so special in so many ways. All the females in the family all had long thin fingers. The rings that fit them barely fit on my pinky finger. When she showed me her ring it was, and still is the most beautiful ring i've ever seen. She had me put it on one day while we were sitting at our family garage sale and it slipped right on, it was magical. I know that's nerdy but it was the first time something finally fit me. Almost like it was made for me. I wore it all day and got compliments on it by everyone I saw. That had never ever happened to me, EVER. 

The last three months of her life I had just graduated highschool and I stayed with her up until she passed. The ring somehow bonded us in a way I can't explain. She told me about the engagement, about how it was only a small stone at first but then my great grandpa sold a large chunk of land to the city and upgraded it for her. It was just so special and she would always get tears in her eyes talking about him.

 I would say we can stop talking about it, I didn't want her to get upset. But she said they were happy tears, she was crying because she knew she was going “home” to him, finally. I was blessed to be able to be with her. I know I'll always have the memories and that has to be enough.",02Nov2020,1
138,"I've been thinking about this for a while but in my head, I have this idea of who I am or at least who I could be (it's not even grandeur or unrealistic. Perhaps it's a positive version of myself that I could be somewhat effortlessly?) for example, I know I am more sociable than i appear, I know I am more talkative and that within the cold interior of my introverted heart - I really do love being with people. And yet, something as silly and temporary as emotions takes away the joy that could benefit me a life time. I sabotage and isolate myself only further instigating the cycle. I end up feeling like no one really cares for me and then anger starts to boil when I realise that in the end, this dosen't fucking matter and my stupid problems are NOTHING compared to the heartache other people endure. All I'm doing is wasting my time, crying alone in my room while my loved ones remain unaware I even feel like this and yet, it hurts so, so, so bad and I'm so sick of crying. Then again, I lock myself in my room, ruminating about my past; trying to find a way to end it all. I don't know any more, nothing makes sense. Obviously, self diagnosis won't get me anymore but I also suspect bipolar disorder is at play here. I cringe every time I speak to other people about it. I never mean to appear self-pitying or have them think that I don't appreciate all that I have because, I do and it's just makes it even more depressing.

That's why this post exists, I guess, so I can vent a little bit...
