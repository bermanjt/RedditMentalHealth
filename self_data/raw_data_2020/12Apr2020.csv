Summarised backstory that lead up to this




So I went through a short lived fling that I hoped would be a relationship last year. Person X and I were friends for a year and a half now, and were getting along quite well. We ended up seeing each other regularly and talking to each other almost on a daily basis. I eventually started to feel feelings, and wanted to announce. My brain told me that this won't work out, we are polar opposites, have differing life philosophies, don't understand (mainly me) each other on a deep emotional level (they are trans, I'm not). There is one other person, person y (also trans), around that they get along with quite well, and chat to regularly.  My brain told me that it made no logical sense for me and person x for a relationship and it wouldn't work out. Person X and y on the other hand, both were going through same emotional feelings, similar life philosophies and similar personalities, so it made perfect sense for them to hook up and work.

Nonetheless, I went for it. Person X told me that they too have feelings for me. It was going great, but this great time was short lived (2 months). Quite soon, lots of drama happened (unsurprisingly this drama related person y.) Short story short, person y and person x were closer and was quite evident they were loving each other, spend more time with each other, person X ghosted and lied to me a few times but still tried to pretend it was all good. I think you get the story.

So, in conclusion, I had it coming. I knew it wouldn't work out. It made obvious sense for person X and person y to work, but not for me and person x. Now i've had been feeling more down and going through emotional drama for half a year as I can't seem to get over it.

So my question, should I base potential future relationships on the question, ""do we logically fit?"" Or go with the flow, and follow my hear over my brain?",12Apr2020,2
8,"Every time I see the news and read the medical journals, it becomes more and more apparent that it'll take well until July at the very least to find a vaccine to the virus. And that is also a best case scenario. Even if a cure or a vaccine is found, it'll take months to ship it to everyone. I think it will take till November or December for the world to finally revert back to normal operation, but considering how the virus is spreading, the number of people unable to support themselves, a crashing economy, and the growing dissent on governments supporting the upper classes, I feel like there will be a lot of chaos and suffering before this all ends. I sincerely hope people see all the reasons the world isn't working right, and work to fix them after this ends. The world is not fair to everyone, but here's a chance to rebuild to an extent. I hope the power monopolies in every industry break, and that we finally have some power in making it fair for everyone. Because this pandemic will definitely bring out the worst of humanity.

11,"This is based on a series of conversations with roommates and friends and my late husband. 

I would not call myself amoral by any stretch but my moral compass is my own. I was raised to keep my own moral compass and as a general rule, the law is the law but doesn’t mark morality. Good men don’t need it and bad men won’t follow it. 

Or as my friend recently put it, “If a cop told me you murdered someone, I’d believe them but you probably had good reason and shouldn’t be punished.”

Or we were watching a show about a scam artist using his skills for good and I liked him and the response was, “That’s because he’s you. You have evil skills but you use them to make a better world.”

I am the first to admit my morals are.. askew. Steal a loaf of bread when you are starving and there is no sin. Hit your abuser and run? Good for you. 

I was raised to distrust authority (literally told since I was a toddler that power corrupts and to never trust anyone with power over me). My morals reflect that but also social good for all is a powerful motivator for me and a general end goal. 

Can you be evil for good?",12Apr2020,1
13,"90% of my interactions with people (only family right know because covid) are just comedy related and trying to get them to laugh to make myself feel better. All I ever get in return is the same, I feel like I'm not even taken seriously anymore. I can't stop, I'm so damn awkward I can't think of anything else. The same goes for my friends at school. It's all comedy. I don't even have anything to relate to them anymore, since I don't have any social medias other than Reddit and Twitter, and I'm barely ever active on those. I don't have any of the ""popular"" gaming consoles like a ps4 or Xbox, and all my friends do. All they talk about is doing things with each other the previous night. I've buried my own grave, because everyone else other than these friends judges me by looks and makes fun of me. I'd be a lonely sap without them, and I think they know that. They pity me. It's sweet, but they only are friends with me because I have nowhere else to go. I'm the lowest of the low.

14,"So i got this new job and had a two day training i just finished.

Its a pretty basic job, alot of young people mostly. 

Anyways there is this one kind of cute girl there the rest are dudes. First day of training was pretty normal everyone was quiet and so was I. The second day i am sitting in front of the girl, and everytime I moved she would cough in a weird way. Like kind of sexual in a way. Every time i moved, to the point where the trainers were looking at me dead in the eyes. Im a pretty attractive guy, definitely the most attractive there. Not trying to sound like a dick, and I really dont care about looks, im just trying to get my life back on track lol.

After a few hours of her sexually coughing everytime i did something the trainer (pretty chill guy) said r u okay? To the girl, shes like yea i just have asthma. Everytime she talked to somebody she would kind of go above and beyond in a friendly way, people were just being chill and she was trying to sell herself in a way that was a bit overboard, but whatever i can be a lil weird too so i dont judge. I didnt respond to her at all i just acted normal.

But what was weird is when we got back from lunch, she immidiately brought up her kid and then when i moved or did anything that she would usually respond to for the past 4 hours she didnt cough at all, not once the entire 4 hours after lunch.

I thought maybe i am looking too much into it, but when i first got to training she kept looking at me and no one else, then when i said something in the training she spoke up and kinda tried to start an argument and i wasnt even talking to her.


It was pretty subtle stuff tbh but I never really encountered anything like this. 

What do u guys think, im obviously looking too much into it, but what could have she seen in me to try and mess with me. I was minding my
Business the whole time. I felt like she was trying to manipulate me for no reason at all. Shes like 22 and has a kid btw.",12Apr2020,3
17,"I was friends with a person for 3 years. It was great. He was funny, sweet, genuine and very understanding. Never used to judge me. I could be myself in front of him. It was nice. Past year we both got very busy, academically.  Always tensed, a lot of work and all. We started fighting a lot. Like everytime we were on call or met. He stopped giving shit about me. I thought it was just a phase since we both are going through a rough time. Okay, it'll pass. Chill. But it just kept continuing and it got worse. I was always with him. I was the one who use to apologise for ""his mistakes"" cuz i always had this in me that never ruin a relationship because of ego. He always made me feel bad and low about myself. And worst thing was that he was very manipulative . He always played as if he was the victim and i used to feel so guilty about it. I know you guys must be thinking i am dumbass but it's hard to just get rid of a friendship that you had for such long time where you geuinely don't want to lose the person. So you keep ignoring the red flags. And that's why i excatly did. For months and months. We talked when he wanted to talk. He was only nice and attentive with me when he wanted some help. In last few months he even started talking so rudely to me that it just got unbearbale. He acted like he was doing a favour for me by being my friend. 

Yesterday he called me after a week. We were talking about something and i asked him something and he didn't responded.  I call out his name. He said ""oh yea what? I was talking to someone on text right now. Didn't listen."" I responded by saying ""when do you ever listen anyways"". And he just went on saying that he is the only friend i have (ahem bold of him to assume) and that i better be nice to him. And if he ignores me then I actually deserves it. So at this point I've had enough. I just cut him mid-sentence.  And said ""you know what? Go an fuck yourself. I've had enough of your bullshit. You are a fucking asshole who doesn't know the meaning of a friendship. You act all worth and important but the truth is you are a selfish, coward bitch who uses friendship to get his work done. I did a mistake wasting my time on this shallow friendship ans I'll make sure in future i don't make any toxic ""friends"" like i had you for years. Bye. For good"". And i cut the call.

This happened last night. Was I scared of doing this? Yes.  Do i regret it? No. I am happy. Really. I did it guys! After months of being in such a shitty friendship where it affected me aswell as my mental health. I finally got him out of my life. Will i miss him? Idk maybe. But it was for the best. Leaving a friendship is hard. I get it. You always want to work things out.  But when you realise you've tried enough and you don't get anything back in return then it's just pointless.",12Apr2020,9

24,"And that’s kind of crazy for me to think about. So much has happened over the past year, from going to camp over the summer and finding my passion for filmmaking, to losing all social media privileges (I totally don’t have Reddit, what are you talking about???) and being told to go to church because I made a film my folks didn’t agree with, to finding out my crush was going out with someone else on the day I was going to ask him out, to finishing my last marching band season, to coming so close to finishing high school only for this virus to kick us all in the ass (RIP class of 2020). It’s been such a roller coaster of a year, and not all of it was amazing, but I’d say it’s been pretty good. I got accepted to college with honors, and with luck I’ll be living on my own for the first time in the fall, studying filmmaking and advertising! I can’t wait. :)

Everyone has one, and they happen every day. It’s special for everyone, and she it’s your turn, it’s extra special. I see it as a day for the individual to pause and reflect on what the heck just happened in the past year, and to see if they want to make changes going forward, and I think that’s pretty cool. It’s different for everyone, and we all have different stories, and it’s fun to read through most of them (except those darn karma farmers)!

Man I know It’s not my business anymore and she has the right to do whatever with whomever whenever. But my first reaction was to get competitive and think “I will bury that motherfucker. I will beat him at everything he does and I will become someone he will always be inferior to” verbatim this was my thought. I love this pet of my personality. It gives me drive and motivation to pull off things no one else can.

My competitive edge comes from the fact that I am willing to get punched in the face over and over and over again until I’m unrecognizable but shit, if I made the other guy look worse then I came out of it a winner.

26,"I was raised Roman Catholic and grew to dislike it more and more the older I got. I completely abandoned calling myself a Catholic when I got old enough to learn about the horrible abuse that the church is responsible for.

I never really followed or believed in a lot of the core beliefs or ""rules"" associated with Catholicism and I never went to confession. Despite it, I think that the teachings of Jesus from the bible are really important to me and have shaped the way I live my life. Even if Jesus wasn't real, which I think he was, the fact that someone had this philosophy that's all about love and forgiving and peace way back in that time is amazing, and it was spoken by someone or written down by someone.

39,"I don't even know where to start...

My mom started to show symptoms of dementia since a couple years back, it ended up being a completely different thing that it's treatable with surgery.

Before the surgery my dad used to get very frustrated with my mom and started to do this shitty thing of saying he was going to leave us so that my mom would ""wake up"". He started doing that every time something upset him so that he would get his way and then we never talked about it again. 

I thought that with the surgery that would stop, but he got angry at me about something and started saying the same thing, but this time he said he was going to leave this world and that he didn't wanted to be here anymore, we would be better without him and that he was doing it for us, so that we would finally be happy.

My mental health was already fucked before hand, but this broke me completely, it took me kind of slipping down the stairs (it was literally one step and nothing happened to me) for my dad to change his attitude completely and then he acted like nothing ever happened, even dared to ask me ""why are you so down"".

Today I woke up hearing him be angry at my mom about something, so i already had my anxiety up, I was afraid of him doing the same thing he always does, I was sad and after breakfast I just went back to bed.

He went to ask me some questions about lunch, saw that I was answering with one or two word sentences because, you know, I was fucking sad, so he told me ""why are you so negative?"" and left with a disgusted face.

I started crying and it wouldn't stop, I somehow managed to calm down but later he went to my room and said that he was leaving, that's when I fully broke down, he asked me, what happened?, I explained to him that I didn't wanted to go through that again, he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about, like that never happened and said that he was just going for groceries, then completely changed his attitude for the rest of the day.

I'm tired of him, and on top of that my mom just had surgery and refuses to stop doing chores, I stop her from lifting heavy things or doing things she shouldn't be doing and she gets mad at me, makes tantrumd and gives me snarky remarksand, it hurts.

Without a doubt, it's done so much to influence the morals   
 and history of the human race.

I honestly don't care if one doesn't believe in religion, but despite the fact that so many irreligious people say they don't mind either, the same people go ahead and without hesitation to say that the bible and it's writings is no different than the three little pigs, among other statements, as if they believe these statements are undisputed facts, because ""muh i'm atheist that means im sMaRTeR"".

And then i'm supposed to stay quiet and not say anything, or else get bombarded with angry atheists who can't fathom the fact that they should be mindful and tolerate others, the same way christians have been doing for them for centuries.

 But the moment anyone comments on homosexuality, or anything else they have an opinion on in the same manner, it's essentially the equivalent of giving yourself the death sentence on this site, since it's always downvoted and flooded with angry replies, who just want to debate you in a comment war where last comment wins.

49,"As stupid or as lame as this sounds, but I have zero talent in music. For many years I love several music pieces especially anime background music or other tv shows that made me so curious and I wanted to execute with my fingers or my breath to feel a sense of accomplishment or something I can be proud of myself once. So bought a keyboard with my pocket money and my parents will help me to pay for my classes. So for a few years trying to play my piano, I doesn't work so as good as i hope no matter how much effort I placed in my practice. I tried and tried and tried but my mind doesn't synchronized with my body movements and flowing the beat and even my left doesn't move properly and it freezes. 

My music teacher actually gave up on me and he said that I'm unteachable and blamed me that I'm not taking this seriously and my skills of reading the notes is made it even worse as I don't know how to play it. I know how which key to play it and I know the beat like single, or half etc etc but I cant input in my mind to play it out and the only way to for me to know is by memorizing the entire song and beat and follow the notes in sequence. My teacher disapproved and decided to tell me to quit. I felt so stupid every single time after his class and tried to practice non stop and I can't even execute accordingly the performance that he wanted. My left hand can't work accordingly as my brain cant dictate which key to hit next simultaneously for both of my hands and that metronome is distracting to keep up and my mind to process it. Eventually my teacher told me that this lesson is the last lesson as I am uncapable of playing music and he bootee me out from his class. I tried to redeem myself by practising non stop every damn day and there is hardly a single decent progress at all.

Then I decided to play a child's instrument a recorder. I could play them but terrible as my friends told me that I have to play with emotion. But when I play with emotion, it crashes so hard where there is no way I could balance the emotion, my breathing control, the finger strength to climb is certain chords (for lower chord you need to relax your fingers) and the notes presented in the sheet.

I really envy my musical talented cousins and friends as they could snatch any musical piece and execute so perfectly despite they never heard that music before.

There is a slight burning sensation, almost pleasant. I touched it then itched my ear and the same feeling is in my ear. Burning but not uncomfortable, or ALMOST uncomfortable.",12Apr2020,1
52,"Being in quarantine has made me realize how useless I’m treating my life. I am twenty years old, in my third year of CC with HORRIBLE and I mean HORRIBLE grades. I am a full-time student. Not looking to transfer to a four year uni anytime soon as of now. My major is nursing and with a 1.50 GPA, I’m going nowhere but the streets with those grades. I also work part-time in retail four days out of the week, looking to quit soon after this all ends. (Before you continue on, this is a ramble/advice seeking post)

I am at the age where I feel like I am running out of time of what to do for my future career path. One of my interest is acting, Ive always wanted to be a huge actor. However, due to the current situations with my parents neglecting the idea it’s a no go. Nursing is my top choice because I’ve always wanted to be knowledgeable in the health field, and helping others is a huge plus! However again, I have no motivation to do good in school. Sure I’ll do the basics like homework and other assignments but not to best of my abilities. To add, if you were to see my transcript, you’d probably pass out. I have multiple withdrawals/failed courses. I’m scared that no four-year uni will accept me. Throughout all this, I am constantly pressured by my parents to do good. I know most people my age are probably going through the same thing, but I am so lost and need advice. Moral of the story is that I need help in figuring what I want to pursue/how to start/managing my whole fucking life.",12Apr2020,1
53,"Ever since I was in high school (im almost 21 now) I've wanted to remove myself from society. Live alone and turn off the TV and Radio and get off social media. I want control of my own life and not care what people think of me.

This sounds anti social but let me pair it with this. I plan to be an entrepreneur and I need to be able to see things clearly. I want to network with people that increase my productivity. Most people don't, and it just hurts my brain, I need to be away for a while.",12Apr2020,2
55,"On the outside, I should be happy. I'm 20, and live and study abroad in Paris. I live in a house with 4 of my best friends, and I do well in my studies. In the weekends I play squash with a good group of friends, and I often go out and party.  As I am studying law here I am kinda stuck here career-wise. As of now, I like Paris and want to practice here as a lawyer at least for a couple of years. However, the city always makes me a bit angsty. It feels a bit too big, it's not as as friendly and nice as home (Stockholm) and I don't know if I want to stay here forever. Although living a seemingly nice life, I have been so heavy with constantly anxious thoughts trying to understand what I should do for the future, and I always go around thinking: What if I build my life here in Paris in my 20s, only to get tired of it and move back home to Sweden, where I will have lost the connection to many of my friends? It's like I feel like there is no point in having any fun in Paris, because it's going to disappear in a couple of years anyways. As of now, when I return home to Stockholm for the study breaks, I have my group of best friends from elementary school and a bigger group of friends from high school, so technically I shouldn't feel alone, but every time I return I can sense that the distance between me and my friends is getting bigger. I feel so nervous about building a life in Paris because I have this feeling I am going to leave it all in a couple of years and go back home, and be left with 0 friends as I have lost touch with home. Suddenly I will have left my friends in Paris, only to go back home for literally nothing, and I am so terrified of being alone and not having my friends. Especially considering I am not in Stockholm for the ""golden"" college years of making friends in the early 20s. Will anyone bother to reconnect with someone in their late 20s/early 30s? Is it even possible to make new friends at that point or is everyone busy with work and their domestic lives?

Why do I feel so scared about being lonely in the future? Am I going to lose the connection to all my Swedish friends and return there without being able to make any new friends, because I lost out on the college years?",12Apr2020,1
57,"I just had a huge fight with my family, parents Vs children. I have gotten sick with my father's behaviour towards me and my brother (both adults) over the last few months, and today I snapped. I ended up involving my mother in this too, but she deserved it less.

Every point I made, they told me a million reasons why I shouldn't feel that way and why I was being a whiny, spoilt little bitch, completely invalidating my feelings. It's as like they think they are absolutely perfect and could never do anything wrong. A discussion of my feelings turned into a full blasted shouting match. Granted, I too said things I shouldn't have.

I can't stand being around them now but I am shut in the house with their wrath. I don't want to see their faces for a while but I can't escape. I can't apologise because that would mean taking back all the things I said, which I meant.

What do I do?",12Apr2020,1
58,"I’ve been writing in here a little bit in the past, about my abusive relationship and how I’ve met the most amazing girl to ever land on this earth, it’s been just over a month I’ve been with her now, she wants to build a future with me, I want that as well, she’s given me the ambition for the future that just a couple months ago would have seemed unrealistic.

My education was completely fucked over due to the toxicity of the relationship I was in prior, to correct this I’m taking an Access To HE (paramedicine) course online for the next year with two GCSE’s (English and Maths) to meet grade 4(C) which is required by the university on entry, I’m confident I’ll pass this, I currently hold no GCSE’s solely due to the fact most of my teen and adult life was dominated by a completely vile human being, however in my mocks I was looking at a grade 7-8, I did however achieve a level 1 in college which is equivalent to the lower grades(1-3) but wasn’t present long enough to take my level 2&amp;3.

Thanks to what is hands down the most amazing and supportive girl I’ve ever met in my life, over the next 4 years I’ll be studying to become a Paramedic and in 5 I hope to be working with NWAS and living with her so I can give her the world for what she’s done for me, I want to support this girl for life because I can not possibly thank her enough, I’m already so in love with her and don’t know what I’ve done to deserve someone like her.",12Apr2020,1

68,"So I’m an essential worker apparently. I was working 44-62 hrs a week depending on what is happening. Now a one client isn’t needing anything from the company I work for which has resulted in having a week and half off till my next shift which is 8hrs long and after that I don’t know when I’ll be working. ( I turned down a 42hr week for a 68hr working week which I knew would end soon. ) 


I always was negative, stressed or just complained about the amount of work I was doing ( coming from a previous job that I was only doing 4 to 8 hours a week ) and now to know that I have this time to destress. I genuinely feel like I’m going back to a state of mind that I don’t want to be in. I had gotten out of it after 2 months stint about a year and half ago. And me working allowed me not to think about it, not to have it come forward, allowed me to focus on what is happening tomorrow. Maybe there is an amount of hrs per week you are meant to work and I just didn’t find it but I think I know what it is now.


Don’t get me wrong I enjoy what I am doing and I have goals that I want to achieve. Honestly I don’t know how retired people do it. Just be at home go out to the beach or the shopping centre or whatever they do. 


Should I be complaining about working when there’s millions of people that lost or stopped working? No.

Everyone in the church, 
We liked Easter a lot...

But the virus, which lurked in the shadows
Did Not!

The virus closed churches, the whole Lenten Season,
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.

And nothing about it felt normal or right.
The coughing nonstop and the breathing so tight.

The fear of the virus was now known to all,
And it forced to stay home, the tall and small.

With the church doors locked tightly and tied with a rope, *
We stood there Good Friday, losing our hope,

Staring out from our caves with our sour, Grinchy frowns,
We sensed the depression and loss in our towns.
 
“It’s over,” was echoed on each pair of lips,
“No planning church service and after church trips.

No rehearsing cantatas and sermons and prayers,
No ironing our clothes and/or curling our hair.”

And we growled, our fingers all nervously drumming,
“This virus will surely stop Easter from coming!”

For on Easter we know, none of us would do rather,
Than wake bright and early- to church we would gather!

And then! Oh, the noise! Joyful Noise! Noise! Noise! Noise!
That's the best part of Easter! The Great Joyful NOISE!

The children would rush for the eggs that were hidden.
It’s Easter you see, so no candy’s forbidden

And they’d feast! And they’d Feast! And they’d FEAST! FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!
 
Then we all, young and old, would raise hands and bow heads,
While prayers of thanksgiving and worship were said.

We’d celebrate Jesus, his death and his rise,
And after the sermon our prayers we’d reprise.

And then we’d do something we like most of all,
Every one in our churches, the tall and the small,

Would stand close together, with Easter bells ringing,
Hold hands in a circle, and all would start singing!

And we’d sing! And we'd sing! And we'd SING! SING! SING! SING!

And the more we all thought of this great Easter Sing,
The more we thought, ""How can we skip this whole thing?

Why, as long as remembered the church has been open!
There doesn’t seem anything left to have hope in""

Then we got an idea! An AWFUL idea!
And we thought on this Terrible, AWFUL IDEA!

""Easter’s Cancelled!” We felt the fear rise in our throats.
And we made few calls, no need for our coats.
 
And we gossiped and clucked, What a great virus trick!
We watched CNN till we made ourselves sick.
 
""What we need is a savior!” and looked quickly around.
But since saviors are scarce, there was none to be found.

Did that stop us? NO! We turned back to the news
We found many ‘saviors,’ and multiple views,
 
Then we all got bandanas of blues and of reds
And made ourselves masks to tie on to our heads.
 
Then we hoarded our food and we all shopped on line,
If we had to be home, well, at least we’d be “fine!”
 
And we shut off our faith and we turned on our screens,
We’d scroll all of FaceBook for this quarantine.

All our windows were dark, and a funk filled the air.
We were slipping and sinking in deep, deep despair.
 
Good Friday was dark, and our spirits were down
We saw Jesus dying, the thorns for a crown.

""The passersby said, 'Why not get yourself down?
You're King,? You’re God’s son? or are you a clown?”

.And we wondered too- “Lord, why not set yourself free?
We need you to save us- God, where can you be?""

We got stuck on that thought, for a moment or two.
And we pondered if God would really come through.

The darkness kept spreading, continued to grow.
Cause hope, in a crisis, is the first thing to go!

And we slithered and slunk, with smiles most unpleasant,
Though we longed for the mercy of God to be present!

“Netflix! And Amazon!  Distractions for looking!
Chocolates! And Puzzles! Baking! And Cooking!""

And we stuffed our hope down. The virus, was winning,
Our belly’s and even our heads were all spinning!

The death toll was rising. We all felt so scared.
The loss touched our families, We weren’t prepared!

So on knees bent so deep we went back to the Lord.
“Give us hope through this darkness, give us faith through your word!”

The cross loomed so large, it was hard to remain.
""My God!"" Jesus cried, ""why’d you leave me in pain?""

And the thunder clapped once, Jesus took his last breath,
It seemed all hope was lost in the wake of his death.

And they took down his body in utter dismay.
His friends and His family, they wept and they prayed.

And then all the next day, we did as we were told
Social distancing practices getting so old.

Though we gathered on line to feel comfort, and cry.
And all of us badly in need of reply,

We doubted the power of Christ to come through.
And without resurrection, oh, what would we do?
 
So on Saturday night, we did what we could, 
to ease our own fears, though we knew where we stood.

Our faith, it felt shattered, we needed to sleep
So we said a quick prayer, “God, our souls quickly keep”

""Wait till tomorrow,"" God whispered to we,
""There's a light that is rising that you’ve yet to see.""

And God’s words soothed our hearts, we held all that was said.
And we breathed a deep breath and we all went to bed.

But while we each slept in our quarantined rooms,
Jesus was waking and leaving the tomb!

On Sunday, the sun rose on time, inch by inching.
But we woke to our usual doubting and grinching.

Easter Morning, we still feared, this year, would be skipping us,
Till we realized the truth under all that was tripping us.

And our mouths, they hung open a minute or two
And then we remembered just what we should do.

“Listen”, God said,  “To my voice- you MUST hear!""
So we paused. And we opened our hearts and our ears.

And we did hear a voice, and we sat up bed.
“Jesus WAS risen, just as He said!”

We took in the son-rise- God opened our eyes!
Jumped out of bed smiling, with shocking surprise!

Every one, every Christian, the tall and the small,
Was praising and praying and singing and all!

No virus stopped Easter from coming! IT CAME!
Through God’s grace and mercy, it came just the same!

""It came without choirs!  Without church doors open!""
""It came because NEW LIFE is what we have hope in!

And we laughed at our doubts, sang till voices were sore.
Then we all thought of something we hadn't before!

That we don’t need to join hands or meet face to face.
Cause the church is a people, connected by grace

And the virus, still looming in all of the land,
Is no match for the power of God’s mighty hand

And what happened then? At the church now, we say,
We worshiped, and sang, ‘Christ is Risen Today!.’

Connected by Spirit, to God, through Christ’s love
We raise resurrection songs here and above!

And we brought back the joyful noise, feasting in praise
And Christ, RISEN CHRIST! To our voices we raise!

80,"You guys probably are familiar with that feeling to an extent, stop talking to someone for years you guys weren’t really close but you decide to reconnect. Well I did hat with my friends from my other country that I moved from 3 years ago. And honestly even after 3 years, they still added me back and some people even messaged me (even though we barely knew each other before!) and I’d like to say that this little leap of faith really helped so. 
If you’re scared of reaching out to someone don’t let that fear take a potentially good outcome from you.

I got my self-discipline right back on track, as no matter what I'm feeling, I'll still do what I'm supposed to do. 

I've read a lot of books and actually LEARNED HOW TO LEARN, which in my opinion is the most important life skill of all. I changed my perspective on a lot of stuff and I'm proud. I learned about so much stuff it's ridiculous.

I've been listening to so much music and it's been sounding better than ever.

I've been meditating and my mind doesn't have a million thoughts going through it every second anymore.

I've watched movies/series that everybody watched but I did not. It made me feel out of the loop, not anymore.

I've stopped a lot of addictions, which made my life so beautiful. (Porn,Gaming,Caffeine,Social media, Fast food).

This quarantine has been  the best thing to happen to me. I was on top of the world like this 2 years ago, but I fell back into old habits. I needed a break as life was moving too fast and it was hard for me to catch up. Perfect opportunity to do all that I needed to do, and I believe you should start working on yourself as well.",12Apr2020,18

91,"I’ve been living in my head thinking about what went wrong with this woman I’ve fallen for.

We first met back in mid-2018, connected briefly, then went back to our respective countries which are on opposite sides of the world. We stayed in touch and met once again at the end of the year when I travelled to her country.

During the second half of 2019, we got in touch again and started text almost every day and have occasional scheduled calls. While we still lived far away, I felt there was a connection between us and the conversations have always been… natural, raw and personal. As we grew closer, I picked up the courage to do things that I hoped would show how I felt, such as sending her a gift on her birthday, which she seemed to love. I’ve been honest about how I thought she was special and amazing – although I never said “I like you”.

Then, we met again in Christmas 2019 when I travelled to her place again. At this point, I started to really like her but was unsure of what would happen with the distance – and the fact that there’s no chance of us moving closer to each other in the next 2 years at least. We went out a few times and had the best time. I did what I thought would show how I felt – flowers, gifts with handwritten notes, picked up the tabs and planned the dates to her liking. By this point, it was clear that both of us really enjoyed each other’s company. She has always been receptive of my advances and said she had lovely time with me, even asked me to visit often.

I was still hesitant to tell her outright I liked her, as I was still hoping there would come a day in which we’ll live in the same city together, and I’d stand a better chance then. I was trying to make an arrangement in which I would live closer to her for a few months mid-year and wanted to use the momentum to tell her then.

Anyway, after returning home, we still texted. I did a couple more things to keep keep the “sparks”, e.g. sending flowers to her office, which she said she liked!

However, several weeks in, things turned different. After she came back from a trip to visit her parents, her schedules had turned busy with work and other commitments, and she started responding less. I didn’t have any reason to believe that she didn’t want to speak with me – everything was going well just before that. I didn’t hear back for a couple of weeks, couldn’t call her. Finally managed to hear back. She said she’d been hectic so wasn’t able to text anymore. I was surprised so decided to tell her outright how I felt. She then said she just wanted to be friends and that she doesn’t want me to waste my effort/time.

I’ve been replaying this to figure out if there was anything I could have done to save the situation. Do you think I did anything wrong?",12Apr2020,1

105,"So, things with Nat are not going well. Unfortunately. Really, it's sad. There were so much possibility. Not they are gone. What seemed to be sparks of a new year firework is now all but gone. It makes me really sad. There was so much possibility. Things died before it came to life. I made some mistakes, she made some, we made some, and the time and situation; and it died. It makes me sad really. I was telling this to one my friend, one that respect; he asked me, this possibility that died, was it really there? And he made a good point. 

Things that died, it died because there was/is a 3rd person. She wanted to breakup with him even before we met. And still she can't let him go. Wow! Just wow! I thought I was enough for her to let her past go and start a new one. I thought I was special to her, as she was to me. Nah. I was not. I was not. It hurt me. I thought we had a lot of chemistry. She even told me so. She is a good person. Trying to do the right thing. I believed her when she said it. I chose to believe her later. Well, that was not the case it seems. I was not enough for her to let go of the past. Not only that my arrival in her life did not change her stance on breaking up with him any better. One can even say, I may have pushed her to him more. It hurts. It does affect my self-steem, which was low to begin with. I just started working on it and it took a hit so early. It's okay though, I did it once, I can do it again. It just hurts. I was not planning to have a long term relationship with her, I wanted to experience her as a person. Body and mind. I wanted to learn from her. I wanted partner up with her. And she said she was looking for something too. I thought she meant with me, turns out she didn't mean me (I am assuming). I wanted someone with whom I can fight irrationally, to whom I can say I need some strength today, can you spare me some? I wanted to experience a new person. I wanted to laugh with her. I wanted to watch movie with her. I wanted someone with whom I can talk philosophy with. I wanted someone with someone I can be insecure with. She told me she would like that as well. We said at the beginning, ""Please tell the truth, always"". I held my end of the bergain. She did not. She hid things from me. Important things, like she had a bodfriend for the first three weeks. Thank God at least she did tell. Although I think shed did not because of me but for her own consience. I don't mean to paint her in a bad picture. She is a good person. Even in this turmoil she supported me. Oh! I wanted someone who can support me in my journey of discovering myself/self-improvement/discovering life and someone whom I can support. She said she wanted the same. I thought she meant me. Nah. Yeah, I was saying, even in this turmoil she supported me. When I was down, she said ""I beleive in you"". It meant a lot to me. No girlfrield ever told me that. Usually it was the other way around. I was met with ""You are not a real man, why can't you do anything like that boyfriend"". And even after that I stayed. I lacked the minimum self-respect to leave. I was foolish. I was naive. I was made to beleive I am responsible for their life. And I beleived it. I am better now, it took 10 years or so. But I am better now. 

Today makrs the 3rd month since our first date. After some abusive relationship she was/is the first woman I have met with whom I could have normal, even a healthy relationship. I was so afraid of sharing myself with another person again that I marked my calender to check on this relationship I was getting into. Here I am responding to my call; a call out of fear of losing myself in nother person. I was starving for some affection, some warmth, some physical touch. I was starving. I was starving. She did give me some ounce of that. I found that a bit in her. The starving self in me, the one who was so thirsty of that got some of that from her. I felt like a man after a long time. 

I am sad, I am sad. For what it could have been, and never will be. Like my friend pointed out, maybe it was never there to begin with. Maybe I am sad over something that was never there. I am sad. It came so close to me and got away. It saddens me. I need to pull back. I opened up after a very long time, to her and to my friends. Both are not there anymore. Maybe Iam too much for them. Maybe. I belive I was/am too much for my friends. And for her, I was not enough for her. She told me, I am the third person with whom she can open up; the other two being her best friends. I thought I was special. I was not. I was not. I hugged her tightly. With my heart. I knew it was gonna end soon. I wanted to end it soon. But I did not think it will end before it even started. 

What am I trying to say? I do not know yet. Just rambling here in didgital paper. Hopeing it will be able to show me something. I really should read this after few days. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Be sad my friend. Be sad. Hug yourself. Pull back. You were full closed up/down. Then you switched to too much open up mode. In this spectrum, be 30% open up instead of 100% that you are right now. Because of opening up, we are hurt right now. We are feeling so lonely after a very long time. Something we thought were past us. Something we thought we took care of already. But also ""In order to feel something we need to risk getting hurt"", see? We felt something and we got hurt. Both comes together my friend. We can't have one without the other. It's okay my friend. We opened up, we got some warmth, we got some love, got to feel the warmth, we also got hurt. Now we adjust, pull back. 30% open up. We can do it. We have done it, and we shall do it once again. That's the human story my friend. For a short moment we felt like a victory.

It's okay my friend. We got this. I hope your heart heals. I hope your heart gets a bit better. It is okay. It is okay. Be sad. We are strong. We are motherfucking strong. It's there. It's there. We need to dig deeper, again. We got this. We got this.",12Apr2020,1
108,"I'm senior in high school (f18) and have recently committed to a military college. I did this a few weeks ago, but with all the wack stuff with quarantine nothing really feels real. I've morphed into a hermit who sleeps and reads conspiracy theories all day. Lately though, it has come to my attention that I have about six months to get into the best shape of my life physically and mentally. Lately, I'm realizing that my life of not really trying and mostly succeeding is about to come to a grinding halt; I'll have to work hard, manage myself, and make mistakes. I'll have to wake up at ungodly hours and run, stay up until who knows when trying to understand physics, and get yelled at and messed with and embarrassed. That's okay, though. 

I signed up for this, and I have no regrets.

Someone told me that quarantine will separate the strong from the weak, and lately I've been weak. I stopped working out and bettering myself. I can't be too disappointed in my decisions, I have been meditating and helping friends, but it's not good enough for the future I want. I signed up for this and have absolutely no regrets. 

I have six months and all the time in the world, I'm going to military school and will succeed because I have no regrets.",12Apr2020,2

My dad never really took pics of me, and my mom lost a lot of mine along the way due to so many life shituations. My dad never wanted to buy me a yearbook or school photos and they were too expensive for my mom to when I moved in with her.

How can I tell myself that it will get better, how can I believe that when I have no clue what tomorrow is going to bring let alone the next week, month, year...

I thought this would make me happy. Why do I feel so much pain.

I want to make a difference, I want to make change. I don't want all this suffering and pain, but maybe I'm just another broken person contributing to all the pain in the world.

I just wish I didn't feel so much... 

I'm scared that I'm right. That even after all of this I will fail to find happiness. Maybe it doesn't exist. Maybe everything I feel is just a lie. Maybe when I finally feel it, I'll just fuck everything up, I'm good at that...",12Apr2020,2

134,"My (F18) friends and I used to play DnD all the time. We did this for about 2 years and my ex boyfriend was always our DM. About a year ago, we stopped playing because some group members decided we didn’t have enough time to play (the real reason was that two players apparently didn’t enjoy my play style and I wasn’t told this until much later and i think it’s an unfair assessment). 

Soon after this, another campaign began, with the same group minus me and one other person. The other person was too busy to play anyway and would’ve left no matter what, but I was left out against my will. To add insult to injury, I was replaced by my exes new girlfriend and it’s on the one day i couldn’t play even though everybody’s free on other days. 

This campaign is still going on, and every time I hear about it it hurts me all over again to be excluded. It also hurts that my best friend doesn’t seem to care that it hurts me so much. She never fought for me. I don’t want to play with them at this point, but it still hurts to be left out. I have talked to the other about it but they don’t seem to care that it hurts me and offer no sympathy or solution.

I know this seems dramatic, but it makes me feel really sad. I love DnD, and my friends are super important to me, so it hurts to feel like I’m not as important as them. How do I get over the feeling of FOMO?",12Apr2020,7
135,"We have been successful at flattening the curve, which has the effect to lowering the peak and easing the strain on medical resources. However, this also has the effect of stretching out the ""tail"" of the pandemic. That is, instead of flaming up and then dropping quickly, we have a long drawn out smoldering burn.


We're never going to bring it down to zero, and until we have a vaccine or enough of the population has had it (maybe something like 50%?), we're going to have to continue social distancing. In the US for example, if we estimate a million people have had it, that's only about .3% of the population. We are pretty much in the same situation we were in 3 weeks ago. If we estimate that the US is taking on 100K new cases daily, it would take about 30 months for it to reach half the population. 


I'm certain we will see some partial re-openings, maybe with improved understanding of the disease we can treat it better and control its transmission more effectively. But for most people that are working for home, they're not going back to their offices any time soon. Maybe a year? Maybe more? Same goes for large gatherings, sports, concerts, movies, clubs and bars, any kind of resort or spa, theme parks, and most air travel.

136,"I am a 15 year old 9th grade student. Turning 16 on 22nd this month. Ever since i started 9th grade, I have been certain that i will not make it to 16. For the past two years, I've not been in my best mental health. In my country, namely Pakistan, the study system is really trash. 9th and 10th grade are given the title of matriculation. It is an unfair system,  they give us 8 books to learn, word to word. No scene of concepts, just memory. All i remember doing all day is just studying and gridding my ass off. In my case, for 2 years, because our school started 9th in between of 8th grade. I have been pressurized more than my size over the past 2 years by everyone. Teachers at school would threat us about exams all the time. I was taunted all the time. School people didn't leave a chance to throw my self-esteem away. They didn't even give us proper summer vacations (in our country, it gets really hot, upto 45 degrees celsius). They gave us 3 weeks worth of summer vacations and tonsssss of written work to do. Now most of my classmates didn't do the work but i did it thinking it would be useful later on in exams. But my freaking teacher lost ot anyway so basically i wasted my time. I was so sick in the vacations yet i grinded everyday and pulled all-nighters just to finish my work. I was so sick mentally that at one point, I hallucinated a lizard on my bed. I get really scared of that stuff so i jumped out of my head quickly, and got hit hard in the head by the door. Now no normal person would sleep after that so i turned on my PC... To cool down a bit. My dad (like any other Asian parent_not saying they're bad, i love my parents) he objected that saying i should only focus my studies. It was one year into 9th grade when school started the never ending test session. It went on for 6 months straight. There was no rest, no sanity, no nothing involved in my life other than studies. My PC was also restricted for me because of so-called exams that never showed up... Until they actually did... I gave 2 exams, was really happy that I'd finally get over with this stupid 9th grade.. And corona virus popped up, everything shut down and they postponed our exams. How worse could my life get honestly? I felt my life, my time, my devotion, and my hard work wasted right there because of sone pandemic. Why would i even work so hard right? Or why would i not take it easy like my classmates? It was because, all i wanted, was to be a freaking surgeon, a doctor in this Goddamn country. Today i am at the point where i am almost giving up on the biggest dream of my life. If you have been reading all this till this far, firstly, thank you... And can you help me out? I have no one to talk to because no one understands. I wanted to be a doctor because doctors here are so shit that you won't even believe it. I love my mom more than myself, she's got a lot of problems i wanted to fix. For which i made this decision. But i didn't know i would get wrecked, both physically and mentally. I don't know what to do. Should i just kill myself? Give up on everything? Or continue to suffer thinking something good might happen?",12Apr2020,1

142,"We’ve been together almost a year now and I’ve known the real catfish for about 6 months or more. She (who I previously thought was a boy) is beautiful, and amazing. It was hurtful when I found out they were a catfish but I wanted to work it out so we did. And it went great! We’re set to meet really soon and i’m more than excited to meet her. But sometime I get in this funk and miss who she used to be. The “guy” she used to be. I found his profile on facebook and it’s so weird watching him live his everyday life now. He doesn’t know me at all. A hard pill to swallow, but I don’t know him at all either. I probably never will. He speaks little to no english and I don’t think i’m his “type” at all. I had my suspicions before but after another months of searching on the internet for his pictures and clues I came up empty. She even sent me videos and talked about meeting soon and how we couldn’t wait to meet. So I just gave up my search and believed him. Huge mistake. I’m glad I’m with her. I love her. I want to meet her and be with her. But a part of me hates her for doing this and I wish I never knew of his existence. I wish I could get past this and not think of him at all. I don’t want to hurt her at all. She’s amazing and  she treats me like a princess. I just need to get past this and soooon! :(",12Apr2020,1
143,"Dear diary,

Today was a lot more positive than previous days have been slowly feeling myself getting there just taking small steps at the time at the moment.

Managed to distract myself by playing nazi zombies and GTA 5. Going to try finding the custom stunt races and do them at some point during this lockdown.

I am proud to say I have not thought about her once today and I’m pretty proud of myself for that, one day I realise I won’t think about her at all.

I realised she is totally the wrong girl for me. She wouldn’t understand and doesn’t understand my little quirks. For example I love watching documentaries about crocodiles and great white sharks. 

Not counting on it just yet as this is still technically a fresh wound but I will eventually find a girl who loves me for me and loves me for who I am including all my quirks.",12Apr2020,2

147,"I don't know what it is. Maybe a sexual aversion problem? I've had feelings for this person for months, and now that he's showing a sexual kind of interest in me I feel sort of horrified by it. I thought I liked him, and I thought I could see a romantic relationship with him, but now I feel so put off by the fact that he views me in a sexual way and I can't understand why. Did I really just like him platonically?

I think maybe some of this is derived from negative experiences I had. I can vividly remember my first sexual experience, feeling this terrible fear, failing to say no, going numb. His reaction to the physical pleasure sent me into a panic attack. Just the way his breathing changed and his body tensed up, not being able to see his face, feeling like he was a stranger. It was traumatizing and I can't understand why because I agreed to it and all was well in the moments before.

I tried again a few times after this but none of my relationships have survived very long and half the time I just feel numb like I can't have feelings for anyone, even if I thought I did at first. I tried once again to push myself into sex and but it just made things worse of course. It lacked love and it was the most empty feeling I've ever had in my life.

I'm so confused and overwhelmed by this problem. I tried to go back to therapy before the pandemic but I couldn't follow through after everything went online. I don't know why I've struggled so much. I had anxiety growing up and I was shy, but I spent so many years overcoming that and I thought I was alright by adulthood. I wish so badly it could be different.",12Apr2020,1
