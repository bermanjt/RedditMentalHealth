0,I had a night with a girl where we both got drunk. Wasn’t a date but we discussed a lot of sex stuff. Later in the night I kissed her and she let me. (Later said she might have kissed me back but it was ages ago and she doesn’t remember fully) She went to the bathroom and came back to bed facing away from me I kissed her back and wanted to have sex which I told her. She went to the bathroom to throw up and go home. Shit was weird for a while. She was uncomfortable and had a boyfriend at the time whic I knew about which is so shitty. The night is blurry for me cause I was really drunk (don’t get that drunk anymore) She said it was a weird night but now she thinks of it as a funny bar story and told me I need to get sover it and stop worrying but I feel like I fkn assaulted someone.,24Nov2020,1

4,"Recently my fiance was falsely accused of raping one of his little sisters (they were never alone together, I was with them the whole time). It's been really hard on him, and only a handful of people know, almost all of them being my family. Everyone who knows believes and supports him 100%, but due to his childhood, he has problems trusting people and asking for help/support.

His mom is serving a 13+ year sentence gor a crime she didn't commit, and he's terrified that the same thing is going to happen to him.

We're getting married next month, and expecting our first child in 2 months. His grandma that raised him has been a major part of his life, but he hasn't talked to her about what's going on. He's terrified that his sister's side of the family (half siblings) talked to her, and that she might now think that he is a pedophile and a rapist.

He hasn't reached out to her (or anyone really) since he was arrested last month. I bonded him out and we have a good lawyer, but people in his past were very unforgiving, and he is convinced that anyone who hears about it will assume it's true, including those close to him. (It didn't happen, there is no possible evidence, and he has never done or been accused of anything of the sort before)

He was afraid to invite his grandma, the closest family member he has, to our wedding, so today I broke down and called her.

I asked her if she knew anything about what was going on and she had no idea. So I filled her in on what had happened, and how hard it is effecting him. She was very supportive (and upset he didn't call her when he got arrested or got out on bail) and expressed that she believed him, due to the circumstances and the impossibility of him having an opportunity. (His sisters live on the other side of the state and he only met them this year and has never been alone with them).

I knew she would believe and support him. She is an evidence first person and there is simply nothing but the word of mouth of his 15 year old sister, who he's never been alone with. He needed the support and the proof that the people that love him now won't abandon him as easily as the people in his past.

He woke up from his nap towards the end of our almost 2 hour long call. He asked who I was talking to and I told him the truth about who it was. When I got off the phone he asked how I ended up talking to her. I lied and said she called me, needing help with ordering something online (which shr actually had asked me for help during our call.)

I feel bad about calling her against his wishes, and lying about being the one who reached out to her first. But she's the closest family he has, and he needed her support. She plans on calling him tomorrow before work to tell him that she loves and believes him.",24Nov2020,1
5,"Hi there kind people of reddit,
It's my first time posting ever. I decided I'd give a shot of your opinion on this story. I've told it to my closest friends, yet no one could give me a logical explanation or said that they have experienced something similar.
Backstory is i lost my father in August 2019. He used to talk a lot on his phone due to his business. He spent, like, the whole day, communicating with clients, making deals, etc. Back in 2016-17 He used one reeeally old htc smartphone which was already so not-up-to-date that even google play was difficult to run. Basically, it was not useful, so he bought a new one and we dumped the old HTC in a drawer full of old tech. After he passed away, me and mom made a really deep clean of the room where this phone was. She went outside the room to get some chores done while i was organizing this drawer, so i was left alone in the room when suddenly i dropped a notebook and as i squatted to bring it back to its place, the old phone, which was not used by anyone in the family except for my dad, simply turned on by itself. I did not even touch it, just saw the little screen go white and the htc logo appeared and i was shocked to see that it had less than 15% battery. After all these years??? 
What are the chances, reddit people? Thank you for your time, i really hope someone out there might give a rational explanation of this :)",24Nov2020,1
6,"Due to COVID and shops closing, I’ve faced the risk of redundancy until today I was offered the opportunity to apply for the new assistant manager role that’s opened up in my store- and I have been heavily praised by my manager who indicated that if I apply I’ll be successful.

TL;DR You wont give in to my out of the blue demand? Have a pizza!

My ex's mother messaged me after months of no contact wanting to take my girls for Thanksgiving. I won't be able to afford/ provide thanksgiving without help so I told her I will host thanksgiving and do all the cooking and cleaning if she provided the food and she could take them to the little park (I have a full view of it out my window) for some one on one time. She told me no, she wanted them to go see her side of the family. I then offered to bring them to her place (covid restrictions, I know) and I would just sit in my car across the street. Again, she said no, she would be taking them on her own and I can't come.

I'm not comfortable with that at all because a few months ago my ex took my girls on a seemingly normal visit and ended up fleeing the state with them which ended up with an amber alert parental abduction. She attempted to guilt trip me and harass me that she was’t her son and I'm being a horrible mother withholding my girls from their family. I got to the point where I told her the offer was no longer available and blocked her from contacting me. Since then she has used random phone numbers to harass me and has gone as far as sending the cops on a welfare check three times under the guise of being concerned about my girls.

Granny of the year! She didn’t care about them on their birthday or when we were homeless. My anxiety is through the roof. To get into my building people need a code and if they don't know it they have to buzz to get in. She tried twice already and has started sending random pizza delivery to my place which is extremely embarrassing and cruel to the poor delivery drivers wasting their time/gas for nothing since I can’t pay them. Everytime I hear a buzz I know it's either her or another poor delivery driver that I have to explain I didn't order and I can't pay.

It’s childish, petty, immature, with no signs of stopping because this is exactly the bullshit her son used to do but its my fuck up because I gave her my address in the beginning because I was positive she would pick one of the two options I gave. I never really had much contact with my ex’s mother, even when we were dating but I am now seeing where he got the narcissist, manipulative, threatening traits from. I just wanted to give my girls a good Thanksgiving and needed help with the meal. I fucked up ten fold.",24Nov2020,1

Needless to say I was hurt, but I was able to make some new friends and have some fun as a college kid in a college town. I was also able to turn my life around and improve in a number of areas. I came home for the holidays because I wanted to be around family. The night before I left, I made the decision to unfollow her on all social medias, so I wouldn’t feel tempted to look. I also added “The best start is a fresh start” to my instagram bio because I thought it described what I was going through. Fast forward to today and she texts me a really passive aggressive text mentioning my instagram bio and says it is aimed at her. She also accused me of not being over her, not doing enough in the relationship, and lying about the situation. I explained to her that she was misunderstood and that it had nothing to do with her at all. She got pissed and told me to fuck off and blocked me on snapchat (but weirdly not on Instagram or Twitter). The reason I think she is lying is because I unfollowed her on the 20th and she has an app that sends her a notification when she loses a follower. Its the 23rd today and if she got that notification on the 20th, she would’ve said something about it there and then, but she didn’t.

21,"Marked NSFW for potentially triggering things mentioned, such as s*lf h*rm


About 2 months ago I started trying to clean my room up. I only got clothes and books organized and left it at that. It’s really big for me and I didn’t have anyone to tell. Excitement and happiness came stronger to me than they’ve ever been before, but then my positive emotions were once again beat down with spiked baseball bats by my parents.

My room continues to stay as a mess and I’m reminded everyday about how badly it looks. The motivation I had once had is now gone. The poisonous sentences said by my parents haunt me. They talked about my grades, school, motivation, how I’ll never be good in life, and how I act way to dumb to be the “smart” person I am. I make it look like it doesn’t hurt but I’m always silently in pain.

S*lf h*rm isn’t something new for me. I’ve tried many different methods, such as: cutting, poking myself with needles, punching and bruising myself, pulling my hair out, purposely burning myself, biting my arms, scratching, pulling skin off harshly, and allowing my pets to injure me. 

I’ve done it for years but started cutting in 8th grade. However, I was caught my mom and was forced into taking anti-depressants and taking counseling. I hated every bit of it and faked myself getting better to leave that horrible excuse of a way of healing. The person who tried to help me would tell my parents things I begged them not to say. Even if I didn’t say anything, they would tell my parents what happened during the session no matter what. That sent me into an even deeper state of depression but I hid it.

It’s been almost 2 years since that happened and things keep on getting worse. About 1 month ago I started s*lf h*arming in the ways listed above, except for cutting. The degradation I’ve had to face from my parents has hurt me the most. I’ve tried to stand up for myself but I’ve only been met with more anger and curse words spat in my face to label me as things I don’t want to be.

My room is the only thing that I care about the most which is quite funny and sad. If I don’t get it done, it will remind me about how much of a failure I am. But if I do get it done, I’ll actually have to look eye-to-eye with the things my parents remind me about to show how bad I am at them. 

Lately, I’ve thought about asking my mom to let me go see a therapist or counselor again, but I know I’ll have to have that same one who won’t let me choose which things are secret. My mental health is worsening quicker than I thought. S*cidal thoughts linger in my head longer than they should. I have no one to talk to. With my dad having COVID and my grandfather having cancer, happiness seems further away than it should. I’ll be in quarantine for about 2.5 weeks because of Thanksgiving break and than normal quarantine. 

None of my friends will call me and I’m not close with my family at all, so that seems fun. If I’m lucky, I won’t k*ll myself during any of this. However, the chances seem to get slimmer every day. Hopefully I make it and maybe even get better. I bet even if I tried to c*mmit s*icide; it would be done so bad that my parents would bring me back just to scold me. Anyways, the only thing I have to live for is my pets, so hopefully they keep me here long enough so I can eventually get help.

About help, I’ve contemplated calling the suicide hotline. I need to talk about how bad things are for me and how badly my parents are to me. I forgot to mention this, but after that counselor forced me to come out as trans to my parents and after I came out to my parents about my sexuality, they’ve treated me worse. Honestly, I wish I could go back in time and either k*ll mys*lf or just keep my mouth shut and be smarter and not c*t mys*lf, but it already happened.

So, if nothing helps by my birthday next year, I’ll probably see how long I can hold my breath under water until I d*e or see if I can play hopscotch with a ro*e t*ed around my n*ck.

22,"Hi, I just need to vent. 

My hubby is a genuine and honest person, he’s also a super fun dad to our kids.  He can live in the moment, whereas I am perpetually planning for the future. 

He’s both faithful and loyal to a fault, and he can be incredibly kind and we’ve been married 18 years. 

The problem is he can be exceedingly difficult to live with when one needs order and stability, and there has been little of either for us in 2020. 

He has adult ADHD and functions moderately well. Marriages in which one spouse has ADHD have a much higher than average failure rate and it’s easy to see why. 

He manages difficult circumstances by letting everything slide off his back and continues to do his own thing. 

His sister calls it his bubble and it’s hard to pierce. He survives fairly well due to this, but there are two big problems.

One, it makes him pretty callous and a poor listener. He’s frightfully inconsiderate, and it’s impossible to get him to see why his actions are a problem. 

Two, if something does reach him in his bubble, he has zero other coping mechanisms. 

Earlier this year he was laid off in company cutbacks. That popped the bubble pretty hard. 

He was completely pole axed by the experience and I don’t diminish what he was going through. I was supportive.  I listened empathetically. I did everything he asked, including taking his HR person to task about how the situation was handled and really went to bat for him. 

He REALLY struggled. To hear him tell it, he was the only person to have struggled this much with a layoff and no one suffered like he did.  Worse, all of the progress he had made in controlling and working around his ADHD was gone. He went from a husband to a third child in many respects. 

Here’s the kicker. I was unemployed for a while due to moving to help advance his career.  Everything he went through this year I went through in Nebraska. I talked openly about my struggles and his response was always a shrug. I got myself out of it on my own and was finally employed a month before we were transferred again. 

He always said he felt for me and how hard it must have been, but everything he has said since he got laid off has made it very clear he didn’t listen to me at all when I struggled. 

After he was laid off, we both wanted to go back to our home state. I found a dream job in a dream area.  We took it and I’m happy we are here, but I’m so tired. I’m working a rewarding but difficult job, doing almost all of the parenting, doing the majority of the chores, and I am tired. 

His schedule is such that he is seldom home when the kids and I are.  He kind of tries to help out, but what really needs to be done are large projects that require planning and time management, so when he’s home nothing gets done. I am sick of doing it all myself, so I get to decide between living in clutter or being his mom. 

My best friend spent the last month trying hard not to die of sepsis and other complications. Another close friend moved to Philly and ghosted me. And my other confidant is struggling with mental health so badly I don’t confide in her as she has enough on her plate. A guy also stepped in front of my car in a suicide attempt, so the last two months have been traumatic on top of all of the other crap. 

So, I’ve been escaping into romance novels lately. I want to be with someone who can pull their own weight SO badly. Someone who has their own inner strength and drive and I don’t have to feel like I have to haul it all on my own.  He is who he is and he isn’t going to change, but I also don’t want to lose my marriage.",24Nov2020,1
23,"He's my coworker, it's all very complicated, he always acts like he likes me so I sended my friend to casually ask him, she's closer to him than me so it was easy, his answer basically was that he thinks I'm pretty but he's afraid of hurting me and me quitting because of him, he said that he was an asshole and I was too good for him to fuck up. 

When he said i thought that was it, he didn't wanted anything with me and it was understandable, I thought that was my cue to get away since I got what he said and I didn't wanted that either, but then he started doing weird things. 

I hate the face cover we have to wear and I kind of complained to him about it, not thinking too much of it, then suddenly he was trying to fix some googles that he broke so I could wear them instead, he couldn't and I thought that was it, but the next day he gave me some new ones, and when I asked them where did he get them he said they were his mom's.

Yesterday I asked another coworker for a song (because we can pick our music at the store) and today he played it again, it doesn't sound like a lot, but the title is in another language and I just mentioned the artist, so not only he remembered, he also found a song that I liked just by the sound of it.

There's so much more he does but it'll be too long so I'll stop here.

Today he asked me me to buy him something in my lunch break, it was near my house and he couldn't go, so I accepted, the store he send me to didn't had what he needed so they send me to another a few blocks away, I lost 30 minutes of my lunch break because of it and i didn't cared, he gave me his number to call him in case anything happened, but I didn't, I knew he would've thanked me and told me to go back and I didn't want to. 

I felt like a dumbass... Not his fault tho, mine, why am I so willing to do everything for him? I should be this dumb. 

Also, I had a talk about this with his friend and he told me he always asks him if he likes me by the way he treats me and he has never said yes or no, just that I'm really pretty and interesting, he also encouraged me but I don't know if I want to.",24Nov2020,1

People automatically assume that if you’re right or left you are hostile or opposing. There seems to de no middle ground. I was raised very conservative. I love many of their views or values and I’ve been able to find what I hope is middle ground. I have appreciated many of the things Trump has done for the nation.

29,"So I’m writing here because I wanted to ask for perspectives; first in r/askmen, then r/askwomen, and finally in r/askwomenadvice. They got removed cause they didn’t fit the subs. So I’ve rewritten something different, that’s not as advice worded.

Basically I was hanging out with my platonic male friend on my porch the other night. It was around 1 or two a.m. when a random dude I’ve never seen walked onto my porch and said Dave had invited him. I told him no Dave lives here, he then tried to shake my friend’s hand and tried to shake mine but I told him “no dude, covid, Dave doesn’t live here you’re gonna have to go.” He was then like “well hold on a sec and let me call him” I said “Naw dude, not here, please go” he tried protesting again but I cut him off and told him to leave again. He did this time and apologized, to which I said no worries. 

When he left I was shaken and was telling my friend how weird and scary that was, that he didn’t leave immediately and even argued with me about it. My friend just said “yeah well nothing happened” I told him “I know, my fight or flight response is just fucked from having been assaulted multiple times, things like this scare me, especially when someone doesn’t listen to me”. My friend just said that I shouldn’t be so automatically scared of strangers and it’s not like it was strangers who had assaulted me.

After that I told him about how Many times I had been in dangerous situations with strange men, but yeah at least they didn’t rape me I guess?

Anyways, it just made me think about all of the other times I’ve had to try and justify my own safety measures, feelings of discomfort, or trauma responses to all the dudes in my life. I originally wanted to ask on r/askmen if any dudes had insights on this. Why do these things have to be a debate (NOT asking clarifying questions just a straight up debate). Why do I have to prove why it’s scary for me for a strange man to not leave when I ask? Why has it only been my male friends who’ve told me it’s my fault that a former friend had felt me up when I was passed out drunk. Why is it my fault when a guy I just met at a party pulled my hair in a violent way? Yes these are things I’ve had to debate with men in my life. This is the first time I’ve had to with this particular male friend, and it wasn’t even something violent, it was literally just me telling him how scary that had been.

I don’t want to make any dudes mad. I am well aware it’s not all men. I live in a liberal city that’s  relatively safe, so I’d assume it shouldn’t be very common here for men to react this way. I am just tired of feeling like I’m stupid, or overreacting, or untrustworthy because of the incredulousness I’ve been met with over the years.",24Nov2020,1

33,"So i met my friend on may 22nd. &amp; we been talking alot through snapchat. We've known each other for a year now. 
So, With us being busy with work now, We hadn't had time to hangout. &amp; Hes always says he's busy (which i understand)  - But how can i tell if he generally likes me? I understand friends invite their friends somewhere. 

But: 

Ive learned i wasn't the only ""best friend."" He has one &amp; im the 2nd. So, They went out to bowling &amp; hasn't asked if i wanted to go. So that kinda hurt. 

&amp; Texted me saying ""You're one of my best friends, But person 1 is overall my best friend."" &amp; says im the one he talks to the most. Days later, he tells me ""dude i trust you so much."" So am i just being an idiot for over reacting or is depression just kicking in for having me not believing anything (He lives 2 miles away from me, i think we're best friends, because i know his mom &amp; brother.)",24Nov2020,1
34,"They have a bizarre fixation on my niece. I know, I know, of course grandma and grandpa love their granddaughter, but, trust me, it goes way beyond that. In fact, they love her so much they even kidnapped her.

It turns out that my brother was right when he told me that he thought they were a bit weird about my niece. When my sister finally had enough of their shit and left to move in with her boyfriend they were both beyond distraught. Bawling for days, annoying the fuck out of me with stupid phone calls. My niece dropped a piece of bread on the floor before she left. My parents left it there for weeks because it reminded them of her. Fucking gross, not to mention fucking creepy as fuck. Makes my skin crawl just thinking about it.

Being the weird, creepy, psychotic people that they are they of course were scheming and plotting for a way to get my niece back, and it turned out that that involved kidnapping her. They also used this as leverage to force my sister to move back in with them. My sister should know she is not allowed to have her own life. My parents know best and they will be calling the shots even if they have to kidnap your kid to do so. I told my sister to just call the police and be done with it, but she just wasn't ready for the drama and the battle that would have entailed. 

I'm done with my parents at this point (largely because they threatened me with violence if I was there when they went to pick my sister up). The only reason they haven't tried to sabotage me so far is because they don't really care about me. If I ever have a kid I can guarantee they will suddenly have an interest in my life again. I'm not my sister, though. I have decent money, I'm squeaky clean, and I am incredibly stubborn and willing to fight (it's how I made it despite my shitty upbringing). Try and kidnap my kid and I will have no trouble hauling your ass off to jail.

35,"For the last 5 years, I have struggled greatly with self hatred. It was only after I became aware of how shitty I was that I began to deeply hate myself. I spun out into a long and painful depressive cycle but eventually bounced back from it.

It wasn't a change that happened instantly. In fact, it took me months and months to feel any better about myself, even just a small amount.

I'm doing better now than I was before, but I still have moments I reflect at who I am as a person and beat myself up over it.  There's many days that I wake up and would rather lay in bed and try to sleep through the hours instead of getting up and doing something productive.

There's days that I wake up and I'm ready to conquer the world. Yet there's still this voice in my head that tells me that I suck, that I'm not good enough. A voice that tells me that I'm a phony and nobody actually loves me.

It's difficult and sometimes my life feels like it's disconnected from my consciousness, but I make it work.

36,"Rationality is believing in the Law of Averages. Hope is believing against all odds. 

Beliefs are what you stake your life on.

The Tao is what *is.* Both hope and rationality *are*; however rationality is a methodology to understand the mechanism of objective processes—ie the functioning of what is ""out there""—while hope is the abstract ingredient X in all psychological processes which operate with bad or unascertainable odds—ie the functioning of subjectivity, of sentient consciousnesses.

The Tao is ambivalent to both. It recognizes the necessity, the being-ness of both, yet chooses no side. However, human society chooses the side of hope.

To be without hope is to have lost your humanity, society says. Are they right? Maybe. Maybe hope is the ingredient X which differentiates sentience and non-sentience. 

I... I think they might be right. That the Way makes us realize not our humanity but our animality. 

Truth will kill you—your human self, a half-truth—in the end. But it is a handshake, not a backstab.",24Nov2020,1

39,"Ever since freshman year of high school we were always a part of each other's lives. We've seen each other at our best and worst. We've been through thick and thin. Eventually it became apparent that she and I were at different points in our lives and I saw that I was holding her back. 

At some point, I had lost the passion that brought us together in the first place. While she graduated college, I dropped out to pursue something that would eventually lead to a dead end. While she began building a career for herself, I found myself stuck in a passionless, simple grocery store job. I knew she was going through life faster and I lost the drive to keep up. She stopped reciprocating affection. We were barley ever saying two sentences a day to each other. We were sleeping in the same bed, but in two different blankets

Eventually it came to a head yesterday. We were driving home from a dinner with friends and I asked her something I had been suspecting for a long time. 

""Do you love me anymore?""

 She said that she didn't love me the way she should've anymore. That she had planned on breaking up with me tomorrow. I wasn't surprised. I had seen it coming from a mile away. We got home and we spoke in the car. I told her that I had a feeling this would happen. That I would be okay. That she wouldn't need to worry about me. That I'm sure that she wouldn't be doing this if she didn't think it was the best thing for the both of us. That I wanted nothing but for her to be happy.

We're still living with each other. The contract for the apartment doesn't end until July next year. I'm currently laying on the couch typing this out. We agreed with going through the rest of the apartment lease as just roommates. 

It's hard to describe what I'm feeling right now. I feel numb, but I also feel like I could drop and cry a river at any moment. I feel calm, but I don't trust myself to get through work in the morning. I don't want her to feel guilty or sad, but at the same time I feel like screaming at her. I don't know what will happen. I don't know if I'll be able to hold together without her. I'm not sure what typing this all out will achieve. I guess I'm just trying to distract myself from thinking.

If no one had interest in me up until now despite my efforts at bettering myself and leading a good life, then it's unlikely to happen later. I don't like it, I don't want to be alone, I'm a social person and I don't see the point of leading a life alone from start to finish, but what else do I have? My choice boils down to having my hopes crushed and to stop the bleeding.

I want, just once in my life, know what it is to feel intimacy. And I have to pay for it. I failed, that's what it is is. I only wish I had realized sooner not everyone is good enough for love, I could have spent the wasted 15 years to do something better than looking for love.

A rant to my very personal defeat. I too the decision to blow my cash on prostitutes, try out drugs and alcohol and get sloshed. I never did that to stay ""clean"", but that doesn't matter if you have no one else but you to drag down.

42,"So we all know 2020 sucks. And due to covid, we are forced to stay at home. Some people get depressed, some get creative and some get lazy like me. But I somehow had a thought to learn more about myself to be more ""productive"" by doing at least something?

I started taking personality tests. I learnt about my personality and found all the flaws in it. I got frustrated as it was the exact same thing it said and I can't seem to find a way to improve on it. So I kept having flashbacks of moments that I f up sometime and started hating myself. Eventually I got over it and just moved on.

Then I realized some things are odd about me and I started looking online so see if I was different. And yes I was different, I learnt that I have phimosis and have a short frenulum too (which is common for those who have phimosis). And I got frustrated again.

It didn't just end there, I took more test and realised I have moderate dyslexia. At this point I was dumbfounded and almost went into depression. It took me a while to get over it but thankfully I got over it. I'm very grateful I didn't end up with suicide or in the hospital. Now I realised I am still better than many others that have even more serious conditions, I am now able to appreciate what I have now and just keep going on with my life.

46,"Hi everyone. I'm a 23 year old female from Australia and I'm in a season of extreme frustration right now. Essentially I'm the embodiment of failure. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 8, been 'treated' for it consistently since with no success (therapy, medication, etc.). Psychiatrists and psychologists tell me that I'm a lost cause, they tell me that they can't help me.

My main problems are

* Inability to function properly - i can't hold a job. i either get fired or get so absolutely miserable that i quit impulsively. I'm so unorganized, i lose things all the time, i'm always late. i don't know why. i mostly live in my head, i'm pretty disconnected from reality and i go into day dreaming without realizing and i'm easily distracted.
* i quit everything i start. this has been an issue since i was a little kid with sports and activities. I'd be super into it in the beginning, like sometimes to the point of obsession, then all interest would suddenly cease and i'd rather die that do it again so i would quit. When my parents forced me, I'd be an anxious mess and it felt like I was being tortures. In 5 years i have started 4 different bachelor degrees. in 8 years i have had 17 different jobs.
* I'm super impulsive. i don't think about things i do/say, i just do it. I'm especially bad with money, like i'm currently unemployed and just bought a $400 electric toothbrush simply because it lights up when you're pressing too hard. i also purchased the iphone 12 pro ($2200) and used a credit card to pay for it. money i don't have.
* I'm bored so easily and if i'm not interesting in something my brain completely shuts down but when i am interested in something i have this extreme focus. i can't maintain attention on things otherwise. I can't read long bodies of text (this post is ironic, i know), i constantly get distracted and get off track.
* i'm intelligent, but i haven't achieved much. i was always told by my teachers that i have wasted potential and that i need to apply myself more if i want to achieve anything.
* extremely low mood most all of the time. i definitely still have depression in one way or another. i feel hopeless and worthless, i have never enjoyed being alive, i don't want to be alive. But i am so tired of feeling this way
* I don't know what I want to do in life. I know this is an extremely common issue, but when it comes to figuring out a good career I literally have NO idea. I don't know who I am, I don't know what I'm good at, I don't know what I'm genuinely interested in. Every interest I have ever had has been a brief, extreme obsession that I suddenly lose interest in over night after days/weeks/months and even the thought of continuing something after it ends brings nothing but agonizing misery.
* Extreme social anxiety, i don't like being around people mostly because of how i think they will perceive me, so i avoid people all together even though i'm so lonely and want friends badly. I don't have any friends whatsoever and if I ever get the chance I either avoid getting close or sabotage things when they do start progressing so I don't have to risk being rejected or losing them.

I'm so sick of who I am. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know how to fix myself. I just want to be able to function ""normally"" - job, friends, hobbies, balance. I know this mess is all my fault. I haven't been able to find anyone who has been through something similar online so now I'm here hoping that someone deals with these same things.",24Nov2020,1

My most recent ex was really unsupportive of it and made fun of me for it, didn’t take me seriously.

My only happy place was school and now that’s shut, (i’m 17) and my home has become a sick place full of negativity and dullness. I hate being at home and having to face the same conversations and people all the time. I don’t know if things will ever get better or when, because the last 9 months have been so. It’s horrible to be like this anymore. I really wish things got better/normal faster, but everything just seems to keep going further downhill by the passage of time.

Ever since I play a little game on my pc. Spiderman, he swings over buildings. Punches people scarier than him and cracks jokes while doing it.

Or when you move onto the movies, the cartoons, comics. The representations are a dozen. Even a soda popcycle.


Something about it that I started to admire Peter Parker more than his alter ego. After all it's him who's wearing the suit.

Or maybe I grew into adulthood but still in love with the character I started to understand him more as a person. Some renditions of him is a student while the others are struggling adult. But his situations were relatable always.


He misses sleep, gets hurt in combat, thinks ahead of people much bigger and stronger, gets called a menace by a hitler worshipper, has a second social life which is just as problematic as the first and still no matter what this guy goes through, he always comes back

I've seen so many great things in the character's off mask existence that are inspirational. Not to mention the iconic outfits that unconsciously find myself wearing. Minus the suit of course

Yet, those are the things I dreamed of having. I dreamed of a simple life, where I had a good enough job to live off of, a handful of close friends, and a cool woman to settle down with.

If I don’t get this off my chest it’ll haunt me for the rest of my life, I don’t care if you don’t accept it; I just need someone to listen. For those who want to get to the part where my life gets absolutely train wrecked, skip 9 paragraphs.

Hi, I’m a New Zealand High-schooler that lives in Australia, I’m about 14-16 and if you really want to know so bad, I’m 6’5 and I weigh 117KG, I have Autism and ADHD (although you never asked). I know she’ll find this post so I’m just gonna say hi while I’m at it. Hi!

About a year ago I was at a school camping trip and all the people in different home rooms were told to hang out with the other home rooms, so me and my friend meet up and we talk about PC stuff like us Nerds do. After we ate our lunch and hung out we just started chilling, laying down, looking at the trees, clouds and laughing at jokes like friends do. We were laughing it out for a solid 10 minutes until I see a girl from a different home room that I’ve never seen in my life, she just came over and hung with us we were exchanging jokes, names the like and we went on with our day, now at the time I didn’t find much interest in the girl I just thought she was nice and sweet and wasn’t one of those bitches that bully people because their a famous kids side hoe. 

The next day me and my friend do what we do every day, be friends. After we’ve eaten and laughed our asses off this girl comes back and starts hanging out with us again, I didn’t mind because hey, more friends, that’s brilliant! Anyways over the months I became more accustomed to her and we became friends of sorts, I never felt anything for her because even though she was nice, meaningful and had such nice expressions she never hit any of those feeling spots.

well I could say that changed because the next time she was hanging out with us and our friend group I was talking and she wrapped her hands around my chest and told me to be quiet so she could talk and I mean she muffled her face right in my gut, and I’ve never been hugged by a girl because I’m a fucking loser that spends more time listening to Joji then actually do something with my life, and I just felt this click and I’m like “this girl is hitting on me” and what do you know she’s blushing... so I do what any normal person would do: Take it as a friendly joke and laugh about it, well boy was I fucking wrong let me tell you what was going through my head later that night: 

Me: *listening to Joji* “Man today sure was great, got my assignment in on time without being a murdered and got to hang out with my friends”

Me: “and that girl is pretty nice to me and she even hu- hold on a second”

Me: *pauses Joji* “was this girl hitting on me? Holy shit she was, well fuck”


The next few days are the same just hanging out with my friends but I’m talking and focusing more on the girl because I’m genuinely starting to catch feelings 

Fast forward to Christmas holidays and we chat on discord, I’m saying like 5 hours in a DM FaceTime. Men and Woman, listen I’m about to tell you something you should never do when you want to ask someone you love out, NEVER ASK SOMEONE OUT ONLINE NEVER EVER EVER, I should’ve become more accustomed and closer to her instead of doing it on the bat, this was never my first relationship but this one felt different like I was actually connecting with her but noooooo! I had to be a greedy fucking asshole and ask her out, online of all places, while only knowing her for a couple months at best. Looking back at this I’m actually surprised but she actually said yes, I’m telling you this monitor to monitor she said yes, but don’t worry the next couple of paragraphs will make my life miserable.

For the people that skipped the prologue here’s a tl;dr:
Started hanging out with this girl, she was nice over the months she became attached to me and I felt the same so I asked her out too early and now the next paragraph is where I get fucked.

Hello, here’s what I came here to get off my chest. Listen I would give this girl everything she would ask for, if she wanted to hug I would hug I would coddle her in my arms and I would comfort her when she was being bullied and I just over all tried my best she was the best woman ever, if I were to pick a goddess I would pick her because she is absolutely pure, wholesome, loving, kind, cool, interesting and just overall fun to be with. I never pushed things too far and when she wanted space I would give her some. She inspired me to work out, do fitness and make a diet and I got into basketball, I used to look into her eyes and tell her she was beautiful (couldn’t say the same for me), we still talked like friends but I got a peak into her personal life and I was sad, I don’t want to share too much but she would be bullied and other stuff and I would cry every night because I knew I couldn’t do anything about this, I tried please I just tried my best but... I’m a loser as always. I would wake up look in the mirror and just cry, it got to the point where, every-time I saw her I got this massive weight of guilt on me saying I could never help myself or her even if I tried my absolute best. The relationship only lasted two months... she said that I never helped her with my problems (she obviously meant more than that but I want to protect her personal life, family was putting pressure on her and so was school life).it felt like a fucking train, I cried all night no sleep, just when I was happy without the big hole in my chest, it was never her fault I’m not putting the blame on her it’s all my fault, it’s my fault because I pushed our relationship too far it was on the edge to begin with, it was and is my fault still my fault. I try to look at myself in the mirror but I can’t do it I feel cold, empty, every-time I wake up I lay in a puddle of my own sweat and tears. If she’s ever reading this I just want to say sorry please I don’t want to get back with you I just want to say sorry for everything that I’ve done and I’ve been a douchebag and I’ve been a dick but I just want to say sorry. Just please all I want is your forgiveness. Sorry if you’ve got the misfortune of reading this random redditor... I just need someone else to feel my emo pain lmao.

My grandfather (my dad's dad) died in a coal boat explosion in 1969. He was a coal boat mechanic, and my dad was 18 at the time. What I also know about him was that he wasn't the best father. He was super smart, mechanically, but his interactions with his children and wife was dampened by his abuse of alcohol, his temper, and a myriad of other things. 

My dad and mom had me in 1986. Throughout my life my dad has made a plethora of comments saying that I remind him a lot of his own father (good and bad traits).  I could go through the list of similarities but I won't. 

What if I'm just my grandfather, reincarnated as my father's son, in some sort of universal cosmic redemption story to right all the wrongs I did in a previous life? And if my Dad dies before I have a son, would my dad then become my son?  ( I am currently childless)",24Nov2020,1
71,"so I’ve been talking to this guy on Snapchat for over 2 months... He is in the military and he came home for the holidays. He has been home for a week now and hasn’t asked to hangout? 
I was really looking forward in seeing him but with him dragging to reply just makes me feel that he doesn’t care to see me because he also doesn’t bring up the fact that we had planned on seeing each other. 
I’ve been debating whether to shoot him a text saying  “Yooooo, are we hanging out or what, if not so I could just not waste my time” 
But then again, I donn’t want to bring up the topic of hanging out now cus it’s been a week since he has been home and he hasn’t said anything ?? I feel stupid

74,I’m a junior in high school and I’ve been struggling since day one of freshman year. I hate my school with a passion and I’ve tried transferring multiple times but nothing came of it. I’ve just been dragging myself through every year but this year has been the worst by far. Because of all the restrictions for COVID the school has basically become a prison and just being there drains me of any motivation. I’m mentally ill and I’m on IEP and take medication for it but nothing is working. I have finished barely any assignments this year and I feel like I’m too far behind to even attempt to try and catch up.

I have never learned how to love myself. I look for validation from outside people and events and that’s how I determine my self worth. 

And as of this moment, I have never hated myself so much. 

I am zero fun to be around, save for the brief and shallow encounters when “catching up” with old acquaintances or strangers in passing. I can barely muster the energy for those types of pleasantries. 

I am so full of anger and fear and sadness and spite. And...well, I’m hurt. And hurting. And I’ll be damned if it didn’t take a flipping pandemic and months of isolation to realize just how much I hate my own company.

78,"I met my fiancé in 2014 at work. We were both massage therapists and dating other people at the time. Both in toxic and abusive relationships. It helped us bond to have someone to confide in when things weren’t that great. We were still just friends. Didn’t even view him that way. Eventually he left for another job but I wasn’t allowed to get his number to keep in touch because of our significant others. In fact when he added me on Facebook he told me his gf fought with him and pushed him down a flight of stairs. Mine shoved me and punched a wall. 

He ended up coming back to massage some time later and he had actually left his girlfriend. After about a year or so, he told me he had feelings for me but understood I was still in a relationship. I told him I didn’t feel the same and we stayed friends. I finally got the courage to leave my boyfriend of 6 years. 6 months later I agreed to go on a date with my now fiancé. I still didn’t really like him that way but turns out, I did. Once I let myself realize I deserved better...I realized it was him. 

We have been together since 2017. Got engaged in 2019. It’s by far the best decision I ever made! Today we signed our marriage license, it will be officiated Dec. 5th and world circumstances allowing - we will have our big ceremony and reception next Halloween! 

Basically a long post to say that I’m happy as heck. 

I came from this terrible, abusive, destructive, and horrid relationship that almost killed me. I didn’t think I deserved better. I was broken. - Now I’m happy and in this healthy relationship where I love myself and love him. It can be done!

85,"I just got a really odd message from a stranger on Facebook telling me I should ask my dad about “his felony” and my “new stepmom about all her past affairs.” Then he goes on to say how terrible a friend my dad is. How could he do this to a life-long friend aka the man my stepmom apparently wronged. “[Insert ex’s name] was such a good guy! He even defended your dad when you bashed him on Facebook.”

Somehow at first, I truly believed that this was a message from an angry friend. I knew all the things in the message were from her ex’s warped, abusive perspective, but then my dad was like “No, that’s just one of his aliases....”

Like what?!

And I’m just so angry! How entitled could an individual be?!

By stepmom was H-O-T back in the day and still is, so yeah, the second she and her ex-husband divorced, she got a ton of messages from guys she knew back in the day. One of them was this crazy dude who she only said yes to at first because she felt bad. But then he seemed like he’d really changed from high school, but she was wrong and they broke up.

Then my dad, soon after, saw her at some restaurant in their hometown. They talked, she told him about her recent breakup, and he apologized but she was like “No, it’s a good thing, trust me!” So they became friends again and he eventually asked her out. She said yes, and a year-and-a-half later, they’re newly engaged and I’ve never seen him so happy. 

But this dude....this dude is trying to mess it all up for them out of jealousy. He doesn’t love her. If he did, he’d let her go and be happy with my dad. But instead, he bought a house on her street, and constantly drives by her and her daughter’s house. Oh! And he has a very large gun collection :)

And my dad and him? Weren’t even that good of friends! They went to high school together THIRTY-FIVE YEARS AGO. They were pretty much only facebook friends, because until my stepmom started dating my dad, this dude lived three hours away.

And speaking of facebook! You may be wondering why he defended me from my dad! Well! My dad and I have pretty different political beliefs, though he does usually tend to come around eventually. And a few years ago, when I was a freshman in college, he said something on Facebook specifically about me and my beliefs that really hurt my feelings. So I responded and it turned into a Facebook fight between me an my dad that all his friends could see. But I only did this because I didn’t feel like my dad was being fair and I was tired of all the people agreeing with him. So then, this totally random fifty-year-old man who I’ve never met before, decides to start commenting about how I need to learn some respect, blah, blah, blah. So, I, responded and i don’t remember exactly what it was, but the spirit of it was “gtfo here you stupid boomer” (though I said it in a nicer way).

So yeah. I was being obnoxious, but it’s facebook. Everyone is obnoxious and I was still a kid and he was a fully-developed adult. Plus....my dad was handling the confrontation a lot better before that he got involved, because I don’t like being told what to do, especially by bald old conservatives, and so I lowkey became much more triggered. 

Anyway. The point of this post is to say fuck this guy and anyone else who thinks they can mess with my family. Like his entire plan has just backfired because now there’s just more 

And also I’m thinking about catfishing him with my friends. Maybe he’d have less time to drive past their house then.....",24Nov2020,1

87,"Shoshana Barzilai (1925-2020)

Today, a Holocaust survivor, my grandmother, passed away at the age of 96 years old.

For the vast majority of her life, more than seven decades, she went under the name of Shoshana. This was the name I knew her under, but it is not the one she was born with. Vera Fried, as she was called during her first two decades, was a strong woman - you need to be, to continue living during and after the atrocities of the Holocaust.

Vera (sometimes affectionately called Verushka) was born in Nitra, a small village in Czechoslovakia. She grew up with a love  for ice skating - the nearby lake would freeze for much of the year. Of her extended family, only she and her mother survived the Holocaust. Her mother later remarried, and her step-sister still lives today in Slovakia.

I regret to say I don't have too much to tell you about how she survived the Holocaust. I never asked enough questions, because to me, she was my grandmother, someone who'd I known all my life; that is how I saw her. Still, I recall several things she's told me. Not enough for a coherent story, unfortunately - but hopefully enough to remnisce about her to those who have not had the pleasure of meeting ner.

I know she was on a train towards one of the camps, and she managed to pry one of the windows open and jump out. The train was moving at full speed, in a snow-filled winter.

I know she boarded a refugee ship to Israel on her lonesome, separate from my late Grandfather (also a survivor). Imagine taking a ship to a different continent alone, knowing that you might be turned back on arrival if you get caught. I remember once, my grandmother told me that one of the sailors on the ship was making numerous untoward advances on her - she slapped him, she told me with a twinkle in her eyes, and after that he shied away from her.

I know she served in the military, folding parachutes for the paratroopers - a job that might seem uninteresting at first - until you learn that a single innacurate or improper fold would lead to a paratrooper's death, if the parachute can't open properly.

I know she started and raised a family in a new country, in a different continent. She arrived penniless and with nobody save my grandfather.

I wish I remembered more - I wish I knew the things nobody has ever thought to ask, but I don't. What I don't remember will hopefully surface some day, either in my thoughts or in my conversations with those who knew her.

All my life I've dated mentally ill women. I don't know what it is, but every longterm girlfriend I've ever had has had severe mental illness. The girl I'm dating now just told me she's severely depressed and struggles with suicidal ideation and I'm at a breaking point. 

Years of talking women I'm dating out of suicide, spending hours holding them during a panic attack, convincing them out of decisions they make while manic, calling social workers to prevent them from hurting themselves, cleaning their apartments because they're too depressed to clean up themselves, forcibly taking them to therapy appointments. 

It's all so tiring. 

People with mental illness deserve love too, but I can't do this anymore. Why is it every woman I start get serious with? There's never been an exception to this. My parents are worried that I'm seeking out mentally ill women but I swear I'm not. 

Now this girl I'm currently dating, I don't know what I'm going to do. Dump her because she's suicidal? That's terrible.

91,"32 years old have a rare immune deficiency called cvid. I caught Covid last month despite the fact I don’t really go anywhere cause i work from home and my wife just had a baby late September and also was working from home. 

I spent 5 days in hospital with Covid pneumonia and have fully recovered. It’s been almost 2 months now. They gave me an antibody treatment and redsimir. The redsimir started making me feel better before they gave me the antibody treatment so idk what actually was responsible for my improvement.

My wife and mom had a stuffy nose and stomach issues for about a week but are fine now. Out of my 3 very young kids only my son who is 4 had a random fever twice at night and it was barely 100. 

Everyone is fine now and I in fact feel just as good as before Covid. Have absolutely zero problems after.

The worst part about the experience is spending way too much time on Reddit reading the countless horror stories about you possibly dying. After the experience and now having immunity for an unknown amount time I have to admit it’s been a huge relief in my life. I can go more places and I can take my kids to have more fun than usual.

Like... Jesus christ. Are you like that in real life? I'm listening to my partner player overwatch and this dude is screaming stuff like ""SHUT YOUR DIRTY CUNT MOUTH"" ""YOU FUCKING USELESS SHIT PEOPLE"" etc. We were playing last night and like 3 games had at LEAST one person screaming like this.

You see the same in most competitive games... like WHY? Who hurt you? Why does a video game inspire such malignancy in some people? I can get mad too- i think thats normal. We're all trying to win, and in ranked I think a sense of seriousness and urgency is necessary... but Jesus fucking christ. I really don't think its normal or healthy for people to be getting so angry like this.

Can you imagine acting like this irl? You'd lose all your friends and colleagues for that kind of behaviour. You'd be seen as some sort of mentally ill psycho.  

Dunno what I'm asking or wanting here but... just... why? Every time I ask someone raging like that why I get some variation of ""because its ranked, if you're not here to win then fuck off!"" But that never really answers the question- We DO want to win. Winning or losing doesn't justify saying such vile reprehensible garbage to other human beings. I can take the game seriously without telling someone to kill themselves when they don't play as well as I want them too. If anything screaming and raging just distracts folks like me, or demoralized your teammates so you're actively hurting your chances of winning by forcing your team to listen to you scream and rant about how shit everyone is.

104,"Well, I began my abortion process today. In Australia, you can take the abortion pill or have the surgical procedure depending on your gestation period. I have opted for the pill option. Today, I had my first pill. The first pill stops the pregnancy hormone feeding to the cell in order for it to continue growing. Tomorrow, I take four more tablets which induces the miscarriage.

I am currently six weeks pregnant. The pregnancy was a result of a one night stand and I didn’t keep contact with the person I hooked up with.

I 100% back my decision of terminating. I never thought twice about it. It’s not the right time in my life, my career is about to kick off, and I’m just not ready for children just yet.

I was chatting with my ex because we still are trying to be friends like before with little to no luck.

I never thought something as simple as just having someone to tell him all the things bothering you and how you felt internally would have such a great impact on you so fast.

Im really looking forward continuing my therapy with him and hopefully he wil help me help myself.",24Nov2020,1
125,"Long story short. I work in a hospital, a friend of my boyfriend and his girlfriend are having a baby soon. She came to see us at our hospital and was tested positive for HIV but refuses to tell him. 🤦🏽‍♀️ he is a good friend of ours. What should I do. I feel so bad knowing this and he has no clue. What should I do??!!",24Nov2020,1
126,"Currently a Freshman in college. I know that I am an intelligent young man, but I really really let myself down. I have missed multiple assignments, and I lack self discipline. I often find myself procrastinating and have problems in planning stuff out and remembering the dates. Unless something drastic happens, I probably will end up having to stay an extra year at my satellite campus. I was really hoping on making it into the main campus and this makes me feel really down, especially because its all my fault. On top of this, I am extremely insecure about my physically appearance. No so much face, but rather my body. I am 5'9 and still relatively skinny. I have no abs whatsoever and I have not been able to workout much recently. I feel as if this places me at a disadvantage when it comes to girls, and I am still a virgin and never had a girlfriend.",24Nov2020,1
127,"My bother even said ""I keep forgetting it's Covid time"" and yet is still having a big get together with most of the rest of the family. I just don't get the stupidity.

We told him we won't be attending any big get togethers until Covid is over. But they're still going on with theirs.  Should be 15-20 inside a medium sized house, no masks and I guarantee you there are people there who never wear a mask. What a shit show.",24Nov2020,1

132,"My friend shares a child with a man. They never were in a relationship, they just have a kid together. The kid is a 12-year-old boy and had hair down to his shoulders. Neither of the parents had a problem with that. The kid is flunking his classes.

One weekend while his dad had him, the kid didn't want to do his school work. To punish him, the dad made him cut his hair short. I'm friends with the mom and when I asked her she said she thought it wasn't a good punishment but it was his dad's weekend so she didn't protest.

Number 1: Isn't that kind of a crazy punishment? I know it's not abusive, it just seems really weird and controlling to take control of your child's body as a punishment.

Number 2: I haven't really wanted to see my friend since. Spineless people annoy me, and not only was she spineless but she let the dad do something she thought was wrong to their kid. Any advice for me to see past this? Or should I just forget the friendship?",24Nov2020,1
