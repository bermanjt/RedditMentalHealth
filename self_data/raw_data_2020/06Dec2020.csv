0,"I dyed my hair, wearing false tan (F23) not letting my nails look bad, need new clothes. Still don’t feel good enough visually an I was in total admiration with myself before. It’s helped a bit cos I’ve glown up a bit but I still don’t look right. Anyone else felt like this an did the feeling stop?",06Dec2020,1
1,"I want to be a happy, six year old little girl with pigtails and cute plaid skirts. I want to wake up in my old bedroom, and go on the computer with the blocky keyboard. I want to eat on blue and purple plastic kid plates. I want to roll around on the soft carpet  and play Wii Sports Resort. I want to make little storybooks with marker drawings. I want to be in kindergarten, with the rainbow carpet and the neon colored stools and play with the blocks used for counting. I want to run around on the playground, with seagulls flying around the tan and blue school. I want to get along with all of my classmates because we're young and don't have the ability to hate anything yet. I want to secretly dance to Adele and Taylor Swift and Katy Perry on the radio. I want to go to Disneyland with my family, and have them record me smiling and walking with my wobbly-kid steps. I want my family to put a camera on me for the smallest things, like making cookies or eating an apple. I want to sit in my room for hours with my Littlest Pet Shops and wooden animal figures making up stories. I want to have wide eyes on Christmas morning, or run around on Halloween, reveling in the magic of the season. I want to lay in the sun, on the cool grass, excited for my future, daydreaming of all the cool things I'll do. 

Wow, the last line hit me hard. I'm not that little girl anymore. If I was able to meet that girl, I have no idea if she'd be proud of me or disappointed. I'm certainly not proud of myself. I wish I had known just how good I'd had it back then.",06Dec2020,1
2,"Like many others my age, I graduated Highschool in the middle of the pandemic in Poland. Although numbers were comparatively low at first, Poland went straight into lockdown and I spent six weeks entirely at home, seeing only my boyfriend for one day. From March until May, social gatherings were so restricted that I developed quite a severe form of social anxiety and depression, as I rely on social interaction quite a bit to keep my mental health issues at bay. In June and July I enjoyed a few restricted meetings with my friends, as the numbers went down a lot during the summer and I even went on a social distance holiday abroad. I felt so happy for these small, restricted things, because I had been deprived for months on end. 

During the springtime, everyone was still scared and followed  the restrictions (for the most part), so I felt like everyone was going through the same shit as me. But alas, the second wave that hit Europe in October proved to be very different. I started university in Germany and almost all of my fellow students regularly party at home or in the dorms, irrespective of the new lockdown. While I, too, can understand bending the rules a little bit, I think parties are incredibly irresponsible. 

I feel really angry, because this pandemic took so much from me (my graduation, the after parties, my pre-uni summer, my first semester, freshman week, etc etc etc), but I endured all that, because I have to. And I want to. It sucks, but I am scared too for my health and that of people close to me. I can't even bear the thought of infecting someone else, because of my irresponsible behaviour. And it angers me that I have to keep on waiting, making no friends at uni, sacrificing moments and events in my life that would be important to me and battling mental illness because of my isolation, while listening to the party noises in the dorm rooms next to mine. 

Does anyone feel the same? 

Disclaimer: I understand of course that I am still incredibly privileged during this crisis and have had a much better experience than many others. I am very grateful for that. I just needed a space to vent and find support in this community.",06Dec2020,1
3,I only washed them because his dad was coming over and I didn’t want his dad to think we were dirty. Granted a I let a lot of house chores slide because we are not sparkly clean ppl but I care what his parents think. I even scrubbed a bathroom in case his dad needed to use it. I don’t generally care that much about what ppl think- more like I do but I tell myself it doesn’t matter that much. But his parents opinions matter to me because he’s important to me and I want them to feel like he’s in good hands. Even tho I am not on the same page as them on other things that are very divisive we have common ground that we love my fiancé. But my fiancé noticed that I scrubbed the trash can clean and thought it was dumb. But 1 it needed to be done and 2 I didn’t want it looking like that if his dad saw it. While he and his das worked on their project he didn’t eat or drink all day so he got a headache but his health is generally not the best so we are all more precious about it then he is which is very annoying to him. I warned his mother that he needed to eat when they left because he refused lunch and she asked me to take his temperature when he got home which I knew he wouldn’t let me. I let her know that I made the bed for him and got the room warm and had his dinner ready when he got home if he didn’t eat at theirs. He would be think this is all dumb. But we love him so much. And I feel close to my to soon to be in laws because we love him so much. I have to bite my tongue around them a lot but I still think they are good ppl. We can overcome our differences but a lot of that is my fiancé and I letting their political opinions slide off our shoulders. But I’ll be damned if they see my dusty trash can.,06Dec2020,1

All US enemies would be together include China, so covid won't went out it to the rest of the world, and if covid was made in lab or something it would be sent directly to US and the army doctors will take the charge of it, so it will end quickly (everything the army do for some reason they do it better)

5,"Ever thought of how a the tiniest decision could shape a future? How it can literally made you who you are today?

One a monday night years ago, i made the simples decision on whether or not i should go drinking with my buddies or not. At that time i was working as personal financial advisor for almost a year after getting my diploma. Me and my buddies don't usually hand out on work night but that particular night one of my friend contact me at 3am past midnight ask me if im down for a drink. I have to go to work at 8am. Usually i would decline. You might be asking why am i not sleeping right? Well ever seem like forever i have trouble sleeping, i never consult any doctor or anything because i think i just not that big of a deal. So there i am sitting in my room thinking about that offer to go out for a drink. For over 30min i think about an excuse to just decline the offer but somehow i got the feeling that i need to go. I say ""fuck work tomorrow . Lil of drink wouldn't hurt and i couldn't sleep anyway"". In my car on the way to the where our usual place to drink i think about my work and my current situation. It's not like i have a bad job or anything. I just that sometimes the job is not great, not bad either but just ordinary. I would do the same routine every day. I don't hate it but i don't love it.

As i arrive, i saw 2 of my best bud sitting at our usual table at our usual shop. That night a little different because we would usually have 6 people with us but that night is just the 3 of us friends. Other 3 of our friends decide not to come. You guys know how a big group of friends usually have small group in them right? That night i with 2 of the most longest people i know in my life. We had drink and we talk after talk and talk. Just best friend having the best time. Topic after topic. Then we got into a topic about further our study to bachelor degree. Honestly i been thinking about it too. I just never talk to anyone about it.

Both of them already made the decision and plan about it a long time ago. The reason they ask me to hang out is a way of parting. They both already apply to college and waiting for acceptance. Out of curiosity i ask them how to apply, what and what not to do during the process. After that we all go home and go on our daily life

2 days after that i couldn't sleep. I decide to go see sunrise at a beach 30min from where i live. My plan is to wait for sunrise, after that go jogging and had breakfast and then get home take shower and head to work. While sitting at the beach i smoke a roll of weed and just sitting there thinking. My thoughts keep coming to whether i should continue my study or not. To cut things short here i am final year of my studies.

This year is really hard for me. I know it hard for alk of us because of what going on in the world. I lost my grandmother this year, my girlfriend left me, im broke and literally have zero income. All the online class stressing me and it getting harder for me to sleep. Im tired.

I been thinking of that night. That small decision whether or not to go out for a drink. That night if i didn't go out wouldn't think about study. I will still have my job. I will probably getting promoted or get a even bigger opportunity at other job or company. I would have spent my time in my city, near my family. I would have more time with my grandmother. I wouldn't have to meet my girlfriend (now ex girlfriend). I would skip all the heart break and just live a simple ordinary life.

I keep thinking if that simple decision shape today reality, what other simple decision that i miss? Or decide that could change something.

The uncertainty of the future. The endless possibility. Different path and the lost cause that could have been successful.

I'm so tired of feeling like this. I just wanted to rest. I want to feel nothing. I want to not think about anything. I want to have clear mind.

This is what i been dealing. I have no one to share this with. I am writing this in hope that it can lessen the baggage that i carry.

Happy weekend everyone!",06Dec2020,1

9," Hey guys, I need advice regarding a personal family issue that needs to be looked at from different perspectives. So, I'm going to try to keep this short as I can without leaving out important details regarding the situation. The issue is regarding my mom, my grandma, and my aunts. My mom has been asking for more support from my two aunts for my grandma, she is in her 70s and is suffering from Parkinson's and is in the early stages of dementia. My grandmothers mental health has been deteriorating throughout the decade, and the past few years have been rough on my mom given that she is her caretaker.

My mom, step dad, and two little brothers have had to learn on the job as her condition worsens, doctors and family members close to us have told all three daughters that it needs to be an equal effort in order for them to be able to tackle this situation in the best way. However, both my aunts(One lives 5 min away driving, the other a couple of states away), have been neglectful of how my mom is feeling going through this and its been affecting her life. My grandma is very difficult to manage, and is at risk of hurting herself on a weekly basis.

My grandmother want's to leave the house everyday, but my mom can't take her because 1(She works from home and my step dad takes the car for work) 2(They live in a highly populated area, where COVID cases have been spiking) 3(My mom is working and watching my brothers as they do online school). She is constantly at risk of escaping because she gets too anxious and leaves their apartment, they've had issues with other tenants because she is asking them for rides and has been caught sneaking into our neighbors home. She is at risk of her hurting herself(Rushes down the apartment stairs, crosses streets in traffic. And lastly, the kids have had to witness and deal with some of her episodes and its been traumatic for them.

My family and I understand my grandmas situation, and we've supported her all the way and continue to do so. We feel as though the ones who don't seem to understand how complicated this really is are my aunts, each time my mom has asked for their support they get defensive and disregard her and hows she's been handling all this. It's been difficult on her, and it's been taking a toll on her mental health and the kids as well, overall this is a mess. And I do want to say that YES they do help out, just not as much as they should. The oldest one lives states away, and calls my grandma on a weekly basis and helps out financially, but she she offers little emotional support to my mom and my gets the most defensive about this. The youngest lives in the same area, only shows up every now and then, and like my mom has two kids/job, but has excuses to why shes never around and says that my mom needs to complain less.

I'm tired of them pointing fingers and neglecting the reality of the situation, I just want them to do whats right for everyone...especially my mom. I don't know what to tell my mom anymore, because I've tried talking to my aunts in the past but it's always the same BS. Other things i'd like to put out there is that my mom moved in with my grandma over a decade ago, but its under my mom/step dads name and they've been paying the bills for years and never asked my grandma for financial help. You cannot take her out without keeping an eye on her, she WILL run off without telling anybody(store, party, etc..). My Mom does everything for my grandma, cooks and buys her food, helps with her laundry, handles her medications and appointments and has been her emotional support throughout most of this. We have tried looking for an at home nurse for her, buts it way too expensive to pay out of pocket and her insurance wont send anyone since my mom is there).

I know this isn't easy for my grandma, its been a nightmare actually, seeing her like this. But, like her, my family and I are in disbelief of how fast the disease has progressed and are struggling to find a way to deal with this as it develops. No, we will not put her in a retirement home.

14,"I recently read about a man named Mirko Novansky. He looks like a stereotypical nerd in his photos (he has a Facebook, and I checked it out). According to the article, a police officer chased him and grabbed him from behind. The two of them both ended up on the floor face down and that's then Novansky wrapped his thighs around the police officer's neck and began to squeeze him, which made the officer ''gasp for air''. The police officer could only let out grunts and groans to alert his collegue that he was in danger. His collegue got Novansky off of him, but the officer, who weighed 5 stone heavier than Novansky, sustained damage to his windpipe and was traumatized by the incident.

The type of hold is called a 'scissor hold' or 'headscissors hold'.

Would it be possible for a nerd like Novansky to wrap his thighs around someone's neck, to the point they cannot breathe, and then hold it there until the person literally suffocates? Has it ever happened before?

I don't mean choking someone out, making them pass out in seconds. I mean actually restricting a person's ability to breathe in air, like a snake.",06Dec2020,1
15,"So yeah as the title says, my da had a heart attack last week, just got 2 stents put in yesterday. 

I’ve been in a daze all week pretty much, no history of this and never any serious ailments. Top guy, always out and about and it’s just hit me like a tonne of bricks.

This may come across wrong but I wasn’t sad, more scared. People who have lost, or grown up without parents are some of the strongest around and when I heard the news I’ve never felt so weak.

He is home now and well (as well as you can be), I’m just wondering if any of you had any experiences similar to this? And how you dealt with it for you and whoever suffered.

16,"I've never really had a problem with anxiety before. But recently I feel like everything is falling apart even though it's not. I've got a d&amp;d night that I have to plan for tomorrow night, I need to find a job that offers health insurance and even though I'm 26 I still have no prospects besides delivery driving.

 My hands are literally shaking and I can't take a smooth breath. My mind is a fog that won't clear. Everytime I go to my laptop I freeze, Everytime I go to the indeed app, I freeze. Something is stopping me from doing anything productive in my life. I'm terrified that this will continue to spiral out of control.

17,"I consider myself a very self-aware person. I can see the places in my life that I hold myself back and I know that im doing it but I dont know how to change it. I think part of the problem is that I have trouble trusting myself due to the conditioning I received in my childhood. I was always told what I was doing wrong but never told what I was doing right. So I constantly doubt myself. I also learned not to express my emotions or ask for ""too much"" because that's unacceptable. As a kid I recognized this treatment was wrong but every time I attempted to speak up about it, my parents instantly silenced me and had little tolerance for what I had to say. 

its no surprise that as a result, I have trouble speaking up for myself. I struggle expressing myself and appear rigid/cold to other people. I have a hard time making new friends and just stick with the ones I have had since childhood because its comfortable. when i'm in a uncomfortable situation I over-rationalize my behavior to deal with my anxiety instead of admitting the real reason why I acted a certain way (even though deep down I know why).

I want to be the type of person who believes in their convictions. The type of person who faces conflict and knows that they can defend themselves no matter how overwhelming their emotions get. The type of person who effortlessly expresses themselves without having to think about it. The type of person that other people respect because they respect themselves. The type of person who has a strong sense of identity and stays true to their values. 

I know I have the capability of being the person that I want to be because I can literally FEEL a part of myself that is just waiting to be expressed but this part of me is almost out of reach because of how long its been repressed. I guess what im trying to say is that im having trouble bridging the gap between who I am and who I know I can be.

19,"This was way out of character for him, especially since our kids were in the room (luckily they didn't see). We teach our kids constantly not to point it at living things, so for him to do this was confusing. 

He does have some low level anxiety, and he did have to have an emergency dental procedure today (he's neglected his oral hygiene since childhood and HATES the dentist), so I know that's been heightening his anxiety.

But for him to do that. Even with a toy. To look me dead in the eye. I want to throw up and cry and I don't even know what to do or say. 

I asked him why he did that and if that was how he felt and if he truly understood the weight of what he did. He said he was just joking (a VERY out of character joke) and it's okay because it wasn't loaded.

20,"There are exceptions to this, like tacos, fried chicken, and normal finger foods are fine, but seeing people eat straight from containers, or without silverware bugs me.

Watching TV, and a dad and his two sons are all eating from an ice cream cartoon with spoons. I hate that, for some reason. Eating straight from the peanut butter jar, drinking straight from the 2 litter soda bottle, or cereal box makes me sad.

If I get a bag of chips that only I like, and know I'll eat all of them myself, it doesn't bother me to eat straight from the bag. If it's a huge family size bag of chips that'll be shared with others in the house, I'd prefer to use a bowl.

It's not that I'm worried about the germs. It just makes me feel kinda sad for some reason I can't put my finger on. I prefer for popcorn time to include multiple bowls, or containers, too. If I'm sitting right next to the person with the tub, it's okay to grab as a group I guess, but sitting across the room, I'd like to see each person get a container of popcorn.

I'm not one of those odd types that uses a fork for pizza, and a lot of cooked meats are fine to hold in the hands for eating, especially if you use napkins once you've gotten chicken or pork chops all over your hands.

I've seen some weird stuff with people that don't use silverware, though. I met a woman while I was homeless, and she and I were both in our 30s at the time. We dated, and were together for six years before it fell apart. But when we first met, she would eat a lot of things without silverware. Since we were both homeless at the time, I figured it was out of necessity, because a lot of improvisations must be made when you don't have a place to keep normal household items.

After we got an apartment together, this woman still chose to eat with her hands, and straight from containers. She would squeeze pudding cups and eat from it without a spoon, then scrape it out with her finger, and lick the finger. She actually ate green beans with her hands, and no fork. I tried to avoid being judgemental, but now I don't care. I would tell anyone that I can't handle watching that, and probably walk away. I could probably never date someone with these habits again.

Maybe it all just reminds me of poverty, homelessness, and lonely desperation, because like I said, it's not the germs, and I'm not super formal. I just have this weird pet peeve, now. I did some of this stuff myself as a kid, but I was never attached to these habits. Now, I can't stand it. Even if I want to eat dry cereal, I want to pour some out into a baggie, bowl, or something. Bowls and silverware are almost kind of comforting to use. 

If this dies in new, that's understandable and fine. Weird, unimportant issue that it is, it's not like anyone *needs * this post. I just felt like writing it out.",06Dec2020,1

I had biked out to the grocery store to pick up a few small things. While I was unlocking my bike to head back, some old lady with a buncha flyers came up to me acting painfully enthusiastic telling me about some charity bullshit you could tell was just tryna milk people's money.

As per usual routine I tried to pass her off, but she kept on making up stories trying to get me to pay her $100. No really.

I decided to just say fuck it and I hopped on my bike and was about to ride off. Bitch grabs my handlebar, still having that fake smile on her face telling me why I should fork over money to her. I kneeled off the bike, pointed my swiss army knife at her and told her ""Fuck off right now.""

24,"Hello, Reddit! I like to follow the relationship advice and mental health subreddits, because I am someone who spent a LOT of time struggling. And I still struggle. I want to share this with you all because I feel like it would be a helpful tool for other people—because it was for me!

I see a lot of people—especially young people—lonely, isolated, generally bent out of shape and sometimes abused. They, like everyone else, want to be accepted and loved and cared for, but often find themselves being taken advantage of, not shown consideration, and are left beating themselves up over relationships that are better left behind.

My life is not yet where I would like it to be, but the question that allowed me to start turning things around was simply:

“Does this person have my best interests at heart?”

If the question is no, cut them loose. If you have not been given reason to believe that the people around you want good things for you, then they are a waste of your time, energy, and attention. And I don’t mean that people have to be DOING things for you. But you won’t get the love and respect you deserve as a person if you don’t demand a standard for that. Some people will just take and take and take and they will NEVER have a coming-to-Jesus moment where they suddenly stop acting selfishly.

Even if you are in time in your life or a mental space where you can’t bring yourself to action, or you can’t bring yourself around to the mindset that you deserve good things, the first step is surrounding yourself with people who do. Because they will uplift you and support you. If all you ever hear is negativity or selfishness, that is all you’ll ever feel. If you surround yourself with people who speak of you positively, consider your needs, and treat you fairly, it will eventually rub off! And lead you to a place where it seems less of an insurmountable task to take good things for yourself and be happy.

TLDR; Does this person your best interests at heart? No? YEET",06Dec2020,1
25,"As we all know religion in general frowns upon sex. But there is one thing I cannot understand. How come all prostitution (including legal sex industry avenues such as porn and even non-penetrative business such as webcam) is considered the ultimate evil? But a woman who had multiple partners is considered not as bad (even if she is outcasted)?

In particular, why is just selling your body once- especially in times of despair where you are so poor you have no options to put food on the table for your family- often deemed as the irredeemable sin that permanently stains a girl as unclean? While having voluntary pleasureful sex (even if it is frowned upon) isn't considered as dirty? About the only other ""mortal sin"" i can think off that is universally considered unforgivable is getting raped.

I can understand looking down on a girl from say a middle class or rich background with a loving family, doing it because she's too lazy or too greedy to get cash ""morally"". But why just even once to feed the family is considered unforgivable? While say having sex with over 50 men purely out of lust not considered as bad?

This extends even to atheistic societies such as the Soviet Union so religion alone cannot explain it.I mean its still exists that even in loose society where sex is treated as a recreation that also have rising number of atheists (if not are majority atheists) such as France and the United States, even promiscuous women would be ashamed at the thought of selling themselves. Even merely as a mistress to a single man who they find sexy as hell and are even simultaneously are in a girlfriend-boyfriend relationship, the thought of receiving cash for check is seen as filthy and staining, a sin that cannot be forgiven.

Hello people👋🏾 As of late I (27f) have not been living my best life. I’ve been trying to be on an active mission to find company. At the age of 27 I am truly struggling to find that person. Or any person for that matter. I’ve been on dating apps and all I’m getting are men who try to add me on snap or Insta to be overly sexual without ever meeting me. I did have one positive match and I’ve been talking to this guy for well over a year. We talk on the phone and ft and he doesn’t live so close to me (2-3 hours away). I kept picking up weird vibes from him the past couple of days and he kept bringing up company that he was having. He was asking me if I had been seeing anyone and I had explained that I was and returned the question to him. Then he explains he’s been seeing a FEW girls... way to feel defeated girl. Our convo continues as I try not to actively become upset as I know we aren’t together or exclusive and he makes some comment to the effect of if someone wanted to see someone they would or meet half way.  Him and I have never met up before. He’s made comments about me making it seem as though he’s into me. I’ve even asked if we are going to meet ever and he says yes.  I just don’t get that. I’m also bothered because you’ve been talking to me for so long and are just now telling me that you’re talking to a few girls. Then the convo continues (on FT) and I see him look at his phone all crazy and then say, “woah” so I asked what was going on. At first he said nothing then 15 seconds later he tells me that he started no nut November late because he just had a girl over last week. Then proceeds to tell me that she sent him nudes right then and that he was struggling with his celibacy.  WHUT 😒 Well how many has it been this whole time?  Were you ever going to tell me?  Why don’t you and I meet?  Are you into me or not?  Our situationship has me all types of confused. I honestly do value him as a friend and would be ok if we were just that but I would like to know that. 

Due to this event I actively tried to put myself out there and talk to an old fling (literally someone I mutually masturbate with over snap because what else can I get, not even casual sex lol).  We make an appointment for last night and I was all excited and it had been a long time and I figured I had that secured down. We had talked about it all through the course of the day and when it came time I messaged him and nothing. Hasn’t opened it in a whole day and completely blew me off. I don’t get it. Why bother with entertaining?

Then I fell even deeper and entered those waters you never should. Added a guy I used to talk to on FB. He has been the best potential match I’ve ever had. Honestly I really liked him and I thought that he liked me as well. But we had our issues. Come to find out those issues we all insecurities on his part. He didn’t want me to tell my friends anything about anything we had going on and would always ask if I was talking to or telling my friends something (in my opinion I never gave him a reason to feel so strongly on this). Also there was a day him and I had been making out in the car and he had his hands all over me and the moment I tried to touch him below the belt he froze and told me to stop. That was my first time ever being the aggressor. After that day he stopped talking to me for months!  As you can imagine I was scarred and wasn’t even sure where I went wrong. 2 years later he tells me it was because he was insecure about his size and thought I would tell everyone. When I heard that I was so hurt because I liked him so much that it didn’t even matter to me and that he let that ruin us and didn’t tell me for years. So flash back to currently as I’m in my feelings hoping this is my last chance with connection and my last chance with him. We message asking how everything’s been and if we’ve been working during the pandemic. I asked what else he had been up to and he told me that he had been working and hanging with his girlfriend. When I tell you guys I feel like hippo shit it’s more like I felt specifically like hippo diarrhea.  He asked me had I been on dating apps and I told him I had given up and was just waiting for the right thing to appear (actually meaning that from now on because I was lowkey trying to snag him) and he told me to continue on my search and I’ll find the right person. I’m not sure if that was genuine but it felt condescending.  It just hurt by saying those words because you’re implying that I wasn’t the right one for you. But how would we even have known that if you wouldn’t have done those things to me. He squashed us before we got to start and I’m bummed. He found someone and I’m still stuck alone. 

I’m just hurting. Why am I always the one left single and alone. I try and it doesn’t work. I don’t try and it doesn’t work. Being 27 and never having a boyfriend or anyone who’s truly interested in you is for the birds. It’s been a shitty three days and I just needed to air that out and ask you all what you think is going on or if there’s something I can maybe do to change my circumstances. If you have any questions just ask me 🙂",06Dec2020,1

31,"Sorta just need to rant about the night I had. 

I recently got promoted at work and things have been going well. That is, until tonight when I was at work and my ex decided to show up randomly. I told my management before that I don’t feel comfortable working with for numerous reasons and I was not to be scheduled if he is working there too. (It only happens once every few months). 

I was at work visibly crying and shaking my one of my leaders kept coming up to me every 5 minutes asking me if I was okay. Each time I said no and was having a panic attack due to the situation and all my leader did was say, “well maybe later we can get you an early release”. I continued to work for hours uncomfortable, shaking and crying. 

Eventually my leaders start letting some people go home early but my name isn’t picked. At this point I’m extremely emotionally exhausted from having to work under so much stress. A coworker asked me if I was okay and I just exploded and said “NO! ACTUALLY! I’M NOT”. 

She went to Twitter and stated that I can go fuck myself and multiple people from work retweeted it. At this point I feel so disgusted that I let my behavior become so ugly and I took it out on my coworkers.",06Dec2020,1

37,"   Basically, I had Spiderman's powers but about one-tenth of the strength and  I was being chased by an extremely persistent girl around a huge mall for hours on end because apparently she loved me. The chase was super intense because I had a very strong feeling that if she caught up to me it would all be over. I should mention that the girl was based off of my high school crush and was the same age as in high school (I'm now way older), which is why I think I was running away. 

   To cut a long story short, after what felt like  5+ hours I eventually run out of webbing and fall down some stairs where she catches me. So I have to explain to her that I'm too old for her and that she can definitely find a good guy her own age. It's pretty bittersweet. As she's leaving though, I think I start talking to her older cousin who was ""supervising"" her, though I could have made that up as I was waking up to make myself feeling better.

PS: I think the mall was okay with me running around there so much because I worked there as an entertainer.",06Dec2020,1
38,"hi, I’m on my mobile so sorry if the format is messed up! 

Basically, I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I was born in Australia and moved when I was 15 to Canada. All my friends from Australia now refer to me as the “Canadian girl” and everyone in Canada refers to me as the “Australian girl”. Also the added fetish of Australians in America/Canada is real and I’m very sick of it, the amount of whack things that people have said to smh. 

it’s extremely exhausting but I feel like I can’t mention it to anyone. I could deal with it for the first couple years, the jokes, fetishizing, being referred to as a country and not a person. But now... I have no patience for it, I instantly get upset when someone mentions one of these things to me. I feel as though people only want to talk to me about the other country that I have lived in and want to hear my accent. 

It also has caused a lot of confusion and indecisiveness for me for my future. I’m afraid that if I move to Australia, my friends in Canada will slowly fade away and vice versa. 

What I’m wondering is if anyone has advice for how I can fix this? Should I mention it to my friends? (I have bad anxiety so i feel like this option is out), am I just overreacting? How do I stop feeling like this?",06Dec2020,1
39,"I used to be a huge dancer. I could naturally just vibe with the rhythm of a song and go with it. I wouldn't even think of moves, I just did them. It always felt amazing expressing myself with movement, along with the actual physical exertion of it. I loved it, and still do. However, recently I feel like I've been losing myself, not really sure how to explain it. Feels like I'm not myself anymore. So whenever I've tried to dance it always felt stiff, robotic, and choreographed. I hated it, and still do. Right now as I'm typing this I just finished dancing to two very awesome songs. My creativity is still there, thank god. My heart is racing, not sure if from having moved so much or the excitement of it. I'm hoping I can keep this spirit tomorrow. I'll try to make time to go and dance somewhere, because this is very important to me.",06Dec2020,1

41,"As i'm living my new second life, which started 5 months ago thanks to an event that woke me up, i'm struggling to cope with how i lived a big chunk of my previous life.



I was never accepted by anyone in my life. My mother revealed me a couple days ago that it was because ever since i was little i'd always be ""ahead of everyone"" and she said that it was because i was a smart, different kid, so my family, my few friends, and most of all my school mates never accepted me. Keep this in mind as i go on.



I got bullied MASSIVELY in school ever since i was little, which made me isolate and close myself in the house playing videogames all day. I isolated myself from all my friends, which all grew up while i remained a child (with helicopter parents too).


I lived like this, isolated and living only on the internet, for YEARS and the more i went on the more i started to lose touch with reality.



This is what makes me sad and i can't cope with it. I lost complete touch with reality up until a few months ago, my behaviors in everyday life looking back were extremely weird and almost autistic.



I can't seem to cope with the fact that because of massive bullying i closed off myself and resorted to just living in fantasy, which made me lose touch with reality.


 My father never gave me any guidance and was very absent, so there was nobody besides my helicopter mom which only reinforced the behavior as she kept infanticize me into her little child.



Now i have had my wake up moment and in the span of 5 months i made more progress than in 7 years, and i'm already in a much different place in life.



But i can't cope with my past. I can't, it hurts too much to remember myself and how lost i was. How out of touch with reality i was. Help me.",06Dec2020,1
42,"Our professor warned us before the semester began that his lectures would be emotionally taxing, and he definitely had a point. He’s an incredible, knowledgeable, and passionate educator, and I often stay after class for his office hours (via zoom ofc) for up to an hour. 

But his lectures’ content is so harrowing. On the days that I’m able to devote my full attention to the gravity of what he’s teaching us, I often finish class crying, or spend the rest of the day feeling completely drained and unable to empathize with anything that isn’t a detailed description of piles of boiled-alive bodies stacked atop one another in Tokyo in 1942. 

But perhaps I’m at my worst when I realize just how possible war on a massive global scale actually is - and that it’s not this abstract concept that humanity has been able to completely detach itself from. 

Another world war could happen because it *has* happened before, and all these ‘underlying conditions’ we study in high school and in even more detail in university - they haven’t gone anywhere. And very few people before WWI or even WWII had any idea said conditions would go on to propel the world into a mission of mass suicide for the next thirty-or-so years.

I know I’m being pessimistic, and when I can think straight about the world, I don’t genuinely see these tragedies of history repeating themselves in the near future.

I can picture everything about his house: the carpet, the way the kitchen floor slants, the flowers in the backyard. I remember his smile, the way he moves his hands when he talks.

At the start of my relationship my fiancé said that he and his first gf of four years ( they broke up when he was 24 he is now 31) and it fizzled out and he ended it. 

That they were too young and that had they met when they were older things could’ve been different. This comment still irks me and it kind of stops me from feeling completely secure in this relationship. Though he says I have nothing to worry about and he’s just being mature about the situation it makes me feel like she was the right one for him, they just had bad timing and I’m the next best thing. We’re 31. 

Am I just being insecure or am I onto something here. It puts me off and I find I put 70-80% effort into us rather than 100% as I maybe should. I also see my self as loving him but not in love because these thoughts put me off.

50,"Three days ago I graduated from University with a bachelor's degree in Chemistry. 
I've been congratulated and cheered up by my darlings and my close family. I'm happy for my achievements and for what I still have to do in the future. 

However, today something suddenly hit me: my father doesn't know anything about this. He doesn't know because my parents have been officially divorced for 10 years now and he's been absent from my life - excluding some rare instances - ever since I was 6.
He's never reached out, not in a meaningful way. 

I found out early this year that he had moved out of the country I live in with his new girlfriend/wife.
In a way, that's like a final sealing of everything, in my mind. 

I sometimes wonder whether my boyfriend is safe or happy, whether my best friend is happy with her academical choices or whether my mum has other issues we have to deal with, so how has my father never done that with me? Why has he never tried to reach out and know about my life and my siblings'? 

Sometimes I ask myself whether he cares at all, whether he actually loves his three children. Does he fall asleep thinking whether we're happy? Whether we've eaten? Whether we're cold? Whether we're safe? Does he try to guess what we may be doing, what our dreams might be?

I think that if I walked next to him he wouldn't recognize me anymore. I don't look anymore like the 11-year-old girl he last saw. The only giveaway might be a scar I have right in the middle of my face. 
Would he care at all? Does he ever think about how I'm 22 now, my sister 19 and my brother almost 17? Does he ever think that there are three (young) adults out there that carry his genes and whose one (me) look physically a bit like him? 
Why can't he show some care and love towards us? Why is it so hard? 

I can't understand how he has done several things with his new partner (showing love, travelling around the world with her, bragging about her and moving mountains for her) and nothing for me, nor for my siblings nor for my mum while we still were all together?

It hurts, a lot. I know am rambling, I know it might not make sense at all. I just don't know...
What if he dies? How will I feel? What would go through his mind? Is he really happy without his children?

He has been more appreciative of his ""step-daughter"" than of anyone of us, always according to social media (yeah, once every few months I go through his and his girlfriend's profiles).

I don't think I'll ever get over this. It's something I've been able to manage and put aside pretty well, but when these thoughts surface again sometimes it's hard to ignore them (like now): everything he has done to my family has had an extremely deep impact - directly or indirectly- on my life, mental health, choices, finances, happiness, personality and so on.
Why doesn't he want to face and see what he's caused (be it good - rare - or bad)?

Why can't he be present?

Why can't he be a dad?",06Dec2020,1

61,"All fandoms receive hate, right? There isn't a single fandom out there that does not receive hate because not everyone will like it; the same applies to the furry fandom as well.

I should be posting this in r/furry but somehow, i think the problem lies within myself more. Hence, why i posted it here.

As the title suggests, I'm running out of patience due to the negative things the fandom receives. Usually, it doesn't really bother me but i wouldn't be making this post, would i now? 

I think that the most hate that the furry fandom receive are due to the stereotypes that being a furry is a sexual thing. Hence, why some people would immediately say things like ""ew!"", ""disgusting!"", etc. 

And then there's the trolls that make fun of them. That honestly is the worst part of the internet; people who would go out of their way to say things that are beyond the threshold of what's considered as a joke just for a few laughs. What's more is that they are completely unreasonable; there's absolutely no use arguing with them!

The part where i mentioned the threshold? That's going to be the topic of this post.

One time, i was just browsing through some memes like i usually do. Then i stumble upon a meme about what mentally sick people draw. There were three images, two of which being disturbing while one of them was just a furry drawing.

At first, i had some chuckles. Now, i feel like I'm being attacked. Reminder that i found this meme a few months ago. I should be over this... when i saw a youtube animation video. 

""Furry disease"" in the title, i watched it... well, tried to.

Emphasis on ""try"". I tried not to overreact when it's still the very beginning of the video but just a few seconds later, i quit. 

I just felt the feeling of sickness building inside me. First, mental illness. Now, a disease? I'm close to popping my lid but i recompose myself.

Maybe they just made that video without the pure intent of pooping on the fandom and mjust made it as a friendly joke.

Maybe they too are a furry and they made that as a joke. 

Maybe, I'm just far too sensitive and prideful as a furry...

The others are probably just chilling, munching on some popcorn or something, completely composed. Heck, even laughing along as well.

One part of the problem lies within my oversensitiveness. I don't know how much more I'll be able to hold on and not lose my cool and go into an all-out pterodactyl screech. 

Reminder that this post is not about attacking the aforementioned things in this post. It's more like me just venting my frustrations by talking about the thing with a friend.

64,"I don't like the way girls are as in personality.

For some reason they never tell the truth. They always have to say A and not B, and they always have to find other words to say stuff that is not the actual truth. For some reason, my impression of girls is that they never can do one whole sentence without there is a lie in it.

I don't like that non of them is good with money.

I don't like that they are capable of brainwashing themselves to believe their own lies.

I don't like that they are the victim in every single situation possible.

I don't like that they can say no to sex 200 times, but once I say no one time, It's a massive problem.

I don't like that they get drunk after 2 shots and can yell and scream at me, and I'm the bad guy because I have to have done something because why else would they scream and hit me right?

Why can't we just chill? Just be together, play games and why can't we ever go out and drink a bit without massive problems every time.

I don't like that everything I say have to be asked with a question like: ""So what you are saying is that xxxxx"". NO, What I am saying is exactly what I said, nothing more nothing less! No need to analyze me more, which leads to my next point,

I don't like that woman are analyzing men way more than they should. Every breath I take, every step I do, everything I do have to be analyzed and looking for some ""red lights"" or whatever the expression arre they are looking for, some red thingies thats bad idk.

I don't like that girls are cheating more than men, which is a fact but you never hear it that often because men doesn't speak about it the same way woman do.

For many reasons, one of which is addiction, the game is addicting and I've identified the cycle that occurs when I no life it. I watch videos of it for a while, before I feel the urge to emulate or play it myself. The game has changed so much from the one I remember, and regardless has impacted my mental health negatively in so many ways that I see no reason to continue playing. Therefore I quit league of legends. Overwatch is a dead game with an awful game design which I can't even run. I will no longer be playing this either, as if I was. MMOs I've already said are time sinks, and the only reason to get into them are really for a community. I barely play single players through anymore, filled with so much anxiety to do it correctly and be perfect. It is the things that I truly enjoy that I begin to hate as my perfectionism and FOMO sour them. Fighting games have been a goal of mine since my early days of high school. Watching the fgc and playing these games, learning has been the most useful part of my development as a person. I've learned a lot about control and how to approach a problem from fgcheads and I've gained a lot of inspiration from the community. I've become better than I ever thought possible in these games, despite my anxiety to play anyone online. The fgc was the only community where I ever felt at home. Anime, ego, complexity, style, thuggery, jokes and real honest people. It's sad to start from zero again, it was always comforting to know that I had a place that accepted me for my ability, for my hard work and myself. Even though in the end it was pretty much a parasocial community of retards that I delusioned myself into believing were real friends. Regardless, I'm glad to have been a part of it in any form. I suppose this is the end of a chapter. Though it's not as though I am cutting these experience from myself, even though some of them I will be unlearning and improving. I take what I have learned and move forward with it. Thank you for being the only place I felt accepted for just being me. Goodbye.",06Dec2020,1

68," whether those fucks be white or arab (which most of them are lets be real dont leave out the arab muslims (lbr arabs in general you get bangaldeshi muslims but they get shit treatment) the white elite want to fuck all day because they look most like white people and they feel sorry for violent people who look white), fuck you. NOT ALL OF them are racists but for sure they have the most privilege and whine the most fucking much. those you cant criticise have power right? bishes can do anything but get a free pass. The most fricking privileged are arabs who get to whine all day and get specil privileges in european countries because theyre the most white but pretend they arent. i feel for the ones living in their own countries but no sympathy if theyre racists. i mean the most privileged arabs are the ones who have a lebanese pretty appearance (white) and lo and behold theyre racist AF so much of the time, but they are so high on the victim hierarchy its disgusting. they make fun of your looks and be like 'race doesnt exist muslims dont do SHIT lalalallallala', well you clearly got some arab supremacy right there huh. why do they get special privileges and act like white snowflakes? because of their unusual amount of privilege. imagine being a fake brown person going around being literally white, historical oppressors (honestly they shouldnt be blamed for that i agree theyre great), constant privileges, create so much of the narrative, and racist AF, huge political power (SERIOUSLY) the most loved and attributed race (mesopotamia and babylon ottomans and literally everything is attributed to them but they keep talking about how they dont get their fair share, in fact they literalily get to steal credit from greek, indian and chinese sources). RICH af and always asking for more and more privileges and throwing all other races under the bus because your 'race' commits so much crime i mean come on. they dehumanise other races because so many of their denomination commit crimes, and white people exaggerate other poc's crimes becasue olf that reason. so fucking racist and whine lal day about how they get like one article about a huge crime a muslim committed, while ignoring the fact that everyone else has way more fucked up articles about them",06Dec2020,1
69,"So early this day, me and my homie was smoking and rapping on his crib, when suddenly we talk about politics, religion and shits. I came up with this theory. I theorized that the hell we know, it's not actually the fire-y place and shit. HELL is EARTH, and Heaven is still the heaven we know. I think that when we die and our life is driven by sin we are just going back to live on Earth (Hell) which what we call reincarnation. We only going to heaven if our soul became pure. Life is a cycle. If we are going to live our life with sin, when we die we just going to be born again as a human until we achieve the purest form of our soul. We live life with sin - We die and be reincarnate again. When we achieve the purity of our soul - We are going to heaven. I may sound crazy and maybe didn't explained it well, it's because English is not my first language so I'm not really used to explain things in English.

71,"I was at my niece's 13th birthday, talking with her and her friends about random things and they were mentioning the fashion and trends they have to follow to be liked by their friends. Which I get. I remember the pressure to impress everyone at that age. But when they said that, my immediate reaction was 'well you know you can just not care.' I explained to them that they can wear whatever they like regardless of whether it's considered 'fashionable' or not.

It was like the most outlandish thing they've ever heard. They then told me that if that happened they would be cancelled and lose their friends and then have no life. 

This makes me sad not just for them or this generation or whatever. Because this is life. We all care too much what others think. I just turned 30 and tbh the biggest thing that's changed for me in the past decade is that I just don't care what people think anymore. I got married at 21 and my husband is a different race so I faced a lot of backlash, judgement, and hate for it, especially from the last people I ever thought would be like that. But it taught me a valuable lesson in my early 20s to just not give a shit. I will never please everyone. Someone will always have something bad to say or something about me or my life they don't like. So it just doesn't matter to me. And I'm a lot happier for it. My friends envy me for this trait. 

But when I was a kid, that option was never presented to me. I grew up in a very religious family and my parents cared way way too much what people thought. I always had to be mindful of what the church people would say or think. I was also trying to fit in as a teenager of course and I even remember one time my mom literally sold some of her gold to buy me a certain brand of backpack I just had to have to fit in. 

We're told to look a certain way, behave a certain way, and own certain things to be 'accepted' or 'loved'. But here's the funny part. I was still bullied and had no friends even when I tried to do all that. Even with the backpack.

80,"I often see people think that an author of a published book represents reality. They say ""well in this book by dr X or Y, therefore what they say must be true!"" 

There's a lot of people who publish books solely based on their opinions that they call facts. When you have people who write about ""abolishing the family because it would be good for my cause"", the reality is they have no argument for it. It's effectively a massive op Ed of often single, miserable people with no baring on reality. They write these form of books in order to convince other stupid people to take the exact same opinion on the basis of an ideological ground.

Theories are important. They require a hypothesis and grounding based on a matter of fact for theories to be supported. What I'm seeing more often now is that people are writing books based on ""theories"", when said theories are simply their own ideological opinions with no basis in reality. It's effectively reading a train wreck and said train wreck expecting people to fully agree with it because the author is a ""proud fem theorist who cares about women"" or ""a proud doctor who cares about the health of people"". These people have their opinion, but it doesn't make their opinion a theory if they cannot come up with a reasonable explanation or case for why their theory is correct.

Most books based around Sociology should be avoided. There's nothing of value to gain from books that offer no reasonable basis for their theories. It's just giving stupid people money who have a fantasy of how the world works and projecting their own misery on others.",06Dec2020,1

82,"Hi all, this is my first Reddit post so hopefully I’m posting in the right place and doing everything right! 

Apologies in advance that this is quite a long one. And also for the level of detail I just want to include all the info I have. 

Last year around august time I started with an intermittent pain on the left hand side of my chest. It’s roughly around the first 2 ribs /collarbone and sometimes underneath my left breast. It does on occasion correspond with some arm pain and pain under the shoulder blade on the left hand side. 

For background information I am a 30 year old female in generally good health, good weight (having just lost 26 pounds), have moderate exercise (walking the dog twice daily and yoga 2-3 times per week). I am an ex smoker who now uses a very low dose nicotine ecig which I am making attempts to quit. I have never been a big drinker but don’t drink at all now and haven’t for the last 3 months. I don’t take any medication just vitamin d and folic acid daily and a Berocca in a morning as an alternative to coffee. 

I attended the GP surgery in November of last year with the chest pain and was diagnosed with constipation and given a laxative (laxido) following the use of laxido I experienced both constipation and diahorrhea intermittently and general gastro complaints. I went back and was told IBS (even though I’d never had IBS symptoms before the laxido). I was told to try fibogel instead of laxido. Which basically gave me diahorrhea again. 

The chest pain is very intermittent I can go months with no problems and then it returns. It is not provoked by certain foods, medication or exercise. Sometimes it happens when I am resting, other times straight after a meal (but not a particular food). 

After some reading online I called the doctors in June of this year and suggested it could be GERD. I was put on lansoprazole for one month. It didn’t help. Again I went a long time without the pain then it started again in September this year along with an issue of feeling like there was a lump in my throat. I was put back on lansoprazole but once again it wasn’t helping. I attended the GP surgery and saw a genuinely helpful GP who ran several blood tests which all came back clear no thyroid issues, no coeliac, no infection, no inflammation, no deficiencies in fact my blood work was perfect. I had 3 stool tests which also came back clear these were the FIT test, a standard one for infection and a calproctin test. I’ve had an upper endoscopy including 2 biopsies and a camera up my nose in ENT to look at my voice box and upper throat area. Again everything clear. 

The GP has repeatedly suggested anxiety I think mainly because I had a history of depression and anxiety although I have not suffered or needed medication for this for nearly 2 years. I feel like any stress and anxiety I have now has been caused by this condition not the other way around. Although I think the swallowing problem is definitely related to anxiety as when I am calm it is not as bad but the chest pain comes regardless of calm/stressed etc. Nevertheless I eventually agreed to try an anti depressant. 

I started 20mg of citalopram but unfortunately the side effects were horrific and actually gave me anxiety the likes of which I haven’t felt for many years as well as diahorrhea, nausea, sneezing repeatedly, hives, feeling weird and spaced out etc etc. 

The problem I have no is this. The chest pain still exists. Yet I feel I am getting nowhere in finding out what it is, or what can be done about it. We have ruled out anything gastro causing it but now it seems to be getting brushed off as anxiety and I genuinely don’t think that it is. I am a bit concerned that at no point has any doctor considered a heart or lung related issue as the cause. 

Just to add as well I completely overhauled my diet (which wasn’t horrendous but could be better) and now eat a relatively acid free diet no caffeine, alcohol, red meat, fatty foods, fried foods, tomatoes, milk, onions, garlic, citrus etc) I do still have my ecig although I have cut down a lot with a view to eventually quit but have tried not having it e.g when at work and it makes no difference. I just feel at a loss now, I have another phone call appt with the GP on the 22nd December but I think at this point she thinks I am just making it all up because I’ve been on at them for so long. I feel like I must be really annoying her. 

Any advice or comfort that can be offered would be much appreciated. Has anyone had a similar situation? If so how was it resolved?",06Dec2020,1

88,"hey guys, so i love food, and this led to an accute condition where I shart, and for the last year i've been having for dinner a different footlong sub, (subway) and a cheesecake factory cheesecake, along with fat burrito and taco from the local stall on a drive home. He has a fatphobic predisposition, which has ruined our relationship with its prejudice. He thinks fat=fart. AS if the fatness is the sole cause for toxic farts. But yes farts had been getting serious, a medical condition, bubbly. They were the bone of contention. Farts can be caused by fat, but it is not the sole cause. My boyfriend has a deep prejudice against adipose tissue under the skin (ie he is obsessed with weight) and i have cut down on the extra cheese for the burrito (whcihc ontains the majority of fat). I did the first step, but he hasn't compromised.

Every night the farts grow louder and louder from my butt, and he got unsually grouchy. The farts were steady throughout the year, worse in the summer, and then my boyfriend keeps weight shaming me, saying i should cut down the tacos, as my fart reached its peak strength. not even thinking about my condition, which made me bored and tired, and fart like a mad cow. Since the eating reached its peak, I get all tired and forget to flush, which then has clogged the toilet, and we must get a shiny new one. And i use a lot of toilet paper to keep up hygiene, which is bad during covid. 

My boyfriend has been abusing and nagging me for my weight to the point he's forced me to cut down on the tacos, and puts a bowl of boiled veggies to make up for the toxicity. Every night I have demon farts, and what does he do? Groans like im breaking up with his sorry ass. And then literally one morning, i said 'woman, you've had enough, it's time to tell sydney whos boss"", it turned into a game, and I was angry too. Everytime he would tell me to stop adding the cheese to the taco, MY taco, I bend down and fart strongly into his nose, and he vomits After a month he got his lesson. So I sit on his face. (ie i cant feel my face HAHA) and he literallys uffocates because of his psychology becuse ""im fAt"" (what an ass) when not too long ago we were doing similar stuff and he was into it. at this point he cant avoid farts, whcih are poofed to every meal he cooks at home. One day, my boyfriend got petty and did his own fart, and said 'do you like it'. This is beginning to get full on abusive. I told him to mind himself, and bent down on top of his nice pan and did my usual shart ( we see eachothers shit during anal) onto his cooking, and he started spitting in my taco bell, which I have to trek a km to buy. this relationship is sour. i need to run.",06Dec2020,1

90,"I'm in a catch-twenty-two situation where one of my housemates (who is also a business partner) provides my business with great service, but at the same time, can be a very draining person to be around, due to their negative and pessimistic outlook on life, and lack of self-awareness, that can cause them to become self-centered and bring up extremely depressing, heavy, personal subject matters out of nowhere. Whenever this happens, I do my best to be there for them and listen, but these conversations can really bring me down. These conversations are usually always out of nowhere and due to their mental health.

What should I do? Should I push past their negativity and put up with being drained for the sake of my own career or find someone else to work with? What if I keep running into the same situation? This is the second time in a row that this has happened when choosing to work with someone else. I've always ended up working with someone who is equally great as they can be bad, and have always ended up working with someone who ends up draining me for little to no reason, because of their mental health issues.

These kinds of recurring conversations that happen at least once a month really mess up my equilibrium, and I'm having doubts about whether I can work with this person, let alone live with them. I've just come out of a slump of severe depression that lasted for years, and really don't want this person bringing me back into it.

The thing is, I wouldn't be where I'm at in my career without this person, and know that I wouldn't be able to do what I do in my business without their help. I know that I do need space from them, and am wondering if the same dead-end relationship will happen like before.

I don't even know where to begin. This has been one of the worst years of my life, as I'm sure it's been for so many others.

Some background first: I'm a drug addict in recovery, and so is my fiance. I have a really long history of mental health problems, starting with suicidal ideation and severe self harm as young as 6/7 years old. 

Back in April of this year my fiance's doctor abruptly informed us that he was no longer prescribing Subutex, a synthetic opioid used in medically assisted treatment for people suffering from opiate addiction. The doctor wrote my guy a three month script, which would have given my him enough time to taper down off of it and get completely clean. Well when he went to refill it the pharmacy told him out of nowhere that they no longer carried it and couldn't help him. They could have called and let him know, they took the time to call him and wish him a happy birthday, but didn't bother to notify their patients that it was no longer available. So he was forced to drop off cold turkey from an extremely high dosage.

It led to him relapsing on heroin, and like a dumbass I got on it with him. We ended up losing our jobs behind covid; over the course of the year we emptied out my entire savings, maxed out my credit cards, destroyed my credit, and everything of value we owned is now in a pawn shop. We both overdosed multiple times and he almost died. I had to drag him out of the car, blue and lifeless, and give him cpr until the paramedics got there. They were finally able to revive him after what felt like an eternity, but as soon as the dust settled",06Dec2020,1

101,"Guys I'm so hopeless and have nowhere to turn to. This is on mobile, a throwaway, and I'm a mess right now so the grammar is probably atrocious. Tldr at the bottom.


My suicidal ideation has gotten so out of hand, I wake up to a screaming in my head telling me that today is the day. The razorblade I have hidden is engrained in my brain. I experience an almost physical burning on the insides of forearms, telling me it's right there and in just a few minutes all of the pain can just be gone and I won't be a burden to anyone anymore.


I have a long history of suicidal ideation and self-harm (along with anxiety and severe dissociative episodes; like I don't know who I am, what's real or fake, auditory hallucinations, the whole nine) dating back to around 5 or 6 years old. It led to a severe drug addiction culminating in legal consequences a few years ago. I'm so grateful that I was arrested. It got me out of an abusive relationship with the guy that introduced me to hard drugs, got me on the needle, etc. 


I was able to get clean, involved heavily in treatment and twelve step programs. I got back into college and graduated magna cum laude. I met the man of my dreams and we got engaged, and I was able to get a full ride to graduate school. I'm currently working towards an MS in clinical counseling with a focus on addictions treatment. It was a fairy tale, the perfect second chance success story. 


Cue 2020. Early this year my fiance got abruptly cut off from his Subutex, a medically assisted treatment program to help those suffering from opiate addiction. He had to stop cold turkey from the highest does they can legally prescribe, and he ended up relapsing. 


I used with him initially, but overdosed on the second day and almost died. He found me, thank God, and the paramedics were able to bring me back, but by the time they got there my oxygen saturation was at 23% and had been there for a while. Since then all of my mental health problems have been through the roof. 


We'd get off of the heroin for a week or so by buying subs off the street, but then the supply ran out and it would be right back to smack. We lost our jobs to covid, and ended up burning through my savings, maxing out my card, and pawning literally everything of value we own. I couldn't afford my health insurance and got cut off of all my psychiatric medications and everything was was made that much worse. He had a bad OD in October and I was finally able to stop all together, but he wasn't.


The last two months have been hell. Just me fighting him to stop and get help while trying my damnedest to stay away from using myself when he was doing it right in front of me.


I finally gave him an ultimatum and he went into a detox facility yesterday! So there is some hope. But I'm terrified he's going to leave early or just get out and go straight to pick up again. 


I'm terrified. I love him more than anything in the world but I don't know how we move forward from here. It's like we have this beautiful life ahead of us and it gets dangled in my face just to be ripped away again and again. We're thousands of dollars in debt and everyone in our support system is just disgusted by us. They don't understand how hard it is to close the box and keep it closed after the first time it's been opened.


I just don't know what to do. Even with me clean since early October we haven't even begun to make a dent in our debt. I got a job and he has one hopefully lined up after he gets out, but with criminal records it'll be extremely hard to get anything accomplished until after I finish my degree and get licensed. 


My support network wants nothing to do with me, they're turning people away from meetings because of covid-19, and my therapist is as inaccessible as my meds because we're completely broke. Like negative bank accounts broke. I can't even go to virtual NA meetings or reach out to campus therapists because my laptop is in pawn. 


I've made so many mistakes, but I've worked tirelessly over the last 6 years to fix them and get to a point where I can help other people so they don't have to go through this. 


This year has ruined everything and I just want to die. I'm so lonely and hurt and afraid and I know it can just be over immediately. I can just fall asleep and move on to whatever is next without even knowing it happened. My friends and family won't have to keep loving me and losing me over and over again. I keep telling myself that if I do it then he'll come out of detox and never want to touch the shit again because it killed me. I feel so worthless and don't see any other way out. I'm sorry for the rant but I have nowhere else to go reddit.


Please reach out to the people you love, this time of year is hard enough without all of the bullshit that's happened globally. They could be right on the edge and you'd never know it until they're gone.


TLDR: Suffer from severe mental health issues, recovering drug addict. Lost health insurance and jobs with covid; I had to come of my psych meds and my guy had to come off his MAT. Relapse on heroin, cue lies deceit and poverty. Finally got clean and my mister is in detox but we dug such a deep hole I don't see any way out. I just want to die. ",06Dec2020,1

103,"I get that some people are more socially inclined, but when my social battery is drained and I’m being boring and standoffish it feels like I need to just snap out of it, I get a deep gut feeling that this isn’t it and I need to change and be more social. Anyone else feel this way?",06Dec2020,1
104,"We fought a lot the past months, and this time we had a massive fight in the parking lot when she was about to drive home. I think she told her parents and brothers about it, and now they probably don't want to speak to me anymore. She's 21F I'm 23M and we've been together for 1 year and almost 3 months. I feel so so so shitty. I shouldn't fight so much, you know. I just feel so unloved in the relationship, and she doesn't put the effort in that I need. Problem is, I think I just expect too much from her and that's what's suffocating her love for me. I just hope she won't put an end to our relationship. 

I will talk to her on Wednesday. I pray to God we can still work it out, but I'm scared. I'm so scared to not have her in my life anymore. I'm scared that I will regret how I handled the relationship for a long long time. I just can't sleep from it. I'm scared that if we do stay together, that I won't be in a healthy relationship. I'm scared that I will waste my time and energy on an imbalanced relationship. I don't know what to do. I just want to sleep, but it's keeping me awake.",06Dec2020,1

106,"&gt;Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.",06Dec2020,1

108,"I am so fed up of my life and where I live. My apartment sucks, my roommates suck, my job sucks. I have like 4 good friends and 2 of them have recently moved far away so only like a few people actually here (MA) that I actually would stick around for. I just need a new life I hate living in the US, even living in a mostly liberal area I just still see disgusting shit that makes me not want to live in the US. My boss is a racists piece of shit and so are most of the people I work with. 

I seriously want to know if there are any possible ways to get out of here and start over somewhere else? I have 6 years of student debt, my credit cards are mostly maxed out, and I’m basically living paycheck to paycheck just to pay for a shitty 3 bedroom apartment that my roommates just make a mess of. I seriously need to get out of here or I’m going to end up trying to kill myself",06Dec2020,1
