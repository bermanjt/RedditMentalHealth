5,"Today I'm just going drink a little bit of vodka while doing my online class, I got everything I want right now. Weed, alcohol, cigarettes my own place where no one can bother me. This should be perfect, maybe dance with yourself a bit #####, just do your own thing. Don't let things go to far, have self control. Try not to doubt yourself. You can be something if you focus, fuck quitting I love to party. I enjoy life too, partying won't help me live longer.

6,"Say group A mistreats group B, and group A passes this behavior on to the next generation of the group by bad example, then group B will continue to be mistreated in the future. For e.g., white people mistreating black people

Say group C mistreats themselves, and passes this behavior on to the next generation by bad example. For e.g., anti vaxxers harm their children, but their children might also become anti vax

In the first case, if each generation of white people is a bit less racist than the one before, we would expect racism to shrink over time just by math. This seems like it should be the case even if white people didn't consciously try to be less racist, because the next generation is not only influenced by their parents. They're also influenced by external groups, like the black people who are being mistreated, who would discourage racism

And if white people do consciously try to be less racist, then it would shrink racism even faster. Only unconscious bias would remain. It wouldn't explain any overt actions. To put this another way, Derek Chauvin is responsible for the actions of Derek Chauvin

---

In the second case though, external groups won't always step in to stop a community from destroying itself. In the specific case of anti vax we do interfere because anti vax affects other people as well, but there are many other examples. For e.g. the ""black community"" has a higher divorce rate and this persists across generations

But is it victim blaming to say that a group hurts itself? In cases where a crime is committed against an individual, it doesn't make sense to blame the victim because no one wants to be the victim of a crime, for e.g. George Floyd is not to blame for his own death. But if we look back at anti vaxxers, we can see that each generation is both the victim of harm from their parents, and the perpetrator of harm to their children

So who is to blame for the harm done to anti vaxxers? One option is to blame the anti vaxxers themselves. Another is to trace it back to whoever sparked the problem to begin with (Andrew Wakefield). But is Wakefield far enough back in history that we can't really blame him? A third option is to get rid of the idea of blame, and just say that it's part of the state of nature now

To clarify, people can be to blame as far as they have control over the situation. So, someone who is influenced by earlier generations of anti vaxxers can still choose to learn some science and free themselves from the influence. So if we just choose some random numbers, like being an anti vaxxer is 60% personal choice and 40% the bad example of others, then people are 60% to blame, but the other 40% is just something that exists and it ""sucks to be you"" if you get hit by it

---

Then do we expect white people to pay reparations to black people? We wouldn't expect Wakefield to pay reparations to each new wave of people who are hurt by anti vaxxers

Partly the disadvantage of being black is caused by white racism, but partly it's accidentally passed on from influences within the ""black community"" for which no one is to blame. Some people might want to fix this anyway to ensure all have equal opportunities, but it's also a reasonable philosophical position to say that we don't have to fix inequality that just exists as part of nature (people born in countries with fewer resources, or short people who want to play basketball, or the fact that women can get pregnant and men can't, etc)

To conclude, I think it is enough to just do no wrong (rather than being expected to actively fight against it). And finally a quote from Morgan Freeman ""I’m going to stop calling you a white man. And I’m going to ask you to stop calling me a black man.""",13Jun2020,0

10,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  as I gained weight from 11.3 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.4 again and jogged  and it made a little difference. It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast until 9:30pm then eat is that better?

11,"I have a Non-binary friend who once fell for the Joe mama line. Here's how it happened. One day, in the before times we (me, them and a few others)  were all talking. My ass had just heard about Joe mama and knew it was a dead meme. So, I decided to do a quick vibe check(for lols). I asked ""So, guys...You ever heard about Joe?"". MJ responded, ""No, who's Joe?""...The room filled with scilence as everybody stared at MJ. In the presence of their piercing stares, I delivered the killing blow. I could BARELY hold back my chuckles. In a voice reminiscent of crying, I said ""JOE MAMA"". I quickly made the sound of a dying rooster and started laughing my ass off. The funny thing about this is that they were doing this In front of their Ex BF and, Future GF which is like, embarrassment x4.

14,"How do I have interest and hobbies and things? 

When I was a kid my mom and my grandma would always make fun of or talk shit about things I liked, or they would make it about themselves,  so over time I stopped liking things. Now I realize I’m 21, I have not a damn thing I care about. I have things I do. But nothing I care about. I don’t know how to share my interest with other people. Come to think of it, I never do anymore. I’m always afraid of being made fun of. 

I’m kinda at the point where it’s either make an effort to get better or die. One of them seems so much easier though 

Really my whole mindset is the problem, I view people as transactions, you do this for me I’ll owe you a favor down the line. I struggle understanding emotions, I guess I don’t really have them anymore. I can understand how you should feel in a situation but I don’t feel it. I’m good at acting and reading body language though! So I guess that’s a positive. 

How do you try to be a person when all you know is that people will abandon you? I don’t want to trust other people. I’m so scared to. But I’m so alone like this and I’m going to die soon if I can’t learn.",13Jun2020,8
17,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

21,"I still can’t believe it, I never thought I would have to say goodbye to my fluffy friend. 

I feel like it’s all my fault. He was throwing up seeds and at first I thought maybe he was regurgitating to feed mango, but then he started to lose weight quickly, I told my mom about it but her and I thought maybe it will go away, but then he started to become really really un energetic, he became really tired and wasn’t acting like himself.

So last week my mom called a avian vet and scheduled for this Saturday (My mom works all week). 

There was so many things I was I had done, I could’ve started feeding him like a baby with a syringe, but I didn’t and I hate myself for it.

I wish I had spent more time with him, I really thought he could make it till Saturday, and we could get him treated.

He’s gone now and if I could turn back time, I would’ve spent more time with him, I really wish I had spent more time with him because I now am starting to realize that it’s over, I will never be able to wake up, and come out of my room to see him.

I hate myself for brushing off obvious symptoms. If I’m being honest, I don’t wanna live anymore knowing I’m the reason that he died, nothing will replace him.

Life has been so crappy after he died.

I keep thinking about how I killed him by ignoring his illness, he wasn’t even a year old and my retarted self let him die.

Should I take therapy?

How am I supposed to response to ""oh I'm so sorry"" type comments?

I feel weird for not knowing. Like I'm not having feelings about her passing and that's why I'm not sure how to respond, but deep down I know that's not true. We weren't the closest but we still spoke on the phone for half an hour or so once every few months and saw each other on Christmas/Thanksgiving. I feel a sad but I'm coping fine I think.

I was told that this was the first time anything like this has happened with my brother. A few of my friends have similar stories of some possible trust issues this girl has through past relationships with her. It's seems like she is always suspicious of any other girl (now a guy i guess) that my brother is around, almost to the point where he isn't allowed to have other friends. I know better than to not take domestic violence seriously but she doesn't even want me to confront my brother about it.

40,"A couple days ago my sister told me that she knows I tried vaping. Apparently her friend (F1) asked my friend (F2)  if I vaped and he said yes. So already this information has passed through 3 people before coming back to me, it’s like a game of telephone. 

 My sister got busted for vaping a few months ago, and today I smelled vape in her room. I told her I could smell vape, and she got really defensive and asked “how do you know what vape smells like?” 

I know what vape smells like because lots of my friends vape, and I’ve been around it enough to know. To her this was just more proof that I’ve vaped before.

I asked F2 if he told F1 that I vaped (just to be clear, I didn’t vape) and F2 swore on his life that he didn’t tell F1 that I vaped.
Which means that F1 made it up entirely.

Also, F1 has a vape that I know about and she was here earlier. I think that’s why I smelled vape in my sister’s room, but my sister was definitely doing it too

48,"Tonight after 104 days in no-contact social isolation I finally get to see a woman i have been crazy about for a long time. We knew each other in high school through mutual friends and have been connected through Facebook for several years [but haven't seen each other since 2000](https://imgur.com/d4Q8Fzn) after i was fresh out of the Navy. (We are both in our late 40s, she graduated in 1990 and I did the following year.) I secretly crushed on her for a really, really long time because we had a lot in common, but around the time we reconnected she had been separated for a year and was awaiting her divorce to finalize. She briefly casually dated and i had things going on in my own life so i just kinda politely lurked - occasionally we would comment back and forth but i never was anything other than friendly and polite because having been divorced myself i knew she need a lot of time.   


Well her divorce finalized back after nearly two years in February and i kept wondering if i should send her a message about getting a drink sometime, but honestly i haven't dated in two years and i kinda felt rusty.  But then the virus hit and - yeah, i kinda thought i blew my opportunity until our mutual friend of 30 years (one of my best friends &amp; her niece's uncle) gave me a verbal kick in the ass and told me that if i didn't act now i was gonna regret it. Then my another close friend of mine echoed the same sentiment so i went for it.   


So everyday now for the last 80 days we have talked. Didn't take long for both of us to realize we were really connecting... we both are still kinda weird in our own ways having never really lost our old gothy ways, bonding over old monster movies, dark humor and maybe just a touch of goofy evilness. Kinda broke the ice by jokingly calling her Demoness and it became a running joke between us.  Then we realized we were really having some intense feelings towards each other. Kinda blind-sided us in some ways as we both said later. There is definitely something there that i honestly thought i might never experience again in my life.  


Tomorrow, she is the first person i am actually gonna be able to spend time with since this has all started - we live in the Seattle area and so socially isolating has been something we both take seriously since we both have people we care about that are immuno-compromised.   


Literally the first person that i am going to be able to touch at all is her and i can't believe it finally gets to happen. I spent the last two days deep cleaning my apartment, going grocery shopping because i am making her dinner and trying to get everything just so.   


I feel like i am a teenager again and it's crazy because im this strange long-haired bushy bearded dude with a dad bod, getting all worked up because i get to kiss a girl tomorrow and now I can't sleep.  


I think i just squeed. holy fuck, i fucking adore this woman and i finally get to kiss her. i get to finally touch her face. i get to hold her close to me. this year has been so terrible for so many people, but tomorrow is gonna be the best day of 2020 for us. it's happening. it's really happening.",13Jun2020,15
49,"Today I found out my ex has been seeing someone for the past 10 months, so starting just 2 months or so after we broke up. I've been alone for a year. 

I also tried talking to a new therapist the past couple of weeks about my depression, and she mainly just scolded and criticized me. 

I cancelled the sessions, but those two things really fucked me up this week, more than I thought they would and more than they should have. I try not to think about my life too much, but I have very little prospects as far as a career/friends/relationship, and I'm not too optimistic about finding more prospects for these after the pandemic has fucked the world and the economy. 

It took me forever after graduating college just to find enough work to move out from my parents, but then the virus came and shut that new job down, so idk if I'll even have it once the world starts up again, I'm worried I'll be laid off. I don't think I'll even like the job that much, it seems mundane and depressing. The pay isn't terrible, but it's not that great. I'm still living with my parents now. 

I'm pretty shy and I rarely initiate conversations with strangers, so I've had almost no luck finding new friends since graduating. The few close friends I made in school were kind of through luck and being in a community together, but now that I'm not a part of any community, idk how I'm gonna find any close friends. 

I thought ""even though I'm shy, at least I can use dating apps as a last resort for a relationship,"" but I rarely get any matches. I'm so lonely I swipe for hours sometimes and I feel pathetic.

51,"I'm even making this. Not sure if it's because I'm such a nervous wreck right now or what. But, I've been sat here for a while, just remembering my past as I've gone through this reddit.

I don't even think this'll even take off, to be fair. 

I've always been an anxious bastard my entire life, saw a post here that made me feel a bit odd. Like, I was seeing a mirror reflection of how I feel.

22, and even with a job, in a steady home, both parents- I feel like I'm under pressure. So much pressure, just, all the time sometimes and I don't even know it/recognize it. 

Pressure to do better, Pressure to make new friends, Pressure to get that top ranking. Sometimes, it just, burns me out so hard that I fall into a sort of 'slump' - just another term for depression.  Been thinking on a post I saw here earlier and truthfully? What in the hell am I going to do?

I only have a few courses charted in College, not even an AA degree yet, and I aint got shit for money. Everything has been more or less given to me, and I hate it deep down, but I swallow back pride, smile and grin. So shielded it almost makes me sick- I'm not being controlled/domineered as to what I see, say, look at, do, hang out with, etc. I know, if I moved out on my own, I'd be so screwed there wouldn't be any end to it. Personally, I'm just so scared of drowning in all of it: bills, taxes, etc. It's not that I'm not grateful, I am, really, for every last meal, shirt, whatever, a penny even so much as pushed towards me. I'm just, too damned prideful really, at least for myself. Been hurt so many times before by other people that I've learned to try and rely on myself, but can I? For this? Why am I even making this, if I obviously can't? 

'It's a mindset' - Something that I know is true, but God, I don't even know if I can ever break it. Said 'mindset' being that, I'm just too damned passive. I don't hardly ever initiate, unless I want something/have too. Truth be told, I still thankfully have a few friends at work, but, I dont think I could trust them with this. Thing is, I feel like I'm wearing a mask, more and more often and now it's like it's just- splintering.

I'm just, not sure what I can do. I feel like I'm present but see through, like people look at me but don't 'look' at me. Like I'm some sort of undesirable, or I got the plague, or something equivalent.

I just realized I wasn't depressed as much because of what she was doing (the constant fights, throwing things, hitting, the blame and criticism) but rather because of what she was: her confidence, ease to connect with people, the fact that everybody liked her instantly (me included), perseverance, hard working personality, ability to stay happy and positive. In reality, seeing all these things in her that I felt I was lacking killed me depressed. My envy slowly killed me from the inside, making me resent her, because she had it all, and kept putting me down for not doing/being. Feeling all that inside me every day eventually made me numb, made me unable to move, and ultimately lacking even more in all these areas.

Today, I've cut her of from my life, thinking not being reminded everyday would make me get out of this deep hole, but it has only pushed me deeper.

She's moved on already and is back to her happy confident self and I'm going backwards. Why am I like this? Full of envy

How can I pull myself out of this depression?

Recently, things have been accelerating at a worrying rate. I'm losing my ability to function, I can't focus, can't think clearly, can't remember things more than a couple of seconds and I'm constantly having the same thoughts fog my mind...",13Jun2020,1
57,im kinda sad rn so any joke or story doesn’t even have to be funny would be greatly appreciated,13Jun2020,1
60,"Up until a month and a half ago i was a very depressed, angry person. These feelings  stemmed from just a bad childhood and I carried them through my teenage years. I reacted badly to any bad situation I was put in and ended up becoming very sad with a lot of mental health problems.

Until my ex boyfriend and I broke up. I realized then that that’s when I needed to change. I needed to improve myself. Up until a month and a half ago I had no goals, my only goal was to move in with the ex. I had a ton of bad habits, I never really ate, I had no friends, and I just generally didn’t take care of myself. 

Since then I found out that I want to be a pilot. I’ve been looking into the air force for that one. I’m enrolled in school (something that I wasn’t before) to get my bachelors in aerospace engineering.

I stopped vaping about a week and a half ago after realizing that when I ran my lungs felt like they were on fire after 30 seconds. 

I started my workout journey with running every single morning with my best friend (yes! I made friends) and then moved on to the gym. I’ve gained 12 pounds. Which is the goal. I’ve been eating a lot more and paying attention to calories because I need to be 117 pounds by the end of summer. I started out as 96 pounds.

I’ve gotten so close to a couple of people over the past month and a half that they threw me a little surprise party for my birthday the other day. (I’m so happy with my new friends. Far more positive and better for me than the people I hung out with with my ex boyfriend).

Oh and I’m getting shift lead at my job (starbucks) and almost done with the extensive training. I work so hard there and I’m so happy that it’s finally paying off. 

Oh and btw screw relationships. I’ve had more fun in a month and a half screwing around with my best friend than I ever had in that 2 year long shitty relationship. oops. 

Anyways, doing and achieving all of these things has really helped me with my mental health. I’m really happy I’m doing better for myself. So thank you for listening :)",13Jun2020,1
62,"I woke up on the couch this morning and ate half a tub of cookies and cream icecream then lazed around the lounge all day watching movies and playing games. I'm 25 years old.
I don't know what to do with myself, I hardly have any friends and the ones that I do have  don't really share the same hobbies or interests as me. I used to do drugs pretty heavily and lost the majority of my friends when I got out of of that scene a few years ago. I quit drinking 6 months ago and since then hardly see the rest of my friends or do anything social at all really. I live in Australia and most people my age here only hang out to drink or play sports, and I'm not into sports.
I feel better mentally since quitting alcohol as I had a drinking problem and it really brought me down. Everything at work is good, great even, but when I'm home all I do is sit in front of the tv. I want to do something productive like exercise or learn a new skill but I struggle to motivate myself which is weird as I'm super motivated at work. I feel like I'm wasting my youth.

64,"I've tried university 4 times and dropped out each time because I was too lazy to study and it just didn't feel like it's for me.

I've quit countless number of jobs because of the same reason.

In December 2017 finally I was able to keep going to same workplace, in betting shop. I managed it for a year and then got a job at ""corporation"". This job paid little over a minimum wage and my only task was to ask suppliers for invoices. I've worked there until end of 2019. I quit that job because I was sick of it, barely could get up and go there. I've saved some money working there. I was doing nothing from January-May 2020. When I decided that it's maybe a good idea to try again in other companies, I failed at getting a new job. Because of a lack of degree, shitty experience and probably due to coronavirus which forced a limitation of recruitment. I've lost all my savings living like this.

I again lost any will to keep looking for a new job. I feel like I just don't belong in system like this.

I live in a shitty place which hasn't been touched nor renovated in the last 20 years. I have no laundry machine, no fridge, it's 11th floor with big balcony that is all covered in pigeon's shit. Those fucking birds are here all the time and they're loud as hell. I'm not allowed by the owner to throw any net over the balcony because she says ""it will look like a prison"". It's 95F inside all day all night. When they were so loud I went crazy and just jumped to window to close it and I closed the window too hard and glass broke in a half. Those windows are probably like 50 years old. Then next day again out of frustration of living here I broke a door in a bathroom. I'm calm 99% of the time, everyone sees me as that nice guy, but all that frustration is building inside of me and sometimes I get those crazy attacks that I can't control.

Oh and please don't even start with ""just do what's interesting for you"" because I have no idea. :|  As much as I wish to know, I just don't know.

I’m trying to get my life started and become financially stable but I guess I’m just lost in life right now.

70,"My family did a pretty good job sheltering me from the hostility of the world while still growing up. As I became an adult, lived on my own, and got a job; I was very naive to think everyone was good and they all mean well. I thought, people never lie and they are not gonna intentionally do anything bad to me. Haha I was so stupid. 

Through my job and the people I met there, I had to learn the hard way that people are basically animals. I learned that, people see kindness as an opportunity to exploit and abuse me. That they can just do whatever they want and I will just allow it (being racist, rude, not paying overtime, etc.). 

I soon started to realize the abuse and it quickly became all too much. So much that, if I want to keep my sanity, I needed to quit the job as it is the only way, I see, to reflect and reinvent myself.

I just had to change. I had no choice but to stand up for myself even if it seems, to them, that I am being a bitch. I cannot please everyone anymore. 

It is challenging but not super hard to find a job where I am from (before covid19). I was able to successfully set boundaries in my new job and made it clear to my boss and workmates that I WILL NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF ABUSE WHATSOEVER. I also made myself financially stable so that I am not afraid to lose my job at any given moment. 

I will not be treated like shit anymore. No one deserves to be treated like shit. 

Friends I have not seen in a long time commented on how I have changed. I still love and care for everyone but, unlike before, I will not hesitate to call you out once I see a red flag. I do confrontations, now, too. Just an FYI.

72,"Could all those people who got sick foresee it? No. Sometimes I hear about people or acquaintances who suddenly have strokes, heart attacks, tumours, and I wonder: ""Why did it happen to them? Why not me?"" And I realize that you can't really predict how these things will happen. You can't just go about your day and think ""I am not going to be the one who gets cancer anyway"", because apparently people who developed illnesses or diseases didn't know what was going to happen to them. So I believe health is the most important thing. Nutrition, physical activity, posture, deep breathing...whatever you think might help. 'Cause you never know, and once it happens you might realize that physical pain is one the worst things you can ever experience. I mean, seriously, if stubbing your toe or crushing pimples hurt so much, think what ""bigger"" things can do. For a few days I have suffered from back pain (probably hypertonia), and that's when I realized that physical health is everything.",13Jun2020,6
73,"The stereotypical ""Karen"" is no doubt worth a snicker being that everyone seems to know someone who encompasses the personality type. I recently looked into the ""origin"" of ""the Karen"" archetype only to find claims that it originated in 2017 on Reddit none the less. Although there's truth in it's popularity as a meme gaining traction through Reddit. It seems to me ""Karens"" true origin has much more depth than it's [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)) or other high ranked Google [explanation](https://theconversation.com/how-karen-went-from-a-popular-baby-name-to-a-stand-in-for-white-entitlement-139644) or [this one](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/5/21079162/karen-name-insult-meme-manager)

Ginger was a character played by Sharon Stone in the 1995 movie Casino. Brilliantly played by Stone the character is progressive from lovable to despicable (but still lovable). She starts as a street smart goddesses of hustle equally crafty, manipulative, gold digging wildcard, drug user beautifully damaged goods and the love interest of Sam Ace Rothstien (Robert Deniero) Ginger ends up unhappily married to ""Sam"" as a out of place, out of control ""kept"" rich suburban mother of 1 house wife desperate to do what she wants when she wants in spite of her ""agreed upon"" marriage to the powerful Sam.

So how does Ginger and the modern ""Karen"" connect? Well, the movie ""Karen"" played by Sharon as Ginger Rothstien goes to incredible lengths to threaten and manipulate what she wants in spite of having little to no clout to do so much like the let me ""speak to your manager"" mantra. In the movie she literally trys to take Sam Ace Rothstiens kid and even holds her own child hostage from Sam exactly like the memed version of ""Karen threatening to take the kids"". She's emotionally explosive, she's a cheater, she's gaudy, she's a mess, her hair is edgy...

And if my explanation isn't enough to convince you that the meme ""Karen"" is literally SHARON stone as Ginger from the movie Casino just watch the movie. Orrr just [watch this clip from the movie](https://youtu.be/Ekl6Toc5dcI)

tl;dr Karen didn't originate on Reddit it was encompased by Reddit through a collective character stereotype created in the movie Casino by Karen err umm I mean actress academy award nominee (she should of won) Sharon Stone! Same clip as above https://youtu.be/Ekl6Toc5dcI

75,"I’m scared I might be a sociopath. My friend said things about another friend implying she was sleeping with someone. I believed him and got jealous. So I told her that he said inappropriate things, he even made comments about her when she invited other friends over, I thought he was talking shit implying some kind of threesome. He never directly said these things the were just implied. Now he’s adamant that he never said anything, a specific moment he said you know so and so have a thing, in another moment he made comments about a love triangle and “I wonder what they’re doing right now jokes”I assumed he was telling me for his own benefit to push me away from her when maybe he was telling me because he was a real friend and didn’t want to see me get hurt. I remember the things he said that made me feel uncomfortable and upset but since I never admitted my feelings of jealousy or my feelings for my friend I’m afraid I just used the situation to manipulate. I should have been more honest, but now everyone thinks I’m a sociopath because I posted things online trying to justify my actions instead of just admitting I had feelings for her and that the things he was saying upset me because I liked her. Since then I realize sometimes my mind jumps to irrational conclusions sometimes and I feel like I’ve lost my only friends, but why would anyone believe I didn’t just make this shit up if neither of us will admit what was actually said? Without her friendship I feel empty and abandoned, she won’t talk to me because she thinks I’m trying to manipulate her when truthfully in the moment I don’t think that was my intention, I overreacted and made something out of nothing because I got jealous. Or am I in denial about being a sociopath?",13Jun2020,1

After the dentist filled the cavity, she recommend me to floss at least 3-4x a week.

So I started making it a habit to floss daily. At first, my gum bled. Apparently that is a sign of weak/infected gum. Every single time that I flossed, blood would come out. This went on for several months.

Lately I've noticed the blood no longer comes out! That means my gum is much stronger now. Feels good to see your consistent effort pays off!",13Jun2020,1

83,"Long story short, after years of having an unconventional job and making relatively good money for my age, I was let go 6 months ago. I’ve lent the last 6 months pinching pennies because I’ve always refused to get a regular 9-5 job knowing I would fail either at the job or with keeping my sanity. My family always told me to go to college or start at the bottom of something stable that I could work in and I just couldn’t do it. It felt wrong for me.

This week I’ll finish training for my new job that I will actually like, at a great company that will start me in the 6 figures at only 22 years old, and hopefully i can stay for a very long time. I’m not one to get excited about stuff usually, but I don’t really want to talk about it with family because despite the great opportunity, they won’t be happy if how I got there going against the grain of normal.

What matters is the reality that she’s gone and now that I get that, I can take a deep breath and move forward. I deleted most of my social media apps to prevent myself from constantly looking for an answer and stalking and letting myself feed into that.

90,"# This past week, Justin Trudeau took a knee at a BLM rally and stated that systemic racism exists throughout Canadian establishments. At best, he revealed his open and caring nature. At worst, he pandered to his electorate base in a series of calculated actions designed to solidify liberal votes.

**In reality, he did what most people do when using influence. He differentiated human beings based on labels. What is our societal infatuation with focusing on our differences instead of our commonalities? Babies are not racist. This is not an issue of genetics. Society teaches us to discriminate. We celebrate our individuality, join safe peer groups, and create labels for the purpose of differentiation. It all seems innocent enough until it isn’t.** 

**From Party Politics to junior high school hallways, we unwittingly foster a society of divisiveness. Psychologists tell us that concepts like multiculturalism and diversity training often work against their good intentions by creating silos based on labels. If there is any validity to the suggestion that our best intentions are taking us further away from what we want, then we need to talk about it openly and objectively.**

**I recently released a novel on Amazon called, For a Daughter’s Love. It is an intriguing story of a fractured relationship between a young woman and her father. I refer to is as Purposeful Fiction, because the storyline is designed to allow the reader to investigate their thoughts and feelings about who they are as people and how they fit into society. The book also reveals a possible future of positivity and connectedness and how we could make it a reality.**

That means I have a Czech first/last name, dual citizenship, grew up eating Czech foods, half of my family lives there, been there several times, etc. I always identified more ""Czech"" than American. My mother's side is mainly Swedish (her parents' parents were immigrants). Well, my mom randomly phoned me one day (I live in another country), and told me I was conceived secretly via IVF after my father got a vasectomy (didn't have a chance to inquire more). She passed away shortly after.

I can't always be a fucking people pleaser and mindlessly say yes to a favor so I wont disappoint a person- which later on would make me feel regret for saying yes in the first place. I mean for fuck sake, I got bit by a dog just because I said yes. Just because I didnt want to disappoint these two people. Hell no. You should have warned me and you didn't even apologize to my face for never warning me about that neighbors dog who was aggressive and untrained. She never warned me about it the moment I step foot in her smelly house. Nor left a note. Its shocking because shes the woman who would remember where her keys were. Of course, I acknowledge that I am also somewhat at fault here because I wanted to stop the dog fight, I wanted to stop this neighbors dog from hurting or making her dog to bleed. Then I got bit. Karma, cool. Fine.

Just a simple sorry even when she was not looking at me would have still been okay. She never did.

Oh fucking well. Since theres none sympathy from her, time to move on. 

I am my own person. I am standing my ground, finally. 

I can say no if I want to. If you're upset about it, well, I dont give a fuck about hurting your big ass egos. If you call me a bitch because of this inside your brains or when you both have another gossipy bullshit chit chat about other people again, okay, I'll be that bitch. Whatever.

Find another to put YOUR responsibilities on. Smh. Or don't and maybe do it yourselves. 

Oh yeah why ""nothing to do"" and ""low life"" is on quotes- few months ago, I overheard my narcissist dad and his woman friend who's also a narcissist but a covert narcissist call me these two things. When they were in the living room, drunk. Just blatantly judging my life without knowing the full story. Basically they were talking shit about me when I didnt even do or say anything to them because I'm a quiet person who keeps things to herself and who HATES drama. 

I am utterly pissed off. Yes. But I'm keeping my cool, in real life. 

Why I'm saying I'm standing my ground is because of these two dipshits. 50+ years old and 40+ years old VS a 21 year old. I know they both dont like me. Actions really does speak louder than words after all. Which I wont be going in on that topic because I do not want to remember any more traumatic past nor look in to the fucking past of my abusive dad. 

Smh. I am, angry. I have the right to be- which I realized that i do have the right to be angry at people like these two. I am and I was treated so unfairly. But it's fine. I realized as well that there are other people who would want me with open arms. 

Fuck these two. 

And this woman still has the audacity to ask me to look over her smelly house this morning... when I said no, both of them resent me for it??? My dad hung up on me???

When I found out I graduated I was extremely happy and proud, my mom and bf told me congratulations, sister made a post on fb, and grandma sent me some money. I was happy with what i got (the congrats and money from gram) but it seemed like me graduating wasn't a big deal. I pushed past that thought and went on with life. Then I started seeing posts on fb of my classmates graduation parties, their families taking their pictures of them in cap and gown, cutting cakes, etc. I felt hurt that I didn't have something like that, even though I'm not a fan of parties. I decided it's for the best because I'm antisocial so I should forget it. Today is my birthday. My sister, mom and bf told me happy birthday. Earlier my bf asked me what I wanted to do today and I said ""nothing"". I just wanted to spend time with my bf, maybe watch a movie later and relax.

119,"Hello everyone,

I just need to speak about my life a little bit and share some things that is disturbing my happiness .

I'm living in London right now, I moved here 3 years ago is gonna be 4 this year and in this time I can't  socialize very well, I don't have my group of friends like i used to have in Spain (where I coming from) and this is affecting my mental health in some way, I believe that everything in life is more o less about balance and from the moment that I moved to London this part of life is really deteriorated.

In the end we are social creatures and to keep ourselves happy we need to have our group of people even 2 or 3 that we can hang out and share things, in my situation I don't have anything like this here,yes I have my group of friends back home but because of the distance is not the same kind of relationship that you can have with someone that you would see.

Sometimes I think that the problem is me and probably that the answer because I'm a difficult person regards trusting and call someone friend,
I want to make friends but with people that I have things in common not just people that is thinking to get drunk in some park through this quarentine. 

 I'm looking for people that can help me to be better because something about relationships is what you bring to the table and how do you make the other person feel, we always want to stay around positive people, people that elevate us.

But sometimes ignorance maybe is a bliss and when I had been in the park near my house this afternoon what I saw was some groups of people that don't care about what I care, and with this point of view you don't care with who you hang out.

I'm very focus in my goals and become a better version of myself but something is missing in my life and I feel some kind of emptyness inside of me because of this situation in my life, I also know that  your happiness don't should be depend of something external but in this case I think that the we way we are made make us need to satisfied some needs and one of them is feeling integrated with the environment around us.

When I was 13 I started cutting myself. I never could explain why I did it. I can't explain why I still do it

When I was 16 I started developing an eating disorder. One of the reasons I believe it keeps coming back is that its a way to hurt myself

It's unlikely, where I ap there are only few cases and I don't have a cough. I obviously don't want such an awful and deadly desease, it's taken so many lives already.... but I can't shake that deep feeling that I want to have it.

Why do I want to hurt myself so much. I am covered in scars from self harm and accidental cuts i scratched at. I can't move one leg in a certain direction because I intentionally forced too hard when streching to do the splits and pulled a muscle really bad. I'm slowly ruining my body and I keep wanting more.

132,"My University provides free online OED access to its students. 

What the OED is: it's a dictionary. But it's not just any dictionary. It's a dictionary that tracks how a word is used over time. This is important. I once owned a copy of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. There was a lot of prereading stuff it offered such as historical and cultural context among other things. One of the things it talked about was the difficulty people have with Shakespeare's texts because the language is so different. What it said next stood out- it argues that the biggest challenge with interpreting Shakespeare's isn't not knowing words, it's thinking you know a word but it actually meant something else completely different in that time period. Have you ever read a sentence from an older text and you knew what all the words meant but it still didn't make sense? One of the reasons why is the usage of the word could have changed. 

For example, I was reading a text from I think Julian of Norwich, and God praises the girl for being ""buxom"". This stood out. Why would God praise a girl for having big breasts? Well, modern use of the word means busty, but at the time the text was written, buxom actually meant something more like ""faithful"" or ""obedient"". Having a dictionary to refer to to be able to understand that distinction ensures that the text is accurately read, and I just think that's the coolest thing",13Jun2020,1

This post is from my throwaway account because I really don't wanna. I am really insecure so I would be coming back to see how much people comment and trash me but yeah. 


So I think by the definition I am a Nice Guy.

It all started back in my school days when I had a crush on a girl. She was one of the most beautiful girls in school and I was the exact opposite. It felt really magical. I was not being creepy but I used to drop some messages and tell some of my friends back then but it got out and she gave a long message about why it won't happen even before I confessed. 

I did not blame her for it. Months passed and I still kept in touch with her and chatted with her sometimes, on and off, we got in the same college and we became really good friends then. After 8 years of having crush on this girl, I finally became her boyfriend. I was trying real hard to be sweet and something you know.. something you can say proudly that HEY THIS GUY IS MY BOYFRIEND!!



She broke up with me and the relationship did not even feel like a relationship.

It barely lasted a few months and she blocked me out. It was some dumb mistake which is kind of a joke but she really took it to the ceiling and ended it. This is when I started talking with this girl who was the Girlfriend of my then, friend. Nice.

It was going nicely. This was the first time I actually felt there was a person who was actually happy to call me a friend. First time in 20 years. I have craved for simple affection for years and I finally received it for the first time. And one day we met up to gift her boyfriend on his birthday, it was on this night that stuff happened and there were family issues and  threats because they accessed the chats I guess while she was at birthday and she had to hurry home and the family beat the ever living shit out of her. And soon her father passed away because I think he was already in a severe medical condition and seeing his daughter helplessly beaten I think his heart just faded. Her boyfriend decided it is best to break up because he does not want to be the reason she gets beaten everyday. 

I .. I could not see this. This was my friend... She was broken. Every single night and every single day I talked with her and consolled her and just.. I became her therapist and everything.

I started liking her and she started loving me.

Not SUDDENLY!  It was a span of 2 Years here.

But yeah. I was really insecure though. Knowing what the family did over a stupid relationship, and me being a different race and religion... I was insecure basically and told her probably it won't work out.. and 


I confessed my feelings and we started dating. 

This was one of the most beautiful moments of my life. Love, Affection, someone to look forward to, someone's smile just warming your heart, waking up each day to a message and a smile, it's like the sun just shining on you in cold winter mornings. I did everything. I gifted and went with her everywhere. I was not really creative but we did everything. 

It was then she shared a secret that her brother does incest with her unwillingly since she has been like 5. He has forced her for blowjobs and spooning and she has woken up with cum in her face and sometimes being licked down there and when he found out she was dating last time he used this as an opportunity to do even worse things. 

I was devastated. I tried to think this through and calmly suggested ways. However there wasn't a way out. With him being the bread earner. He sometimes didn't? But he did many times.  And being in a fucked up country she was a liability in the house. If she tried to escape this it will break her own family. She was being called as a sl*t throughout her lifetime by her own mother sometimes but nobody knew the reason was her own son.

I did everything I could and I am not sharing the details and if anybody recognises me here I am fking dead. If you know then shut your fucking mouth. 

Things changed. 

Now everyday I was trying to do things to lighten her day and mood and make her just feel precious and worthy to live in this world. I helped her with important life choices and college and everything. I made her take decisions which will make her confident and strong willing in the future and I think it did work sometimes because she was able to say no to her brother sometimes. 

However her mood was fucked up many times

Time passed and we fought over petty issues. Being elsewhere it wasn't possible to always meet and  my insecurities sometimes restricted me from meeting her and I just didn't, sometimes I felt I wasn't enougb and then then I felt more that I wasn't enough. I started hustling and doing things, graduating and getting a job but I had a burnout or something and I wasn't getting a job and it was going hellish. I was not able to figure out what I could do and what I can and whatever I did I was not good enough even though I trained for it and I was not earning for years like I did once in a while but there was not a major source of income.

I was breaking down mentally and having anger issues sometimes and we fought sometimes. And in helping her become confident and strong willed. She.. she did become what I wanted her to.. she became a better and stronge person. However after some time we fought again I guess

And someone suggested her to breakup, now this wasn't an ordinary suggestion. This guy had his mental health broken as well and he recovered from a breakup. So he ... Idk why... He used techniques which are used to help a person breakup on her.. like criticize the person everyday and write down reasons why you may not like them and this was going on for a long time and he just went on. He once felt guilty and told me and I said it's fine I forgive you but just don't do it.. 

And he did

She had a feud with her brother, this guy thought she fought with me because was off on chat. And he told her to breakup. And she did. 

This was the breaking point of my life

It has been 2 years since this event and I have still not recovered from this. The girl has moved on cosmically. Smarter, more beautiful, more strong-willed and has a job and a lot. But I broke down so horribly because I invested every bit of my emotion into her and I blame myself for the breakup every single day. Every night I cry to bed every morning I want my sleep to go on for ages. I have tried suicide 8 times and saved by God's mercy. I am unable to find light in my life. I called and messaged her so many times that she doesn't even respect me, having a fucked up mental health I was fired from jobs, I did try therapy but it all just came back and i don't have anything in my life right now. All my friends including him just stopped talking with me after the breakup. I have helped a real million people in the past with some wonderful movements which I started just so I can show her and make her proud of dating me and she was but those projects all shut down because I just don't have the will to live anymore.


I have skipped a lot of details because I can mess this up astronomically by going into details but to cut it short I am living in guilty for the past 2 or 3 years that I hurted a girl like her so much that she had to breakup with me and I have made my life so miserable after that I think given a few more months I might actually end myself
