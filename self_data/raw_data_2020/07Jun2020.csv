0,"Started talking to a girl I liked. 

Hung out several times. 

Both of us expressed how much we enjoyed hanging out. 

Hung out again leading to sex and cuddling.

Planned on hanging out again.

Boom! Friend zoned out of no where.

I’m trying to keep on hanging out with her and maybe setting up a fwb but who the fuck knows.

1,"The situation is as follows,

My father is coming home tomorrow from a business trip and I'm afraid he's going to hurt my family. 

He's threatening to take my niece away and send her to foster care, and destroy my mothers life. My niece lives with me, my mother (her grandmother), and my sister (the aunt). The birth mother (we'll call her the Birthgiver and who is my other sister) abandoned my neice barely at the age of 1 years old to be with her boyfriend.

My father has threatened to send her back to her Birthgiver even though she's EXTREMELY UNFIT and a drug addict. As well as neglectful when she was in her daughters life. My father will not EVER change is mind about the thought process of ""a mother should raise their child"", when clearly she doesn't want to.

As of right now too my parents marriage is basically shit and I wished they have gotten a divorce years ago. My dad favors his other family more, and says we ruined his life. He actually is currently WITH his other ""favorite family"" right now, or as he put it on the phone, ""I'm with MY family right now"".

He comes home tomorrow, and I'm afraid he's going to hurt my mom and sister and niece again. He has in the past and I have proof. I don't know if I should call the cops and give them a heads up about what's going to happen. Because really, I don't know if it'll case more harm than good to my niece. Because there is a GAL (Guardian ad litem), assigned to my nieces case right now for a battle of visitation right for the Birthgiver to see her daughter. Even though we NEVER denied her visitations, but she chose to live her life without her daughter in it.

I need to know. Will this cause more harm than good to call the police about the potential threat of my father ruining our lives, or stay quiet and wait to see what happens?

Please I need a family lawyers advice or someone who will know the best thing to do. Please.",07Jun2020,1
2,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

3,So my dad died about a month and a half ago. Since then fewer and fewer people are coming around the house and I’ve gotten to the point where I feel like only three people really want me around right now: my mom and my girlfriend’s two children. While most everyone else may want to be around people and feel wanted I just have the desire to be completely by myself and cut everyone off.

4,"I used to go to therapy about depression 10 years ago and quit because doctor said I've made some good progress and couldn't afford to pay anymore (and I lived in a 3rd world country which doesn't take depression as a serious illness)

everyday I think to myself 'Please don't let me wake up tomorrow' before went to bed  
I can't feel happy, there's only emotion of pain and uneasy feeling inside me. like I'm not complete

I'm a huge shut in but also try many things like trying to pick up hobby (sports , taking picture ,going to gym,hanging out with friends), got a gf(7 years and still together and yes I know this sound miserable to get gf for the sake of wanting to get out of depression)

8,"I recently have been getting back into gardening. I'm in the process of digging out old weeds and plants in my new home and I intend to make it into a whole herb garden. But, this time, gardening has brought me a weird feeling of a much greater sense of peace then when I've gardened in the past. 

These last couple of years, a lot of family events has brought me negativity and I've often felt out of control when it comes to my mental health. So, I was wondering maybe I feel more relaxed tending to plants because I get to forget how awful some things are. But, at the same time I forget the world when I'm sucked into my phone. I don't get why its gardening in particular, but it's been a really nice feeling.",07Jun2020,1

10,"Politics is like a game a very complex game with pieces and puzzles and knowing how to shift the tides, and like any game, the experience guy will almost always win.  

&amp;#x200B;

In politics you wont make everyone happy and you have to not only have a good platform but know how to push it forward. People want radical change, they want change to happen from one day to the next and they want it easily without problems and without pushback and in politics that doesn't happen. Politics in reality aren't based on feelings, voting is, but policy is another monster on its own where you have to compromise, make alliances and know what to say and how to respond. 

Biden is hated because he's a career politician and one of the best. He knows how politics works, he's been a VP and a senator he knows how international relations work. Very few countries have got it right like Germany with Merkel, politicians that play the long game and know how to circumnavigate the political world. Merkel, like Biden are boring, they know how to get policy across and that's something i've yet to see. Most people discuss that Biden talks slow but few have actually read and discuss his political positions and what and how he wants to accomplish things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Biden is a career politician that everyone hates because he ""speaks slow"" and compare him a lot to trump but almost no one talks about his political policies and where he stands. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trump in his 4 years as president has not accomplished not even one of his most prominent 2016 election promises. And sure the guy has tried, but he hasn't because he doesn't understand politics, or anything for that matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

if you had a job and were to hire someone who would it be? an experience guy who has delivered results or someone who has promised the world to you? 

I'm kinda sick people compare the two. Ones a competent person and one is still trying to get mexico to pay for the wall.

12,"I'm writing this here because this is the only time like I feel like I'll be able to express myself. Sure, I'll write letters but it's different.

Several years ago I was arrested and subsequently kicked out of my graduate program. Suddenly, I'm in over $200,000 in debt plus interest, without a degree, and financially destroyed.

I've been that way ever since. I'm currently sitting without A/C, a job, and I'm hungry. The only time I get money is when my parents send me some (pathetic considering I'm nearing 30). For months I've applied for minimum wage jobs to no avail. They think I'm ""overqualified."" I've even unpacked my resume, and still, I get rejected.

Also, I'm about to graduate with a bachelor's degree in accounting, and I want to do my master's in computer science, but a part of me feels hopeless. I'll never have a good life. I'll never have enough money to pay off this debt. I'll never have sufficient funds to pay for a mortgage, especially with my terrible/horrible/depressing credit score.

I've gone several months without hot water when it was cold, several months without a heater, etc. Now, it's hot as hell and I'm dying with no A/C.

I just think about how corrupted the police were, how unwilling to listen to the state board was that kicked me out of my program, and how evil the world is, in general, considering what's going on with Covid-19 and with the whole police brutality situation.

I'm seriously fed up. I've exhausted just about every imaginable resource that I could fathom, and have spoken with several attorneys about my situation, and all of them have agreed that ""what's done is done"" and although my case has been dismissed, due to state policy and the fact that I was placed in a pre-trial deferred adjudication classification, my school situation is basically hopeless and unredeemable. I cannot transfer or use those credits elsewhere.

I'll leave behind my parents, my wife, and my child. To be honest, my wife is the one who I blame for this because she made up a lie that caused me to get arrested in the first place. I honestly don't even want to get into it, but I have resentment built up over it, but I've done my best to forgive her to the best of my abilities.

I'll miss all of them. I have a love for all of them. Throughout my short period of time on this earth, I believe I got to experience true love when my child was born. That, and perhaps from my parents and my wife. I'm not quite sure, but I know that my love for my son is great. Everybody else is great too, but something about my relationship with him makes me happy.

I just know everybody will be in a better situation when I'm gone. I'm financially unable to do anything, and will probably end up homeless in time. I'd rather go out on my own accord than have to succumb to the hell of the earth and be under the mercy of others extending their hands to me. I've seen how people treat homeless people and I'm not about that life. I'd rather die with my dignity.

I'm tired of being tired. I'm tired of one disappointment to the next. I'm tired of one set of bad circumstances to the next. I'm tired of just about everybody and everything, and I'm tired of the fact that I'll never truly be happy.

I just would like to apologize to God, because I know that God has done a lot for me and that I did not do as much as I could have to make God proud. It's easy to want to do good, but when you're busy with the craziness of life, it's hard to always think about being righteous, going to sermons, praying, etc. I wish I could have spent more time doing these sorts of religious activities.

Peace to the world. Love you all. &lt;3",07Jun2020,1

18,"My friend and I are both members of the LGBT community. They advocate for very obscure, outrageous sexual / gender identities and pronouns that I believe just make a mockery out of queer people. I’m not talking about non-binary or anything, I can understand that, but I’m talking “autism gender”, “bun/bunself” pronouns, things like that. I thought we’d previously come to an understanding until earlier when I sent them a meme type post with identities so far removed from reality that I thought we’d both be able to laugh about it.

“Genderplaylist” 

Apparently, that’s a term that a very minuscule amount of people on tumblr use. They proceeded to go off on me. Never in all the time I’ve been friends with them have they ‘seriously’ told me to go fuck myself with such anger. They apologized for the ‘fuck you’, but still went about verbally castrating me for ‘invalidating other people’s identities.’ 

I’m not just hurt by how they spoke to me, but I’m astounded that they can seriously advocate for identities so far removed from reality that it’s not even funny. I hate the fact that as a not-straight person I’m lumped in with all the stuff that tumblr pulls out of it’s butt. 

Further more, I’m a person who occasionally enjoys dressing as the opposite gender, and when I do I don’t mind being mistaken for that gender- which I often am. I’m not uncomfortable with my parts, I just like to express myself, but my friend keeps trying to insist that I’m trans and genuinely doesn’t understand why that would make me uncomfortable. I advocate for trans people, but I’m just, not trans. I don’t know what to do. We’re actually both teenagers but they’re younger than me so I’ve been trying to chock it up to immaturity, but it’s becoming a lot for me to handle.

22,"It’s been awhile since my last post. Now that we’re in quarantine, I’ve done a lot of thinking. I’ve looked back on the years and have noticed something huge in my life. I’m scared of my dad. He never physically assaulted me or abused me in anyway. He just has a bad temper and can say awful things to my brother and I. My dad has always been a vocal person for as long as I can remember. When I was little, I never really thought about it to much because he was my dad. But, as soon as I got older (maybe 7-9) he grew more vocal towards my family. He would get annoyed by the slightest things and get so mad that my mom would have to step in and tell us to go to our room to block out the noise. If nothing was perfect for his standards, we would hear about it. As the years past, it only got worse. Nothing was ever good enough for him. I eventually stopped telling him things and tried to avoid him at all costs. I think now looking back, I crave positive attention because all I’ve ever received from him is negative feedback. I have older siblings as well. They have all moved away and have ceased contact with my family including my brother and I. I never understood why until now. They left because of him. When I was younger I was always afraid of my friends dads and would always refuse to talk to them or to ask them for anything. I think I got that from my dad being so mean to us that I wasn’t comfortable enough around them. (They were all nice people btw it wasn’t like they were mean or anything). My brother isn’t affected as much as I am. I’m guessing because he’s a boy and he just couldn’t care less. Around the beginning of quarantine, I was helping my brother move rooms since he wanted to move into the basement. I had to take an air conditioner and move it out of the way. I placed it on the mattress and chunks of dirt came out of it. My dad went Biserk and said “Your a fucking dumbass!!! How could you be so stupid”. And right after he left the room, I broke down into tears into my grandmas arms. After, I thought I was overreacting and my grandma told me not to accept the fact that he hurt me emotionally because it wasn’t my fault. I’ve been trying to research why I’m so scared of him and why I’m so shy and I can’t really find anything. Ive been told my whole life that I’m just a quite person. I came to accept it but I wanted to know why. I also believe that because of my father, I cannot lose any weight. I was debating weather or not to see a therapist but I’m to afraid to tell my mom that something is wrong with me. I realize that my problems shouldn’t be everyone’s concern and that their are far worse things going on rn. But, I really needed to write this. Not only for some answers, but for someone to help me.

26,"I have been taking antidepressants for more than 2 years without knowing it. What do I do?

  Two years ago, my parents, brother and I were helping a family relative (my grandmother's aunt, she's not that old) to move out of her appartement to a private elderly center (basically luxurious apartment for old people that can still take care of themselves). While packing the stuff, she frequently asked us if we wanted this or that thing because she wouldn't need/want it anymore, some paintings, tennis rackets, plates, etc.

  At some points she gave us those tin boxes. Inside where small white tablets with a minty smell. She told us they were mints with extra vitamins and that it's recommended to take only one per day. She gave us a couple and we continued our job. We didn't really thought about it. The box looked like the one you can find in a pharmacy, a normal looking box for vitaminized candy, and herself being a retired doctor, even if we didn't have any doubt in the first place, made us having trust into her.

  And so life went on. We kept a box of ""vitamins"" in the car and when it was empty, we replaced it with another one. In a little more than 2 years, we emptied 2, my family and some friends when they were with us. Until 2 days ago.

  My mom and I were at Canadian Tire to buy some stuff, and because of the Covid-19 pandemic, only one could get in, so I stayed in the car. I took the box. In orange is written ""WELLBUTRIN SR"" and in smaller characters ""Chlorhydrate de Bupropion"" (I'm from Quebec, so French for ""Bupropion Hydrochloride""). As someone who's really into science, I thought it was the scientific name of the vitamin, and googled it.

  I didn't told her already, I don't know how to react. Basically, Bupropion is an antidepressant and an adjuvant to quit smoking. It's also sometimes used to treat drug addiction. The only positive thing that I read in the Wikipedia article is that it wasn't that dangerous if ingested in to many quantities and that it had the same or lighter side effects than other antidepressants.

  So now, what do I do? Do I just throw the boxes away? Do I tell my mom (she's not positive towards mental stuff, so she will probably be enraged to know that she took ""joy tablets"" as she call antidepressants)? I'm sure my grandmother's aunt didn't knew it was antidepressants either, she worked for the medics and she's still active mentally, so she would have noticed. 

PS: I typed the exact same thing as written on the box, Wellbutrin etc... and the box didn't come up. I can only find normal pictures of what you would consider am antidepressants to be stored into, with the notice that they are antidepressants. I'm still trying to find what they are exactly. If you find a picture of something that fits the description, contact me.

  If there's any development, I'll write it below.",07Jun2020,1
27,"Do you know how fucking demoralizing it is that every time a bigot decides to shoot people or every time an incel makes a hateful remark, they are labeled as “mentally ill”?

Mental illness DOES NOT equate Facism, racism, misogyny, etc...

In fact, I have NEVER met a mentally ill person who believes any of those things. Most mentally ill people are marginalized and take up the plight of those who are also marginalized.

Are you telling me that ALL nazis and hateful ideology were commited by people that are mentally ill? If you believe this, you are putting people in a position where they cannot have sympathy for mental illness, because it means excusing hate.

Yes, severe mental illness can lead to violence. My mother is schizoaffective, with literal episodes of psychosis. She seems more like the people made fun of on [r/publicfreakout](https://www.reddit.com/r/publicfreakout/) than the people who carefully calculate elaborate plans of hate.

And guess what? Police and hospitals WILL NOT TAKE HER unless she is a threat to herself or others. Any violence committed by someone who is THAT mentally ill, meaning in the midst of psychosis, has probably had their family and friends pleading with the cops to get them help for weeks. My mother can burn our furniture in the pile in the back yard, but cops won’t take her because when asked “do you want to hurt yourself or others?” She says no.

So

1. Mental illness is not an excuse for hate
2. Mental illness is not a scape goat for hate
3. Any violence committed by the mentally ill is far more likely to be a problem of inadequate support by the government and hospitals meant to protect than the person sufferer's fault.

We’ll call his nephew nick. Well nick was a great friend and person for awhile, but he got into drugs and was suicidal. He was sent away by his family to get better. His uncle (we’ll call Tim) was very distraught by this and so was I. Now keep in mind, I have a boyfriend at this time and I still do to this day. And he has a wife the same age. His wife reached out to me when I was sixteen. I was still close to his family and saw her every now and then. She texted me saying that Tim isn’t doing good emotionally. She said that she was wondering if she could give me his phone number. I thought this was weird, but I know her quite well and trust her. I said yes and then I texted him saying hi. We chatted over text, and I let my boyfriend know. (Who has already met him.) He told me to be careful and I was. After texting each other every now and then, I asked if we could hangout with my boyfriend present. I told him I miss hanging out with nick and him. Tim asked his wife and she was uneasy at first, thinking it would be odd that they were hanging out with 16 year olds. She said it was fine eventually and that’s how it started. 

He has never shown signs of grooming. Which a lot of people ask about. I was groomed at a young age. I know the signs. I avoid the people who give off those signs. Even if they do it once. He has always made me and my boyfriend feel comfortable. Now that we’re all adults it feels great. People still question our friendship, understandably. Tim always feels so shitty when people do that. He has even tried to end the friendship. Yeah it sounds weird. Yeah it doesn’t happen a lot (sadly) that different generations are friends. He has been a mentor, a friend, and practically a big brother now. 

But my question is, how do I make people understand this? Any advice?",07Jun2020,1

All of the people not reacting to it, as in still standing up to it and not fighting back, and still going out and protesting, are much more patient than me, as well as more brave.

If I was out peacefully protesting and police decided to use force on me, as in rubber rounds, tear gas, and or beating with nightsticks I would absolutely get violet right back at them with just as much lethal force they are using.

It is absolutely fucked up beyond everything I've ever seen to have cops with 20+ units out shooting, and beating peaceful protestors. What kind of low life piece of shit scumbag do you have to be to shoot peaceful protesters? 

I'm just so sick of all the stupid shit going on, we've got a moron for a president, and cops beating and harming people in the streets.

We immediately get up and I put my cloths back on and she puts hers the sisters boyfriend told me to leave so I just did and then it was an awkward 10 mins of me being scared to go outside because I didn’t want to have any communication  with them after about 6 mins of waiting they came inside and didn’t look at me I just walked right out with my girlfriend and drove home while she got lectured by the sisters boyfriend and her

49," 

Context:  I (28M) got fit, joined clubs and followed the usual advice to get  better when I wondered why I got rejected all the time. It didn't bring  much, people don't consider me as friend or boyfriend material and I  spent my life lonely so far, never had a relationship or intimacy.

Without  saying too much, I told I had been single for a long while to some   acquaintances, one of these told me let's go eat together and consider  it a date. We talked more there, and I admitted it was the first date I  ever had. She dropped it there, saying that not having a single   experience at that age was a red flag. I asked some other people and   they told me the same, basically people in their twenties try, stumble,  but also learn what they can give and want in a relationship. People  want other people they can connect with, including on a relationship   level, and it was a red flag for them too.

In  short, my self-esteem that wasn't high before died that day and for the  sake of my mental health I just cut contact with the outside world. So  my question is, for those that had a very (very) long bout of intense  loneliness with no friends, SO or intimacy, how did you cope and make  peace with it?",07Jun2020,1

53,"Some aspects of it whereokay like the message and sentiment.  Bit I was bothered by the semi aimless nature of it.  There was a lot of people there but I felt like our numbers didn't get utilized, most people just stood around.  The organizers megaphone was too quiet so most people couldn't hear them.  

The crowd just cheered for anything and everything even tho they couldn't hear.  Which is good in regards to supportivness but bad in regards to knowing what was going on.  The organizers message wasn't reaching most people.

I wish they made up informational flyers for us.  Or at least had their demands on there banners and signs.  But all their signs were mostly cookie cutter BLM and silence equals violence messages.

A huge gripe I had with the demonstration was at one point some teenaged climbed on the monument and held up a BLM flag to it but they didn't have any tape.  Everybody cheered and took pictures. Someone offered them tape but they wanted to keep their flag rather than tape it to the monument.  But the crowd didn't boo them or anything.  That put me in a really bad mood because it was horribly superficial.  

Those teenaged deserved to get booed for not taping up that flag.  I was under the impression solidarity was important.  Not taking that tape was a weak move.  And the crowd was stupid, as well as the protest organizers who didn't speak up.  

I bet the cops on the roofs laughed at us for that.  It was an impotent display of slacktavism.

the last friend i ever had ended things last year (7 years down the drain). the only people in my life are my fiancé and those i work with.

however, i am a very shy person. i don’t have social media (aside from reddit). i love conversation, but have social anxiety and it’s hard to talk to people when the attention is on me, and not a topic; like the sims or a book. 

i’m very elated over this because i am deeply in love, and am in a healthy relationship for the very first time.

the biggest reason my family and friends have “dipped” is due to an abusive relationship i was in 3 years ago- which destroyed the relationships i had with others, and my mental health. i’m still not fully recovered, but just started going to therapy again (really happy about it).

so hello reddit, i’m engaged to the man i love, and i’m very happy. 

you should know that if you suffer from ptsd, bpd, mdd, or any other mental health issues- there will be someone that will make you love yourself again; and if you’re not looking for a someone, there will come a day where you love yourself again.

Whereas I see so many talented writers and painters and I can't seem to think that I won't be able to reach that stage without giving up a part of who I am or be good at them too late in my life. Do you guys have any advice about this?",07Jun2020,1
87,"To My Fellow Americans:

   Where is your patriotism? Your “proud” courage? Your integrity? Your humanity?

   Why do we antagonize further division: do we not dishonor our name-”united”- by doing so? We have strayed further apart as a nation: we have allowed our superficial differences -race, religion, political affiliation, opposing opinion- to cast aside our brothers and sisters; and cloud our judgement.

   Do you fail to realize the suffering, you cause or prolong, of your fellow patriots? Spinning wildly in circles, contributing to a never-ending cycle rather than changing the narrative?

   How many more years will it take for us to wake up, if not now? For us to abandon our materialistic habits we hope will fill the belly of your soul? Why have we denied the warmth of conversation? Positive, effective communication is the crop we must grow to fulfill the liberation our spirit seeks.

  Yet we have ignored its importance, perpetuating pain rather than support as a consequence: we have prolonged the deprivation of life -which depends on physical, emotional and spiritual health- liberty, and property.

  I will no longer remain silent while the country and people I love experience such cruelties.

  I will no longer stand idly by while thousands of Americans are overcharged for prescription drugs and hospital bills. Billing and insurance companies cost private insurers and providers $248 billion in excess: the top twenty-five percent of pharmaceutical companies report profit margins of twenty-two percent; $40 billion going to sales and advertising instead of research for new drugs. The denial or prevention of healthcare for our citizens is in violation of their right to life.

  I demand change, the mending of a broken system to better accommodate the needs of the people. We have the power to centralize a claim system; reducing third party costs: we have the power to reward and shift focus to efficient, affordable, quality care for all patients; to create a national, transparent set of payment requirements, integrate care networks: we have the power to impose a windfall tax on drug companies charging excessive prices and return their profit to consumers.

   How much longer will you watch your fellow citizens go without or be crippled under the cost of healthcare? 
   I will no longer stand idly by while my brothers and sisters go without shelter or food.
Are we really solving homelessness by placing bars on benches, spikes in front of stores; or are you fueling the cycle of poverty and crime? Why? Do you believe it is of their own will? Are you fearful of your tax dollars going to waste as the resources provided will be manipulated and taken advantage of?

   We are so quick to tell a person in an unfortunate circumstance to be strong and climb up through hard work and dedication, yet lack the instruction or guidance to do so. Who are you to deny your brothers and sisters the opportunity to reclaim their life when they have the will to change but do not know the way?

   We have the resources to construct Tiny Home Neighborhoods for twenty times less than a single shelter, involve community volunteers and homeless resident organization, and provide support for those actively participating and committing to change.

   I will no longer stand idly by while our youth, the future of our nation, are cheated out of a proper education. The corrosive nature of our system lays evident in the 2.1 million dropouts from age 16-24; yet we continue to ignore the interest and curiosities of the students and force certain subjects irrelevant to mental and physical self-management required for a healthy, rewarding life.

   Do we not progress by teaching our future leaders all knowledge of the subject they chose to pursue as well as the keys to a liberating life?

   We have the funds to establish a national education standard; to teach accurate, factual information related to a class; progress at the student’s pace; introduce mindfulness breaks, shorter days, and community involvement; to rid homework and standardized tests. Why do we refuse to change our approach and listen to our future generation’s needs.

   I will no longer stand idly by while my fellow patriots are stripped of their humanity and subject to cruel and unusual punishment. Is it not our goal to rehabilitate the brothers and sisters we’ve failed to support?

   Why are we so quick to deem offenders as evil, vile creatures; deny the complexity of our nature; when we have taught them violence and cruelty? 

   Is it not cruel and unusual punishment to be treated less than a dog? Why have we not bestowed the punishment all men must face; the demons he has avoided; in its stead?

   Strip him of his life, but give him a new one- change and restrict his schedule to reflect positive growth; guide him, teach him how to self manage his mind, body and spirit when he is ready and committed- and reward his success and progress with increased access to job, education, and leisure classes; allow offenders to hug and touch their loved ones under supervision. Is it not a fair, worthy endeavor to face the inner turmoil and change for the better?

   Have you forgotten their families? Do you look away while innocent citizens are sacrificing their livelihood for the welfare of their incarcerated loved ones?

   We have turned a blind eye to the $1.4 billion in fines from bail bond companies; the outrageous charge of $24.95 for a fifteen minute phone call specialized phone companies require; the $13,000 in court fines and fees on average; the substantial mark-ups or added service fees they are forced to pay approved vendors for restitution.

   We house 2.3 million people for $80 billion per year in correctional facilities, spend one hundred times more than the private industry’s profit on payroll for correctional employees, and increase recidivism through strict probation- which currently 3.6 million Americans are subject to.

   Creating a truly supportive community that supports self-management and respect can decrease repeat offenders and save $80 billion per year. We must tackle the root behind their actions and sentence those guilty of alcohol or drug abuse to rehabilitation, detoxification, and possible community service or jail time.

   I will no longer stand idly by as police brutality divides my fellow citizens and the executive branch‘s irresponsibility. My brothers and sisters are endangered because of lack of national police training and conduct standards.

  Is it not against their oath of honor by betraying public trust?

  We have the power to end the cycle; to demand entry tests determining ethical, moral, psychological, and physical aptitude; to demand field training as a requirement for all officers of the law before they gain authority which is to include multiple real-world scenarios, nonlethal versus lethal use of force, recognition of mental illnesses, negotiation techniques, the ability to remain calm in stressful situations, military grade threat level assessment, use of the Fitzpatrick 
Scale to describe skin tone, and public relations and renew every two years. 

  We have the resources to demand the required use of body and dash cameras throughout shifts; investigations of reported lethal or improper use of force as well as violations of the code of conduct. If found guilty of interfering with body or dash camera footage, intentionally turning the cameras off, or in violation of police conduct, then they shall be permanently suspended, immediately terminated, and possibly serve time in a correctional facility.

    I will no longer stand idly by as the jealousies and vices of those trusted to represent the will of the people steal my fellow Americans’ power and destroy our great experiment.

   Has the continual imbalance of the Legislative, Judicial, and Executive branches and the division of our nation caused by our outdated two-party system not proven to be evident?

   Super-PACs donate unlimited amounts of money to candidates so legislation benefits them and their agenda: Congressional members sneak in selfish, unnecessary expenditures to the bottom of bills: Cabinet members align their agenda with the president since he owns their seat: Supreme Court members sitting for life, stifling progress by denying fresh, current ideologies and are influenced by party affiliation rather than the Constitution: Lobbyists manipulate and bribe congressional members to push legislation, voting rights denied to our citizens, is this not against the fundamentals of our experiment?

   Have you forgotten the power delegated to you upon the absence of the federal and state government; the right to alter the constitutions of our government?

   We must establish an equal platform for all candidates to share their policies and plans in detail and expel the two-party system; encourage transparency through fact-checking; introduce term and age limits; use independent experts to review legislation being written to ensure the well-being of the people is not jeopardized; overturn executive orders when both the Cabinet and Supreme Court agree it is in violation of the Constitution or the people’s rights; allow the boards of departments to appoint their heads rather than the President selecting unfit friends for the seat; allowing the Cabinet to also select possible Supreme Court judges and imposing a twenty-five year term limit and an age limit of 60.

  We must improve voter access by expanding early voting to 45 days nationally, automatic registration with issuance of identification or driver’s license at age eighteen, creating disable friendly voting stations, allowing secure online and mail in voting, removing Election Day or declaring it a holiday, and educate lour citizens on the importance of voting.

   I will no longer stand idly by as my neighbors sacrifice their health and livelihood to earn a living by overworking. Is it not robbing our brothers and sisters from family and a healthy mind?

   We must demand national work requirements including a maximum work week of 40 hours, flexible scheduling, 6 hour shifts with 8 hour shifts as overtime, 10 hours as double time, and declaring 12 hour shifts illegal; mandatory paid leave of 10-14 days, mandatory parental leave of 6 months; establishment of a $13 per hour national minimum wage as well as Universal Basic Income.

    I will no longer stand idly by as the world I love withers from climate change threatening the eradication of humanity itself.

   We have the resources to demand mitigation of greenhouse gases, increase use of electricity and clean energy, maximize energy efficiency, restore and conserve ecosystems, localize farming to discourage waste, build strong, intimate relationships between farmers, businesses, and consumers.

    I will no longer stand idly by as nuclear weaponry and other weapons of mass destruction endanger innocent people.

    We must demand the eradication of all nuclear weaponry throughout the world: We do not want to die from unchecked emotions and issues from our own or other countries.

     I will no longer stand idly by as my nation is not enlightened about our feeble government that threatens the tranquil enjoyment of our rights.

     I ask you to stand with me, educate those willing to listen, unite to change the course of our nation and end the prolonged unnecessary suffering of millions of Americans- sons,daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers- our constant bickering perpetuates.

    We must stand united in cause and alter the constitutions of our government, for it is the root of the problems we face.

    Will you stand united with your fellow patriots; now that you know our nation’s future is in your hands? Will you cast away your differences of opinion and band together to pull out the roots; to look out for your brothers and sisters’ right to life, liberty, and property; to guide and support each other and strengthen our fraternal affection?

   Or will you further divide and betray your people, your nation, for your own selfish vices? Will you deny the love of your community and accept materialistic ventures in its stead because you believe the hole in your spirit will be fulfilled?

    If you have any courage, integrity, patriotism, or humanity, please stand with me; defend and support your fellow Americans and their rights to life, liberty, and property; ensure our children’s futures and serve as a city upon a hill.

  Please, wake up America.

  We need you more now than ever.


                                                                            Sincerely,

                                                Your fellow, and probably overly concerned citizen.

P.S. Sorry for the length. Had a lot to get out since I usually hold my tongue about stuff like this, but I’m tired of staying silent while the people I love turn against each other over lack of education and some superficial ass differences. If you consider yourself a person of reason; or a person who forms their desires in accordance with reason, but fail to receive matters of fact from others to heart or attempt to understand principles differing from your own, you’re nothing short of fucking useless.",07Jun2020,1

92,"If you don't want to report to both the mods and admins, then I'd advise using only www.reddit.com/report.

The benefits are as follows:

* Consistency. Admin removals tend to be more consistent than mod removals. I'm banned from a subreddit because I reported a bunch of comments that went against that subreddit's rules and then asked a mod if they wanted me to continue or not.

* Acknowledgment. You get spam in your inbox for every report but you also get a message on actioned reports. This helps ensure that reports are doing something.

* Uniformity. The rules at reddit.com/report are sitewide rules so you don't need to read the sidebar of every single sub you visit to know whether a comment you're reading can/should be reported there or not. As an example, insults and glorifying violence are both banned sitewide and so may be reported everywhere via that form. 

* Scope of retribution. Mods can only ban from one subreddit. Reporting to the admins means that users can get suspended from the site.",07Jun2020,1
93,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",07Jun2020,1

105,"We've evolved to have different features to help us survive in different conditions. 

People who've evolved closer to the equator originally had darker skin because the melanin (brown pigment) blocks harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. (light)

They found that the width of the nostrils is strongly correlated with temperature and humidity. Wider noses are more common in warm and humid climates, while narrower noses are usually found in cold and dry environments.

Eye sensitivity to light typically affects people with light coloured eyes because they have less pigmentation in multiple layers of the eye than those with darker eyes. Because of this, they are unable to block out the effects of harsh lights like sunlight and fluorescent lights which is why people closer to the equator evolved to have brown eyes, different qualities help us adapt to our environments helping us survive.

The world records in running tend to be set by black athletes and in swimming by white athletes. We show that this is predictable from physics. Locomotion is a ‘falling-forward ’ cycle, in which body mass falls forward and then rises again. Mass that falls from a higher altitude falls faster, down and forward. In running, the altitude (L 1) is set by the position of the center of mass above the ground. In swimming, the altitude is set by the upper body rising above the water, and it is proportional to H – L 1, where H is the height of the athlete. The center of mass in black people is 3 percent higher above the ground than in white people. This means that black people hold a 1.5 percent speed advantage in running, and white people hold a 1.5 percent speed advantage in swimming. Among athletes of the same height Asians are even more favored than white people in swimming but they are not setting records because they are not as tall.

Different features can give us an advantage, dominant genes help determine which features we inherited from our parents, people can instinctively look for similar qualities in their mates as themselves (or their parents) to increase their chance of passing on the same genetic traits that helped them survive.",07Jun2020,1

110,"idk where to post this, im not asking for advice bc there's really nothing that can be done, i just felt like sharing this story.

my bf is 20, when he was 3 his parents got divorced. eventually his dad remarried with a woman we can call J. she seemed to be the perfect woman, always happy and cheery, so much that it almost struck my bf the wrong way. she seemed a bit too happy, almost psychotic.

they eventually had 2 kids, after this J started behaving really weird. she would constantly lie and talk shit about my bf's dad. one day while visiting tunisia, where they both come from, J planted cocaine in bf's dad's car and payed some cops to arrest him (yes, stuff like this is possible in tunisia bc of corruption) luckily enough he got out of there without consequence, but he decided to divorce J.

while in their mother's care, the kid's kindergarten techers noticed bruises on the kids and CPS was contacted, it was proven that J was behind the bruises. J lost custody of the kids and they were now fully in my bf's dad's care.
after this she literally went insane.

she started hanging out with my bf's mom, she convinced her that it was my bf's dad's new gf that was behind the bruises and made my bf's mom feel bad for her. one day they were sitting in a car and since it looked sketchy some policemen came. turns out J had done it again, she had planted cocaine in the car and her plan was to get away and contact police to get my bf's mom arrested, but instead they were both arrested, her plan didn't go as she had hoped.

since J have had many drug charges against her, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison. my bf's mom was sentenced to 1 year probation. my bf's dad decided to let J have the kids one last time before she went to prison (he is way too trusting and cares too much for people) so J took them to tunisia to stay with her and her dad, she wasn't allowed to be alone with the kids. however when it was time to go back home, J messaged bf's dad saying that he'll never see his kids again and that she was planning on raising them in tunisia.

this was 5 months ago. they are still in tunisia. they are 5 and 7 years old and they are in an awful enviroment in a super corrupt country with a WANTED CRIMINAL. and there is no way to get them back. in tunisia you can get away with murder if you have the money. she met some rich dude who helps her pay off the police in order for her to keep the kids she don't even have custody of.

it's so upsetting that my bf's dad moved here to sweden to get a better life for his kids and to raise them in a safe enviroment, just for some maniac to kidnap them and take them to the place he wanted to protect them from. i'm just so angry abt this and wanted to rant. if you've read this far, thank you for litsening &lt;3",07Jun2020,1

I will not have a boyfriend that says and continues to call my friends whores. It is immensely disrespectful to my friends, to me and to women everywhere. What you said is incredibly hurtful and demeaning, actions like that hurt women and create a world of slut-shaming. In the end you threw a low blow and it shows how immature you are. 
I’ve had these friends for years and years, they aren’t going anywhere they will always be there for me. When you disrespect them, you disrespect me. 
During our relationship you have; lied and created a false narrative that we were exclusive, bought nudes from an ex, lied about it while having me venmo you back for dates, forbid me from talking to my ex while you were actively talking to other girls and buying nudes from your ex, tried to make me feel bad about what I wore and when I post pictures of myself, tried to control me talking to one of my best friends of 10 years because he was a guy, forced me into sex when I was not comfortable with it which you knew of, sabotaged my birth control (taking off the condom without me knowing, after I told you I wasn’t on my normal birth control), disrespected my nieces/nephew, and more. 
All in all you treated me awfully, you’ve said hurtful things about my friends and family, you gaslight me and when I speak up to people who care about me they look at me concerned because none of the things you do to me are okay. 
Im telling you all this because I hope that you see that these things are not okay and to never treat anyone else like that again.

120,"Once upon a time when I was teenager, I met a bunch of racist Korean kids. Generally speaking I don't have a problem with Koreans. They make good food, their culture is interesting and generally speaking they are good people.

It just sucks that my perception of Koreans changed just because I met a few bad ones. Now I don't know if they are all like that, or if it's just a small minority of them like that. 

As I'm typing this out I now realize it's just a small minority that's like that. But man, for a long time it hurt.

Racist people suck. And they're annoying. Fuck. If you're gonna be racist either keep it to yourself or do so with other low minded people.

121,"My story goes like this, I used to be a gifted kid. When I reached high school something changed within me, I became so dumb and socially awkward, my mind was constantly foggy and I hated my existence. I found ways to cope by watching movies and learning english (I'm Moroccan btw). I did college and graduated despite everything (was a nightmare tbh ..I had to squeeze the last bits of brain I had left). My working experience is a disaster, I had to quit two times because my head couldn't keep up with it. My only chance at a cure came through the hands of a chiro whom I'm grateful, he did some few cracks along my cervical, and I felt absolutely amazing and my fog was long gone, I could finally be my smart myself and be proud of it
. But damn my happiness couldn't last long enough, fast forward 1month and a half I was taken by a sudden urge to sleep, so I took a late nap (round 5ish) and woke up 3hrs later feeling messed up and back to square one. Everything I had built was suddenly smashed and I would give anything to have that feeling of normalcy back 😩 Now I'm 25, I have already lost two jobs and lost my boyfriend because of it as it is, ENOUGH.",07Jun2020,1

Even I tried reaching out myself to get past that perspective falacy and they (a couple of my better friends) didn't even read my message.

124,"What can I say? Had the perfect day with my boyfriend. Being in an interracial relationship (I'm Asian American, he's White) while the Black Lives Matter movement is picking up heat has caused tension both in and out of home. We've been doing a great job keeping our conversations about our perspectives pretty respectful, but boy did we need a break. (BTW our views aren't polar opposites, we just both do allyship differently) 

It started off with a sleep over in the living room the night before where I fell asleep during the 13th documentary on Netflix (I'd been up since 6am) and him calling me falling asleep predictably cute. Cuddles and time annoying each other in the morning and then we did our own thing for a few hours. 

Some miscommunication lead to tense moments during lunch, which you'd think would've ""ruined"" a perfect day, but it didn't. Because we resolved it quickly and take pride in how much our conflict/resolution skills have improved over the past 3 years. 

Then we went shopping (we currently don't live in America); he sat down and watched me try on shoes for an hour haha. We got home, ordered dinner, cuddled, and binge watched Community for like 4 hours.

We're coming up on 3 years next week and are planning to have the marriage conversation soon! A day like today reminded me how much I love him and a week like last week reminded me why I love him. I'm so excited for what's in store for us!",07Jun2020,1

126,"I don't know where to post this and I just want an opinion from other people.

I realized, or rather accepted something that has been affecting a lot of my relationship with people. This is a bit messy because my mind is working so fast as I am typing this out but I hope you can understand and reply with your thoughts or advice.

Okay I don't know where to begin but ever since I can remember, I can never keep up with friends. I've lost and cut off 2 good friendships and realize It was more of a me problem than what happened during that time. But now, I didn't want to lose the remaining 2 close friends I have because I know they're genuine but i'm just a difficult person to be with.

It's like this. I have close friends. They post about their other friends. I feel this ugly emotion inside me. (its jealousy but more on that later). OR they go out with other people without me and I feel this ugly emotion again. Then it affects my way of socializing with them. Like I feel like a victim but in truth i'm just overthinking. I've lost 2 people because of that. 1, because she was a magnet of a lot of people and I felt like I was pushed aside. 2, I guess related to this but what happened was different.

Last week of April, I had a breakdown. Nothing major but a wave of sadness type of thing. I felt frustrated because even though we were in quarantine I felt like I was alone and can't reach out to my friends. So I decided to lowkey ghost them. Like mute them and our gc. It was easy and sad because they didn't reach out to me. It felt a bit good? Like I didn't feel pressure with our friendship. My goal was to stop feeling hurt whenever I see that I had no new messages from them.  I promised I would reply to them once I felt that if I checked , I wouldn't feel disappointed there was no message. It lasted for months until now because I still felt hurt a lot of times. After ignoring my message requests, I checked and one of them (lets call him Trey) reached out a lot of times and even used another account and one (let's call her Ash) reached out just yesterday. I planned on writing letters to them about my true feelings about everything that's happened.

Okay before I go on about my realization one last part of story time. I apologize if this is so long. So what happened was, before all of this. We were 4 people. Me, Trey, Ash and another one. I had to cut off the other friend because of our toxic friendship and bla bla its too long to mention here. I didn't ask for them to choose between us (although my insecure self knew people liked her more than me because she was just more social than me). However, Ash promised that she would stay by my side because she knew what it felt like to cut off someone. Well, she didn't. I knew it was difficult for her because she was going through stuff too and she was just confused on whatever's happening. Although I think i'm speaking on her behalf here. We did talk and well our friendship downgraded? It's not the same as before. I was closest to her in our friend group and well after everything that happened, our friendship was affected and I kinda understand. I think she's still sorting out her own problems but I haven't really talked to her. But I still love her and still want to continue to be her friend. I just hate how awkward I am with her. Or how much I overthink about our friendship.

So to continue, I never got to write the letters. I kept putting them aside because I thought there was so much time. But, I just keep on procrastinating and instead just ran away from the feelings I hated. Now, I finally talked to Ash and Trey after 2 months. At first, I felt anxious and even sad. I missed them so much but our friendship really has turned into something different and it's because I realized (and realizing more as i'm typing this) a lot about myself and my relationship with them. I guess the time apart did help in a way that made me focus more on myself than the one who I am when i'm with them. I realized that i'm jealous. i'm jealous of the way they easily make friends with other people. It made me feel insecure that because they were meeting a lot of people, I was being swept aside. I realized I felt that I was being left alone. I felt this strongly with people who i'm closer with, because, well, i'm closer to them and I felt that them meeting new people means losing people i'm close with which means me feeling lonely. This jealous feeling is not unfamiliar rather I was aware but not fully accepting this ever since I was young. I don't know how I got this but yeah it affected a lot of my relationships with people. So yeah. A big revelation rather than a realization.

However, because of someone, I realized that being an introvert is okay. That even though I am not like my friends who are good at making friends. It's okay i'm like this. I'm not alone. I have friends. I need to accept that they have other people but that doesn't mean i'm being left alone. This will take time to learn and accept but this is me. It will hurt at first because i'm not used to it. Its okay that I don't have a big circle of friends. I have friends that I can rely on.

Adding on to this, as an introvert with social anxiety. I still haven't figured out that part yet. It's difficult to accept this because not only is it difficult for me to make friends, its difficult for me to go on daily life without suffering from being nervous around people. Especially not meeting people after a long time, I know its hard for me to socialize even with close friends and I think that's why I would need assurance from people. It's just really hard to maintain friendships when i'm like this because I really cannot reach out first. I used to do it before but I'm not the same person as I was before and I need to accept that. Now I don't know how i'm gonna ask for those assurance without feeling weak and insecure. I'm still figuring out about myself and accepting the way I am. I haven't even thought deeply about having social anxiety that's affecting other aspects of my life.

So I guess the point of sharing all this is, is because I haven't had anyone to talk to about this. I've kept this with myself for so long because I didn't know who to share it with. I've always wanted to talk about this with other people so my feelings are validated or someone can correct me or tell my why am I feeling this way. If you read until here, thank you so much for being patient. I hope you can share your thoughts, opinion or even advice.

For context:

My GF (18F) is now in a really terrible mood (think mood swing + COVID madness + natural problems). She is really upset because most of her friends kind of don't text her on their own. Apparently only I and her other two male friends do tend to text her and initiate conversations and such. She says she's tired of texting first and is disappointed in her other friends. 

To be fair, her 18th B-Day was during the pandemic and her celebration plans have been shot at least twice due to people having exams and such.

I did try to console her that in some cases i know that those people would put themselves in harm's way for her but she claimed it didn't mean anything to her since they can't text first and obviously don't care about her. She was pretty affected by the mood and such but sparked a question, or maybe two.

130,"Searching for a job is the most infuriating thing ever to me. Applying for jobs feels like a full time job for me right now. 

I hate having to create a profile on a company’s website to upload my resume, only to be forced to hand fill in the same exact information right after. 

I hate having to tweak my cover letter over and over again depending on what I think a particular company is looking for. Especially knowing that they probably won’t even look at my cover letter. 

I hate how half of the jobs don’t even list how much they pay. I have an interview tomorrow and have no clue what the pay is because it does not say. It might be a total waste of a day and unnecessary stress if it doesn’t pay enough for me. 

I hate having to put on a bubbly persona that feels fake in an interview. I’m pretty quiet most of the time and it feels unnatural to have to amp it up and act outgoing. I hate how being an introvert always seems like a negative when job hunting. 

I hate situational questions such as, “tell me about a time you had an issue with a coworker...” and having to guess what kind of answer they’re looking for. 

I hate how you can spend so much time applying for a job, doing multiple interviews with the company, taking tests for them, etc. only to not even get an offer. Then you’re back to square one. 

I hate that after all of this, you may end up getting a job that you’ll absolutely hate. When you accept an offer, you have no idea if you’re going to end up hating your coworkers, the company’s culture, or the work itself until you’re already stuck there. 

I hate to be so negative, but it’s so soul crushing that I do all of this to get a job where I’ll sit at a desk for 8 hours a day and hardly have time to do anything in life that I enjoy. I’ll sit in traffic, sit inside all day, sit in more traffic, and get home when it’s dark. Then I’m too pooped on the weekends to want to do anything. I can’t even enjoy myself on a Sunday because I’m just worrying or dreading work for the next week.

Title says it all. When I was an edgy teen, I would browse 4chan for the memes and ridiculousness. Eventually I started lurking /pol/ out of morbid curiosity. I never fell too deep in the /pol/ rabbit hole or anything (I never believed any of the jew conspiracy shit), but I remember one time several years ago I made an extremely vile racist post just for the hell of it. I definitely didn't mean it (I know this is something a genuine racist would say to absolve themselves) and I'm not really sure why I did it tbh. I think I just wanted to say the most offensive thing I could. I felt very weird afterwards and never posted anything like it again. I eventually stopped using 4chan altogether because of how toxic it is. 

For some reason, I can't seem to forgive myself for this awful post I made. I know I didn't directly hurt anyone by posting it, but still. It kind of makes me nauseous thinking about it, because I've grown a lot as a person and I can't even imagine the pain I would cause if I said something like this in the real world, especially because I have so many friends from different racial backgrounds. I've tried really hard to offset my past negativity with positive actions, like donating to charities and volunteering to help those in need. Still though, I can't stop thinking about this awful shit I said. I don't know if I'm overreacting or what, and I don't even really know why I'm posting this here.

I’ve been verbally abusive in relationships and yelled at my friends and girlfriend even over things like a damn video game. “Why didn’t you heal me are you retarded???” 

Today I made a new account on a video game that I’ve been playing for 3 years. I’m already banned from chatting for a day because I was shit talking all of my teammates who are new to this game. 

My mom got a dui and asked me to help her pay rent that month because she had fees from the dui. All my life she’s supported me 100% financially and emotionally. Always took my side.  Well I was in an awkward spot because I had student loans and other bills to pay but I agreed.  Then one day she could tell I was annoyed so she told me to get over it. I kinda snapped and said “ I have to pay for ur shit because you’re a grown woman who acts like a child” 

She cried. 

When people ask me for help at work I try to bottle it but I get annoyed at that too. Not in a cocky way but I’m good at my job. I get top performer awards every quarter.  Everyone comes to me for help and for the most part I’m glad to help but some days I’m just thinking to myself “JEsus Christ why can’t you do this???” And sometimes it comes out in my tone when I’m explaining something to them. 

I realize all the time I’m an asshole but idk how to fix it. I apologize to everyone I’m mean to or have an outburst towards, but after 100 outbursts they probably won’t be inclined to accept my apology. 

I’ve been thinking of anger management or therapy but I don’t see how it’ll help. I talk to people about my emotions / life / problems and I’m still a jerk.  Talking doesn’t seem like a cure for me. 

Me yelling at people who are brand new to a video game is stupid and I realize it. They’re new, they don’t know how to play. Yet that doesn’t stop me from flaming them for being bad.  And i made the new account because I’m bad against people on my own level so it’s even more hypocritical of me to flame people for being bad.  But even though I realize this, I never stop.

150,"Why good posture matters

You’ve likely heard about the many benefits of having good posture. Not only does it allow you to develop strength in the areas of your body that experience the most chronic pain (aka your lower back), it also helps reduce the tightness in your neck, shoulders, and upper back.
But did you know good posture can also:

boost your energy levels

help you breathe better

allow you to maintain proper form when exercising

reduce your chance of injury when performing physical activity

make you appear taller

The benefits of sitting up straight extend beyond meditation. Research suggests that we feel better about ourselves and our endeavors when we sit—or stand—at attention.
Researchers found that people who were told to sit up straight were more likely to believe thoughts they wrote down while in that posture concerning whether they were qualified for a job.

On the other hand, those who were slumped over their desks were less likely to accept these written-down feelings about their own qualifications.

The results show how our body posture can affect not only what others think about us, but also how we think about ourselves.

 In addition, good posture is associated with a number of other health benefits, and has been proven to be better for your muscles, joints, and ligaments. Bad posture, on the other hand, has been linked to tension headaches, back pain, reduced lung capacity, arthritic joints, digestive problems, and a slew of other ailments.

So the next time you’re feeling anxious or insecure, sit up straight and hold your head up high. There may be something to the “fake it 'til you make it” approach after all.

In reality it's actually quite harder to keep a good posture all the time we always tend to slouch for comfort but that leads to several problems as discussed above.

154,"Tl;dr at bottom. Sorry about her the length. 


Hello all. Will probs delete this in a week or so. Just wanted to get a general thoughts or opinions. I was kinda blown away from my boyfriend’s reaction. He was super upset for me and didn’t understand why I haven’t talked about it before or said anything to my parents growing up. It also confirmed his opinion of not liking my family. I love him and he is pretty protective of those he loves. We have been together for 6+ years and talked about getting married soon, so I could understand his worry having to be around them. 

Backstory: my brother (born 2 years before me)  was a very premature baby (this plays a part in my story I promise) and was smaller than my dad’s hands in pictures. It was a complicated birth. When I was born, my mom said it was scarier because everything went so smoothly. She was waiting on pins and needles to go wrong. Since I was born, my brother has never been “fond” of me. Even in the hospital room there is a picture of my mom holding me as a newborn and my bother screaming to be in her lap instead. I believe they never prepared him for a sibling and he was overwhelmed by the new addition (me). Growing up my brother and I were total opposites. My brother would wear his shoes and I would throw mine off and run barefoot. He loved playing video games and I loved going with my mom for a walk or playing outside. I have had a lot of friends while my brother was often taken advantage of by friends. We are polar opposites. Meanwhile, while growing up this premie baby grew up to be over six foot tall and over 300 lbs. We would run into friends and family not seen in a while, then my parents would introduce us and make my brother “stand up” to show how tall he is. He seriously sprouted over night, tall and wide. I don’t say that to make fun of him. He is my blood and I know I am supposed to respect him but I don’t. He used this to his advantage to repeatedly take advantage of me. Our fights were vicious. I am not the one to back down from a fight, and neither was he. I have had multiple black eyes because the music was too loud when watching TV. It would start as screaming matches and end in him holding me down with all of his weight. The most vivid memory when this started happening was the first time it happened when I was around 6. 

It was late at night and playing outside on a swing set. I ran into him off of the slide. He, thinking I did it on purpose, started pushing me to the ground. I remember thinking I HATED THIS. I now have a fear of tight spaces because of him holding me down and then pushing me down repeatedly every time I got up. This went on for a while. When I finally was able to roll away, I went running inside and told my mom. My brother blamed it on me. It was and has always been my fault in his opinion. Now matter what he has gotten in trouble for or what I have tried to get him in trouble for. I wasn’t always the nicest sister, sometimes I would steal and I know I would definitely fight back unfortunately not well. Due to his size most of the time, I either had to figure out a way to run away or find my parents. I have been hit in the stomach with a shovel (for wanting to wash my hands while picking oranges in our backyard), pulled out of my car (because I was a new driver and wanted to drive), his in the face with a desk vacuum cleaner (for leaving it out after he put it up), etc the list is endless. Point is my brother would beat me up and would multiple times get away with it. 

Here is where it gets a little fucked up: So in the 90’s we had a huge satellite dish in our backyard. I want to explain this because, I have numerous times growing up, walked in on my dad watching porn. On the computer, tv, magazines, although my parents always made sure to lock the door when they did it...thank god! Lol anywho, remember when channel 3 was input channel and you could get the satellite channel? When my brother discovered that late at night, he called me into his room, and made me watch it with him. I even remember the images and seeing them for the first time. I remember asking my brother what they were doing...he said plainly having sex. As he sat me down, I remember him trying to pull down my pajamas. I got away when my mom called upstairs saying she could hear us and go to bed. I ran to my room very grossed out. I was around 11 at the time and my brother was 13. For the next 3 years after this I hated going swimming with my brother. I remember the first time he flipped a pool float chair over (where it had a echoing space under and was always fun to hide under if not trying to drown while playing). He told me he wanted me to kiss him like the ladies on TV dad was watching. I remember feeling his tongue in my mouth and knowing this was wrong. I remember pulling away and him pulling me back. He had put a pool thermometer in his pants and wanted me to touch it and suck it underneath the water. During this time growing up, my parent were confident and so were we in our swimming abilities to be left alone. When it was too cold to swim, he would make me watch what was on Tv (the porn our dad was watching), beat me up, and summer would come around. This happened repeatedly for about 3 years from 11-13. This happened to stop when I joined band and as many after school activities. Basically was out of the house as much as possible. 

We still fought like crazy and to this day still do. Just last Thanksgiving, he threw a tennis shoe at me in front of my parents, because my dog jumped on his balls while he was laying down. I immediately threw it at his face and we both started screaming at each other. It sent my parents both into a flying rage that resulted in my mom crying on the bathroom floor in the middle of cooking the turkey. Even in that moment, I still couldn’t tell my parents. I told my boyfriend all of this one night after drinking and he was shocked. He said he could understand some of the emotional sides of me better and some of my OCD tendencies. I believe this is why sometimes, I really struggle in a crowded room and preparing myself to one day have children. I can’t get over this hurdle of having a son first or worrying if the same thing will happen to my daughter. My parents still don’t know to this day, yet it’s easier to tell my boyfriend and the internet or ask for a close friend’s opinion. This would be my 3rd time talking about it to anyone. Sometimes, I sit back and think, that couldn’t have happened. They are some of the most vivid memories I have of my brother. Mainly because every time we were in the same room together, it’s been a bad experience. Those memories are also pretty hard to forget and keep resurfacing. During quarantine and being more lone with my thoughts and memories, I just don’t know what to think of it all. Lastly, I have never thought of being a victim of abuse, except when my boyfriend said it. He did recommend going to therapy with me (just the first session) so I have someone who’ll be there for me that I know. I just don’t know. 


Tl;dr: My over 6 foot tall repeatedly beat me up and took advantage of me and our TV showing porn. I never pictured myself as victim or abuse. Now during quarantine, the thoughts and memories are starting to effect me and my emotions. My boyfriend was shocked and really didn’t know how to handle the information. Never told parents. Next steps, would be welcomed.",07Jun2020,1

157,"Okay, friends. It’s not often I feel the need to share my opinions over any media platform. But this is a whole new level of shit I cannot idly tolerate. The way (some) police have responded to peaceful protesters across the US is truly sickening. Every day I see more and more videos of cops violently attacking protesters who aren’t looting or causing destruction, attacking the press, the medical tents, and even bystanders WHO WEREN’T EVEN PROTESTING! These are WAR CRIMES! It seems to me they feel that they are at war with the general population. These are the people protecting us??? Who raid homes without a warrant, shoot the family dog, and kill anyone at will??? Who kill unarmed black people who may not have reacted perfectly calm with a gun in their face??? How is anyone supposed to feel safe when this shit keeps happening??? We need real, radical systematic change, and FAST! We need to properly vet and train new applicants with more focus on mental health, de-escalation and community building, rather than the doctrine of “shoot first, ask later,” and gaining control of every situation through force. We need to get rid of qualified immunity so that officers can be held accountable for their crimes. Too many power-hungry cops use the badge as a free pass to act with impunity, and the worst that happens to them is they get fired, and are almost never prosecuted. The badge should be an honor and a privilege, not as a shield from the law. To be clear: most cops are well-intentioned. But the few with short tempers and violent impulses have to be weeded out. It should be on the good cops to call out the actions of the bad ones. Otherwise, they themselves are culpable. 

If there’s anything these past few weeks have shown us, it’s that even though there’s always someone recording, these violent cops just don’t seem to care. Nothing’s going to happen to them, and they know it. If we keep ignoring this unprovoked brutality when it’s all out in the open like this, what can they be allowed to get away with in the future? 

The president has commanded the police force and national guard to “dominate” these protesters, while all 50 states and 18 countries showed their support. Now, who do you think is on the right side of history? 

I see one of two outcomes of these protests; either real systematic change, or further constriction of our constitutional rights. We’re seeing it now with this widespread violation of our first amendment rights. We must be careful in how we deal with this, because once freedoms are taken, they are generally not given back. I don’t want to sound pessimistic, but if we don’t wake the fuck up soon, I see a dark, dark time ahead for ALL of us. 

Think of all the times and places throughout history where the government has gained more and more control of its citizens until finally reaching an Orwellian nightmare. I’m not saying we are headed for that, but we must be aware of the possibility. And I’m starting to see warning signs. As the saying goes, “We must learn from history, or else be doomed to repeat it.” We’re like the frog in a slowly boiling pot of water, who only realizes it’s burning after it’s too late. 

I’m optimistic though. Remember—we are a country founded by rebels! It is not in the American spirit to lay back and allow the ruling class to take over every aspect of our lives and suppress our voices through fear. I like to think we collectively are too diverse, too complex, and too aware of what’s happening to fall under the spell of a single authoritarian rule. We are a melting pot of diverse cultures, backgrounds, and personalities, and we are in dire need of each other. It’s time we realize that, or risk everything our founders and forefathers bled for. This goes beyond any partisan issue. It’s time we come together now. The world is watching. 

But please, remain nonviolent. This is not a call to violence, but a call to action.",07Jun2020,1

170,"It’s been awhile since my last post. Now that we’re in quarantine, I’ve done a lot of thinking. I’ve looked back on the years and have noticed something huge in my life. I’m scared of my dad. He never physically assaulted me or abused me in anyway. He just has a bad temper and can say awful things to my brother and I. My dad has always been a vocal person for as long as I can remember. When I was little, I never really thought about it to much because he was my dad. But, as soon as I got older (maybe 7-9) he grew more vocal towards my family. He would get annoyed by the slightest things and get so mad that my mom would have to step in and tell us to go to our room to block out the noise. If nothing was perfect for his standards, we would hear about it. As the years past, it only got worse. Nothing was ever good enough for him. I eventually stopped telling him things and tried to avoid him at all costs. I think now looking back, I crave positive attention because all I’ve ever received from him is negative feedback. I have older siblings as well. They have all moved away and have ceased contact with my family including my brother and I. I never understood why until now. They left because of him. When I was younger I was always afraid of my friends dads and would always refuse to talk to them or to ask them for anything. I think I got that from my dad being so mean to us that I wasn’t comfortable enough around them. (They were all nice people btw it wasn’t like they were mean or anything). My brother isn’t affected as much as I am. I’m guessing because he’s a boy and he just couldn’t care less. Around the beginning of quarantine, I was helping my brother move rooms since he wanted to move into the basement. I had to take an air conditioner and move it out of the way. I placed it on the mattress and chunks of dirt came out of it. My dad went Biserk and said “Your a fucking dumbass!!! How could you be so stupid”. And right after he left the room, I broke down into tears into my grandmas arms. After, I thought I was overreacting and my grandma told me not to accept the fact that he hurt me emotionally because it wasn’t my fault. I’ve been trying to research why I’m so scared of him and why I’m so shy and I can’t really find anything. Ive been told my whole life that I’m just a quite person. I came to accept it but I wanted to know why. I also believe that because of my father, I cannot lose any weight. I was debating weather or not to see a therapist but I’m to afraid to tell my mom that something is wrong with me. I realize that my problems shouldn’t be everyone’s concern and that their are far worse things going on rn. But, really needed to write this. Not only for some answers, but for someone to help me.

177,"What happened to Floyd was disgusting beyond description. I do not dispute that in any way and am **NOT** trying to equivocate their fates.

But man, what a horrible thing to happen to a teenager. This kid grew up thinking the cops were the good guys and immediately thought ""this guy is breaking the law, I need to get the cops to fix that!"" He was probably naive to the evil of the Minneapolis Police Department, and had absolutely no idea what chain of events he would set in motion. Yes, it was against store policy to call the police for counterfeit bills. But that should be a minor mistake that deserves a reprimand, not a life-defining moment that will haunt you forever. 

I say this because there was a time when I could've seen myself doing this. I worked at a gas station and sometimes had to call the police, not realizing they weren't really any help at all and just made things worse (which I clearly see in retrospect). If I didn't know what cops do to black people (and I didn't for a LONG time), **I** could've been the one who made that call.

I know some people probably want to demonize him because George Floyd would be alive if he hadn't done that, but again: he probably thought the cops were the good guys.

The best way to describe me is that I'm basically just a slightly higher functioning version of ChrisChan. If you don't know who that is, look them up. 

I'm autistic, so I may act/talk/think more like a child than an adult. It may seem weird but it's just how some of us are. 

I'm also bipolar so please excuse my mood swings and such. I can't afford health insurance so I can't get medication or see doctors. (Also I did that stuff for years when I had insurance- it never helped.)

Sadly, I don't have any local real-life friends, because God hates me or something idk. I have very few online, who usually just ignore me and consider me to be a burden, like everybody does. 

I do want more friends, but I'm kinda picky with who I talk to. I ask that you not try to force your opinions on me, and be as kind and understanding as possible. 

I'm a Bernie voter, in favor of social democracy for the USA. I am also an anti-SJW though, so keep in mind I'm not head-over-heels for much social justice rhetoric. 

**I will NOT tolerate any anti-white and/or anti-male rhetoric, nor negatively stereotyping every U.S. American.**

I didn't choose to be any of these, and that last thing can technically be changed. Just learn to get to know individual people and be nice. 

Also, I am gay, but please don't get creepy and pervy if I say no to you. I'm not into ""older"" men, or very heavy-set men, or very feminine/cross-dressing men. And just not attracted to most men in general. 

That said, I am against gender roles, so I'm not masculine at all really. Please accept this. 

Due to my depression, I don't do much and sleep all day when I'm not working whatever minimum wage job I have at the moment. I don't have any talents or hobbies. 

I play a few video games and my favorites are platforming and adventure games I guess, I prefer older games to newer ones. I don't like shooting or RPGs much. 

I also like language/linguistics (I'm monolingual though, sorry), and pop and indie music. 

Also I am a furry with an anteater fursona. :&gt;~

I do have a few triggers and anxiety, but they're rather common things that most people don't like to see/talk about honestly. If I feel uncomfortable about something, I'll try to politely tell you and we can talk about something else.
