I Used to be a professional makeup artist educated at Blanche MacDonald. I got my dream job at 23 from an unexpected interview.  I believe in giving a hundred percent or not bitching about the consequences. I used to love to play music, piano, guitar and singing. Creating almost anything and visiting new places / travel. I went to South Africa for my sister's wedding in Oct 2017 and it was an eye opening and unforgettable experience. I was not a person whom stayed home and liked it. 

Ok. Onto the short novel

I have a very low immune system and am self isolating during this time. I have been working myself up mentally to do this de clutter evaluation for a while now. 

This provides a now provided me a no excuses time to go through my collection and purge what I don't use. Repurpose other items and display the ones I would like to use.

It will be such a treat to walk into my ""makeup room"" and actually be able to do a look on myself .
~~The attached photo is the current state of the disaster and will show you the reality~~ of a makeup artist that has to give up her craft forever because of a car accident. 

I had not been practicing makeup for a while as I had fallen off a roof and hurt my right shoulder. My dominant arm and the one I create art with, over the past couple years I have worked it back to a place with yoga and online physio videos that I WAS able to drive and maintain part time employment driving drunk people home in their own vehicles. 

Dec 2018 that all changed. I was bed ridden for a month and not contacted by insurance regarding my injury for 6 months. At this point I had been getting f myself back to order, trying to do what I could with what I had. 
The in August 2019 I was in another MVA this time sitting on the opposite side of the car. I was the driver in the Dec accident and passenger in the August one. In both accidents the vehicles were totaled and I was left injured. 
I still have. Hard time being outside in the day because of the sun, even with sunglasses and a toque over my eyes. 
I can't sit for any extensive time because my I have back problems from the first accident that became more significant compounding with the accident in August. 
Most of my days I spend standing pacing because there are only certain places I can be where the lights aren't too bright and the noises aren't too loud. 

For example. I have the backlight turned off on my phone as I type right now as well as wearing sunglasses and it still gives me a headache to look at. 
All day everyday has been pain for the past I don't even know what the time frame is. I have legitimately stopped counting. Since Dec 30 2018. 

I know many people are n self isolation right now and I completely understand on a next level. .I am immune compromised and disabled because of events stemming from the injuries of my accident. 

In March I saw an old friend from high school I hadn't seen in 4 years, and before that the last time I had a social encounter was August 6, 3 days before the next accident. 

I am just so done with it all. The doctors obviously have bigger problems on Their hands right now and I completely understand and respect that. It doesn't change the excruciating pain I am still going through every day without help or relief. 
I had a standing dr appointment before this whole COVID-19 thing and have had an ear infection I didn't notice because of the level of pain I am used to experiencing everywhere. It was a minor discomfort but really started to display signs of getting worse. 

So I went to my doctor and I told him what's up. I can't eat, sleep at night, be awake during the day as the lights are terrible and I am wearing ear plugs all the time. I am having trouble doing things I was getting better at doing in the new year, small things like open the fridge, the drawer for the pots, get into a bathtub on my own, wash my own hair, put away the dishes, walk the stairs (we have 3 floors we actively use in the place we live) I crawl up the stairs to the bedroom which is located on the top floor and the basement I literally have not been in since we moved in October. This is because there are no safety rails and wooden stairs without backs so I can't even crawl up and down them. The doctor recommended psychiatry. I have been that route and do not want to play those games as the psychiatrists  in this city tend to not stay at one job for long and it's not often I would even see the same dr more than once which is not helpful. 
He also recommended vitamin B2 complex to work with the failing migraine med. 
I am in debilitating pain.this is the first time in over a week I have been able to even look at the screen this long to type this. 
As I am disabled and insurance has cut me off my doctor didn't offer another option. I spoke of medical assisted dying with him as I don't feel I have another option and it's so unfair to put this on my SO. This isn't what he signed up for. Also. This just isn't living. The only things I experience are pain followed by anger and grief.  

This as you can probably imagine has put the hugest weight on my SO as he is the one picking up all the slack as the insurance company attributed every single problem i have had except 4-6 weeks after the accident- to my previous falling off the roof injury in which I was checked out for and cleared. I had a steroid shot in my shoulder a little over a month before the accident because I still had pain completing any exerting work. 
The insurance company sent me a letter that they had an out of provincial doctor consult on; whom had only seen my files and never seen me in person. 
This report indicated there would only be the 4 to 6 weeks of injuries. She also conveniently mentioned I was in another MVA (motor vehicle accident) in August. 
The entire time I was dealing with the insurance company I was adamantly told to keep the injury claims seperate, in every way. From describing symptoms to receiving treatment! 
How does one even do that?!?
Ii did it to the best of my ability . When the insurance company contacted me saying their medical consultant found the injuries to be preexisting. The manager of the injury insurance informed me they had paid over $6000 into my treatment and it was already over funded as the past injuries were the problem.  They gave me $975 to move because we had planned to move before the accident and it is in there policy that they will help you move if the injuries had I hired you from moving. 
I wasn't able to move and had to write out a 26 page detailed transcript of whom I had do what duty and payrate from friends and family. $975 to pay movers for a 3 bedroom house. Packing moving and unpacking. Then $65 to cover the money I had spent out of pocket on cabs to get to physio. Which I attended three times a week. 



  however I haven't had help from them with what I need. My medication hasn't been covered by them, they have not helped my fiance around the house with all the duties of used to do that he is now on double and triple duty as we have a dog as well. 
My doctor has been a dead end and with insurance cutting me off I feel like there is really no future for me. 
I have had it confirmed by a dr and a physio.theraoist that my condition is not going away and will be something I deal with my entire life.

I don't even feel safe being a passenger in a car anymore because I know my insurance agency would not do anything if I am to get in another accident. As they have proven. 
 
This started as talking about rearranging my makeup collection in makeuprehab sub and turned into the hugest rant.

31,"Last week classes got cancelled, I’m a teacher so I still have to work but I’ve been doing it from my apartment, I’ve only left my place once this week to get some snacks at the convenience store. 

And since then I’ve been feeling gross, and just generally lethargic and sad. I took showers every day bur never washed my hair and completely stopped shaving. I started feeling the first signs of depression and felt like I was close to spiraling (I have a long history of depression and anxiety). 

This morning I was gonna have a friend over to watch Lord of the Rings (b/c they’d never seen it before) and I decided enough was enough. I went out for a long walk, I took a long shower washed and did my hair, shaved for the first time in a long time. And put on nice clothes to see my friends. 

I feel good today, not great but better than before.

32,"my father and I are polar opposites in how we do stuff.   The current situation I’m in at the moment is, “my” car is having issues with it. Right from the beginning I told my dad to NOT buy that car because it had a history of mechanical issues (the model) etc. he decided to buy it anyways because it was “cheap” 

My dad is pretty “frugal” in every way possible so there’s that. He’s always trying to save a penny. Well, here we are, the car is having the exact issues I told him that car would have if he bought it. 

Now here’s where we’re at. Normally I’m this situation my approach is, sell the car before it starts showing any real issues. You get to 1. Save money now when it’s not as bad and 2. Put up a grand or two and get a new car. 

My dads approach to this is, sink endless amounts of money into fixing the car. His logic is, spend a little today to fix said part, a little tomorrow when it breaks again, and a little more the next day. Keep the car until it’s worth pennies. 

The issue is, he tries so hard to not spend money but at the end of the day he’s paying significantly more when the car is worth pennies and you need to get a new one. 

So yeah.. I’m keeping him in the loop about what’s going on with the car as a courtesy to him but I’m definitely not going to dump buckets of money into it.",21Mar2020,1

37,"I spent my early childhood in Washinton, D.C. as World War II was raging and was a news junkie even then. Back then America had a real ""Can Do"" spirit. It had its own steel mills, chemical factories and assembly plants. Back then America made things and the war engendered a spirit that despite privations like rationing of food, shoes, clothes those were only minor annoyances because there was a job to be done and we were going to do it.

Fast forward to today. We don't make much of anything, even cars are largely imported parts. With the Coronavirus, which could be looked at as a foreign invasion, we spend a lot of time thinking ""poor me"" and look immediately to Uncle Sam for aid in light of a country that has ignored for decades things like preparedness, hospital and medical infrastructure, to mention a few.

The Can Do spirit seems to have gone away and it probably began when we switched from a manufacturing to a service economy. 

Although I dearly wish to see how this all ends, the demographics say that I probably won't live long enough. Perhaps when I depart this mortal coil I'll have my memories of when we were a much different, and perhaps better, nation.",21Mar2020,1

A now seemingly long time ago I found my calling. My mom said “Hey you ever thought of pharmacy? They seem like good guys, are always in need, make good money and can move wherever they want.”  I thought to myself, that seems cool.  I had a budding interest in chemistry and found fulfillment in helping people, so it seemed like a perfect medium. If all else fell through I would be a lab jockey and work at Dow or drive their trucks.  

Over the next 8 years of early mornings, countless hours of studying, stocking shelves, cleaning counters, drug coupons, transfers, takeovers, tears, life long friends, worthless fucking MTM classes (yeah I slept through your shit LB), catches, misses, life lessons; I found my true loves: my wife and the profession of pharmacy. 

I’ve only held a few jobs in my life (McDonalds cook, Photo tech, Pharm Tech, Pharmacist and Pharmacy Manager) by my Papa gave me advice that I have carried through all of them: “No matter what you do you, give it your all.” 

That’s what my wife and I are doing now. We are certain that if we haven’t already we will catch it, and hope that it isn’t bad. We are scared, but we keep going and will keep going until we can’t. 

We have had the strange conversations with our child. That people are getting sick, our job is to help them, we can’t go to school, can’t see our friends, can’t go out to eat, can’t go to the zoo, can’t be like it was for now. Mommy and daddy will take care of people that need it, we may get sick, we may not be able to see you for a long time if we do, we plan to get better. We hope it all gets better, hope that everything gets back to normal, and if it doesn’t someone will be there to take care of you and that we love you no matter what. 

It’s going to get worse before it gets better. It will never go back to how it was before this and maybe it shouldn’t. 

But no matter what happens my family and countless other health care, retail, sanitation, education, utility and other thankless workers will continue to give it our all. Right now,  that’s all we got. 

I’m scared, I’m determined, I’m ok, I’m not ok, I’m not stopping, I’m dedicated, I will be there until I can’t and I will come back when I can and if I don’t come back,  I gave it my everything.",21Mar2020,1

43,"I’ve been wound up all day and super distracted, getting work accomplished was near zero and as a people manager, I feel guilty and horrible about it. I think right now it’s normal to a certain extent because of the coronavirus, but I got feisty in the neighborhood FB about people ignoring the quarantine recommendations. 

I did ok with it until an asshole told me me “go suck Richard.” May have been a beautiful comment if was towards someone else or if I knew this person in any capacity, but I didn’t. They were intentionally provocative by posting a pic of themselves on the beach when the specific comments string was unrelated (it was actually started by someone accusing me of being a bully, but that’s a whole other story). 

Anyways, I was wired from my one cup of coffee and not enough to eat. It doesn’t happen to me often, but strong coffee without enough carbs makes my sugar levels crash and I end up all sorts of jittery and anxious. Add in that I already struggle with anxiety and depression, this can be bad situation. 

Anyways I got over it and moved on with my day. Still uber distracted and more than typical sentimental, but mostly normal due to our lock downs and friends from across the country checking in. Anyways, went to take my one pill (antibiotic) before bed and saw that I never took my morning meds. 🤦‍♀️ 

I know I’m anxious right now with or without them, but without them, I am just stupid. The meds explain a lot about the day.  I haven’t been in the greatest place with my husband and don’t want to admit it to him, so thanks for hearing me out here. Tomorrow will be a better day and I really hope something starts looking up soon. I’m just so over it all right now.",21Mar2020,1
44,"Today I went driving for the first time in about 3 weeks. When all of this started I was moderately worried and thought the immense grocery shopping and toilet paper hoarding was nothing more than a hype.

I had decided to sign up for Uber Eats for the first time ever for more business as I figured it would be booming. Having driven for quite sometime I was approved for Uber Eats in a matter of 10 minutes.

After more than 2 hours of driving sitting outside a manufacturing plant in a major city surrounded by college campuses and food industry I made $11.00. 

My toilet paper I purchased from Walmart was $20. I had 3 ride requests, one for Uber Eats which got canceled because the restaurant didn’t have the food available. The next one had been a rider who was getting laid off next week worried about not being able to find a new job.

I asked them if they’ve had issues finding drivers when using the service; that was not the case. My assumption is there is a high supply of drivers all vying for the decreased market to pay their bills. 

We are the portion of the population who will be forgotten about. People are getting laid off, they aren’t taking Uber’s or eating out. I had thought business would be booming but it’s anything but. 

I don’t think I could even apply for unemployment as an Uber driver because outside of California we aren’t considered employees but independent contractors.

It took me 2 hours to realize just how serious this is. It’s more than just photographs of empty streets and not having TP. And realistically, when we see Italy, and consider that the U.S. is much larger and is a relatively unhealthy country, this is going to be bad. Worse than anything I’ll most likely ever witness in my life.

You’ll be lucky if you don’t get sick, but, that doesn’t mean you won’t be impacted. Kids whose parents get laid off may end up relocating leaving their schools and friends behind. And we have to consider for a moment that our aging loved ones and those with underlying health conditions may not make it out. 

At first I had said; I’m young, I have nothing to worry about, this could be an opportunity to buy cheap stocks. What a fool I am. I’m worried for our country, our families, our children. It makes me sick and fills me with self-hatred that I might gain where others lose. And even if I don’t, the fact that I had tried. It might be true but it becomes conflicting when your economic prosperity is tied to watching others lose. What does that say about me as a person? It says I’m a worthless piece of shit. This being coupled with not being able to achieve more than minimum wage is depressing. 

I wish to help, but, I can’t help myself. I fear this incoming recession and this coming week. As much as I just want to lock myself in my room, it fills you with doubt and hopelessness. A thought I’ve only ever come across once in my entire life. I watched a video of a hospital in Italy, filled with people, and I couldn’t help but feel how sad it is that some of them will die alone. 

I want to hug and kiss my children and tell them I will be okay and that I love them and that their future will be better than mine. However I have no assurance that will happen. Not now, not November 5th, not within the foreseeable future. And I worry that if I become sick, I may not be able to care for their needs.

I dread next week, and the months to come, and it’s disgusting that those that will be hit the hardest will be the poorest communities. Rather than rejoicing in life, we may worry about our bills, our jobs and our loved ones. 

Meanwhile, congress continues to debate what it is that Americans need. $1,000 to those who make less than $76,000 and $600 for the poorest. Many still believe we should get nothing. I think back to my $11 I made today before I had given up, and the $20 for a roll of TP I was fortunate to buy as they were restocking a single pallet. Families are suffering while our politicians play games. This is our present day reality in a country viewed as one of the wealthiest in the world; not even a blanket of hope shines. 

And sadly, I’m assuming many are still unaware of just how bad this is, and how much worse it will become. Tell your loved ones you love them, and I’d like to say hold them close, however, it might be your love that kills them. God help us all which ever one you believe in. Because as of this second, it appears that God may be the only thing we have.",21Mar2020,1

- Summary: Best case, is dies out in the summer like previous viruses, then comes back for round 2 when it cools back down, and we develope and administer a vaccine by 2021. Worst case, healthcare systems collapse, economy collapses, we fall into remission similar to 1918, and COVID-19 becomes another seasonal flu. 



COVID-19 is in the beginning stages. We can slow the spread, sure. What happens when all the health workers get sick due to lack of supplies? What happens when low wage workers at grocery stores get sick? What happens when you've been out of work for months because the virus just keeps spreading?

48,"i have been grey rocking the hell out of my mom mostly out of fear. i am twenty three and traumatized by a previous relationship in which i almost got married. i live at home with no bed and no room. i sleep in the living room. i’m just stating those as facts about my living situation. it is my job to cook for my younger sister(15), clean the kitchen and the living room, and all around tend to the house while she sits in her room all day long. then when i rebel and stop cleaning i’m told i’m useless, i don’t do enough, and i’m not living in reality. she cleans all the time, she says. 

she has one big meltdown a year with cleaning and it’s always the week before christmas when my older sister visits. it used to be more frequent in my youth, but that never stopped her from always making us do the dishes after dinner. it didn’t matter how late we stayed up cleaning a household’s breakfast, lunch, and dinner. i say us because my older sister used to shoulder the bulk of chores. she ran out of that house by 22. 27, now. it is a nightmare to be mother’s cinderella for the past five years.

i live in absolute fear of her because i never know when she is going to just lose it. when she raises her voice, so do i, and the fight turns into this mess of yelling and praying for me like i’m some kind of leper for saying i don’t get enough credit for what i do. and that i shouldn’t be bossed around passive aggressively by her lazy ass. she always puts her boyfriend before her children and it has always driven me mad. she is separated from my father, who is a good man likely just as traumatized as the rest of us. her boyfriend showers her in material gifts and fancy trips and we are never even considered for them. she will brag endlessly about paris but never once ask how your midterms are doing. she’s emotionally absent and sees her adult daughter as someone to manage, not mother. 

i have not been speaking to her much because i cannot suffer through anymore shouting matches. but i also am waiting for an apology before i ever trust to communicate with her again. during that fight i told her that when i came home broken from an abusive home, she did not provide an ounce of actual warmth towards the situation. she was only excited to talk about how crazy that ex was. in response, she tried to gaslight me and tell me that i was dead wrong about that and that she has always cared for me.

the night i was dumped i called her. the call lasted twenty seconds, and she hung up saying she was tired. i was stranded and alone in southern california, five hundred miles away from her. she was too tired to worry about me. okay. 

tonight i was on the porch, she came out before she leaving to her boyfriend’s house. she told me that dad wouldn’t be able to show up to the house until tomorrow, but she was leaving tonight anyway. then she SHOUTED “I LOVE YOU WRITTENBYRAE” (real name redacted obviously) and stormed down the stairs. i was too shocked to reply. why say it so loudly? i froze up for a few seconds in this panic i couldn’t quite explain. anyway now im wondering what the hell im going to feed my little sister tonight!!",21Mar2020,1

59,"My father was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer about a year ago. When I found out I moved back in with my parents, my wife tagged along and whenever I had days off I would help him. And my mom would cover the other days. Together, we took him to appointments, slept by him during hospitalizations, made him eat, even towards the end doing small things like helping him put his shirt on etc...

During this time I cried alot, sometimes it would be something small, like noticing how skinny he got, I would tell him be right back, go  to the bathroom,  cry,  flush toilet, come back out. I would pour him orange juice place it in front of him, look at him,  go to the bathroom and cry. What I'm trying to get at is i cried frequently as I faced this tough time in my family's life head on. 

The last month he was alive he would tell me alot of how proud he was of me and couldn't ask for a better son. That made me cry, to the bathroom i go. 

Last week he became more and more unresponsive, but I kid you not he would always say my name when I walked into the room to check on him. He wouldn't respond to my questions but he would say my name. I cried everyday in the last week, never in front of him though.

When he took his last breath i had 3 very close relatives in my room and my mom. The relatives helped ALOT (family very important where im from). I THINK i felt like he was finally at peace resting. 

My 2 siblings aren't doing well and my mom especially isn't doing well. It's been 1 week since death. I'm the only one im not crying or griefing as much right now. 

I had a buddy over and we were laughing cracking jokes, my mom overheard and when i walked upstairs she asked if i was on drugs... i said no(never took drugs). She then told me it's ok to cry and grief. She didn't want me to blow up down the line.  I told her im ok. She then indirectly stated that it didn't make sense i was laughing and had people over and it's only been a week since death.  It made me feel real guilty, i didn't think much of it inviting my friend. My friend felt the vibe when he came down and then felt bad for making everyone laugh. 

Am I ignoring grief or is this normal. Is it weird im not a complete mess right now? I cried every fucking day towards the end and it wasn't easy for me but am i supposed to continue crying and being sad? Don't get me wrong, i am sad but not all the time.

I didn’t want to do this anymore. I was pushing myself to hard and never gave myself a break. I just wanted to be the best for my parents, but the pressure was too much. Everything just came crashing down with all the stress and worry.

66,"**SUMMARY**

Going to give Discord / Avrae a shot. Post your character idea below or DM it to me to apply. If you're accepted I will DM you the discord invite

**FREQUENCY**

I'd like to start at 4-6 posts per player per week. Depending on how the group feels, we can increase or decrease as time goes on.

**ME AS A DM**

I am totally new to PBP, Avrae, and also new to 5e. I've DM'd pathfinder for years and that's the experience I'm coming into this with.

I will likely make mistakes. Feel free to correct me. If you ever want to change your character or are unsatisfied in some way about the way the game is progressing, don't hesitate to message me.

**ADVENTURE BACKGROUND**

Whether you were born in the pits or sold into slavery, you've spent *at least* the last six years fighting to survive in the Arena.

In two days time it will be your Death match - a final bout designed to kill you, usually the result of an angered person of influence. Your squad (composed of the players) has been on a golden streak lately, and no doubt you ended some politician's prized gladiators. The long suppressed urge for freedom, barely a ember in past years, has now roared to a burning flame; even as you face almost certain death, the siren call of something sweeter urges you to fight on.

**TONE**

Unlike a traditional high fantasy, your characters may not necessarily become legendary heroes. That doesn't mean it's not *possible*, but in this world, just *surviving* is a worthy and admirable goal. Small successes are big in Athas - if you, for example, have a house and kids with a clean supply of water by the end of a campaign, you are living the dream. I would still aim high, but take pride in small successes - getting enough money to support yourself, obtaining a new weapon

**Seriousness vs. Fun**

Athas can come across as very grimdark, but to me it's just 90's pulp. I aim to have fun, and the tone will oscillate between seriousness and lightness as the situation demands. I hope to avoid uber dark emo characters if we can.

&amp;#x200B;

**RULES**

So, since this is Dark Sun, I highly urge you to read the magic rules in the document I linked in here:  [https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LX4yHeg3\_fD-cb5AYlb](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LX4yHeg3_fD-cb5AYlb)

P.s. if you can't open this, just search ""5e Dark Sun"" on Google

**Magic**

If you are an arcane magic user, you *will* be a target almost constantly. Casting a spell in front of someone in most places could mean a death sentence - especially so in the pits. The beginning of the game will be very hard for you - but if you're clever, you might be able to pull it off.

**Races**

I am not too concerned if you choose to use 5e races with their stock attributes, or borrow from the rules in the above document. Just know that if a race doesn't exist in the above document, it's probably off the table - with the exception of Aarakocra (spelling?)

**Literacy**

Most folks in Athas are illiterate. If your character is literate, you'll want to supply a very compelling reason.

**Water**

We are doing a very simplified system for water. Whenever you do a long rest, you must also consume 2 units of water. If you don't, you gain one level of exhaustion.

If you are halfling, you need only consume 1 unit of water.

If you are a half-giant, you need to consume 3 units of water.

A flask might hold 2 units of water. A barrel might hold 14. A cactus in the middle of the desert might hold 3. And so on.

I'm not concerned with tracking food. It is implicit that if you have gathered enough water, you have gathered enough food as well.

If I ever become concerned with tracking food - which likely won't happen - I'll let you know.

**Religion**

Read the doc above on this.

**Warlocks**

Sorry, no Warlocks allowed.

**Alignment** 

Please no evil alignments. In general, characters should want to work together, and should want to perform selfless acts.

The D&amp;D I run is cooperative, not competitive. Attacking from, stealing from, or keeping threatening secrets from other players is not for this game.

**Romance and stuff**

Just keep it PG, don't make it weird if you try to flirt with an NPC or something

**Swearing**

Use fantasy swears (blood and bloody ashes, bloodydamn) instead of English swears (shit, fuck, etc.)

**Thri-keen** 

If you decide to be a thri-keen, note that they can't wear armor

**Wild talents**

Don't forget to select one!

**Psionics**

You can be one, just follow the rules in the guide posted above please! There might be a psionics class on D&amp;D beyond, not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. Let me know if you have questions.",21Mar2020,1
68,"Sister in law won’t cancel destination wedding...

So my fiancées brother is getting married in Maui tomorrow. With all of the Coronavirus stuff going on, we’ve had 5 flight cancellations; we were supposed to leave Thursday the 19th but with the wedding on Saturday the 21st, I have decided to opt out and not go for the following reasons: 
my mother came to dog sit and as soon as things blew up wanted to go home ASAP. We changed her flight to leave on Sunday the 22nd. I am hoping her flight is not cancelled but if it is, she will need me to drive her home to MT. I don’t have anyone to watch my dog and I need to get my mother home if quarantines start happening. 

I wish my fiancé would just cancel his last-ditch effort to fly to Maui early Saturday but it’s his brother, he’s the best man, and I can’t expect him to do that when almost everyone has cancelled on him (the brother) already. 

I texted the bride the situation to let her know my fiancée is still trying to go and I am having to cancel, and she was very short with me and immediately texted my fiancée that we were “in the wrong”. I am so sad this is happening but I just can’t risk getting quarantined in Hawaii because of my dog and my mom, and I wish my fiancée wasn’t going either because he might get stuck there, for a party?? It’s one day, it’s just a wedding, we can redo it! We can all pitch in and have another party as soon as things settle down! I just can’t believe how insensitive they are being. I can’t get sick and give it to my parents, or anyone who is at risk, it’s just not worth a one day thing. And I want my fiancée to cancel but it’s his brother and he has to be there for him.

I fear my time has come at my university. 

If it is, then I am slightly sad as I feel i wasn’t able to fully experience all there is to offer at my university.

I wasn’t able to fully enjoy my college experience; it was cut short. 

I feel that i was just coming into my own, and as soon as that was happening, I receive the news that my college experience is over. It was as if i was finally enjoying myself at a party, but the party was over as soon as it started for me.

Spring quarter was supposed to be best quarter, the quarter where i get to show off my mastery of studying at the undergraduate level, the quarter where i get enjoy my newfound friendships one last time and potentially develop new ones. 

This was the quarter where i try model un, a club that I was always interested in but never got around to actually joining it. 

in sum, this quarter was the quarter where I was going to be able to compensate for the things I didn’t do in the past quarters. This is the real tragedy; this is where the pain lies.

I was taken advantage of when i was 17 by a 21 year old guy friend of mine, he was always so charming and likeable, and very kind to me. But after what he had done, i couldn’t bear to hear his name or even see his face, it would make my stomach hurt. I sent him a very straight forward text about why i never wanted to speak to him again, and he never seemed to understand and tried to flip it on me, and we didn’t speak for about a year. 


Until a couple weeks ago, he all of the sudden kept replying to my Snapchat stories as if nothing had happened?? The first time i was tempted to respond, but didn’t. Then he messaged again, and again, and i finally responded with something lighthearted and i was nice?? like wtf?? i keep responding to this asshole as if nothing happened! Then, he sent a long “apology” if you could even call it that. He essentially said “it wasn’t my intention to take advantage of you i guess it just happened sorry”. Bruh. Thankfully i never said “it’s ok” or “i forgive you” i told him the cold hard truth, that i cried every night for a long time and couldn’t sleep because of him. He told me that he wanted to be “friends” again and that he’d wait for when i was ready. I WILL NEVER BE READY! i didn’t respond to that text, and he took that as me BEING READY 



He now continues to message me and you know what i do? Reply.

88,"Well, this is my alt since my main account has too high of a karma and will be downvoted for whatever reason. 

About four weeks again, my Mom had a fall. And then subsequently, she started to black out. So we went to the emergency room and they found out two things: she had perforated diverticulitis (a hole in her colon which was leaking in her body and it was life threatening) and she had a broken femur and hip. So for two weeks straight, we were in the acute trauma ICU to trauma care. They preformed three surgeries on her, one to stop the colon, and next to put in ostomy bag and finally to put pins in her hip and femur to repair them. I was with her every day. I slept at the hospital, took a lot of time off work and I had no sick days and went with leave without pay because her anxiety was so bad. It started to look up. She was feeling better than before. She could walk better. We check her into physical rehab, so that she can learn how to walk. It was a grueling two weeks. The coronavirus made things difficult and cut visiting hours. She finally was able to walk without a walker and was moving. I finally got her home from rehab yesterday. She got her stitches removed from her orthopedic doctor. While going to another appointment today, she suffered an episode. She started to lose balance, vision blurred and she started speaking incoherently. She couldn't stand. The doctor's office called 911 and she was readmitted into the hospital as a stroke patient. The ER didn't tell me anything and left me in the waiting room for four hours. I had to find her room myself. They don't for sure what is wrong, but the outlook has not been good. But unlike before, I couldn't stay by her side. The hospital imposed stricter rules and bad all but essential visitors. 

This is killing me. I don't know how to put up with the stress. Before I can go to a restaurant and had a nice meal to clear up my hand.But now that they are gone. The library's gone. There is no family to support me. I am an only child and the burden is all on me. I had hope that the coronavirus would blow over. So that I could deal with her health.

89,"The Chinese are selfless and crazy about wisdom. They made a religion out of philosophy, and even twice (Confucius and Buddha). 

They don't care about losing a little freedom, as long as it gets people massively out of poverty. It is for the greater good, and even I would argue that they are experimenting. 

Indeed, every country is experimenting with a different kind of leadership than the others, so we can see what the world needs. 

We have to respect the Chinese for the high degree of their discipline. They just want to be our friends. (Just look at all the pandas they are giving us, haha)

Stop hating the Chinese, they will not gauge us out of their massive power, they are fair and humane. They just have a different kind of morality. 

Yes indeed, people say morals are relative, yet they want everyone to think like they do. It is time to be open-minded. 

I'm a gifted guy, though it might not seem so, and I have decided that I would give 30min out of my day about bridging the cultural void between Us and the Chinese, for a better world.

It’s been difficult for me to come to this position, especially as I’ve lost a lot of my globalist friends for stating my new belief that what we actually need is more positive nationalism and more inter-national cooperation before globalism.

However, I have yet to meet someone who actually slipped on a rogue banana peel and fell onto their ass as a result.

92,"Made a supply run last night, looking for craft supplies to help keep me sane as well as attempting to find things like disinfectant wipes, masks, etc. Found some boxes of vinyl gloves at a Walgreens that hadn't been picked completely clean yet. Bought 2, the maximum allowed per customer at the time.

Fast forward about 20 minutes, and I'm at a different Walgreens. This one has also been picked clean of gloves, masks and hand sanitizer, so I just buy a few other things on my list. As I'm checking out, an older couple - I'd say in late 40's or early 50's - walks in, asking about the three supplies I listed above. The clerk tells them they're completely sold out, and the disappointment is plain on their faces.

So since I had bought two boxes of gloves, I offered them one of mine. Gave it to them in the parking lot. The man asked if I was selling 'em, but I told them just to take it and to pay it forward.

93,"I’m 25 and i live with my dad, i lost my mom to cancer a little more than 3 years ago, which was devastating but it seemed like i was coping just fine and i was helping my family members getting through it, then my fiance left me about 6 month after that cause she was just tired and i understood that, it was never easy to deal with me, and after my mom it was definetly harder, i felt like everything was coming down on me but i still kept a stong face, i was doing military service at the time and the whole rules and plans was a help to not have to think about it all the time, after the military service ended, i was home with my dad, no job, no mom, no fiance, no friends, no will to live..
Living with anxiety was something i was used to, but the added depression was making it too much. I spend a while just making it one day at a time, even tried applying for university, which i didn’t get in first year, and the next year didn’t get in the one i wanted but got in one that was at least the major i was interested in (photography), so i started doing that and i was doing better, i mean i had better days and worst days but at least i was doing something.. after the first semester i realized that it’s gonna cost a lot more than what i can pay with the tuition and the gears and everything, so i stopped going for the second semester.. i was not able to deal with my own thoughts anymore, i mean i have had suicidal thoughts for about 2 years and i could not stop it anymore.. so about 8 month ago i decided that i should just end it all, and stop suffering and making my family uncomfortable.. so i wrote my suicide note, i cried a lot, and i decided that i’m gonna cut my neck’s vain (i thought it will be faster and less painful) the next day.. i woke up that day and my sister called me out of nowhere and told me that she is pregnant and no one knows yet and she wanted me to be the first one to know, it was a great news and she wanted me to know it, i was overwhelmed, i couldn’t do it, what if my sister would hear the news of me killing myself and she would lose the child? I couldn’t do that to her.. so i decided to wait untill her son’s birth and then finish it all, i thought to myself: i have waited this long, i can get through a few more months..
But lately i just feel like maybe i can live, maybe i can do over, live to see my nephew, to have a life..
So i’m still unemployed and definetly still depressed and all, but i have a will to live (even if just a little) for the first time in a long time and i just wanted to share this with someone, anyone, even if no one cares and no one reads this long ass text, but still..

As someone who feels like just another someone, dealing with the big D in depression, I hope to turn someone away from the bottomless pit. I’ll cut to it. Just stop. Stop moving the gears in your head. Stop thinking. Just stop. Look outside, feel your breath, and stop. Feel. Feel your existence. You’re here. You were put here. Whether your belief in God, or science, or both, you cannot deny your present existence. Embrace it. It’s wonderful. No matter how absolutely agonizing your existence may be. Embrace it. Because it wouldn’t be better anyway. I know it’s hard to try and tell someone to love life, because yours most definitely can be worse than mine, or worse than another. But it’s never out of your reach to try. To try and love every minute that your heart beats. No matter how alone you may feel, just know you always share something with everything else: you’re alive. You here. Be here. Because odds are, someone will be different if you were gone. Someone’s life will never be the same without you. Even if you’ve never met them yet. You being here will always offer a chance at changing the trajectory of someone else’s life for the better. Show love and be love. Be here. I want you to be, here.

I hope this hits just one of you :).",21Mar2020,1

it's hard to find a balance between not getting too close and not accidentally pushing friends away. despite this, I'm very close with my boyfriend; he's my best friend and treats me with so so much kindness and respect, but we haven't been able to talk in about 4 weeks. I'm worried for him, too. long story short, he probably has no friends either in his situation.

i asked one friend to hang out with me in discord earlier tonight, but he ditched me for an old group of mutual friends (and an ex of mine) who frankly treated me like shit. this was nearly 10 hours ago, and my chest still hurts thinking about it.

133,"What the title states.

My husband’s parents (in their mid-late 50s) and younger sister live in the area. His sister, we’ll call her Alyssa (21 F), works at a major grocery store. 

Alyssa has stated repeatedly that she’ll be fine if she gets the coronavirus because she is “young and healthy.” I don’t know what precautions she takes to stay safe at work, but I really don’t want to spend too much time with her after she is around thousands of people all day long who could be sick.

My husband and I are also young and healthy. However, I do not want to risk getting sick and potentially spreading illness to someone who is unable to fight it. 

I thought that his parents, being older themselves, would understand why we are taking precautions. Well, I was wrong. Yesterday, they invited us over for lunch. I told my husband that I wasn’t too comfortable going over there, as I did not want to get sick from Alyssa or get his parents sick should we be ill and not know it.

He told his parents my concerns and they acted like I didn’t want to see them. His dad even said, “Well she should just go stay with her parents so we can come over.” UM NO? My parents in their mid sixties and my mother has high blood pressure. I haven’t seen my parents in weeks and don’t plan to until this all blows over. They’re acting like I’m selfish and don’t want to spend time with them. His dad also said he “feels fine and can breathe fine” so people really need to “calm down” about this. His mom is a little more understanding but still seems to be taking this personally. 

My husband also tried talking Alyssa into wearing a protective mask to work, and she blew him off with her “young and healthy” thing, stating that she and her parents “will be fine” and that it’s pretty much impossible for her to get sick at work, despite the fact that she is in contact with hundreds if not thousands of people every time she goes to work.

I don’t think I’m being unreasonable at all but I feel like they’re taking social distancing personally even though it’s for THEIR OWN GOOD, and to be honest, they’re pissing me off with this.

TL;DR: husband’s family is angry that I don’t want to spend time with them in a contained space during a pandemic when they are older and his sister works at a crowded store.",21Mar2020,1
134,"I fell in love with my classmate but it never went beyond a casual friendship because he's straight and I'm gay (secretly/closeted). We could talk about anything and we did every day for more than five years. It was great because I got to be near my crush without him knowing I had feelings for him. But it was also sad knowing he's not interested. I knew he liked me as a friend.

He was fiercely introverted so we never hung out after school and we never chatted online. He once came to my birthday and a summer camp but that was about it. Nothing more and it really sucked. I'm also introverted but not that much so I still want those kinds of social interactions. Because I only spoke to him I distances myself from my other friends so I was at home all the time after school.

I don't know if he knew I was different. I remember two moments where he was kinda suspicious but I don't know if he ever figured it out. 

He got accepted into a high school that is in a different city. I was hoping he'd want to go to the same high school as me. The last day at that school was the worst day of my life. I didn't even say goodbye to him and I just fucked off. I wish I said something.

During the summer I was at home all the time with no one to talk to and I got really depressed. I thought I'd befriend my new classmates but on the first day I was still broken so I was quiet as shit. I was the quiet kid, no one wants to talk to the quiet kid so I wasn't able to make friends.

After almost two years I still have no friends and I think about him every hour of every day. Not even sexually anymore, I just miss him as a friend. We never messaged eachother. I could do it through social media but I don't know if it's a good idea.

I've been depressed and lonely for two years and it gets worse every day. I started having suicidal thoughts but don't worry I won't kill myself. I hate myself because of my sexuality and because I'm unable to make friends.

I brushed it off as “we are both super busy with work” and summer will give us time to plan our wedding, buy a house and start our lives together. I fucked it all up. I didn’t give her the attention she needed. I was too comfortable and not caring enough. I’m so scared and I don’t have my best friend to tell me everything will be okay. I miss her.

I was very attached to my old room because I personally paid and painted my room walls, and put up shelves and just decorated it to my liking now Im living in the little room separated form the house. 

Im not allowed to paint the walls or put up shelves which means the things that give me comfort cant be put up in my room. This really upsets me but now Im feeling better about it.

155,"I decided I was going to become a working artist at the age of 3. As I grew, I understood that choosing to be an artist would be challenging, and spent hours each day working on improving my skills. I knew that I could increase the probability of success through discipline. After graduating high school, I found a video of a man sculpting on YouTube and immediately knew that it was my calling. After some quick research, I found the closest university that taught figurative sculpture and applied. I had a goal to not only graduate, but to also impress the professor enough to convince him to let me work for him after graduating. I was the first undergrad in the school’s history to be given a key to the sculpting studio (usually only professors and graduate students are trusted with this). I graduated and was asked by the professor to help work on one of the largest bronze configurations in the world. I learned a ton and then went after my Masters of Fine Art. During my first year as a graduate student, I lost both of my grandmas, my grandpa, and my uncle that had been living with my parents since I was 13. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced. After graduating, I got married and found a job as a 3d design professor. My plan was to start building up commissions as I taught until I could fully support my family through my art. After my first year teaching, our first son was born with major complications. He didn’t have a heartbeat for 29 minutes and we were told that his brain was most likely so far gone that he wouldn’t even be able to blink. My wife is a nurse so I had to give up my faculty position to stay at home and care for our son (she had better insurance and a better paycheck :/). Through some miracle, our son recovered completely. He’s absolutely normal. We were told by the doctor that he’s an Oprah child because he’ll be on her show if we ever go public with it. I’ve tried finding a replacement for my job but the university’s just aren’t hiring right now. We recently had our second child who was born 2 months early but without complications :). He was held in the same Nicu room that his older brother stayed in :). Recently, I’ve been looking for any job I can find in order to get my wife home. Her floor has 5 cases of the Corona virus and she’s been told that she has to expose herself to those patients even though we have a premature baby at home :/...so there you have it. I’m currently giving up on the dream to be an artist but all in all, life isn’t so bad. I currently have two healthy kids at home, a loving wife, and I still have my knowledge and skill base to pursue my dream in the future, hopefully. Life can throw you some hardballs, even when you go out of your way to prepare and plan out your future, but as long as I’m still breathing and have a healthy family, I really can’t complain about much.

164,"I am not a conspiracy theorist. But I am a Chinese-Canadian and am fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English. I have been educated in the Chinese public school system for 6 years, and the Canadian public school system for another 6.

I know that the Chinese government lies, and had lied, about the coronavirus. As early as December 30, 2019, a finance-centric YouTube channel 财经冷眼 that I subscribe to disclosed that a pneumonia outbreak of unknown origin started in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Dozens were infected and no one was talking.

The government covered it up. They did so because the economy is the most important thing to them. Also, Chinese New Year came early this year--January 25. With that, hundreds of millions of people return home from the cities they work (this phenomenon exists because China does not have ""freedom of movement"" within its borders, amongst other reasons). Also, millions use this period of time to travel to other countries for vacation purposes.

On January 17, something happened and it forced the government to actually start revealing the true extent of the outbreak. From January 17 to 20, the confirmed cases exploded from 41 to 198, and then it spiralled up from there. It was 1 000, then 10 000. Things started getting really bad. Eventually, it settled and ""stablized"" around 80 000 in China.

If you ask me, there is no way that this number is true. I am willing to believe that by now, in Wuhan alone, the number of people being sick are 10 times greater than what is reported for all of China. That there may very well be millions sick nationwide. If Italy, a country with a population 5% that of China, is reporting 53 000 cases, how in the world is China not reporting 100 times the cases with so much lag time between China and Italy? These things grow exponentially, which means that 

    let i be an initial number of cases
    let r be the growth rate of the cases
    let t be the amount of time has elapsed
    C(t) = ir^t represents the number of cases as time elapses

Exponential functions grow exponentially as well, so the rate of change is just as bad as change itself (with constant lag time)

Growth rate g(t) is 

    C'(t) = g(t) = ir^t * ln (r)

Now, what I am saying is, if the Chinese government chose to not cover this up, and publicly reveal that an outbreak of something was happening in Wuhan, and quarantined everyone affected and order the immediate shutdown of the South China Seafood Market, it would never have needed to lock down Wuhan (or the entirety of Hubei, or other provinces or cities outside Hubei). This virus would not have spread to almost every country on Earth with 300 000+ cases and nearly 13 000 dead (a death rate of 4% from reported cases).

Instead, the government chose to cover up the outbreak, humiliate and threaten the doctors who blew the whistle, causing the unnecessary loss of life, sickness, financial ruin (bankruptcy from medical bills, inability to live due to being unemployed and unemployable for an unknown length of time). Stock markets collapsed and lost 1/3 of their values, bond yields driven towards 0 in the US (very bad for people who want to save money), USD and JPY being unbelieveably high with every other currency crashing (causing extreme inflation which erodes the purchasing power of people living in countries other than USA or Japan).

This cover up will hit China very hard. The extreme housing bubble in the large cities will just collapse because when you are in a country with an old population--and it is the old who die of COVID-19 mostly, and you get a lot of homes for which no one will occupy. Housing collapse -&gt; bank collapse and hyperinflation (it is due to money printing and a lack of supply of goods, China has 5%+ inflation now) -&gt; government collapse -&gt; military dictatorship or warlord rule -&gt; murders, suicides, executions and famine -&gt; a humanitarian crisis 100 times that of the Syrian Civil War.

For the rest of the world? Not much better. Canadian, Australian and Hong Kong housing markets will crash, causing mass default. Oil companies go bankrupt or get downgraded (a lot of those companies issue bonds that are graded BBB [barely investment grade, and held by pension funds, etc...] and they are a downgrade away from being rated junk, which will lead to selling by pension funds because it is a legal obligation for pension funds to mitigate risk and not hold junk bonds). This leads to even more defaults and bankruptcies, and billions of people will lose their jobs due to their employers going bust.  Do you know that Canadian oil was, at one point, being sold for $5.43 USD a barrel? No one makes money at these prices.

China did not learn at all. In 2003, the SARS coronavirus already killed hundreds and sickened thousands. This? This is going to be 1000 times worse, at least. I hope that the punishment for covering up a deadly secret for the sake of the economy is losing the power you held onto with an iron grip for more than 70 years, China!",21Mar2020,1

179,"I met my friend when i was like in grade 2. He was always a troubled child. he argued with the teachers. hurt other kids. tore books, banged benches until he realized he couldn't break them. not one single day passed that he didn't cause a mess. the more we grew more crazier he became. i was not his friend until we were like 10 years old.i was 2 years and two grades older,  but i did know him.   


He once entered the female changing room where i was too ,  and dragged a girl by hair half naked. no one knew why. both kids' the guardians were  called. he never said why he did what he did and was suspended nonetheless. by this time i was his friend, well  rather acquaintance. why you ask? because we both were queer and closeted. how we got to know we both were queer is a story for another day.  
so when i asked him why he did so, his simple reply was, ""it was fun."" and just that. he would behave rudely with almost anyone. well except me. for some reason.   


when i got a girlfriend. he got really jealous for a while, saying she was snatching me away from him. no he wasn't obsessed with me. maybe his unconsciousness was scared of loosing the only friend he had. he soon got over being mad at my girlfriends or boyfriends as they changed quiet a few times. he would often come over at my place ( i live alone, mom used to be always out of station and send money, no dad). he would come over. say nothing, cry at my shoulder and then without a word leave. i knew his parents hated him. he was enough crazy outside , i wonder what he was inside the house where his freedom formed more wings. his parents once tried to put him in an asylum but it didn't work out. he voluntarily got out.   
therapies never worked on him.  
by the time he was 14 he had assaulted (just beaten up, nothing sexual) countless people out age, dogs, animals. his parents were fed up of him. he hated his older brother, whom his parents obviously focused more on.  
he never bothered me with any of his crazy antics, yes he was clearly crazy in front of me. but never did the ""crazy deeds"". i mostly ignored all his bullshit rants. and he was just satisfied by screaming bullshit into my ears.  
the only thing he was good at was studies. academically he was not a problem, but everything else about him was a problem.  
one day he arrives at my door step. he wasn't on his bicycles, mind you it takes a 30 minute walk from his place to mine.  
he was covered in bruises and was bleeding from his nose. but he has been hurt like this before but on his own. this clearly looked like someone did this to him.   
he collapsed on me, i took him to my spare bedroom and rode my way to his house.  
much to my shock , the fire brigade was there. black smoke everywhere. the tree house in his yard was burned down.   
when i went to his father he gave me a 'what the fuck do you want ' look.  
pretending that i don't know anything i asked him where my friend Dan was.  "" that little devil is never ever returning here. you better find sane friends. and if you ever see him, say, we're done with him. he ain't our family no more."" without much question i turned around. ' he lit the green tree up huh' is what i thought then.  
i return home. he is deep asleep from his wounds. i never really asked him how got those wounds , but i assumed that his family were at their limits. and reporting his family to the police meant making his way into the asylum. he needed therapy but it would probably ruin anything his future holds. i took out a airport type bag and went over to his place again to maybe get hold of anything he has. maybe what he wears.   


they gladly welcomed me to take the ""garbage"" away. while i was collecting his stuff from his room his brother walks in.  "" why exactly why are you keeping him with you? what are you in love with him? child i say you, he is dead crazy. he kills rats. almost eats them""  
i reply him with a , "" i dont know why i'm keeping him. yes i love him, not romantically, i have a girlfriend. i know how crazy he is. but he isn't crazy with me. ""  
he rolls his eyes and stumps away.  


i told my mom that a friend was staying with me since he got kicked out. my mother first asked whether we had contacted cps , but i made up some scenario that his family was crazy  and hes almost 17. a year more he'd be 18 and it wouldn't matter. we never really had financial problems and mom visited rarely whenever she got her chance. i managed to get him to behave.   


i knew i couldn't keep him for long if he wasn't changing. the only advantage i had was him not being crazy and violent at me. i could feel his inner instincts saw me as a motherly/protective figure.  
getting him to the local therapist without letting my mom know was the hardest part.  
nothing was easy . the first 30 days with him were absolutely horrible. he had no conduct , no manners. like i knew he didn't but tolerating that for a whole day was again a new drama. i became a mini therapist myself. i had studies too, but i  was already in college and was communicated from home not campus hostels. i had to reason and logic with his every wrong deed.  
you see it is easier to logic a dumb person than a person who already understands the consequences.   
the hardest part in his recovery was making him understand why is it wrong to do something wrong.  
like literally what i said. but very slowly it did work out.   
of course my mother found out one day of what kind of a person i was letting to freeload. but by that time he was , much much normal. only if his family had put a bit more effort on him.

  
he will be 25 next month. we live in a different state now. he looks absolutely sane. acts sane. has a stable job. no one can tell he was a human form of devil once in his life. he has an understanding and patient boyfriend. he would soon move out and live with him completely. i was sternly against the idea of telling his boyfriend about his past hell-hound. but Dan insisted himself that his boyfriend should know. the man didn't believe shit at first. but since he has noticed a few odd behaviors from Dan himself he can make a guess.

he didn't try to contact his family at all. i mean if i were in his shoes i wouldn't either. but his mother once contacted me via facebook. his mother did not have an account before so Dan couldn't block her. she check quite a bit of his profile. and all she wrote to me was, "" is he happy?''. i was surprised at her message and said yes because he indeed was. after  a few this and that chat she ended with, ""thank you for doing my job.""  


i was gonna say that no maam he pays me occationally for taking care of him back in time and even though i say that theres no need of payment your love is enough i do take the cash.

180," 

I met my friend when i was like in grade 4. He was always a troubled child. he argued with the teachers. hurt other kids. tore books, banged benches until he realized he couldn't break them. not one single day passed that he didn't cause a mess. the more we grew more crazier he became. i was not his friend until we were like 10-12 years old.i was 2 years and two grades older, but i did know him.

He once entered the female changing room where i was too , and dragged a girl by hair half naked. no one knew why. both kids' the guardians were called. he never said why he did what he did and was suspended nonetheless. by this time i was his friend, well rather acquaintance. why you ask? because we both were queer and closeted. how we got to know we both were queer is a story for another day.so when i asked him why he did so, his simple reply was, ""it was fun."" and just that. he would behave rudely with almost anyone. well except me. for some reason.

when i got a girlfriend. he got really jealous for a while, saying she was snatching me away from him. no he wasn't obsessed with me. maybe his unconsciousness was scared of loosing the only friend he had. he soon got over being mad at my girlfriends or boyfriends as they changed quiet a few times. he would often come over at my place ( i live alone, mom used to be always out of station and send money, no dad). he would come over. say nothing, cry at my shoulder and then without a word leave. i knew his parents hated him. he was enough crazy outside , i wonder what he was inside the house where his freedom formed more wings. his parents once tried to put him in an asylum but it didn't work out. he voluntarily got out.therapies never worked on him.by the time he was 14 he had assaulted (just beaten up, nothing sexual) countless people our age, dogs, animals. his parents were fed up of him. he hated his older brother, whom his parents obviously focused more on.he never bothered me with any of his crazy antics, yes he was clearly crazy in front of me. but never did the ""crazy deeds"". i mostly ignored all his bullshit rants. and he was just satisfied by screaming bullshit into my ears.the only thing he was good at was studies. academically he was not a problem, but everything else about him was a problem.one day he arrives at my door step. he wasn't on his bicycles, mind you it takes a 30 minute walk from his place to mine.he was covered in bruises and was bleeding from his nose. but he has been hurt like this before but on his own. this clearly looked like someone did this to him.he collapsed on me, i took him to my spare bedroom and rode my way to his house.much to my shock , the fire brigade was there. black smoke everywhere. the tree house in his yard was burned down.when i went to his father he gave me a 'what the fuck do you want ' look.pretending that i don't know anything i asked him where my friend Dan was. "" that little devil is never ever returning here. you better find sane friends. and if you ever see him, say, we're done with him. he ain't our family no more."" without much question i turned around. ' he lit the green tree up huh' is what i thought then.i return home. he is deep asleep from his wounds. i never really asked him how got those wounds , but i assumed that his family were at their limits. and reporting his family to the police meant making his way into the asylum. he needed therapy but it would probably ruin anything his future holds. i took out a airport type bag and went over to his place again to maybe get hold of anything he has. maybe what he wears.

they gladly welcomed me to take the ""garbage"" away. while i was collecting his stuff from his room his brother walks in. "" why exactly why are you keeping him with you? what are you in love with him? child i say you, he is dead crazy. he kills rats. almost eats them""i reply him with a , "" i dont know why i'm keeping him. yes i love him, not romantically, i have a girlfriend. i know how crazy he is. but he isn't crazy with me. ""he rolls his eyes and stumps away.

This one hurt. But it could of been worse. I was in the club dark club.. I been getting few numbers through the night. Danced with a few girls didn’t think nothing of it. 

One of them ended up being a trans women. 
I felt so ashamed and violated. I found out 3 weeks after the day in the club. this person hits me up to chill, I was busy that day. I stalked the social media’s ( I have my ways without asking) I always double check. We never really texted so we didn’t have no in deep convo. Something seemed off. Until she hit me that week to chill. 

It’s funny because I try to avoid things like this. Something wasn’t right but I was naive. Pictures super edited don’t really remember how the person looked like.


I found out that day. Started asking questions cause things seemed fishy. Even though after I found out the person ended up texting me the truth. I just didn’t respond and blocked the number. 

(Could of handled it better but I was pissed) all I could think bout was that day in the club 

I felt ashamed. And so embarrassed. Usually in situations like this someone in the club would of tapped me on the shoulder or not maybe no one noticed. 

I feel like they should of told me right then and there.
I never met up with the person so I didn’t do anything sexual with them or go on a date. (Thank god)

I do remember dancing for for 4 secs with them though.

This situation been bugging me for the past month because I never felt so embarrassed in my life. Questions like “how I didn’t noticed?” “Club was loud didn’t get to hear the voice” I should of took a good look at the person” 

I bet People that were at the club that day was like “ I don’t think he knows” or was just laughing. 

I’m a straight male. Dated plenty of women. 
I do care about reputation though. I don’t want to go out in public or a club and people whisper this situation talking about me. Like “ ain’t that the dude dancing with the trans that one night” and worse see that person again because it would just bring anger out.

I been in house for the past month isolated. 

No one asked me about it though. How would y’all handle this situation? I’m a dude people look up to me that shouldn’t even be in embarrassing situations like this. Young. 

And did y’all ever see anything happen similar?",21Mar2020,1

184,"For as long as I can remember I’ve been able to have internal dialogues with myself and I guess you could say voice(s) in my mind. You know how in older movies there would be a scene of a character quickly flipping through TV channels to find something to watch? That’s what my mind is like. I feel like at any given time I’m flipping through about 30/40 different conversations or thoughts with myself and there’s music in the background. It makes it hard to think sometimes and is rather annoying. But it sometimes helps me, the main voice in my mind reflects who I am pretty well, it’s mostly pessimistic and realistic with a cutting sarcasm. Because of this I can generally make people laugh, I’m good at having deadpan look and can come up with smart-ass retorts easily. I’m decently popular at school because of this and get along well with others. But the voice has been more negative than usual. I don’t feel like I can enjoy anything new because it tells me that whatever it is I want to do is stupid and not worth it or that I’m less of a person if I want to do it. Anyone else have stuff like this or am I losing it?",21Mar2020,1
