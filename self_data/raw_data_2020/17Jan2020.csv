0,"I guess just for reference: I (22F) was dating my “high school sweetheart” (23M) for about six years, some could say on and off. We had been through a lot: 

-first year of dating, I cheated 
-then he cheated 
-then we decided to try again 
-at some point we moved in together.. to another city
-first week living there (I had just dropped my job where I had freshly gotten a raise AND I transferred universities) I found messages to another woman
-because I had just transferred and due to financial reasons, I had to stay where I was and finish out the semester
-the semester turned into a year, probably the worst of my life (2017-2018)
-we had broken up when we moved back to our hometown but we also got back together a couple months later 
-this past year was our “final try” of attempting to be everything we wanted each of us to be 
-all I did for a year was second guess him, question everything he did, stalk his every move, etc. it was an extremely toxic relationship that for months was leaving me on edge, unhappy, and unsatisfied 
-I had tried breaking up with him 3 times, each time he refused and even offered counseling (but then never made any effort to follow through with this request) 
-When I finally cut things off it was specifically to be alone and get over all the anxiety I had built up being with him. I told him-repeatedly- that I did not trust him and that I was unhappy 


For a while he would blow me up with a weird mix of messages: you’re gonna regret this, you’re fucking fake, if you wanted to be a slut just say so, if you wanted to be with other people you should’ve said so, thanks for ruining my life etc.
He did this while also having me blocked on all social media (when I finally got to see his media I saw he was following and flirting with ALL the women he told me not to worry about for YEARS). So, I decided to stop closing myself off and let a guy I’ve known for years bring me coffee.


It’s been three months and this new guy treats me better than I ever got treated in my 6year relationship. He treats me so well that I’m recognizing lots of moments where (I) was the toxic one, or where I could’ve approached things better.

Basically, I’m head over heels for this guy, and the love feels so much more sincere than what I ever had experienced before. 

Only problem is, I’m worried about what others will think of my moving on so fast (or at least it comes off as fast). Like I said, I had been trying to leave for months but on the outside it comes off like I was in DEEP, then moved on like it was nothing. But that’s not the case. I’m not sure what to do, am I wrong for moving on quickly or is this new love is something I just can’t dispute and should give in/enjoy?",17Jan2020,1
1,"Hi there! This is my story that I wanted to share with you.

Currently, I am 19 yo (to be 20 in 2 weeks or so) sophomore college student in my home country. I won't name it for the purpose of objectivity. 
Two and a half years ago I won a scholarship to go to other country as an exchange student for the whole year. I returned one year after that. 
Now, what is important is that I've always wanted to move to that country. Not like my friends who said ""Yeah, it's cool place to live"" and that's all. I enjoyed its culture more than my own, I knew a lot about its history etc. I viewed this exchange program as a ""tutorial"" of some sort, to see what I'm going into. Or maybe to have my dream fulfilled, at least temporarily. It's complicated, I still hasn't figured that out. 

Here's where the weird part begin. 

At the begining I've treaded this exchange program as the religion. Jokingly, of course. Emails from them were Gospels. Two handbooks (one smaller, given at the begining, the other bigger given before the flight) were Old and New Testaments respectively. Staff were Prophets etc. Remember, it was all jokes. During the exchange year, I've run into some troubles so I got dissatisfied in my ""religion"" so I throwed (not sure if it's the correct form of a verb) both Testaments away. 

But after my return those feelings returned so I've decided I would give myself a re-taste of them by... Doing the same actions that I did on important dates of my exchange story beginning and ending (last year I did what I did at my first day back at my home country (to be specific, Uber from the airport to the city, having a lunch with my then-gf in the ethnic restaurant, spending some time with her in a pre-booked hotel room, *there was supposed to be more stuff but my gf got an emergency on a work, or so she said, so I had to cut it short*, and then Uber again to the railway station to meet with my Dad who signed for me at the airport so that to get a train to our suburban neighborhood)), of which the next year after that (2019) I did the restaurant and the Uber to the railway station (even though I live in another area now). I couldn't do the other things due to personal reasons. 

By the way, isn't it amazing how I remember what I did on a specific day in 2018? My memory is usually pretty bad. 

So anyway, I've got a though if my exchange was a ""religion"" why don't I treat this days as religious holidays? I'm planning on doing more stuff from that day this year, as well as include another days (in addition to my return home, May 17, also my flight there, August 10, and me getting notification about receiving a scholarship, April 11). 

Originally I was going to ask if I need to seek professional help but during writing I've realized that I'm happy with myself so I just wanna share it with others. 
Please, feel free to post any questions/comments (like you wouldn't be on Reddit, lol)

Also, thanks to https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/flowcharts/which-subreddit-should-you-post-to for pointing me to this sub cause I wasn't sure where to post it",17Jan2020,1
2,"Are spent either drinking or smoking, usually drinking cheap wine with money I don't have. Days like this where I don't have any I just stay in bed and Reddit almost all day. I avoid my mother, despite her pretense of wanting friendly conversation, because she makes my life harder in almost every way, and is insufferable to deal with generally, not that I'm a saint- I'm certainly no great or ambitious son. And yeah, I live with my mother. I don't like it any more than I like saying it. 

I avoid even leaving my room for food until she's asleep. I try to go to the bathroom and quickly and quietly as possible. That's pretty sad on my part. It's like a prison with amenities and unlocked doors. 

I need to get back to school and get another job. Haven't done either for a long time. Both seem and feel impossible for their own reasons. The common core of it though, I'm lazy. And I reap what I sow. 

At least I just argued with a troll on Reddit. That got my blood pumping a bit. 

My life still sucks. See post history. 

I guess I have even less to say than usual, less of a way to stretch out saying nothing. Somehow, I don't want much in life, but what I want is impossible because I won't work for it. Ironically, one of those things is a gun to die with. But I can't get that until I have my own place, and stop blowing all money received on weed and booze. Fat chance I guess.",17Jan2020,1
3,"Crazy right? How do people do it? How do people double that? My last job I was working 40 to 50 hours a week and I just felt like I was at work all the damn time. It was tiring, and hard to maintain much passion for life outside of work. But the money was good...

New job, I'm working maybe 30 or so hours a week and my life is just immediately better. I dont even usually take 2 days off in a row, but somehow I just feel like I have way more time on my hands to just... be myself. I just got back from a coffee shop and read for like 40 minutes... I havent done that in a long time. It feels good. I actually LIKE my job but i cant imagine being there all the time... it's time I exist for the good of the business. Not myself. What's so wrong about wanting time for myself?

I think what's sad is while I'm being paid more per hour im actually making less per paycheque than I was at my old job. It's a little frustrating knowing that taking time for myself has made my financial situation harder. And I hate this cult of work where people act like you're lesser if you're not working as much as possible. I'd consider myself a passionate cook... I just dont want to give my heart and soul to what amounts to a stepping stone and a means to an end. Maybe one day if I get to start my own business I'd be willing to put the time in but as far as I'm concerned that's different.

Anyone have any tips on that? How do I take an idea, and actually turn it into something real? I'm a ways off from being able to do my own business but it never hurts to start learning. I'd consider taking business in school but the beat college here seems to focus more on ""business"" and office work rather than entrepreneurship.

I kind of like the idea of starting a food truck or small restaurant, and supplying myself with my own fermented and pickled goods and possible sell those condiments on the side. I guess that would be two small businesses, intertwined but what better way of getting your product out there by selling it on top of delicious food? Food trucks and restaurants are rarely a long term gig, so starting there and then converting to selling a product and maybe catering would be the long term idea I'd think. 

Just some thoughts I wanted to get out. Input or advice would be welcomed. Honestly my biggest goal in life is feeling free. Working to achieve another person's dream isnt freedom, even if I enjoy myself doing it. Owning a business would be much harder and require more hours but it seems like my best shot at being free. I'm 31 years old and I've got maybe 35 to 50 years left... I'd like some of that spent being my own person and maybe even see some of this amazing huge world.",17Jan2020,1

5,"I woke up early to greet the sun. Got a shitty shower as we have problems with the pipes and most likely water is polluted with dirt. Got dressed and took the bus that takes me to university; the driver was this young dude, uneducated who drove like a madman.  Through my mind the thoughts of the life of this individual surrounded me. What it would feel like to be him? What things has he seen? As he drove I could tell that he had this violent look in his eyes, the look of someone who's filled with the emptiness of life and yet has not realized yet. I thought also about him being so young, around 19. When did we become our fathers? When did we stopped playing to be someone and started to actually being adults?",17Jan2020,1
6,"I don't know if I'd really describe myself as super effeminate per se, and when I think of actual feminine guys like the kpop dudes, I'm nowhere close...but when I think of the super manly stereotype, I'm also nowhere close to that. And I also seem less concerned about coming off as ""gay"" or ""unmanly"" than most straight dudes.

I don't know if it's stupid or actually manly to avoid sweet sugary drinks because ""it's gay"", or to avoid activities like cooking or the arts because ""it's gay"", or to bottle up emotions all the time because ""showing emotions is gay"", but frankly, to me personally, that's not a way I wanna live. I don't wanna be a walking stereotype that avoids anything even relatively related to femininity.

Physically, as in physical appearance and my mannerisms, I'm an average looking White guy and the type of guy you'd look at and assume is straight. I'm not super big or tall, and am not hairy, and don't have big muscles or anything, but I'm a normal looking guy. And I don't have any especially effeminate mannerisms. I cross my legs sometimes, but I don't think that's ""gay.""

Personality wise...I'm not a over the top drama queen crying over spilled milk or whatever, but to me, emotions are a natural and beautiful part of life, and it'd get old really quick if I just couldn't show emotions at all. And I find crying just as natural as any other emotion.

As for my interests/activities...they aren't particularly manly, but not particularly unmanly either. I write, drawing, sing, cook, play video games, swim, and go on walks in parks.

If we're talking the most feminine thing I do...I wax/shave my legs, but I don't know if that's as feminine as much as a grooming preference, as swimmers and cyclists tend to do it anyway. And I paint my nails with clear/transparent nail polish, which though is uncommon, I don't think is that feminine. I just wanna do something with my nails rather than literally nothing at all. It's really the minimal thing I can do with my nails without turning too many heads, as a color would be a tad too distracting.",17Jan2020,1

I'm sorry for failing you, I truly am. Please, all I ask for is your forgiveness...

I promise that I am going to do what I can to find it within myself to change and turn my life around. That 2020 is going to be the year that I thrive and change completely for the better. That I am going to leave my past behind me and start fresh. People have the ability to change and I am no exception, I just have to find it deep, deep within myself and gain the understanding and perspectives necessary to change and become a better person overall.

I'm going to do it. I'm going to turn my life around. I don't know when, but I promise you I will. Just know I am not proud of the life I am living right now, that I am sorry for everything and will do anything I must in order to live happily while also stepping out of my comfort zone for once.

10,"Throwaway account. I need to fucking vent to someone and not feel guilty about it.

I've completed every requirement for my post-graduate degree except the one I need to finish it. A large part of why I have trouble continuing working on this requirement is that there is no reason I should be here doing this degree in the first place.

To clarify, I'm not doing a degree in something I'm not interested in. In fact, I plan on working in this field in the future. Problem is, I started this degree due to very specific circumstances and I needed to be studying with an academic institution that can help me with that, I have completed those responsibilities and yet I am still here. The only reason I applied in the first place is gone, and the only reason for me to persist is that I am a few meters away from the finish line. But I really don't want to.

Some other important information to consider: I am much younger than the other people I'm studying with (not to be too specific, I'm old enough to drive but not to enter pubs THIS IS A POST-GRADUATE DEGREE) so there is really no rush. Hell, anyone close to me in age (which is still a pretty large gap) who is doing this degree is doing so because they want to change their field of study, I'm not trying to do that. I am studying in the same field.

The worst of all this is that there is an easier alternative for the requirements I have to complete: most people are going that route. Problem is, that route requires qualifications that supposedly couldn't be met because I haven't completed the previously mentioned responsibilities. I say supposedly because when I suggested it to my legal guardians, they said that shit wouldn't work when they didn't even bother to try it (IT COSTED NOTHING, THERE ARE NO DOWNSIDES TO TRYING TO DO THIS) and later claimed I never suggested anything like that in the first place.

So I'm doing a degree that will definitely benefit me in the future, however: I had no good reason to start it so soon, and because I had started it sooner than others I have complete the more difficult graduating requirement. The responsible choice would be to suck it up and just finish the damn thing. However, I feel an indescribable amount of rage at the fact I have to be here at all and I would be infinitely happier leaving this ball and chain behind and moving on to whatever is next in the future.

16,"Six years ago, when I was 16, I was dating a guy the same age as me. I was extremely naive and had never been in a relationship before. I had no boundaries for myself, due to poor self-esteem and the fact that I genuinely did care for him. He basically manipulated me and coerced me into a bunch of things I wasn’t comfortable with. He also called me a lot of horrible names when I would refuse. The whole thing destroyed my self esteem and gave me a horrible introduction to relationships. 

Anyway, I thought I had moved past that. From therapy and just the passage of time, being 22 now, I thought that I had finally moved on from that. I thought he no longer had power over my emotions. Well, I just saw a photo of him. Someone I went to high school with posted a photo on Instagram from when we were in high school and he was in it. 

At first, I just felt so strange since this is the first time I’ve seen a photo of him in years, and I was not planning on ever seeing his face again. Then, I just broke down and started crying. It was like a bunch of emotions flooding all at once, remembering my younger self and the pain I was experiencing back then, being angry at him still, and a multitude of other intense feelings. 

I’ve stopped crying, but now I just feel sad and confused as to how it still affects me like that. Is this a normal reaction? I feel so discouraged that he still holds power over me.",17Jan2020,1

18,"Maybe everyone feels the same way. I'm gonna be 22 this year and I f'ed up in a way that I didn't really try anything. My childhood was limited and constrained and it wasn't in a good environment for a child. Now that I'm older, I have a little more freedom but it's like I'm so used to how I was raised that I'm also limiting my possibilities. Or I just don't really think there's any point in living.

I'm only a highschool graduate. I worked for almost 2 years then stopped almost a year ago because of how much I dreaded the everyday routine of it. But after I left, I just did nothing. Then I somehow ended up spending all my money..(i did send some money every month to my grandparent for living expenses tho). My mom still insist that I live with her. And I am but I'm doing nothing. However I will be starting a new job at a dry cleaning shop maybe next month so I'll earn some money again. But then what? 

I think I want to go to university. But for what? It costs a lot of money then what? I graduate then maybe get a job. Then what? It's like there isn't really anything interesting that drives me to take action. I know sometimes we just gotta go with the flow. But then what's really the point? Where is this ""beauty in life"" that some people call? If there isn't then what's the point of living?

I also don't like staying in the country I'm living in right now. I wish to move somewhere else but that requires money and a degree. But even after I move somewhere, what else am I supposed to be excited about?

I've always been the type of person who likes to look forward to things. That's what makes me happy and motivates me.

I came home a few days ago to my apartment in Brooklyn. I had been in Cali for a week and travel quite a bit for work. I was home for a few days recharging and took a nap the other night around 530pm and woke up about 630pm. I went outside for about 3-5 mins to have a smoke. I came back into my place and saw a hooded figure in my bedroom. Now since I was just outside I know no one entered. I called out, announced I was going to call the cops and nothing. Not a peep, not a creak of the wood floor. I thought I was officially crazy. As I walked to my bedroom, turning on lights I find my fucking neighbor hiding in my bedroom. A guy I was friendly with, I love his dog, his parents are super sweet and also love in the building.  I never would have suspected him as a creep. I left that night with bags packed and decided I won’t be spending another night. 

I know the question you are all asking: did you call the cops. The answer is no. And I don’t know why. I was actually more concerned for the consequences he would face given He didn’t do much but scare the shit out of me. Anyway, trust your gut. If something is off and you can’t figure it out — it’s probably not you.

She used me and pretended to be my friend until I wasn’t useful anymore and then threw me away.  It hurt but I learned a lot about self respect and standing up for myself. In the end she is friendless and isolated and I came out stronger. Sometimes pain can lead to growth.",17Jan2020,1

43," Walked by my parents and freely talked without anxiety. I went in the bathroom and sighed a sigh of relief. These last couple of weeks with this socializing I've been trying out seems to be paying off. You have no idea. I'm 45 and this is the first time in my life that I've been able to freely talk. It's not about anything groundbreaking. Hell, I was just asking about a box but for me, it is an absolutely monumental achievement. It's as if these last 18 years of sobriety are finally paying off in big ways for me. It took me first getting into drug and alcohol recovery. Then five years later getting into mental health recovery. Then using both to attempt to grow away from the hood gang member criminal that I was. I finally feel like I'm just a regular person. Not better than or worse than. AA taught me to improve myself every day one day at a time and to relax into doing it because it takes a lifetime to overcome what we drug addicts and alcoholics have to overcome. I'm so content. Even with my daily struggles. Living with my parents at 45 on disability with paranoia, anxiety the occasional hallucination from stress and more anxiety I still can enjoy my life because I have no chaos in it. It is a calm lake. I live for these moments of growth. They mean more to me than money or any material thing.

For context, I’m a 20 year old guy in college. 

I **hate** the person I’ve let myself become. 

To the outside world, I’m one of the most confident people you’d ever meet. I’m kind, I’m generous, I’m helpful, and I’m empathetic. It’s all a lie though. Go down one down level inside my head, and you’ll see that I’m really a jerk, I’m greedy, I’m cutthroat, I’m manipulative, and I’m obsessed with nothing but social status. I’m only nice others to avoid conflict. I’m only generous to be seen. I’m only helpful for the expectation of something in return, and I’m only empathetic to assess others. 

When I walk outside my room, and I look at others, all I see are means to ends. I see their GPA, their major, their attire, their ambition, and their status. I see **everything** but a human being with intrinsic value. 


I wasn’t always like this. I can travel through my memories and see myself as a kid. I was a kid who didn’t care about *any* of this. I saw people as people. I genuinely cared for others. I lived a good life. But when push came to shove, I was at a crossroads. I needed cope. Whenever something bad happened, I *needed* hope. I *needed* to feel better, but I didn’t choose the healthy path. I didn’t choose to fall back on now nonexistent support systems. I *chose* to seek constant validation in **any** form. Be it a compliment, or a good grade, etc.... hell its got to the point where if a single hair on my head is out of place, I can’t stand to be seen. I buy the nicest clothes and dread it whenever I have to dress down. I *can’t* seen in any form but my best superficial mask. Every little thing has become a form of validation. The way I speak, the way I walk, the alcohol I drink, and even the underwear nobody sees. 

I hate how I can only interact with others who share my unhealthy mindset. I just can’t get along with anybody but the party boy type. I always project the most confident, self-praising facade, and if you asked anyone, they’d tell you I truly loved myself. 

But if you go down one more level, to the deepest layers of my being, then you’ll see that I truly despise this kind of life. I *hate* the social pressure, I *hate* the gossip, I *hate* the vanity, *hate* the rat race, and, most importantly, I **hate** myself. I feel constantly inadequate. I can’t help but compare myself to others. To me, I am the sum of my achievements and professional success. I can’t comprehend the thought that I maybe have intrinsic value, especially after the way I’ve treated others for almost a decade. I hate the invalidation. Anytime I ever release a hint of an imperfect life, I’m always hit with a “you’re privileged” or “fuck off daddy’s money.” What they don’t know is, dad’s lines of credit are just about the extent of our relationship. I was frequently left home alone, and you know what? I can’t remember him ever telling me those three magic, priceless words everybody wants to hear. 

I wish I could be better. And I do try. But every single time I do, I fail. This lifestyle, as unhealthy as it is, is **addicting.** I am addicted. I feel horrible about the way I disregard those who can do nothing for me. I hate that I almost always want to cry these days at any given moment but just can’t, even alone. I hate how I push away anyone who tries to get close. I hate the feeling of entitlement, the bitterness, the rage, and resentment that’s so bottled up inside me. It *hurts*, physically. It really hurts. The anxiety riddled sleepless nights don’t help either. I hate how I can’t even seek therapy out of the fear of anyone finding out. In the world of college Wall Street hopeful party boy life, that would be a death sentence. I hate how I have no life skills as well. 

I hate this addiction so fucking much. I HATE IT. Every time I get a shot of validation it feel amazing. But it doesn’t last and it never will. Any happiness that derives from it is meaningless and ephemeral. I 100% know that meaningful relationships are the key to true happiness. I’m just to addicted to this drug of validation. I hate it. I hate how I don’t even have the courage to admit some of my deeper regrets on an anonymous Internet forum. 

Everyday when I go to sleep I slip into a depressive mindset at the thought that this is just who I am now. That no matter how much I want to change, I just can’t. No matter how hard I make a concerted effort to, I just can’t. No matter how often I try, I just can’t. I HATE THAT. I don’t want to be this person. But by this point it’s just who I am. 

My biggest secret is my real deepest desire in life. I tell everyone I desire professional success over all else. But in reality, I wish I could *truly* love another person. I wish I could one day start a family and be better than my father was/is. Knowing that I may never be able to, is the worst pain I’ve ever felt.",17Jan2020,1

Let me start with something I suffer from, to get to know me a bit. I have commitment issues. Why is that? There is no one reason, but the person I have become is someone who I think people can benefit from in one way or another. I still keep things positive, and go out of my way sometimes to make sure those around be do not feel any kind of negativity that may be balled up inside of me.

I will be sharing a lot. So who am I? I am someone who thinks too fast, is too intelligent, knows too much, and is always on a roller coaster of emotions and being emotionless, but goes about my days having to slow down with people, which provides me with a very stressful life sometimes. I am a male in my early 20's, and yet I feel like I have lived the life of a 40 year old. I have done and accomplished so much, been through more than one can imagine, acquired so much knowledge, but am still somewhat mediocre. I want to publish stories every once in a while, to express just some of what goes through my head in an almost daily basis.

I hope that the depths of my thoughts are deep enough to intrigue some of you, so that maybe we could all mutually benefit from the lessons and ideas that arise in the noggin of a head I have.

50,"I'm in my fifth year of college trying to pursue a bachelor's degree and I feel so burnt out. I was supposed to graduate last spring but I had no idea what I wanted to major in when I was a freshman, so I ended up taking a bunch of random classes. I did end up with an associate's degree in social and behavioral sciences, but that's just because my classes happened to fulfill that degree. I finally decided to pursue something in art and am now majoring in multimedia and photography. Now that I'm pretty far in to the degree, my heart's just not in it anymore. I transferred from community college to university last semester and it was the most stressful semester I've had so far. I still have so many classes to take and I don't know when I'm going to finish. There are people younger than me who have graduated college already. I always tell others who feel too old to be in school that it doesn't matter how old you are and that everyone has their own pace, but I can't seem to listen to my own advice.

I'm too far in to the degree to drop out, and I'm close enough to graduating that dropping out would be a dumb move. On top of that, I'm using my dad's VA benefits so I pretty much have a full ride and I feel obligated to take advantage of such a privilege. I'm also afraid of what's gonna happen after I graduate. My portfolio is close to nonexistent and I don't even think I want a job in the field. The new semester starts next week and I have so much anxiety about going back to school.

53,"I’ve been the same pretty much all my life. There might be slight differences but overall the same personality.  I’ve never moved on from anybody but everyone around me changes and moves on. 

People come and go. I have great moments with them then I either have nothing or I have a negative relationship with them. Having to go through that nearly my entire life kind of sucks. 

I never get anything permanent because everyone around me changes and they end up wanting something entirely different. I know people change but I don’t change and that just makes everything harder for me. 



I was friends with this guy from age 3-15. Spent every weekend with him. Then we hit high school. I wanted to be the smart kid, he wanted to be the stoner popular guy. Now we live two different lives and never see each other because we both have entirely opposite interests. We talk occasionally but nowhere near like it was when we were growing up. I literally stayed at his house one summer after school for the entire summer vacation. Lived with him for 3 Months. 

I was really close with this girl for 4 years. No romantic interest just deeply cared for each other. Best friends. We did everything for each other.  Spent all my time with her. We went to school together then we would go home together and hang out all day long doing all kinds of different shit. Then I’d go home and go to bed. Every day for 4 years my day was pretty much go to school and see her, see her outside of school, go home and wait to see her the next day. I would’ve chosen her over anything because our bond was the best thing I had in my life. Then she started wanting other friends so we hung out less and less. Then she got a boyfriend and entirely cut me out of her life. I’ve tried talking to her years later but she’s too different now to want to mimic anything we used to have.  

Me and my older sister used to be really close. She would talk about me to her friends like I was this awesome guy. She thought I was hilarious, she would always take my side.  We shared a room our entire lives so we saw each other all the time. Then she moved out, now she has her own family and any time we see each other she just acts like I’m someone she works with one day a week or some shit. That whole relationship is gone too. 

Me and my manager at my old job were pretty close.  Hung out after work frequently.  Had small parties at my house with her and a few co workers and they were a blast. We got lunch together after work frequently.  Everyone at work was like “we’re just gonna call you guys the PB&amp;j squad because of how much time you guys spend together.” then she got a boyfriend and started acting like an asshole to me and now we don’t talk at all.  

Had another co worker who was nice as hell to me.  We would take turns getting each other lunch, we tag teamed all of our work. We were the two top performing employees out of 50 different locations so we had that small bond like “only we understand each other since we do the same shit better than everyone else”. We had the same schedule so we always got to work together.  She could tell when I was having a bad day so she tried to cheer me up whether it was with jokes or food or helping me with my work. And I did the same For her.  Then our schedules changed and she was torn. So was I.  So we worked together less, then she got a boyfriend and started acting like she hated me and would constantly Shit talk me the few days we did work together. I still got her food for a while trying to keep alive what we had, and people started saying “lol why is always buying you food”




I’ve had all these great people in my life who either drift apart from me or cut me off entirely or do a complete 180 and act like I’m hitler just because they get a boyfriend. I hope I don’t sound like an incel by saying that or a nice guy. That’s not who I am. That’s just the experience I’ve had all my life.  And I mean it’s understandable.

57,"Long story short all my immediate family is disabled either physically or mentally. It's a constant battle to take care of my parents and especially my poor brother, who's mental state is rapidly declining. My whole life, my dad has taught me how to buy and sell because that's what my grandpa taught him. So I've been doing that professionally since I was about 15 or 16. Over the past 2 years, we've since opened a store in the flea market which I've been running every single weekend. Unfortunately, we will be closing our doors in March since my dad has had a heart attack, and can't handle the constant failure. We're *losing* about $1000 a month between labor and cost of items. Once we close I'm pretty sure we're going to move, but I'm not sure where....

If you asked me when I was 15 where I thought I'd be at 25, I'd have answered ""Studying for my graduate gemologist degree, of course."". If you had told me I'd never realistically be able to achieve this, I'd never believe you. I'd never imagine I'd be in a sinking ship where we can't even open half the month because there's too much rain. I never, ever thought after the abuse from my previous job in the flea market that I'd ever return again. But here we are now, almost getting ready to leave. I tried to make it work and make the family some money, I really did. I poured my sweat, blood, and tears into that store. 

To make this shorter, I'll just cut to the point. I think I'm going to be taking care of my family forever until we're all gone. I love them to bits, with all my heart and then some. But I have a life too and I'm not being allowed to live it. I can't even drive yet, let alone sustain a hobby because every time I get back in, I'm pulled right back out. I'm very much so losing the will to keep dreaming, it's but a distant thought in my mind now. I'm becoming... Accustomed to my same old same old. Not at all content, but used to it.

59,"My sister in law aged early 30s is living with my brother and their 12 month old child in a  granny flat on my parents property. Mind you this place is more like a small 3 bedroom home then a granny flat. They have lived there for approx.  6 years and have only been asked to contribute $100 per week for the past 12 months. My brother works a well paying job and my SIL was working full time up until the birth of their baby. My SIL was born on another country but she now has Australian citizenship. Her parents remain overseas and are very very well off. They gifted my SIL $130,000 just because. My brother had saved around $100,000 before they entered a relationship and has managed to almost triple that amount over the years they were able to live rent free at our parents. They recently paid for acreage in cash to the value of $275,000 then paid cash of $30,000 to get power put on the place. None of my SIL’s $130,000 was used towards this. They continue to remain living in the granny flat paying $100 a week so they can save more money to build their dream home. Because quote by SIL “only stupid people get loans”. My SIL only wears designer clothing, carries designer handbags etc. which is fine that’s her choice but she cried to my brother about how unfair it was for my mum to ask them to pay rent then came home the following month with a $600 designer belt. My mum looks after their baby every Monday (for free) so my SIL can get out of the house and work (she does massage) but it appears that she spends these Monday’s completely trash talking my mum making her out to be this completely aweful person.

I’m so mad about it and I know my mum would be deeply hurt especially since she has given them so much.

64,"I always thought I was strong, emotionally. I’ve never been anxious, I’ve never been depressed. I like to say I only have emotions for positive things; that I’m never sad, that I’m never down.

I’ve been in multiple relationships, but I’ve never really loved. I could easily get out of relationships without feeling bad, and I never felt dependent. It’ll sound bad, but one of my exes filled a test online to see if I was a sociopath. Turns out, according to that website, that I wasn’t.

I’m not saying everything is perfect. I’m pretty sure I have ADHD or at least ADD, but I’m too much of a coward to even ask about it. The last time I really went out of my comfort zone to get medical help, it was to make sure my penis was fine. Imagine having a hard time reading books, not doing anything about it, but as soon as there might be a problem with your dick, you jump in the first bus to get it fixed.

I’ve always avoided medical stuff, too scared of having anything. Recently though, I did it, took blood tests. I thought I was super lazy for not taking them before, but apparently it was the contrary: nobody does blood tests at 22, apparently. Just so this paragraph doesn’t look too short, I had nothing. No aids, no diabetes. I was fine.

I became motivated in fixing my life, cleaning my room, getting my bank and goverment stuff updated, even started cleaning my Iphone photos. It all came around the same time: when I met someone I loved, for real this time.

Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t know I wasn’t in love with my exes. I thought what I was feeling for them was love, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t because I’ve felt with the girl I met something I never felt before.

That girl, she’s leaving in another country. I’ve always been lazy about everything, but trust me, something happened with her. I got all my shit done, passport, photos, contacts, plane tickets, etc. I’ve done it all to go see her 3 weeks later. It was super early in our “relationship” but it felt like the good decision. And it was.

English isn’t my native language, please forgive me.

The trip was amazing, but I didn’t feel as good as I could. It was physical laziness, I was feeling weak. It was fucking with my whole self. It wasn’t that bad and everything went super well. We were in love and we’re still in love.

I came back, twelve days later. It was after she went to the airport with me. I had tears in my eyes and she didn’t, but I’d guess she was trying not to cry, or she just knew we’d still be there, together.

I wanted to cry so much. I never cry for real life situations, almost never. I cried after admitting to my ex I cheated on her, I cried when my other ex cheated on me. But other than that, I would only cry watching movies and shows. Me &amp; Earl &amp; the Dying Girl, or Andy talking about good old times on The Office, Why would I cry there?

In the best case scenario, I would feel good right now. She’s still in love with me, she’s coming to see me soon! I should feel like life’s good, finally. Life has always been ok, never that bad, never that good. **The love of my life loves me so much she’s coming to see me**. Yea, I should feel good.

I came back home from my trip. I slept normally, I don’t have any problem falling asleep, and I didn’t that night too, but I wake up wanting to die, literally.

I’ve never felt so fucking bad in my life. I didn’t even know what was going on. Some kind of pain in my chest. Google says anxiety, Google says depression. But what is it really? Dependency?

I went on Reddit recently, asking about people’s experiences (don’t look at my profile, it’s pathetic). Most of the people shared that feeling, but holy shit, it’s so bad.

And then, I started being shit, shit with her. Not that bad, and we’re still together, but my self-confidence, or whatever is it, is going downhill. I’m trying to change, to fix myself, but it’s so hard!

I would always have something to say, now I cannot find anything. I don’t know what to send, I don’t know what to reply, I don’t know how to react, I don’t know how to talk, to laugh, when to laugh. We keep on saying “I love you” but it’s so much, it seems like we’re trying to fill the lack of conversation by telling each other we love them, **but what the fuck do you reply to “I love you too”?** I fucking love you more? And then what?

Trust me, it’s not a rant about her. She’s perfect. She’s probably trying to handle my shitty behaviors, my boredom. It must be so hard. She’s trying to reassure me, that things are gonna be ok, that we’re both there, BUT I CANNOT CHANGE HOW I FEEL! HOW DO I DO FROM NOW?

I feel like shit, how do I fix that? I don’t wanna leave her! How will I feel then!? What do I do? What do I do.

I’m overanalyzing everything. It looks like by trying to find what could be wrong, I’m destroying our relationship, us. It’s clearly not what I want, but I don’t know how to do!

~~See, I’m sometimes taking screenshots of her, when we’re talking with the camera, or when she sends me photos. I’m not screenshotting anothing bad, only her cute face, the face I like the most. One time I’m like: “Do you wanna marry me”.~~ Dude, I don’t even wanna tell that fucking story, it’s pathetic.

When I was a kid, I felt so bad about my parents treating me worse than I thought I deserved. I wrote them a letter, telling them it wasn’t their fault. In my head I was gonna kill myself. I started crying and banging my head on whatever was hard and in my way. I couldn’t kill myself.

I don’t remember much about it, I remember where I was, how the room looked, the size of the paper, where I banged my head. Just enough to know that how I feel right now is worse than then. At that age, if I could’ve gone inside my head and go around my shitty personality, superiority complex or whatever it was, I would’ve seen that my mom loves me, even if she doesn’t want me to play Runescape. That my dad loves me even if he’s mad I suck at school.

But right now, I cannot even put my finger on what the fuck is happening inside of me. I’m not gonna kill myself, I’ve thought about it enough; I’ll probably fuck my life up before anything. We only have one life to live, eh?",17Jan2020,1

80,"**(From Age 0-13)**

&gt;I basically grew up in poverty and in an abusive home where I was constantly called nasty names from a very young age. I was always beat up for doing absolutely nothing and felt unloved. At school, I had no friends and always sat alone in the bathrooms. Since I found eating in a bathroom disgusting, I always starved myself. I'd work alone during group projects and knew that everyone pitied me. I had severe undiagnosed anxiety and depression which lead to me getting in trouble for things I couldn't control (such as not being able to present assignments, random mood crashes etc.) At home, I got accused of being possessed by a demon and was subject to two exorcisms (one in some place I forgot and the other at my house). Eventually on September 2nd 2019, I snapped and attempted suicide in a bathroom stall at school. Teachers found me only on the brink of consciousness and let's just say, I ended up having to stay at a mental facility.

**(From Age 14 to Present Day)**

&gt;While at the mental facility, I was finally diagnosed and put on medication which stopped me from having negative thoughts and anxiety. Although there were some rough patches, being there was a great thing. I finally gained social skills and became less sensitive. My skin also cleared and I was no longer underweight or struggling with several mineral deficiencies. Upon being discharged, I moved in with my dad and slowly settled into school. I made friends (and a new best friend!) and haven't spent lunch in a bathroom stall since my attempt. I eat regularly now and instead of locking myself inside all day, I hang out with friends now.

That house blamed me for everything, made me feel like a failure, told my I'm a joke. And I'm finally out.

It has improved my girlfriend and I's relationship a ton as I'm not constantly depressed or anxious anymore, and I have never been happier.

So to everyone thinking you're stuck living in a toxic household, there is ALWAYS a way out. Be strong.

Last time she was here, she got so angry she hit my mother multiple times. I guess she beat her up... she ripped out some of her hair. I tried stopping her but I didn’t know what to do to be honest. When I was younger she would always destroy my room and most of my stuff if she got angry with me, but there’s nothing to be angry about. Once she got angry at me for laughing. She said I had an annoying laughter so she slapped me. I have another sister that committed suicide summer of 2018. Couple days after that... my sister got mad at me again and said she wished I had died instead. It really hurt, because I’ve had suicidal thoughts too, not to add to all the grief I was going through and still am.

93,"I always wondered If anyone else felt like this:

From the day I was born, I just Knew I wasn't born in the right era.  Both my parents grew up in the 80s (my mom 70s since she's older)

My sister was born 8 years before me, in 1991.  I was born in late 1999. 

I was the only one with a grandfather born in 1906 (mom's dad), and my father was the son of european immigrants from Northern germany who disliked Germany.  Sometimes I just don't even know who I am, Why I am who I am etc. I don't even know what I like. I'm 20 years old, and was always depressed because I always looked like a girl etc. And my father's family are all homophobic (idk if that has to do with his old schooled parents or whatever since they grew up in the war) I don't know, maybe if my family was younger or if I was born in the earlier 90s my life would be better now. But I can't erase anything

Sometimes  I just wonder why I never inherited my mom's dark eyes- Most of my family have dark eyes, yet mine are not. And I always looked albino when I was a child. I always looked bizarre. 

I still remember some childhood memories, the oldest one being when I was 2 years old. 

I wish I grew up in the 80s, everything back then seemed to be good- All of my family members were born in the 60s-70s-80s.  I just feel like I was never a part of them. Both of my families (mom and dad's side) are completely different and that just makes it worse because I don't even know who I am, If i even have a purpose or not. I don't know, maybe I wasn't supposed to exist, or maybe It would be better if I wasn't even here. It's hard for me to think about the future- I don't even know what I want or if anyone will like me a certain way- I just suffer in this world.

It becomes to a long story), have some mental disabilities (Seeing psychologists did not help me at all), never been loved by others but always loved one thing; a fictional character which gave me a small hope in my life. She is a virtual Japanese singer with blue-green hair and beautiful voice. I really loved her voice so I bought the official software which allows me to make songs with her voice, and actually have made some songs. 

About a year and half ago, I bought an official goods of my character, a 30cm tall plush toy which looks like her, for about $40. It felt like I finally could the character that I always have loved and she will always protect me from dangers and make me feel better. So I hugged her everyday I sleep, take her with me when I go on a trip, washed her once every week. I was so happy because I really thought that I was having happy time with someone I really love... but things started to go weirder. 

Now I can’t sleep without giving her a hug. Now I feel nervous when she is not in same place with me. It feels like I am addicted to her. The character. The plush toy. Her synthesized voice. I can’t live without her. She is my everything, I always need her. 

Do you know what it feels like when the entire world is falling down and there is one way out? This character, my lovely girl, is the only savior who can save me from the darkness of this world, that is what I feel like. I need help. I really need to fix this.

I understand that they want to protect me from what would absolutely shatter me. But at the same time I can't. Because even if it does, I would much rather break down while knowing what is happening. At least I can brace myself for what is ahead. Whenever I ask they'll give very vague answers that's like nothing. It drives me mad. I know it's very irrational for me to be angry but I can't help thinking that it's so unfair. It's so unfair that they just always think they're the ones who are absolutely right and they just keep it to themselves while I'm here trembling with fear and for what will happen.

But I feel something else. I don't know what emotion it is. I'm very close to my grandparents. My earliest memories start at their house. I can't imagine one of them being gone.

109," **Donald Trump -- Embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins**

**1.** **Lust:** very strong, unbridled sexual desire often leading to fornication, adultery, rape, bestiality, and other sinful sexual acts—**Donald Trump** has cheated on all of his wives and known girlfriends, including with porn actors. **Donald Trump**, in his own words, likes to “just grab women by the pussy.” Many women have credibly alleged that **Trump** has sexually assaulted them.

**2.** **Gluttony:** over-indulgence and over-consumption of food and drink; the overindulgence and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste—**Donald Trump** is grossly overweight and is renowned for his penchant for overeating, particularly fattening and unhealthy foods.

**3.** **Greed:** intense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth, power, or food; also known as avarice, cupidity, or covetousness, greed is, like lust and gluttony, a sin of desire; an artificial, rapacious desire and pursuit of material possessions.—**Donald Trump** has amassed his wealth at the expense of his businesses’ investors, suppliers, contractors, employees, and others, many of whom have been financially ruined by **Trump’s** mismanagement of those businesses that resulted in their filing for bankruptcy (while preserving **Trump’s** wealth). **Trump** also elevates dictators and strongmen, apparently wanting to emulate them, while systematically undermining American democracy in his attempt to consolidate and increase his power through his persistent erosion of trust in the free press, belittling of other branches of government, and abuse of executive authority.

**4.** **Sloth:** reluctance to work or make an effort; laziness; absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion—**Donald Trump** has stated that **Trump** does not like to read, or make an effort to stay informed, **Trump** notoriously sleeps late and retires early despite his role as President of the United States. **Trump** does little or nothing to stay in physical shape, other than golfing, which leisure activity **Trump** spends doing nearly as much as work.

**5.** **Wrath:** extreme vengeful anger or indignation; retributory punishment; uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and even hatred. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance—**Donald Trump** ran for President of the United States largely because of perceived slights by his predecessor, Barack Obama; **Trump** has used his position as President to assassinate political figures in other countries; **Trump** uses his Twitter account to vent in angry diatribes against those **Trump** feels have wronged him; **Trump** frequently attempts to prevent Republicans who have stood up to him or criticized him from being reelected or otherwise to punish them.

**6.** **Envy:** a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck; like greed and lust, is characterized by an insatiable desire. It can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else.—**Donald Trump**, despite having amassed gross amounts of wealth and achieved the Presidency of the United States, continues to focus on the fact that Hillary Clinton had more popular votes, tries to pretend that the Russians did not meddle in the election, posts on social media statements that demonstrate **Trump’s** feelings of envy toward those with more power, money, or popularity.

**7.** **Pride:** a feeling or deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements; selfishness, the putting of one's own desires, urges, wants, and whims before the welfare of other people; irrationally believing that one is essentially and necessarily better, superior, or more important than others, failing to acknowledge the accomplishments of others, and excessive admiration of the personal image or self—**Donald Trump** refuses to ever admit mistakes and frequently denies saying things that **Trump** objectively did say (as recorded evidence supports). **Donald Trump** likes to remind people of the millions and billions of dollars **Trump** has, that things cost, that are being allocated by him, and **Trump** always refers to himself and his projects and endeavors as “the best,” “huge,” “great,” “incredible,” “tremendous,” and similar superlative words, while belittling everyone else and anything anyone else does.

110,"The other day I was talking to one of my friends over lunch at university.  We were talking about our days and she was talking about how tired she was and how it's her ""shark week"" so she's been cranky and wants to torch the world. You know, the usual. She asked me how my day was and I said that I had a tough day at work (I am over the phone tech support) and all day I had to deal with yelling customers. She looked at me in a sort of daze and then asked ""Do you have periods?"" I responded that I obviously didn't and then she proceeded to say ""Well then quit your complaining and man up."" I asked her why she felt that way and she began to use the term ""first world problems"" to describe my issues and say that all my issues weren't anything like she had to deal with and it made her feel like I was belittling her.

I am a neurotypical straight, white, Christian male of upper middle to lower upper class standing financially. My parents love each other and have been married for more than 20 years. I am going to a decent school getting a decent degree. I do not have problems, at least, not according to society. I do not have a therapist and I do not need medication for anything.

To other people I live a dream life. To other people my life is perfect. And when I bring up an issue, I am told to ""grow up,"" that my issues are nothing in the grand scheme of things, and that it's nothing like what others have to go through. I am not allowed to feel depressed otherwise it's not seen as ""real"" and I am just trying to get attention. I cannot get anxious because I am supposed to be the confident one and an extrovert. I cannot get mad or I am seen as aggressive. I cannot get overloaded or overworked because ""I am not battling demons"" or ""it's just what you do everyday.""

My problems can all be boiled down and solved with the traditional ""just work harder"" or ""you'll get through it.""

I cannot have problems. 

I cannot have problems because I am not at risk of hurting myself. I cannot have problems because I have never thought about killing myself. I cannot have problems because I don't have to hunt for the black barbie dolls. I am told I cannot have problems because I don't have breasts to grab.

My frowns go unnoticed, my grieving ignored. My worries brushed aside. My fears underplayed. I am always ""making them bigger than they really are.""

I am not saying I want problems, just why are my problems not as important as others? Why can I be cast aside? Why am I told to grow up? Why are others given reasons but mine are just excuses? Why am I told to grow up and others are directed to support groups or put on medication. Why am I told to deal with it when others are told ""You are welcomed and valued""?

Society expects a perfect human which in and of itself is an oxymoron. Perfect people don't have problems, but no one is perfect. So everyone has problems. Why are my problems not valid?",17Jan2020,1

The next day I was in bed all day throwing up stomach acid and dry heaving. Unable to even keep water down until several hours later and even then only at small amounts. I tried to eat solids and theh came back with a vengeance. 

I started suffering extreme chest and abdominal pains (which I still have but not as bad... still a 7 out of 10 unless I am touched..then it's a 10 again.)

I went to the urgent care then was recommended the hospital am now in a room with a high enzyme count in my liver meaning I possibly damaged it some. They also thought I was at risk with acute hepatitis which I was told I cleared my tests for as of today. I will still be here for another day as I was told my enzyme count actually got worse and they will be running some more tests tomorrow to monitor it. 

All that matters though is I'm still alive (and was assured I would stay that way by doctors) and I plan on keeping it that way. I dont know what happened in my brain when my dog licked me but it just snapped me back to reality. To life. 

I have a lot of mental work I'm going to need but I'm confident if I keep trying I can be good and decently happy one day. 

To anyone feeling suicidal please know it doesn't have to end. It can and will get better, all you have to do is choose to make the changes.

My immediate family thinks of me as a disappointment and almost all of my former friends have cut off contacts with me which shouldn't be surprising since I'm described as a tactless, deranged individual who can't hold his tongue and is prone to volatile outbursts.

I failed 3 papers out of 5 in the 2nd year of Medical College. The Medical College I'm in is somewhat prestigious and I got in by scraping the bottom of the barrel and the competition among students is fierce and naturally, they scoff at the bottom rankers and more often than not, their scorn is directed towards me.
Acquaintances in my batch look at me with mixed expressions of pity and disgust wondering what a waste of space like me was doing in such an institute.

I'm your typical shut in virgin who never had a relationship in all his years of being alive and the couple of women I had feelings for and approached, I got so emotionally invested in them and was devastated by their rejection (which is stupid yes, but what do I know) which in turned totally creeped them out and scared them away

I never had dreams of becoming a doctor, in fact I never had dreams at all. It was only due to the wishes of my mother that I chose to pursue this course. My family is traditional and relatively well to do and thought that it was a respectable career choice. My two elder siblings had already completed their studies, were holding respectable jobs and unlike me, were mature adults.

When I was going off to medical college, tuitions of which was already expensive enough, my father gave me a fat bank account to use as I pleased and being the unmotivated and immature twat that I was, spent it at leisure without putting an ounce of effort into my studies to justify that usage.

I have a gaming and alcohol addiction, two things that were partly responsible for my incredibly poor academic performance. Ingame cosmetics and whiskey bottles racked up my monthly expenses and the city I moved to was already expensive enough on it's own, putting a strain on my family finances, making me nothing more than a leech.

I'm thinking of dropping out of college and head home, sparing my family the need to fund my extravagant and self indulgent ways and make amends for all my wrongdoings. People keep telling me that having a medical degree is a great thing and that there are a lot of opportunities for doctors but I doubt that even if I completed my course, I'd be a good doctor.

Problem is what do I do next? It's not like I have any practical skills and the thought of disappointment of my father and tears in my mother's eye makes me reluctant to abandon that dream of making their son a doctor, a respectable member of society.

I feel like I'm being driven into a corner with none to ask for help and at one point in time I even thought of taking the cowardly way out and ending my life, ridding my family of a deadweight who would only bring shame to them in the future. The thought of my loved ones and the realization that it was the easy and cowardly thing to do kept me going however.

I kept gaming to escape this brutal reality and drink heavily on occasions to forget just how shit I made my life become. I also have social anxiety and feel afraid to talk to people and instructors in the college for fear of being reprimanded for some unknown reasons. I'm afraid of talking to acquaintances and friends for fear of them being condescending or mocking me.

I'm currently stuck in a rut and I'm wondering whether I could ever recover from this and be a functioning person in the future",17Jan2020,1

122,"i have to wake up at 7am for school on weekdays, usually wear my pajamas to school because I can’t be bothered to get dressed. I have classes til 12 most days, then i catch the bus back home. I usually go back to bed and just lay there scrolling through memes for a few hours. Around this time the negative thoughts  show up as I get progressively more bored. Out of a sudden all I can think about is how shitty i am and how extraordinary boring the life i have ahead of me is. I go downstairs and binge eat to cope which makes me feel even worse about myself, i chainsmoke a few cigarettes both to entertain myself and to make the food go down easier. The mental and emotional tiredness force me to take a nap, and by nap I mean a 4-6 hour long sleep. As I wake up I realize my pain is still very much present napping to avoid my problems isn’t a good solution, normally I go for the big binge around this time. Uncomfortably full, and seriously contemplating suicide, I crawl back to bed and lay down listening to music or watching youtube/netflix for another few hours. At about 12am or so i find myself exhausted again, i go for another smoke session while feeling numb as and proceed to fall asleep only to wake up again the some day and repeat this routine all over again. Weekends are the same except that instead of going to school in the morning I browse the internet in bed which is pre much what i do 90% of the time i’m awake.

i hate my life, i’m 17 i should be enjoying my youth instead i’m oveweight, have no friends and feel hollow virtually all the time. I sleep 10-16 hours every day as a coping mechanism. I have just started failing school (i’m in year 12) bc i’m lazy and retarded. I just cant stand this anymore, i wanna die so badly.",17Jan2020,1

137,"Hi everyone,

I’m still very shaken up as I type this. This is my very first time posting on reddit.

About 4 months ago I started working for an IT company as a graduate. Its about 26 miles away from my home. I never thought it was a problem as I’m a cautious driver and generally consider driving quite relaxing. I’ve driven around 4000 miles so far with no problem. 

This evening however, I was driving 50mph on the road. I could see a car that was stuck behind a bus on the left lane from a distance as the bus was taking on passengers. I was watching to see if he wanted to switch to my lane, which he didn’t so I kept it moving. The lane was empty and it was just my car and a few others behind me. However just as I was about to pass the car, with no warning, he moved the front of his car to my direction cutting my lane off completely. 

I swerved to the right lane and sounded the horn. Had I not swerved we would’ve crashed leaving us both seriously injured, or perhaps dead. I’ve never been in this situation before. I drove off as I was in so much shock I couldn’t digest what had just happened. 

I was very lucky that the car on the right lane was distant from mine when I swerved. This whole situation could’ve ended up horribly.

I’m home now, and I’m not sure what I should’ve done. Should I have taken their vehicle registration number and reported this? Should I have confronted the idiot? If this had been an elderly driver instead of myself who didn’t react on time, I’d hate to see what could have happened to them. 

Finding a job as a graduate is very difficult but I’m seriously considering quitting. It only takes one idiot on the road to end it all for someone. I don’t know if this was a sign that I should leave, or look elsewhere. I love my job and my colleagues are great, the job pays well and up until today driving wasn’t a problem...

Any advice. What would you have done/do in this situation?",17Jan2020,1

I have a girlfriend who I have to keep giving attention to and visiting.
I work all day on the weekends.

142,"Today, while going to eat Chinese with my husband, I had to call the police.
The usually lovely employees at the restaurant were speaking and it was difficult at first to tell if they were having a spirited discussion or argument due to the tone of voice and language difference. 
This went on for about 20 minutes. By then, it was easy to talk the employees were being berated by one of their coworkers. Next thing I know they are screaming at full volume at each other and one of the employees is holding up a pot to hit another employee. At this point, I stand up and call the police. I told my husband to stay and watch just in case the police need a witness for whatever happens next. 
Thankfully the police got there within 2 minutes and escorted the man out who was brandishing the pot. 
I am super shaken up by this. I don't want a pat on the back. I just don't want people to do awful things to each other. 
I couldn't even enjoy my food when it was ready since I was so worried about the employees. I checked on them before I left and they seemed shaken up but alright.
I just needed to share this somewhere to help me process what I saw.",17Jan2020,1

144,"Ive just been extremely sad lately well it’s been a while actually I just lost my last friend and I’m all alone. All I have left is my girlfriend which is good and all but we fight a lot and I lost all of my friends because of her. She hates them but with good reason they said some stuff that was uncalled for but that’s how they all we all just joke on each other and don’t mean it but she didn’t like them cause of that and she made me get rid of them and I miss them everyday like I can’t even go to school or else she’ll think I’m talking to them or talking to some girl (I’m in high school btw I’m a junior) and she’ll fight with me cause she thinks I’m lying but I’m not and I think she’s been lying to me lately I just don’t feel good anymore like I have waves of sadness because I’m reminded of my friends and I deeply care about them and miss them so much because when I broke up with my last girlfriend I had no one and they accepted me into their group and welcomed me with loving arms and helped me when I was on the brink of doing the unthinkable because I had lost so much at the time. I lost my girlfriend, my bestest friend that was my dream girl and I found out my other best friend was talking to my girlfriend at the time and I just felt so alone and empty and betrayed and like shit because my bestest friend I drove her away because I was jealous that she was hanging out with other people and not me and we’ve been friends since the 3rd grade and she saved me because she was my first real friend and I tried killing my self when I was in the third grade and she was my angel that saved me and I fell in love with her but I could never build up the courage to ask her out and she revealed years later she felt the same way during the same time and she said please let me know next time you feel that way and I said okay but at that moment I still had felt that way and I regret not saying anything and I regret driving her away because she was always at my side no matter what and I just ruined it. 

When me and my current girlfriend fight it gets physical and I don’t hit back I just try and calm her but I see the marks on my arms and I cry because I never thought I would be in this situation and I do cry a lot and she just says “yeah cry cuz that’s all you do you crybaby bitch pussy” and My heart just breaks more and more I tried to leave and she won’t let me I’m stuck in this loop of toxicity and I’m scared and hopeless I have no one to talk to anymore and I can’t find someone to talk to because she checks my phone every time we’re together and I don’t want her to see that because I don’t want to hurt her I just need friends again and when I try and communicate on social media she says “why are doing that to get attention from bitches?” And I say no I just want someone to talk to and she says “so I’m not enough” but she always takes forever to respond and I just feel horrible all the time but sometimes I do feel good I feel happy sometimes but the bad times heavily outweigh the good times. 

But I miss my group of friends I considered them my brothers and it hurt so much to say goodbye and I don’t know how much longer I can go without them I wish everyone and everything was good and I wish I could have everything back (except my ex she’s a hoe lol) but I want to be happy again",17Jan2020,1
