0,When I take a normal selfie I look good however when I take a selfie with the back camera my face looks very asymetrical like deformed. Is this just my brain or do I actually look that bad?,18Apr2020,1
1,"I just read my friend‚Äôs poetry manuscript and realized I have no talent. I don‚Äôt even write poetry, but I‚Äôve thought about it. I do paint and write academic essays, though, and I just feel it in my gut. I don‚Äôt have what it takes, even though people have told me I do. See that was before I went off the rails, before I was abusing adderall, went psychotic, dropped out of school, etc. sometimes I think something was lost but honestly I don‚Äôt know if I ever had it. I‚Äôm not that talented.

For most people it‚Äôs totally acceptable, perhaps even admirable, to not be a brilliant, or some kind of special, creative genius, but I feel like for me this idea of genius was always so wrapped up in my personality. I wasn‚Äôt always even particularly successful in school and my performance was wildly erratic but for some reason everyone always pinned me as the sensitive, artistic type. Some even called me a genius. I think really I was just quirky, averagely intelligent, and extremely attention seeking. 

I‚Äôve always been interested in writing and painting and acting but I have one some very minor awards here and there. I used to think I had all this potential but now I‚Äôm realizing that even if I work my ass off, I just don‚Äôt have it. I‚Äôm not talented (let alone disciplined) enough to really make it in either academia or the arts, my only two real career considerations because for some reason I am especially ill-equipped at nearly everything else. 


Career aside, I just feel stupid and embarrassed and pretentious for even aspiring to be ‚Äúan artist.‚Äù I mean what is more cliche and narcissistic? 

The worst part is so stereotypically ‚Äúartistic‚Äù (in the bad ways). Yes, I have this kind of horrible personality that outwardly seems sweet and kind and ‚Äúpure‚Äù but once you peel a few layers back you will see it is actually this messed up, self-destructive, disorganized, dramatic, brooding, hypersensitive, self-loathing, compulsively lying, whimsical, ungrounded, self-absorbed, immature black hole of chaos and confusion. 

I feel like my personality is so unsavory that it could only be forgiven if I were also to be an artist. And deep down I feel such a strong drive to create and devour works of beauty. (Yes, I know how disgusting and obnoxious this sounds). I‚Äôm probably just the same as everyone else. The only difference is I‚Äôm needier. I crave the feeling of being special. Why? Was I spoiled? I bristle at the thought that I was loved too much, since I feel so hurt and deprived, but maybe that is the case. 

I suppose I could be content with being the same as everyone if I was able to function as well as most. But I just feel not meant for normal life much of the times. For instance, I‚Äôve been waitressing at the same job for over a year and I try so hard, and I practice and practice, yet I am positively the worst one. I make so many mistakes. It‚Äôs the same everywhere I work, every project I try to help with. 

So you see I fee like I have the personality of an artist without any of the talent, which basically makes me the worst of both worlds. I feel like a fraud and an embarrassment. Most of all, I feel stupid for ever thinking I was special. But even stupider for CARING about whether or not I am special, because there are so many bigger problems in the world. I think this whole thing makes me one of the least appealing kinds of people. I guess I should just stop then. But I stopped caring what people think I guess, at least I stopped caring enough to let it curtail my self-indulgent rants...

I suppose I just wish I didn‚Äôt have this insatiable need to be special, and this feeling of despair and embarrassment and worthlessness when I fail to live up to my own standards. 

I know I must practice to be good at things. To be successful. But I am not talking about being good or being successful. While one can be a good or successful businesswoman or doctor, and feel proud of that, I don‚Äôt think there is really a purpose to pursuing a creative or academic lifestyle unless one is GREAT or SPECIAL.",18Apr2020,1

When I was 4, my cousin (also 4) and I were inseparable. We played games like house, Lego, and zoo. The games be played always were a bit.. strange. At least on his part. He look lick our ‚Äúbaby‚Äù (a doll) in the private parts. I didn‚Äôt think of it. We are 2nd cousins and he had a crush on me. We were both little and didn‚Äôt understand what ‚Äúcrush‚Äù meant. The games we played got weirder, and sometimes he would make me kiss him. One day, the most vivid memory, (We were probably 5) we were pretending to sleep in our game of house. He told me to come here. He threw things at me and hurt me when he got mad, so I came over. He told me to kid him. I said no. He asked me again. I said no. He grabbed me, put a thin see through cloth between our lips and pulled me on top of him. I laid on top of him as he did something. That‚Äôs all I remember. It turns out, he was sexually abused by HIS cousin, so he thought that was how you showed someone love. I don‚Äôt know if he remembers. But I do. I see him all the time. I am scared of him. I am only in 6th grade, so I need to tell someone about this? Is it bad or not? I have depression and anxiety.",18Apr2020,1
5,"Throwaway account.

This pandemic has been one of the most mentally and emotionally taxing experiences, I know for everyone it has been. I didn't have the best mental health to begin with. The amount of back and forth information, no one knowing what they want to do, or how to handle it, varying opinions, the arguing. It's been extremely overwhelming. I've had no one to talk to about it, at least not in an honest manner. I just think if the next reaction is anything like this (I live in the US), I don't think I can do it again.

6,"- [ ] I‚Äôm a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‚Äòno thanks iv already got them‚Äô and her response was ""oh, have you got all that?

I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‚Äòplease dress smartly‚Äô and ‚Äògood luck‚Äô

10,"I sat down and read an entire book in one sitting. This is huge for me. Not because I don‚Äôt like to read, though. Quite the opposite. 

My life has not gone the way I had planned. And maybe it‚Äôs still not, but I‚Äôm trying. During this time, I feel like I‚Äôve lost sight of myself. I‚Äôve stopped doing the things I love. I‚Äôve become the person that my anxiety makes me believe I am. I have no personality, no defining characteristics, no hobbies, and no interests. I float through life, unwilling and unable to be anything more than a shadow of the person I used to be, or the one that I want to be. 

Depression makes you feel some crazy things. It makes you forget who you are. But I had a victory today, however small. For the first time in I don‚Äôt know how long, I sat down and I read a book, cover to cover. If you had told me three years ago that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell you the last book I finished, I‚Äôd think you were nuts, but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve lost sight of who I am. I‚Äôve stopped doing the things I love. 

It may seem small, but I reclaimed a small piece of my identity today and it feels incredible. I‚Äôm reminded why I loved reading to begin with, and I‚Äôm wondering why I ever stopped. 

As I pick up my second novel for the day, I actually have hope in myself for the first time in a very long time. I may not be where I want to be, but I‚Äôm going to get there.

And I'm sick of the fact that there is corn product and damn near every food that is pre-made so I have to make most my food homemade because if I eat any corn product I throw up and I'm in severe pain. Although things in my life have gotten great and I'm usually pretty happy, when the pain starts to get so bad like it is tonight I just want to give up but, I can't because there are people that need me and I need them and I would never want them to go through what I went through when a cousin of mine killed himself.",18Apr2020,1

I'm ALWAYS the one people rely on to help them through whatever they're going through, but for some stupid reason, I can't lean on anyone. Maybe I tell myself that my issues aren't as big their problems. Or maybe that I don't want to be seen as someone that needs help. I've developed a pretty serious drinking problem and I've honestly debated suicide every day for the last 6 or 7 years. I'm just tired of feeling empty. For example, my sister just gave birth to a baby girl, and I mean literally within the hour, and I just feel indifferent to it. I just don't care.

21,"Hey guys, this is my first post so don‚Äôt eat me alive please.

Alright so, to start off I just wanna say that I am in no way an alcoholic. I used to binge drink plenty in my college days, but that‚Äôs all behind me. I‚Äôm down to only drinking once or twice a month and never to the point of being shitfaced. It‚Äôs honestly just to have something to do on the one night a week I don‚Äôt work the next morning.

I am an introvert, born and raised. Never had many friends growing up, just a few close ones. I have ‚Äòsuffered‚Äô from social anxiety pretty much my entire life. It has made me somewhat bitter as a person, mostly because of lost friends and opportunities. Most of the time im a ‚Äòcup half empty‚Äô downer, which obviously isn‚Äôt the person people generally want around. Being the introvert I am, this hasn‚Äôt really been an issue for me. However, the ‚Äòimpending apocalypse‚Äô 2020 has created, for whatever reason, has made me crave a more outgoing, extroverted personality. This has been... difficult. 

I started texting people more often practicing basic conversation skills. (I‚Äôm surprisingly bad at this). I also started attending the small get togethers my friend group has every weekend. (I‚Äôm in Southern Utah so the covid numbers are extremely low still). These get togethers (the sober ones at least) have just reinforced my anti-social ways. Lots of awkward short conversations thanks to my lack of communication skills. Definitely draining my motivation of self progression. 

A couple of the get togethers, I decided to drink. Just a couple beers and maybe 1 shot. Obviously, this helps me open up and feel more comfortable, but it‚Äôs does more than that. I‚Äôve always studied myself intently when trying new substances and times of reflection and I‚Äôve noticed that when slightly intoxicated I become smarter. I can easily talk about and give input on subjects i wouldnt normally know anything about. I feel that the confidence the alcohol gives me comes from the access I gain to knowledge and wisdom that I can‚Äôt seem to find while sober. I‚Äôm not afraid of becoming an alcoholic, simply because I just don‚Äôt enjoy the feeling of being drunk like I used too and the fact that it‚Äôs not the healthiest way to spend my time. I prefer smoking a bowl here and there anyways. I just want to be able to become the person i am after a few drinks. I‚Äôve been taking notes when I drink, giving advice to my sober self. I understand how I think and feel while drinking at this point, i just can‚Äôt seem to access it while sober. It‚Äôs like my anxiety is blocking parts of my brain that would benefit me greatly if I were able to use them regularly. I‚Äôm asking for advice, ideas, and opinions. What do you got?

23,"Hey, i'm 13 years old and I'm writing this for advice about my life and personality in general.

I often find myself comparing myself to my surroundings and others. I  have strong personality traits but often find myself drifting between personalities based on my surroundings. I often think highly of myself, at least  I pretend to, which makes me seem arrogant, but in reality i just display myself as strong, so i can feel strong to myself. Ever since my childhood I've had major sleep and anxiety issues. I don't know why. I stopped fearing death, and pain, and I live very much in the present. I feel trapped in my life, and can't wait to escape my town and my current situation. I don't want to die, because I've seen the joy in life. I often crave excitement, and find very little enjoyment in regular daily activities, like school and family. I'm not anti-social, but I often find myself to have low self esteem. I hate my life so much, because I feel that I cant function happily in the place that I'm in. Right now I don't try at all at school, because I don't want to get a lot of money when i'm older, and i don't see the point in putting effort into something that i dont value. I want to just live life on the edge, with no worries, surrounded by people and places that relate to me. I've tried drugs and alcohol which are a good way out for me. This writing is very messy and not well written, but im kinda just venting right now. This is my first time writing on reddit btw. I find myself being very insightful when it comes to people's actions and emotions, and could get around anywhere and with anyone if i wanted to. I don't let other people effect me, and I just over-analyze all of my interactions to the point that my emotions are hidden, but my reactions are genuine. I wouldn't say that i'm fake, but i don't have real emotions. Although I seem like a waste of oxygen that doesn't do anything productive and just wants to have fun all the time, the other half of me very much enjoys meaningful tasks like music, writing, critical thinking, and reading. I often find myself wishing I could transport myself to my ideal fantasy in which society doesn't have rules, and everyone was just pure. Sensitive people annoy me, beause I don't get why people let other people make them upset. 

Overall, I've very conflicted about my identity and what I want for myself, and right now in my situation don't care about anything. I feel like I would be happier in jail than in my house right now. I value creativity. I find that people often get caught up on having cookie cutter lives with school and college, and a family etc, but I just want to live life day by day, without having to do things based on a schedule. 

My question is to everyone, how would you define my personality, and what should I do in my life to make me happier, until I can escape from my town and current fucked up life? Also do you think it's worth it fro me to do drugs, if it will make me happy, rather than to be depressed, and hide my emotions.",18Apr2020,0

Of course that might not happen this year but we just had a zoom meeting where we talked for a few hours. I found out that there's all this stuff I didn't know has been going on with them. Like their jobs and relationships and what they've been doing lately.

43,"So my son has been breaking quarantine regularly for about a week now. I have caught him sneaking in and out when he thinks we won't notice. Since early february I have stressed to him the urgency of proper social distancing and hygiene, due to the dire consequences of this virus.

Specifically, I have told him that he is not to leave his room under any circumstances and may only join the rest of the family when I give him the all clear by knocking a secret knock on his door. But what does he do? He sneaks out and goes into the kitchen, plays video games on the living room big screen tv during the night, and basically ignores my strategy for minimizing the impact of the pandemic in our household. Just the other day when I made an emergency run for some dunkin donuts, I come back to find a god damn frozen pizza baking in the oven.

I just don't know anymore. Kids these days are so, so entitled and think they know everything. I fear such reckless behavior of his will endanger us all.

Even now, the good things I have going for me are painful reminders of the past I had. That associates degree/ other certifications at 19?

51,"I apologize if this is too long. I really need to vent and for someone to say something to feel better.

Some months ago I went through a breakup, it was very hard for me. Then a couple of months later I started talking to one guy from my class and we started to have a thing. I always thought I was moving on too fast, but since I wasn't thinking about my previous couple I didn't care much for it. When I talked to this new guy he told me he had anxiety issues but that he was taking care of it. We started dating, everything was perfect. We could hang out after school, I met his family, he took me to his softball games. We had some issues from time to time because of his anxiety, nothing I took too serious. 

The last time we saw each other (no breaking up still) was before quarantine started, I didn't had the chance to say goodbye properly. We continued talking but I noticed that the quarantine was being hard for him. He told me that his family make fun of him because of his anxiety, he kinda went off that night. He said that he felt like shit because he didn't like hanging out with his family so much and that it was hard when the only thing that was an escape from all that (meaning me) only said ""go to the psychologist. I don't know if I was an asshole for saying that. I was trying to help him. I couldn't be his therapist so I recommended what I thought would be better. He said that he was thinking of quiting college and psychologist. Here comes the breakup point... He said that he had planned to suicide once he's older, once he has done what he has to. I felt so weird when he said that, a weird combination between sadness and anger. The next day I was a little cold to him because I was kind of shocked because of what he said. He said that he wasn't giving up college or psychologist (never mentioned the suicide thing). I said that I was shocked because of what he said and that he can't think that way. He just said that he has always knew that's the way he wanted to die (At this point I was thinking if this could be the equivalent to euthanasia which made me question myself a lot) I posted on some subreddits asking for advice, most if them said I had to breakup with him or I would be a lot more hurt. I listened and that's what I did. I told him that I love him a lot and that I want him to feel better and to keep going to therapy. At first I said we could give ourselves some time, having the faith that he would change his mind about that and that he would have time to deal with his problems. He said if I was sure since he didn't believe in giving ""time"" and he said maybe it was better. He apologized. He said ""I'm sorry I made you went through this"". 

Now I don't know how I feel. There some times I feel yeah it was better this way. Then, there are other times I think when we hanged out, when he said I was the best thing that came to him in a while, happy moments basically and I start to feel sad and with regret. I also feel bad because I don't know what will become of him, will he really do that? will he quit therapy? I would really like to know that we will meet in a few years and that he will be better, that he will get over (or at least that he will learn to manage it) and that he will change his mind about... that. I feel bad that the last time we saw each other we didn't even said goodbye... That really hurts.

When I told my mother she said she was proud of me for being mature and ending it before I got into something that in the future I would not be able to get out from.

59,"[24M] since around November I've been going through a breakup with my ex gf and we finally cut the strings late December. 

I made a bunch of new friends, one was a girl my age(let's call her Sarah) who I became best friends with. We started getting more comfortable with each other and we'd see one another almost every other day. 
Then March came around and the lockdown started. Me and Sarah still hung out a lot regardless because we were catching feelings for each other. 

I'd buy her food, gifts and a lot of stuff and give her my time whenever I could. Although we were both unsure of going into a relationship, for the time being I was ok with it. All I needed was a really close friend who gave me her time and attention as I would to her.

As for my other friends, we would hang out often and they'd help uplift me through my breakup depression. The I had people coming back to me slowly after I left my ex because my closest friends saw how toxic we were and found it quite disturbing. 

I had tried to keep our issues between us but she started spreading lies and gossip like wildfire. In addition to some other heinous stuff she's done. 
Thankfully, including Sarah and the others, I've had a great journey over the past few months. 
Now suddenly with this COVID-19 madness, Sarah and the others have become quite cold through distant communication. Wes all be active on social media before the first week of April but as the solitude increased,communication is loosening. 
Me and Sarah hung out a few days ago, and we haven't had a decent convo since. 

I just see now how things are changing and whose really concerned about who. The people who are responding to me is my family and relatives. 

I know this stuff is stressful but I don't see why they would not encourage us to do things like zoom calls with each other, I suggested a few times. 

I know I shouldn't be overthinking this stuff because everyone is going through their own issues rn whether it be financial or personal. I lost my job too, I know it's hard.  Maybe I'm going through strong social depression myself. Maybe I should just be closer to family at this point and not worry about fake friends?",18Apr2020,1

When I confronted her about it she obviously denied it, said it will be in the garage somewhere (why wasn‚Äôt it in the box I left it in?), and said it‚Äôs not a crime to have a black jumper (with a high neck, balloon sleeves and seam down the side - bit more specific than just a black jumper). She clearly thinks I‚Äôm stupid and that she‚Äôs got away with it. Where do I go from here?",18Apr2020,1
77,"  I‚Äôm a guy. Iv been working voluntary in a charity shop and there was an older lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam me and Sam  were tagging clothes about 10ft apart ...anyway they were asking how old we were: 

üîπSue: I‚Äôm 48

‚óæÔ∏èSam: *bubbly points up to the air* I‚Äôm 31

üîπSue: *looks over at me* how old are you? 

üî∏Me:what? Oh... 29

üîπ‚óæÔ∏èSue and Sam : *act surprised* awwwww are yer!?

üîπSue: when yer birthday?

üî∏Me: November 30th 

‚óæÔ∏èSam: *bubbly points up again*  mines 21st

üîπSue:  oh close birthdays eh....gonna have a litttle birthday bash? *laughing a little*

‚óæÔ∏èSam: (very seriously and abruptly reacts) 
 Ooooo no, ooooo no. Oooooo no, don‚Äôt think my fella would like that, don‚Äôt think my fella would like thaaaat *shaking her head a little*

(seemed sort  arrogant with her 
reply and quite loud too) (could have been an ewwww) she said it acting all ‚Äòla Di da‚Äô ( snobby) but she‚Äôs usually always been really pleasant with me in a normal person way. And I‚Äôm usually very quiet.

She stinks really bad too so the audacity from her to act like that especially that ppl in there rip her behind her back for it yet she stands there very up herself.


 Her bf is in prison whilst she‚Äôs in community service for the same crime idk what it is and he does call Her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes and fancied another guy in the shop (who called her all sorts to me because of her hygiene) and has poor hygiene BO and looks like a hard drug user.",18Apr2020,1
79,"Not sure what else to say. I just don‚Äôt. Never have. I am diagnosed as bipolar and I have anxiety, this could be a factor but I literally would rather mop the ocean before I talk on the phone. I have always been this way. I would much rather text than talk. I hate being forced to sit on the other end of the phone to someone complain about their day and what they ate. It usually ends up being a one sided conversation because I never know what to say! I don‚Äôt feel the need to tell people every detail of my day.
It‚Äôs just so unappealing to me. 
Am I weird? Maybe? My family has always noticed this and brought it up that I don‚Äôt ever answer the phone but they never really NEED anything when they call it‚Äôs always just random chitchat which I feel would be better communicated through text messaging. They are now starting to get upset/worried and even going to the extent of saying ‚Äúseems like you don‚Äôt love me anymore‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat have I done‚Äù (even though I have been this way forever)
How do I get them to understand this? I am 31 years old, married with 3 children and sometimes I REALLY AM too busy to answer the phone and I have even used that as an excuse and it still doesn‚Äôt appease them. They always say ‚Äúwhat if it was an emergency‚Äù but if there is EVER an emergency why not leave a voicemail ???
I feel that they should just get over it. I feel that me having a cell phone is for MY convenience, not anyone else‚Äôs. I mean what would they do if I didn‚Äôt have a cell phone in the first place.

90,"September of last year I decided to move away to the city after graduating high school. I only came to work and have fun, at least that was my plan. Now that I've been isolating, much time for needed introspection has accumulated - Today was my breaking point. I'm currently sobbing while looking at the computer screen haha - but today I did something I thought I'd never do. I texted my father. I haven't spoken to him in over two years. Not out of hate, or pity, or lack of empathy, but pure avoidance. My relationship with him has never been difficult because it has mostly been absent.

 I grew up mostly with a foster family, and he's always had spoken with my guardian (to wish me well) but almost never with me - because almost always I'd turn him away. To clarify: Him not being a parental figure in my life was never his fault. Early complications with custody between my biological mom and my guardian had always been an issue and my father told me once that he didn't want to make things more difficult than they already were. Vague, I know but trust me when I say I know he means well. Now, I'm realizing he'd always had the best intentions for me and I didn't want to believe it because I've been so self-absorbed. I have this tremendous weight hanging over me and I'm wondering why I've never confronted my deeply rooted issues face forward. My heart is everywhere right now. I'm feeling hurt, anger, sorrow, loneliness, healing - all of it.

91,"Just kind of had to share this cause I feel really happy. I‚Äôm pretty sure that for once in my life, the girl I like likes me back. I‚Äôve liked her for a few months, stemming back to a night out we had when we had a really deep, revealing and open conversation that we both really opened up with. We‚Äôd always been friendly due to having mutual friends, but that night really made me stop and take notice of her in a massive way. Since then the chemistry between us always just seems completely different, to the point our friends started commenting on it. A lot of the time even if our friends are there we‚Äôd end up off doing our own thing and shooting the shit, with a little bit of flirting here and there. 

Apart from one really quick kiss back at Christmas, the flirting wasn‚Äôt major though, so while I liked her and thought we got along really well, I didn‚Äôt want to get my hopes up too much. Since everyone‚Äôs been stuck home though our friends have been going on Zoom a shit ton, and since then it seems to have went up another level between us; after one video call I decided to say fuck it and shoot her a message, cause we had such a great laugh. Since then we‚Äôve basically been talking all the time for a couple of weeks.

A couple of nights ago we were on another video call and a lot of our friends were joking about how much we were flirting and stuff. They‚Äôve made jokes like that for a while, and usually I think we just kind of awkwardly act like we haven‚Äôt heard it, but I was a few beers deep and decided to push things a little and flirt a bit harder. She was flirting right back; we were just constantly teasing each other, ‚Äòjoking‚Äô about how we should just go to our own video call, all that stuff, and at one point when I was teasing her she playfully replied with ‚Äòif you really want a date after this is all over you better knock it off‚Äô. I joked back that I didn‚Äôt realise we had a date planned in the first place but I was down, and she just kind of laughed and said ‚Äòif you behave well then we‚Äôll have to see‚Äô. The rest of the night was just us talking shit even after most of our friends went off; I don‚Äôt think we really wanted to hang up on each other.

Anyway, post got a bit long, but just wanted to share. Things seem to get more flirty between us by the day; I just wish we weren‚Äôt both stuck in our house man, it‚Äôs typical that the one time a girl and I seem into each other this shit happens lmfao.",18Apr2020,1
92,"It was supposed to be at least. Snooty professors are dragging me to anxiety and I cannot deal with this anymore.

Because of COVID our finals were online and well... It was pretty open to cheating. Therefore one of our professors decided to make the exam open books and asked the questions from our notebooks. Whoever came to class had a chance to pass. But, turns out, only students who got 90+ from ""midterm"" passed the class. Everyone else got an ff. My midterm was 55. I attended all the classes, I finished my homeworks in time and probably got a 90+ grade from the finals since I participated in everything. 

I never wanted this department in the first place. I am an engineering student but I always wanted to study music or art. I was already a music student for 10+ years when I started college. My family never wanted me to be a musician. They said they will never pay my college tuition if I won't attend an engineering school. I am struggling with this school since the beginning and now everything is overflowing. I never wanted to be here in the first place but my parents are constantly blaming me for being a failure. I don't know how I can tell them that I need to attend college for 1 more year. I don't know if I can deal with this pressure both from home and college. 

I worked in different companies for a total of 1 year as a part of my internship. This 1 year was the worst. I got hospitalized several times and stayed in the hospital for weeks because of my anxiety. Got diagnosed with major depression which never surfaced during college time. 

If I have to deal with severe anxiety anyway, maybe dropping out is a better option. I dont even know if I will be able to work after graduation while the situation is like that.

104,"Hello there! :)

I'm 22, 5ft7, 60kg, study Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), and live in central London.

As far as my personality is concerned, my female friends have always said that I'm quite cute, charming, loving and affectionate, so I'm hoping that's your cup of tea! I have always been quite sociable and popular throughout life, but deep down, I am fairly shy and introverted. I'm quite fun and enjoyable to talk to, however, so I'm sure we'd get on just fine! :)

In terms of my interests, I thoroughly enjoy reading books on philosophy, history, and economics, as well as non-fiction and detective fiction. I also like travelling (lived in 9 different countries till date owing to my dad's job!), discussing politics, following all kinds of sport (especially cricket, football, tennis, chess and badminton), spending absolute hours on good old YouTube, doing loads of window-shopping (I've always had a habit of trying on *reeeally* nice clothes, but hardly ever purchasing them!), playing the piano, listening to a lot of music (primarily EDM, classical, and folk), going on lovely long walks, watching plenty of documentaries and films (mainly comedy and romance), cuddling, and so much more...

I enjoy trying out and doing a wide variety of things, so I can almost guarantee that I would have great fun doing a hobby of yours that is not mentioned in the list above! Just try me! ;)

On that note, thanks a lot for taking the time to read my post! I hope to hear from you soon :)

Don‚Äôt know if this is the right place but here goes sorry for the long post 

Specifically after loosing my farther to suicide have been connecting to characters such as Tyler Duden (fight club) rick and morty (specifically rick) taxi driver, bojack horseman 

These characters all share a few things in common and that is that they are all pretty nihilistic/depressed 

I‚Äôm starting to act just as they do and I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm doing so, or why I suddenly have started to connect to them. 

As an example I‚Äôve started not really caring about others, ( this may be due to the fact I didn‚Äôt really like anyone before my farthers passing anyway) but I‚Äôve started to not care about for example throwing them under the buss if it means me gaining something. Because I don‚Äôt care that they wouldn‚Äôt like me after for the most part i feel 90% of people would do the same to me given the chance anyway  

Another example someone suggested therapy to me and I had previously been super effected by the rick and morty therapy episode. I basically shut them down without even considering that therapy might actually be helpful. 

Final example is I sunk deeply into a pretty pointless routine such as in taxi driver. I get up for work as late as possible each day because I want to spend as little time thinking of the place as possible, this often results In me getting there just in the nick of time and I seem to get a rush from that, I eat lunch away from everyone in my car because I cba to deal with everyone‚Äôs bs I then go home. Play Xbox or browse the internet until dinner. Eat dinner. Then go to bed. All day every day ( I do have hobies on the weekend like skateboarding and mountain biking which I take pretty seriously) 

A quote from rick and morty I really related too went something like this ‚Äú whiping your ass and brushing your teeth is boring, it‚Äôs not an adventure. There‚Äôs no way of doing it so wrong you might die it‚Äôs just work some people are fine with that some people would rather die‚Äù 

I often think maybe my dad was one of those who would rather die, and have found my self taking pretty unecasary risks because I don‚Äôt really care if I die. I want everythign I do to be as high risk as possible because it‚Äôs the only thing makes me happy 

I don‚Äôt have a gf ( probaly pretty obviously) but if I did and I do want one then I‚Äôd probably be a lot happier you know how it is 

I just want to know if anyone else has experienced anything similar. Is this me starting a really bad series of events, should I be worried ect ect. 

Cheers in advance",18Apr2020,1

111,"I wasn't sure where to put this so I thought I'd post here and in a couple other places.

Two to three years ago I took MDMA, had a bad comedown, then it ended, but then two days later I felt really strange (ended up being anxiety), yet I couldn't figure out what was causing it. Eventually I ""figured out"" it was daylight that was making me anxious but I never understood how that had happened (looking back I can say it probably wasn't daylight that was making me anxious, I just felt anxious and looking outside might have spiked my anxiety randomly or something). I eventually found out the concept of ""associations"" and how your subconcious can associate things with anxiety as a means to protect you (although it often screws up apparently). One day I just had this horrible thought that this story I was writing would become a trigger for my anxiety -  I thought about the story and all I could feel was anxiety (to this day I still don't understand how this happened). This ended up spreading to anything that was sci-fi/fantasy, meaning I would feel anxious playing games, watching anime, etc... This continued for a few months but luckily due to being so preoccupied around that time with whatever I ended up forgetting about all of it. A few times between then and now the association has come back and it'll make sci-fi/fantasy things cause me anxiety but I would always find a way to forget about it. 

About two months ago I stopped taking my medication for anxiety and depression as I hadn't taken it for a few days and I had felt alright so I just assumed I didn't need them anymore. However, I thought about going to the gym (something I'd started a year ago) which was my absolute happy place, and randomly I felt a bit of anxiety. I couldn't understand what was going on with me, how all of a sudden was this thing triggering my anxiety when I'd never had any bad experiences with the gym or anything. I put it down to the medication actually making me feel a lack of motivation and that must have been what was triggering the anxiety. However, weeks went by and I still couldn't shake this feeling of not wanting to go to the gym and I honestly couldn't tell if it was a lack of motivation or anxiety, as it had to be one of the two. Either way going to the gym/thinking about anything to do with the gym would just make me anxious but I pushed through it and proved to myself that I could still enjoy it no matter if it was anxiety or a lack of motivation. Despite this I still found myself having panic attacks and depressive spells over what people would think of me if I quit the gym (as I hadn't been enjoying it due to this strange feeling it was causing), and yet again this made zero sense to me: why would I still be defaulting to thinking I'd have to quit it if I knew I could still enjoy it? It's as if my subconcious just wouldn't accept the truth. I wasn't sure what to do so I started counselling and hoped they'd be able to help. 

One morning during this I woke up and had the horrible thought that my own mother would become a trigger for my anxiety. I had a full blown panic attack and couldn't calm down for hours until I smoked some weed and fell asleep, hoping I'd forget about it in the morning. I then woke up and immediately began having another panic attack, which also lasted the entire day until I smoked weed. This kept happening over and over, even when I wasn't thinking about the horrible thought. I couldn't do anything except scream and run around, I thought I had gone fucking insane until my doctor finally  gave me Lorazepam (Ativan) and it completely calmed me down back to normal levels. I cried tears of joy I was so happy it had ended but I still had the idea of my mum becoming a trigger for my anxiety stuck in my head - I had no idea if it was going to become true or not but I was able to keep it out of mind for the most part and it wasn't causing any panic attacks so it was alright, I could deal with it. However, I then realised the sci-fi/fantasy association (I don't even know what to call it) had somehow made it's way back into my mind but I'd remembered it wrong as originally YouTube videos never seemed to affect me but this time around they were (I didn't realise this until it was too late). 

At first I wasn't too bothered as I knew I'd just forget it eventually but it's been five weeks and I'm struggling to just watch anything now because of the anxiety and it's fucking killing me. I've never heard of anyone with this kind of problem before and I've never felt so close to killing myself as I have now. What even is it? How do I stop it? How are these associations able to come back even after I proved to myself there's nothing to be anxious of by simply not having the problem for almost two years?? I can even look at all this stuff and be 100% confident that none of it is inherently anxiety-inducing but I still get this horrible tight feeling in my stomach, my shoulders, arms, even my fucking head whenever I try to interact with anything I find remotely ""cool"". Medication has done barely anything, if anything at all, I can't even tell (been on Sertraline for 6 weeks). I just want this problem to fuck off so badly because my entire life revolves around sci-fi and fantasy things as I want to be a videogame artist! Currently studying game art at uni and terrified to go back next year because I don't want to have my life ruined by this.",18Apr2020,1
112,"I'm 26 years old and feel like my life doesn't really mean anything because I am single and don't have kids. I have a fairly nice job and make just enough to take care of my bills and live comfortably, but it isn't meaningful work. I just enter invoices and answer phone calls. I rent a studio apartment and have adjusted well to living on my own.¬†


I don't have kids and probably never will (I'm chronically ill) and I can't help but feel like my worth as a woman is less because of the fact. There are so many support groups and camaraderie between women who have kids and I just feel so left out and second-class. Almost every topic and general standing women my age have in common is motherhood and raising kids. I don't belong and I can't relate. What drives the nail in harder is my boss always jokes with me and tells me I need to find someone before it's too late. My coworkers who are younger than me have kids. I'm constantly surrounded by it. It makes me feel like I am not doing anything important with myself.¬†I was reminded of it when I lost my health insurance last year and was rejected from Medicaid because I don't have kids. It's almost as if you are not a mother your life doesn't matter.


I feel like when people find out I am childless they get the impression that I have lots of money and live a selfish extravagant lifestyle where I spend my paycheck on hair and nails and take extrensive vacations. Nothing could be further from the truth. I can't afford health insurance. I go without buying groceries sometimes. I never get vacations. And I wipe my butt with newspaper. Life goes by so fast for me it seems all I do is eat, sleep, go to work and repeat. It all feels so meaningless if you have no one to work for or come home to. It all just wastes away. And it's scaring me.


I have my cats who I adore, and my sister's family and nieces--but sometimes I just want my ""own"" family. My ""own"" story. I want to feel like my worth as a woman matters and that I make a difference in someone's life. I want to be loved and noticed. I want someone to look me in the eye and tell me they see me.¬†",18Apr2020,5

114,"Hello! So, I will be graduating with a bachelors in biochemistry next spring and I have decided to continue my education with a masters in Public Health. 

The only thing is that I live in a smaller town in Colorado with my boyfriend of three years. He already has a career here, he‚Äôs buying a house, he has family here etc. 

If I want to pursue a Masters in Public Health on a campus, I will likely have to move to Denver for two years. We‚Äôve had this conversation and it‚Äôs been a bit of a sour spot in our relationship.

Anyways, I‚Äôve lived in this town my entire life and I think it would be a good experience to live somewhere else. I would also hate to lose everything I have here, my relationship, the house, the dogs. 

What are the pros and cons of getting a masters online vs getting one on a campus? Is the quality of education significantly different??",18Apr2020,2

119,"Before I go on, I totally understand if you think I‚Äôm gross. It was definitely a complete lack of hygiene and it‚Äôs disgusting to think about. Sorry for the long post!

I‚Äôm 23 right now and this started when I was about ten or so. I‚Äôve honestly never been one to have a routine, and the fact that my mom died when I was 11 and my dad never cared about my routines or hygiene probably contributed to that.  I‚Äôm not blaming it on those events or my parents, but I‚Äôm realizing now how I‚Äôve never had any good routines in my home life other than showering. It honestly baffles me when people say they wash their face every night and go to bed and wake up at the same time every day (I do have a full time job and my own place but literally every morning is different!).

Anyways, somewhere along the way I just stopped remembering to brush my teeth. It was probably intentional at first because I didn‚Äôt like it, but during my later adolescent years it was because I would just forget. It was such an insignificant thing to do that I never had the urge to do it. 

You‚Äôd think I had a ton of cavities and dental issues, right? Well, it turns out my rate of tooth decay is exceptionally low. I‚Äôve had my Dentist and a few hygienists tell me this over the years, so I‚Äôve used that as an excuse to not have to brush. I‚Äôve never actually had a cavity in any of my adult teeth. There are so many times as a teen where I panic brushed and flossed for a week or two right before my dentist appointment, and even after months of not doing either they would tell me my teeth looked fine albeit some gum inflammation and telling me to floss more. There was one time where they found the early signs of a cavity, but all they gave me was some special fluoride toothpaste to use and nothing happened after that. 

My breath likely stank, but I was under my own weird impression that I just had to make sure I ate something and drank water and it would wash the smell away. I can‚Äôt really tell you how much it stank, but I still had close friends all throughout middle and high school, and a boyfriend in college who I‚Äôm still with now, so maybe it wasn‚Äôt abysmal. Nobody ever straight up told me my breath stank, so I also used that as justification I guess.

I‚Äôm not sure how my bf has dealt with it during the six years and counting, but he has lol. I‚Äôm doing this for myself, but I also don‚Äôt want him to be with an unhygienic person anymore. He‚Äôs been realistic with me and urged me to brush my teeth before, but it‚Äôs never really stuck unfortunately. I‚Äôve definitely felt shame in it; nobody but my boyfriend knows about my lack of habit. Like there have been calendar years where I could probably count the number of times I brushed my teeth during those 12 months with two hands. I‚Äôm sure there are years where I‚Äôve not flossed once. I‚Äôve had gums puff up and get enflamed. 

I know that it‚Äôs stupid to continue throwing caution to the wind and waiting until I ACTUALLY have a cavity or worse to change. I know that it‚Äôs easier to fuck up your teeth and gums in your 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs, and onwards than it is as a kid. I realize I need to stop waiting for the bad shit to catch up to me and let it cost me thousands later in life just so I can be lazy now. I know it can actually cause health/heart problems down the road. It‚Äôs gross as fuck and I‚Äôd hypocritically be grossed out at someone else if I found out they never brushed their teeth. 

So I hope it‚Äôs not too late and that I don‚Äôt have to regret not brushing for all those years even more than I do now. I want to keep this habit. I want to not be able to go to bed without brushing or else I‚Äôll feel gross. I want to have a routine and stick with it. 

It‚Äôs been almost a month now and my teeth already look better, not to mention that I feel so much better. Here‚Äôs a [before and after pic](https://imgur.com/a/oiJ1H8t)if you feel so inclined (it‚Äôs not NSFW or nasty, but they‚Äôre not pretty lol) and you can see some differences already. They‚Äôve been an ugly yellow color for a long time so I‚Äôd love to get them a little whiter but will probably need something fancier and more expensive for that. Love that my teeth still ended up fucking crooked after two rounds of braces as a teen üò≠ I‚Äôll likely do Invisalign in a couple of years. 

Anyway, thanks for reading those of you who still are. Don‚Äôt be like how I was! I was lucky to not get any cavities but that doesn‚Äôt mean my dental health didn‚Äôt suffer. Here‚Äôs to being hygienic for the rest of my life and hopefully having a healthier mouth.

tl;dr: I‚Äôve been terrible at brushing my teeth my entire teenage and adulthood but somehow didn‚Äôt get any cavities or serious health issues so I used that to justify not brushing. But now I‚Äôm trying to get my shit together so I don‚Äôt regret it later down the road.

Edit: ICYWW I am and have been pretty hygienic in all other aspects (washing my hair, washing body parts properly, wearing clean clothes, always washing my hands, wiping my butt properly which apparently some people don‚Äôt do, etc), it‚Äôs just the dental care that I was horrendous at.",18Apr2020,17

I'll share this story here, in r/rant (which is a smaller sub).

Anyway, I'm Filipino and so are my BIL and SIL. Let's call them Mike and Tina.

The two of them are working in Dubai (Tina is a secretary and Mike is an engineer). Mike's office already had a few COVID-19 cases so they did a mandatory test -- unfortunately, he tested positive. Around the same time, Tina also showed flu-like symptoms, though she hadn't undergone a test yet.

The advice from the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) was to have them just stay at home and self-isolate until hospitals had available slots. Mike was even told there'd be an ambulance that would pick him up to transport him to a quarantine facility, though no definite timeframe was provided.

So far so good, right? Well, no, not quite.

Their landlord was aware of the situation, and he tried to forcibly evict them. The entire day included the following incidents:

- Landlord called building management, security, and even a policeman to help with their eviction.
- Landlord and co. were yelling in the hallway: ""YOU, COVID, COVID! YOU, COVID! YOU, GO!""
- The couple was being harassed because they were being forced to leave, all in full view of other tenants.
- Landlord tried to call an ambulance so they could both get whisked away immediately. An ambulance did arrive but they couldn't do anything since they needed approval from the DHA.
- Mike and Tina tried to contact DHA rep. who eventually spoke to the landlord, but the guy wouldn't budge.
- The landlord even threatened to file charges.
- Since they couldn't get them to leave -- and they sure as hell won't go outside/find another place because of the quarantine -- they were detained in the lobby for several hours.
- They were not allowed to go back to their apartment. Mike (who, again, is COVID-positive), was forced to wait without food or water. He wasn't even allowed to use the bathroom in their apartment because they wanted to keep a close eye on him.

Hours passed and, finally, after pressure from the DHA rep. and Mike's threat that it's the landlord who'd get jailed for violating the agency's mandate, the landlord relented. First, Tina was allowed to go back to their apartment and, later, Mike was also allowed. DHA promised to send an ambulance to bring Mike to a quarantine facility and Tina would be left behind since she wasn't tested yet (but did have flu-like symptoms).

-----------

The couple couldn't contact the Philippine embassy in Dubai because it was closed. For my part, knowing that it was an emergency, I tried to contact people here in the Philippines, anyone who might be able to help. One of my reporter friends was a godsend, and I was given the contact details for a ranking official from the Department of Foreign Affairs. The official then got in touch directly with the consulate in Dubai, and consulate personnel talked to the couple.

They now have an emergency contact/byline in case anything goes wrong, and they'll be able to speak to someone who might be able to help expedite the process. So, once health officials arrive to transport Mike, Tina would also get a test.

Hopefully, she gets admitted to the quarantine facility rather than being left alone in their apartment where the landlord, building management, and practically every tenant knows that her partner is COVID-positive. Who knows what kind of crap they'd pull?

Anyway, that's my story -- or, rather, it's the story of Mike and Tina, Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Dubai. Stay safe, everyone, and don't treat COVID patients like that jackass of a landlord.",18Apr2020,1

133,"It‚Äôs 5 AM, I just installed reddit, and I have no idea why I‚Äôm writing this. Also, It doesn‚Äôt really matter if anyone replies or not, I guess I just wanted to express how I feel. hehe.

BTW, To give you a little bit of background info about me, I could say that I do come off as nice and kind to other people. I am extremely patient, understanding, and I‚Äôm ALWAYS willing to give other people chances. (((despite the fact that I‚Äôm an Aries üòÜ)))

I‚Äôve only been truly in love once, but before that, I had guys talk about me and to me (sorry if it sounds so egotistical but it adds to the context üò≠). These guys would always make it seem like they‚Äôre interested, always talking about how I‚Äôm ~all this, but at the end of the day, these boys just left me hanging. 

Months after my breakup (which btw, literally broke me to pieces), I decided to cut myself some slack and talk to guys here and there. I totally forgot what it was like to talk to people again. I really hit it off with this one guy. We haven‚Äôt talked in ages, and only rekindled our friendship through snapchat. We talked for a month and a half (??) and ~vibed pretty well and he agreed. He would always be so nice, and understanding. We honestly talked as if we were in a relationship (and it wasn‚Äôt weird because I knew him way back in high school), but he all of the sudden ghosted me after I practically shared my tiny meltdown with him, and even a few days before that. 

The problem really wasn‚Äôt him, it was everything; and he was the trigger. I feel like people like to talk to me just because they‚Äôre bored, but they fail to see how sensitive I actually am and how I genuinely care about the connection I build with someone. It‚Äôs so unfair how I always feel as if I‚Äôm in the losing end when there are people who make me feel used.  I really do trust a few of the people I talk to, and it just sucks how easy it is for them to leave after making you feel like you were important to them :))

134,"26 still mooching off parents, though I pay a tiny bit of ‚Äúrent‚Äù, bc my dumb ass tried to go back to school and flunked out. 

I have everything I need and good parents, no trauma, no abuse, nothing. I have had behavioral problems in childhood. I should be lucky I had parents who tried so hard, taking me to psychologists, being open to learn about mental illnesses, and trying to medicate me. But it all sucked because my dumb child ass took it as them hating me for who I was bc I was unbearable and trying to make me some imaginary person who was underneath. They were always so nice to me though, and I was so stupid for a little kid, refusing to speak to psychologists or even my doctor. Fluctuating between aggressive and so fucking shy that I went entire school years without speaking.

I have gender dysphoria, I was born female and like girls, if I could just tell them I was a lesbian I would it would be easier for them to understand, but I can‚Äôt be. I‚Äôd love to be. I ducking love lesbians. But I am incapable of having relationships bc of how much I hate myself. I will never have sex not even with myself. I am a virgin who will never give them grandchildren. If I told them everything, my dad would have a stroke and fucking die, my mom would never forgive me, id never make them proud, and I wouldnt be welcome at their funerals. 

I pass as a man a lot of the time and my friends know what I am and treat me like myself, and I am myself. It takes no effort. I could potentially have a life and not even have to think about it every fucking day. I don‚Äôt even want being transgender to be part of my life. I owe my parents so fucking much though. I am a giant depressed loser and I can‚Äôt do that to them. And I can‚Äôt afford to move out.

I have thought about ending it all a few times but I have loans co-signed by my parents (bc they believe in me or something) and I haven‚Äôt been able to get them refinanced for one reason or another, so that would all fall on them and they‚Äôd be fucked. and low key not trying that hard even though interest rates are so low just because I wonder how serious I am. It‚Äôs so stupid and contradictory.

They are conservative and Christian and apparently the ‚Äúcool‚Äù ones, I‚Äôve always thought of them as the best people I know, but once in a while in some conversation or just hearing the comments they make it will hit me that they hate what I am and don‚Äôt even know it. I am pretty positive all my childhood problems and all my dumb mental problems that keep me from functioning stem from being trans and liking girls. Other people with the same problems can function though so I have no excuse.

135,"Well first of all I have to say that I have other things that stress me a lot in my life, and this didn't help much. I sadly got into a car accident that was my fault in any way, on my driving test. I was that lucky.

I feel bad about what happend to my teacher's car, and it kind of scares me to retake the test whenever it will be possible. I already dislike the whole process of getting a driving license in my country which is very expensive, so now other than some stupid fear I also have to take more lessons. I just wanted to get a damn license, and now I have trouble falling asleep and I can't even finish this process because of the Corona.

Not sure if what I wrote make sense, it's the middle of the night and all of this just keeps playing in my head over and over again.

So all those issues those guys have can actually be solved very easily.  I would think a great idea if someone is struggling getting laid or having a relationship is try chatting up a person with no picture on their profile.

I know it sounds counterintuitive but it isnt.  What you dont realize you now actually have to talk.  The expectation of sex shouldn't be there because there is no picture to go off of.  If it is still there.just refrain from making any sexual comments.

This will hopefully give you a little insight. Now you are actually learning how to talk to women.

138,"So a few weeks ago my mom told me that my dad was in the hospital. I felt nothing of course based on our history. She told me he was having another heart attack so she took him to the hospital, and they had to a more complicated procedure on him. About 7-10 years ago, he was having mini heart attacks at work and was ignoring it. When we took him to the hospital, the doctors said he would've died with the next one. So he got 7 stents. Which is a ridiculous amount. His arteries were so clogged (thanks to decades of fast food) that the scan showed them almost full. He continued after to not take care of himself because he's selfish of course. So now he got 1 more stent put in. And probably will need another one. The evil inside is probably keeping him alive longer. 

My mom, though she knows how I feel about dad and has possibly accepted it, kept saying ""I'm not ready to be a widow"". I brushed it off and changed the subject. Because I feel like such a bad person but I'm ready for her to be a widow. I'm tired of the constant fights I've had with her about him. I'm tired of not receiving any support, of him abusing me, of his screaming, of how he tries to tear me down with every sentence. I'm tired of the humiliation, for the times I've been suicidal as a child/teen. I'm tired of her trying to get me to see him multiple times after I already told her I never wanted to see him again. I'm tired of finally agreeing to see him at family gatherings a couple times a year just because my mom misses me. I'm tired of her trying to guilt trip/bring him up/her denial of his abuse. I'm tired of him and his lesser but continuous presence on this earth. I'm tired of him continuing to live (he's 82ish). I'm ready. And I dont like talking to my mom about her readiness to be a widow. I feel uncomfortable and like I'm not the one to talk to about it. 

It's not my fault my parents decided to buy a new house when he was turning 80. It's not my fault they have a new mortgage, or a new car, or gutted the house and poured money into renovations, or adopted 2 young dogs. It's not my fault that mom is so worried about things that will happen after wards. She dug her hole.

141,"**Isolation...**We're all facing it right now thanks to Covid-19, but this is a feeling that's been following me since childhood.

I feel extremely alone when I'm not in the company of loving friends, family, and significant other. It's made me grow overly attached to people to the point where I feel separation anxiety even before I have to say goodbye. For most of my life, I've had this gnawing feeling of sadness/fear/loneliness/feeling that something just isn't in place. It's been hard to understand and rationalize this feeling, and this has prevented me from overcoming it. Social-distancing certainly doesn't make this any easier. I feel very dependant and reliant on the company of others and find it challenging to be alone with myself and thoughts. 

I've had some anxiety issues (potentially depression too) for maybe 6-8 years now that partly stem back to a toxic and emotionally abusive relationship that lasted 5 years. I'm sure that parts of that relationship have made a lasting impact and affect me even today although I tend to repress my feelings associated with that. I want to unpack that baggage before it begins to affect a new and healthy relationship that has just begun to form, because some repressed emotions are finally starting to surface unexpectedly. But I don't really know how to do that or where to begin.

I have talked to friends and they offer good advice, reminding me to focus on all the positives in my life right now. That is helpful...for a while, and then I fall back into a hole of low self esteem and uncertainty regarding everything. Most of the times, these uncertainties and insecurities are highly irrational and i recognize that, but can't stop myself from feeling it.

I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, eating healthy for the most part, working out at least 2 times/week,  continuing to do well in school (finishing masters), and sleeping at least 6 hours/ night. 

I have been to a doctor and counsellor at uni for these mental health issues becasue I thought that I may be depressed. I went on anti-depressants for a while and it helped me enough to get me to a point where I can make healthier lifestyle choices around diet, exercise, and sleep. They associated my depressed mood with grief that comes from the loss of a relationship and just something that will pass. I'm sure that is true, but I continue to feel that way even 2 years later when my ex is no longer in my life and I've left him in the past. I feel that there may be residual trauma but I know I've felt this way since before that relationship.

Still, I get the feeling that something is off. I constantly feel the need to be validated and accepted. I need to be in the company of others, and usually then I feel ok. Outside of that time, I just crash and find myself feeling alone and scared. I try to provide myself with self validation and find things about myself I love and that I am good at, but this is extremely difficult for me. 

I'm mainly writing this in hopes that this will help me work through my feelings. Maybe someone out there has felt something similar and wants to share their story or has advice on strategies to feel better mentally? If you've made it this far, thanks for listening.",18Apr2020,1
143,"Dear diary,

Didnt sleep well last night as had a massive headache so didn‚Äôt get to sleep until 2am.

Thought about her a little today but not as much as I have done on previous days.

My tinder has been less active more of the fact that at the moment with what‚Äôs going on with my feelings I don‚Äôt feel like putting in any effort so I‚Äôve just got 2 unread messages that I haven‚Äôt even attempted to open.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to open myself up to be hurt again to be honest.",18Apr2020,1
147,"I ate some butter on a toasted tortilla with cinnamon and sugar on it. It tastes sort of like a less doughy elephant ear. 
Anyway, I'm slightly lactose intolerant but I wanted to taste real butter again. So I skipped the margarine and used butter instead. 
Now I'm sitting on the toilet with regret and surrounded by the stench of burnt rubber farts.",18Apr2020,10
149,"I write original songs and I'm not sure where I'm going with this or whether I'll ever get a platform, but I'm inches away from a 100 subscribers on YouTube. It means there are people who want to hear me but also people who'll know me and that vulnerability is scary. 

Some days I want to delete my channel and am hit with every inferiority complex in the book. Some days I remind myself that it's about saying stuff important to me. Some days I want to cry.",18Apr2020,2
150,"I have a friend that complains non stop. She creates these awful situations for herself and then claims to be the victim. She will send me messages that are 30+ minutes long about how bad she hates her life and how she would rather be dead than keep living like this. This has been going on for several years. I‚Äôve tried to be supportive and steer her in the direction of therapy. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôm always afraid I will do or say the wrong thing. I‚Äôm afraid if I put up a boundary and tell her that she can‚Äôt complain to me all the time, that it will set her off and she will do something drastic and I‚Äôll blame myself. I feel trapped. What should I do?",18Apr2020,2
