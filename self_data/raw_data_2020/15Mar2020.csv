Starting from that point onwards, I've had major trust issues and my relationships tend to fail because of me not trusting my partner. After that happened i felt that i should stop saying which i did for two years.

Today, something inside of me made me realize that I'm ready to go back into the dating world and find a serious relationship. I'm so happy for myself. Just felt like sharing this with everyone on Reddit xoxoxo",15Mar2020,1

Hi Reddit, This is a long one so i apologize ahead of time. I am kinda in tears rn and can only type with one hand so sorry for the mistakes and grammar errors. So I don‚Äôt really want to explain how it happened, because it still gives me nightmares, but nine months ago I had an accident and my right hand (dominant hand) was cut and the laceration caused by it cut my ulnar nerve 100% and my median 70%. It‚Äôs hard to talk about but I was rushed to the hospital, bleeding out, asking the guy across from me ‚Äúam I going to die‚Äù? At this Point I can‚Äôt tell you how much blood I lost but it was a lot. Anyways he says to me ‚Äújust calm down because anxiety and your heart racing can pump blood faster in a situation like this‚Äù. He tried to call me down by asking me questions and complimenting my tattoo. So I get to the hospital and I‚Äôm surrounded by everybody. It feels like everybody in the hospital was surrounding me. So they stitch it up(poorly I might add) but I was done bleeding. Fast forward to seeing my doctor performing surgery on me told me I might never be able to use my hand again 100%. Blunt, but honest which I can respect. So the day I went to the hospital they were checking beforehand to see if I had adequate blood flow to keep my hand. Monitors the whole ordeal. My fianc√©e heart was pounding and so was mine. But alas they said it was sufficient enough to go through surgery. I was in the operating room for six hours before I woke up on a bed getting attentive care in the post op. The nurse said hi in an angelic voice and the first thing(even though I was certain) was to ask if I still had my hand. I did and I was ecstatic, because I had some hope. After all of that I was prescribed Oxy to deal with the shocks from nerve damage. If you haven‚Äôt experienced it it feels like somebody put a taser right on my wrist. I would scream in agony it was horrible. I was in a cast and then in time in a splint which I was in for four months until I took it off. My fingers were bound by straps in a position that locked them in an backwards L shape. I started therapy to try to loosen them up and help my dexterity and mobility in my fingers because they were stuck in the same position for months. Today was a little step that made me cry I finally got the mobility to use my right hand to tie my shoe lace. That is all and off my chest, I‚Äôm lucky to be able to even due a minor mistake. Thank you.(so I can actually have the dexterity and mobility to do simple tasks I never thought I would be able to do. I‚Äôm crying typing this)",15Mar2020,1

12,"This is a long post, i put a tl;dr below  
I (F17) cant stop thinking about how privileged I am now compared to the circumstances I was supposed to live in. I lived with my mom in my home country (Spain) until I was 6 and we were dirt poor. She worked three cleaning jobs and I remember at first we lived with a relative she didnt have a good relationship with. I remember we rented from room to room, but it was the norm and didnt realize how tired and stressed my mom must have been. She was a young single mom, and she often had to leave me on my own in the apartment with other people renting other rooms. She was so good at giving me the most normal childhood as possible. I only realized as I got older.  


It came to the point where child services got involved and she almost lost custody of me because how poor we were. She was also an illegal citizen because she had to flee Chile so my biological father didnt kill her. My mom made the choice of sending me to Norway to live with my grandmother where I pretty much lived an average life for the standards here. My mom couldnt come with me because she didnt have papers.   


Now that I am older I cant stop thinking about how things could have turned out. How lucky I am to be where I am. How much my mother went through, I really am eternally grateful for her. I feel extremely guilty and privileged because I wish I grew up with my mom. I dont do well in school. I struggle a lot with my mental health, cause I have the privilege to even think about it. My mom had no one helping her when going through all this. She is currently doing good and has a new family :)   


I am so grateful for all I have, considering how much she fought for me. Considering what could have been. I feel so awfully privileged. And I dont know where else to express these thoughts, cause Im afraid my friends simply wont understand, cause they only know the  ''norwegian'' side of me.   


tl;dr: my mom and me lived in poor conditions, she eventually sent me to norway with my grandmother while she continued to struggle for years. i feel guilty and privileged cause i dont do well in school, and id like to make this a motivation instead of a constant feeling of guilt and regret.",15Mar2020,1

23,"Born in the tropics, it's never gotten this cold unless you travelled high up to the mountains and volcanoes where it rarely hails or snows. 

You remember aching drowsiness and warm solid hands charting you up to watch the sun rise and set as the clouds parted. 

This is the will of God. 

You could almost hear her voice say that to little tiny you - you must have been younger than seven. Why seven? Because you recall you hadn't moved to that new big house with three floors and a basement - so four platforms and you turned seven a few months after moving there. 

When you were up in the mountains and volcanoes with your family and extended family members, you still lived in two connected massive houses that was just one floor and had a mango tree you loved climbing and help harvest the mangoes from. 

There were always Jasmine flower thieves, picking it from the fences as the bushes peaked through and bloomed and wafted in the sweet smell of purity. 

How you love the cold, where different flowers bloom in the dead of the night and sunlight turns the freezing temperatures into a bearable soothing warmth.  You hated the sun and you like it a bit more than you did before when the only weather you knew was always hot, humid, dry, and wet. 

Breathing the crisp chilly air is somehow nostalgic, something about the scent of the greenery being cooled digs deep into the back of your head of the past and coddles you to crawl under a blanket like a particularly effective lullaby and panders to you to fall asleep and dream your life away.

I used to try to vent about this to my friends. But I feel guilty talking about my sadness to them now. They‚Äôre already dealing with their own problems. For most of them, those problems involve breakups of ACTUAL relationships, i.e. with people who they were in legitimate relationships with that went sour. I see how much pain theyre in. I don‚Äôt know if I should invalidate the things I feel, but what right do I have to vent to them about my heartbreak when we were never even in an actual relationship? 

With that being said, why am I so sad considering all the problems people have all over the world? People are plagued by war, sickness, hunger, and here I am crying over unrequited love?

Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she‚Äôd of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?'

He believes that:

* We shouldn't listen to what the government says about coronavirus because it's a ploy to allow the government to control our lives more.

* Climate change is a hoax, the IPCC uses unreliable data, and it is yet another ploy to allow the government to control our lives more.

* Various stuff about the Rothschilds:

   * The banks control the government and the Rothschilds control the banks. 

   * Criticism of the Rothschilds isn't antisemitic because the Rothschilds are a death cult, not Jews. 

   * The Rothschilds didn't get harmed in WWII because both sides owed money to them.

   * Evidence showing that the Rothschilds don't control governments is unreliable because of course the Rothschilds want to hide the fact that they control governments.

* Paganism is the best religion and violent forms of paganism aren't real paganism.

I met up with her on campus and spoke about the situation . I sincerely apologized for what I had done and that I was not asking for forgiveness . She said she values our friendship and said that she forgives me for what had happened . I saw her last week and we spoke a bit about assignments and work . I really missed our conversations 

Since we both share the same classes and majors , I offered to help her with her film portfolio last year . I know she does not have anything at the moment so I told her that she can edit a short film I'm working on with a small crew . She agreed and said she would like that . 

I don't want things to be rushed into trying to mend the friendship , so how do I take it slow ? 

TL;DR : After an immature mistake led me to lose a close girl friend of mine at the end of last year , I'm trying to take things slow in rebuilding our friendship",15Mar2020,1

On the other hand, the players are going to continue playing whether or not I‚Äôm there and will be just as much at risk whether I stay home or not. They‚Äôll continue to lose money and if I‚Äôm just sitting at home and staying away I‚Äôm costing myself potential income.

61,"When you tickle a newborn's foot it curls. You can leave it hanging on a bar while it grips it tightly. Children like to climb rocks, trees, poles, and the like. They're like little monkeys. Children aren't racist at all. Toddlers don't have depression. They live in a different world. A different set of emotions. 

I think all the positive traits that babies and children have slowly dissolve with age. The human mind and spirit is like an aspirin pill dissolving in water. 

Whatever system is in place to not judge others who are different from us slowly dissolves. The sense of significance from every event and place in life shrinks. Places that were once bigger than us become smaller than us. Our mind and body become more brittle with the soft untouched warmth eroded to expose the reptilian inner workings of who we are. 

Maintaining our physical health from start to finish is like stacking dominos on each other. The first few dominos are easy, but when the stack gets higher we have to strategically place the dominos to counter balance any imperfections, which will then become imperfections prompting counterbalancing later on.

It's for these reasons I want to eat sea food and greens for my diet. Humans originally came from the sea: the first cell, to invertebrates, to fish, to amphibians, to reptiles, to mammals, to monkeys, to us was the course of life leading to us. I believe that's why the pescetarian diet is so good for humans - we've spent half of our evolutionary life in the ocean. We started in the ocean and even now the vast majority of humans live near the water's edge. We didn't go far from it. I believe that by consuming fish oil and eating seafood with veggies and greens, getting eight hours of sleep every night, exercising, meditating, doing yoga, swimming, and traveling, I can minimise the effects of ageing on my mind, body, and spirit.

72,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this story, but I wanted to find somewhere to share this story because in reality it was pretty funny and my life wasn't in danger. Without further ado, the story...

Last year, in May, I was presented the oppurtunity  by my scout leader for me and a couple of others to go on a three day yacht trip as one of the leaders owned a yacht. Of course  I said yes, and the we set sail at 7pm. The journey to the first mooring bouy was fairly uneventful, except it was quite windy, meaning the waves were quite big. We reached the mooring bouy about 2.15 am, and we attempted to moor up to it. We got it on the end of the boating pole, and were ready to tie up to it, when our scout leader lost his hat. So, he let go of the bouy to retrieve his hat. After struggling to try get it back, we tried to moor up again. Thats when a huge wave pulled the boating pole out of scout leader's hands. So, we sailed close to shore on this island (only accessible by boat by the way) to try and get the pole back. But we sailed in too shallow and... CRUNCH! The boat was stuck in about 5 cm of water, and the tide was rapidly going out. We had no choice but to call the lifeboat, just to get to shore as we waited for the tide to come back in, to put our boat upright again. It was a really weird situation, going on a lifeboat in an actual rescue situation. Everyone else slept at the lifeboat station, but i couldn't so i stayed awake for 40+ hours straight! The lifeboat station was a small one in Kircudbright, Scotland, and we were attempting to moor up to the bouy in Little Ross Island. The lifeboat crew were really nice, and bought us croissants! Then, when they went to get the boat back the next day, the engine failed. With a bit of luck, we managed to get back to the mooring bouy the next night, then sail back to the yacht's port with no other disasters. Looking back at the situation now, its actually quite funny and a good story to tell! Obviously, at the time it was quite scary, but now it's my favorite story to tell people! 

There is  a photo of the yacht on the Kircudbright lifeboat page -  [https://en-gb.facebook.com/KirkcudbrightRNLI/posts/1294318447386167?\_\_xts\_\_\[0\]=68.ARDINhjBCptXwMzFLGAOrLtnqLfOcNTB3\_veyeG-cQ3dmlIXJ615L4i0unh2NuDAf9eqP5-EQbkY1UYYnfAR0G-93wRLy95W2x1q0m3Ng67F1jR35fh1lVIu9Oeu3ASE5PqyOhtXA5lJkICnR6V2ElAc5WofbNrOgOlDwX9voE3QH1HvVoSSwNHmxTgrjqImtXufCz6SYM-xsRsohMIVQ3Ex7Iu8s8vVDyAoadC869PIhatt7HlmSPehdUlmrI7s\_euJIoLLcyBFMM3LLSOLUKZillhIcaino1vWWIA533LJdzat6TLRQL5U9GV5Ly24amXFGfM65rYkLc2LdHxSoNnDyw&amp;\_\_tn\_\_=-R](https://en-gb.facebook.com/KirkcudbrightRNLI/posts/1294318447386167?__xts__[0]=68.ARDINhjBCptXwMzFLGAOrLtnqLfOcNTB3_veyeG-cQ3dmlIXJ615L4i0unh2NuDAf9eqP5-EQbkY1UYYnfAR0G-93wRLy95W2x1q0m3Ng67F1jR35fh1lVIu9Oeu3ASE5PqyOhtXA5lJkICnR6V2ElAc5WofbNrOgOlDwX9voE3QH1HvVoSSwNHmxTgrjqImtXufCz6SYM-xsRsohMIVQ3Ex7Iu8s8vVDyAoadC869PIhatt7HlmSPehdUlmrI7s_euJIoLLcyBFMM3LLSOLUKZillhIcaino1vWWIA533LJdzat6TLRQL5U9GV5Ly24amXFGfM65rYkLc2LdHxSoNnDyw&amp;__tn__=-R)

I put my hands up in a defensive manner, repeating, ""it was a joke"" and she comes back and spits in my face!

I'm having a headache that just goes away if I get distracted. I really don't have a cough but sometimes I feel like my throat is itchy, so I tend to have the need to cough. Been feeling feverish, but checking my temperature it's just normal. I think I'm depressed, I'm not really sure. So earlier with overthinking things I felt like I was short of breath, but I kept reminding myself that this is just all in my mind and try to relax and focus on my breathing instead. And I'm just really emotional right now, I feel like crying. Thinking about the fears that this virus is bringing to all the people around the world. Those who are suffering. Those who are away from their loved ones due to the lock down. And those people who lost their lives due to this said virus. I just really hope that everything gets better soon.",15Mar2020,1
100,"okay so

i‚Äôve always been with the in crowd. i‚Äôm not trying to sound up myself or anything, I can be walking down the street get looks or sometimes being called beautiful. my friends mums always compliment me. i have no problem finding hookups.

the problem is i‚Äôm jealous. i have a friend who is beautiful and can get any guy to fall in love with her. she‚Äôs extroverted and can make a guy laugh without the joke being funny. she doesn‚Äôt really do anything besides go out. i‚Äôm quite introverted, my main talents/hobbies is art (especially drawing), reading books or poetry and adore music. 

i have a troubled background, my family is not normal. i‚Äôm a size 4-6 and 5‚Äô8 and i get called fat and disgusting from my mum and sister. my mums behaviour has caused my 20 year old sister to weigh 43kg, she says to me ‚Äòshe doesn‚Äôt want to look fat like me.‚Äô I get told there‚Äôs mentally something wrong with me, i‚Äôm retarded, stupid and get told i have no point of living. i know it doesn‚Äôt sound that bad, i don‚Äôt remember everything my mum says but one thing that has stuck is ‚Äúit hurts when mummy hurts you.‚Äù my dad is barely home and i have a lot trouble with that. the guy i was in a thing with took my virginity then next week he fucked my ex best friend, called me a disgusting slut and the worst thing was he put his hands on me and choked the air out of me out of anger. later to find out he was an actual narcissist. i am traumatised by it and still can‚Äôt sleep and get nightmares. i found this out 3 months after, i put up with his bullshit until i connected the dots when she told me he said she had a better ‚Äòass‚Äô than me, her ass is really big so no shit. i‚Äôm more covered or ‚Äòclassy‚Äô i get told. (i‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt want to be seen as i‚Äôm just a fuck doll- not trying to shade her btw) 

with my ex best friend, i stayed at hers to distract myself from my family and also to try to forget the fact my grandmas husband almost killed my beautiful grandma.she was crying about a guy she has a full obsession with, i tried to calm her down she was holding a knife on the counter and it was too much. i said to her to her we will get some food and then we will try to go to sleep and relax. i‚Äôm usually good at comforting, this time i was really not in the right headspace to look after someone else, especially about this guy. she then called me a shit friend, i‚Äôm selfish and everything is about myself (after she fucked the guy i was with!!!) . the thing is i don‚Äôt even open up to anyone. i‚Äôm so anxiety ridden, that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm on this app anonymously. i never put my troubles on her like she did on me.

now the main reason i came on this app is that i can‚Äôt impress anyone, my family, boys and myself. 

there‚Äôs a certain group of boys who are so chill and i‚Äôd like to talk to them but they don‚Äôt like me. they think i‚Äôm weird. with my friend they love her. i haven‚Äôt hooked up with anyone, stopped going out, focussing on school and the things i love. this makes me also feel depressed. just everything that goes on. i‚Äôve been walked over by friends and boys a lot. i have a shit reputation. i had a drug addiction (not many people know about) it fucked me up. i got sleep paralysis and couldn‚Äôt form sentences properly (i‚Äôm a lot better, don‚Äôt even drink anymore) 

i just think, why can‚Äôt i be someone else? i know everyone has their troubles but i really don‚Äôt get how they can go out and talk to people so easy. i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs cause i‚Äôm anxiety-ridden and insecure or if i‚Äôm just not important. i honestly don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm like this. i feel like i‚Äôm just there.

103,"Hey, all
Not a medical professional. Not in emergency management. Not an expert in any way.  But here's what I understand about the outbreak as of right now.  

Covid-19 is a virus that attacks the upper respiratory passages, and can migrate down the airways to infect the lungs. If it gets too severe, the infection can turn into pneumonia (fluid in the lungs) that requires medical intervention, either antibiotics to stop a parasitic infection, all the way to a ventilator. 

For those who have had symptoms and been treated, infection rates and severity seem to be dependent on the amount of exposure, respiratory and immunocompromised people, and those who are older.  People under 20 are very unlikely to get that sick. People over 60 face a much higher rate of risk, and those over 80 face a quite dangerous risk.  This makes nursing homes a very bad place to be at this time. 

Exposure to symptoms takes about 5 days, but can be faster, and can go all the way out to 14 days.  

Symptoms include a dry cough, runny nose, and fever.  If the fever gets above 100 degrees F or so, a doctor visit is encouraged. 

A person who has been exposed may be able to transmit the virus before they come down with the sickness.  It is very possible that a large number of people who are exposed will NOT show symptoms, but still be able to transmit the virus. 

The virus can be transmitted via droplets (cough, sneeze, touch) to another person.  The virus appears to be able to stay alive a few hours airborne, and up to a few days on suitable surfaces. It can be killed using standard antibacterial cleaners. 

Because of the dearth of testing in the United States (a few thousand across the country), and the amount of time it takes to process the tests (up to a week), the virus is already much, much more widespread than the reported number of cases.  due to the incubation period being possibly shorter than the test, an infected person may spread the disease for a week BEFORE they get notified they have the disease. 

The virus is already very widespread. For the vast majority of people, it doesn't matter that much. They will not get sick, and the vast majority of those who DO get sick, it's going to be a mild case.  

For those who are at risk, it's up to a 1 in 6 chance of dying,if you show symptoms.  

Because of THOSE numbers, and because of the US medical system, there will be triage medicine happening.  People will be treated based on their ability to survive and their expected longevity after infection, and (for fuck's sake I hope not) their ability to pay for treatment.  People who COULD live with treatment are not going to be able to GET treatment.  

The only way to limit that eventuality is strict quarantining of the entire population.  We don't know who has it, we don't know how far it's spread, and we don't have a way to limit the spread,short of spreading out as long as possible the amount of time it takes for everyone to get exposed. Whatever quarantine you've dealt with so far in the US, it's not enough.  We either look like China, or we end up looking like Italy.  

Final exposure rates to this are going to be on the order of over half the population.  It is too widespread, it is too hardy, and it is too easily transmitted for a large percentage of the population to NOT be exposed.  A New York Times story of a CDC report said we may be looking at 150-260 million exposures in the US, and 200,000-1.6 million deaths.  

The economic effects of this will be on par (or worse) than the crash of 2008.  Millions of people will be unemployed, there will be businesses closing left and right, and there will be associated economic impacts.  People without much in the bank are going to get hosed.  And, no, we don't know how bad this is going to be, economically.

124,"I kept waiting for life to start, I was sure it had to at one point, it couldn't go on like this forever. But a year became 10 years and now I'm even worst of. 

I'm trans but it never worked out. Those trans women that are famous like Hunter Schafer all started their transition very young with supporting families, which obviously didn't happened to me. And even then, when you look at successful before and afters the ones who truly look like women at the end were had very masculine appearances to begin with. They already had narrower shoulders and softer looking hands. That was never the case with me, I have what would've been a perfect male body if I had been born normal.

I can find a job, pretend I'm not trans, be miserable and kill myself eventually, destroying my family.

So I was going through a difficult time and came down to spend a couple months with my dad in SC. Things have been good, I have been working on myself and have been happier lately. Well, my mother decided to come down for a surprised visit. She has diagnosed bipolar depression and undiagnosed OCD, and she is also very high maintenance. It has been nothing but drama and strife since she got here. She is an extremely negative person; it is so integral to her personality that I believe even if she didn‚Äôt have mental illnesses, she would be negative. She relies heavily on others for happiness, although usually is still very depressing despite everything everyone tries. For example, today we had planned a movie day and lunch. She was borderline crying the whole day, everything she said was negative, and she insisted on getting drinks after to drown her sorrows.

I don't mean someone like a rape victim. Though I may have an opinion of something like that depending on the people involved and the events that led to that happening. But that's not the topic I'll be using for this post. Today I'm talking about people who do foolish things and make foolish mistakes and are rewarded or pitied for it. 

For example there's this tv show called Personal Injury Court. The judge almost always finds in favor of the plaintiff (the one suing) because he believes that just because the defendant (the one being sued) is in charge, or a professional in their field of work, then the plaintiff shouldn't have been hurt. But in most cases it was stupidity on the part of the plaintiff.

I'm sorry, but just because you were injured or traumatized doesn't automatically mean that you're not at fault. If you touch a fence that says ""don't touch electrified"", that's your fault. If you get bitten from trying to pet someone's (leashed/caged) dog after being told to leave it alone, that's your fault.

My parents paid for my college, which is a blessing, but the trade off was that I had to pick a major that would guarantee me a job. I majored in business management and absolutely hated every second of it. I hated my professors, my classmates, the material, the homework, everything. Even my internships were awful. I really hated most of my college career because of how miserable my major made me. 

Now I have to use my business degree to find a job, but honestly, I don't even want one. I can't stand the thought of sitting at a desk doing boring excel work. My parents say that work is work, and that it will suck anywhere, so I should just deal with it. They also tell me that I'm just gonna have to learn to suffer through work so that I can do the things I want to do once I get home. I don't think that's exactly true. When I got home from my internships, I was so exhausted and depressed that I fell asleep at like 7:00 most evenings. 

I have a deep passion for music and arts. I play a bunch of musical instruments. I have perfect pitch, which means I can hear notes and tell you what note it is. This lets me figure out how to play songs pretty instantaneously. I'm one of four people I know that have this ability. My friends all admire me for this. People all call me a ""music god"" and everyone says I'm the best musician they ever met. Music is my whole identity. I'm working on an album with my band right now, and doing that kind of work feels so deeply satisfying. I'm also an actor in my friend's short film, and I feel a deep satisfaction doing that kind of work as well. I wish that kind of stuff could be my job. 

I don't blame my parents for encouraging me to do business. It makes college a good investment for them, and honestly, there is no guarantee that a music degree or an acting degree would even land me a job. We don't have a lot of money either, so picking a strong degree is basically a no-brainer for us.

I want to work in audio production, or something similar. Those are my people. I feel like I belong there, but I have to find an office job soon. I'm fascinated by that kind of work.

I know a business degree is great, but sitting at a desk and staying miserable doesn't sound so great either. I would probably have to start over entirely if I want to find work I enjoy.

I'm still holding a vengeful grudge silently hoping for his early death. Not only that I went with the decision to help the family business for the next 3-4 years. It went up in flames (not literally). Our own local brand name stolen by my father's stupidity and incessive control over business decisions that flatlined our income and profits including our reputation. 

Now, I'm jobless, broken, possibly even homicidal and suicidal. One terrible decision turned my efforts and my mother's to ashes that I can't even begin to pick up and piece it back. Please, I beg of anyone. Help me.",15Mar2020,1

140,"Whenever I decide I want to buy something for myself I tend to overthink what I want and end up not getting anything.

As an example, a while ago I decided to buy a new pair of shoes. I work at a warehouse so comfortable shoes is a must, and those tend to be sporty shoes like Nikes and stuff. I spent 4 months looking after deciding to get myself a pair, and never buying one. Idk why I overthink it!

I think it may be attributed to the feeling you get when you buy something you like or think its cool at the time and then regret it sometime later. I hate spending money on stuff I don't really need, and when I do buy something that's like a ""treat"" for me, I have to force myself to use/play/watch the thing or else I get mad at myself for doing so.

I look at it as money being the issue, but sometimes it's not really the case. My job pays well enough that I could buy certain things without putting a huge dent on my bank account, but people who I've talked to about this have pointed out I overthink and overthink and I'm so careful with my money I don't get things I might actually need.

I'm not trying to be cheap, I just feel anxious about things I don't use just sitting there.

An example I have of late is this hobby I recently got back into. It's miniature wargaming. You buy the expensive plastic models, you paint them, and you play a game with them. I have done all but the last thing, and it legit makes me sad and frustrated to think I don't play the game because finding people to play is difficult in my area unless I drive somewhere else. But I never muster the courage to do so.",15Mar2020,1

171,"It started with my 20th birthday back in November. I'm no longer a teen, and I spent my birthday with friends from school, neither at Uni nor at the place where I grew up, in a new town, with what I thought were old friends. It was really weird, we had always stayed in touch and often met up, but something went astray there and I have had no contact whatsoever since.

Then, on December third, my brother who was a year younger than me died in a single vehicle crash. This is not something that was supposed to happen to him, he was the greatest guy I knew and the only real friend I've ever had. I honestly can't describe it properly. Just one facet of this loss is that I don't even have anything concrete about who he was, I've seen so many old pictures of him over the past few months and remembered how much he has changed that at this point it's all blending together and I'm already starting to forget. There are things we shared, things that are part of me, that are lost forever, without any kind of warning or chance of coming to a resolution.

We were very different people, and it's probably for that reason that I needed him so much.

The months since have been shitty. Uni is going bad, I presented a group project to the prof who I had hoped would supervise my bachelor's thesis and he said he regretted spending so much time and resources on our work. I am not an engineer, have never been one and will never be one. 

Worst part is, while you might think that I can still turn this around, my personality completely prohibits this. I am distancing myself from my family, because they care either too little or too much about my brother's death. All other people just annoy me and I keep getting annoyed and grumpy with them. I know this text reads like I'm having some major first world problems but I keep feeling like nobody has ever had to suffer like me. I'm making my brother's death about myself. I don't like this, but I can't change the way I feel.

When I had to go into quarantine for this whole Corona situation I finally realized that I am doomed. I had to change nothing at all about my lifestyle, while everybody is upset that they can't see their friends anymore. I just wanna die. My brother would have done so much better.

TL;DR: my brother died while I am a hopeless case in all regards",15Mar2020,1
