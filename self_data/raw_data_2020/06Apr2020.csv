0,"i had a dream about coronavirus. i cannot post it to their reddit page so im posting it here. i had a dream and im wondering what it means.

a group of scientists developed the coronavirus in a lab and they did not release it until they also made the cure to it incase one of their own people got it.

Their aim is not to profit from this (Although they did in the millions) their aim was to reduce the number of human lives to keep the numbers controlled. They eventually released the cure. If any other scientists or doctors found the cure before the numbers were low enough they would stop them by using coin and failing that force.

There came a time when someone blew the whistle on them but they shifted the blame, they said it was engineered by terrorists as a biological weapon.

What does this mean? any thoughts?",06Apr2020,1
1,"Hi, I have a friend of mine who recently went through a pretty bad breakup, due to some reasons, she wanted me to put up this message for her:  
 Hello, community, I (17F) would like to get some advice on how to bounce back from a break up and love myself. I struggled with self-esteem for years and that negative guy in my head never gets me anywhere. I’ve recieved lots of advice from friends and family, but no matter, I can never retain that advice.. is there any way i could use advice effectively? And anything on the matter of maintaining a health routine to recovery?",06Apr2020,1
2,"My dad is about 6 ft 1 and my mom is the average height for a female. All of my grandparents and cousins are also tall. I turned 15 this year and I am still really small most kids in my year are close or 6 ft. I on the other hand am about a whole head smaller then them and would be one of the smallest in the year. My dad was average size as a kid and then everyone out grew him in high school, by year 9/year 10 he started to grow. I have always been really small and I don't think I have ever had a growth spurt.

I eat really healthy foods with a nice amount of meat, and we don't have much junk in our house hold. I seem to have hit puberty like I have pubic hair and whatnot but my face is still quite young looking. I also have never experienced growing pains. I know this probably does not belong here but I just want to know if I will ever grow this is starting to really annoy me.",06Apr2020,1
4,"(For background info: My degree is creative and skills based, there are no exams, only coursework. I can’t resit modules, I can only resit the whole year.) I was already apprehensive about doing my final year. I barely passed last year and I wanted nothing more than to never go back to uni again (one major reason being the teaching at my uni is terrible but for the first few years I was determined to make the most of it regardless, however this grew tiresome and only started draining my creativity). I had plans to leave but I was persuaded by multiple people to finish and get my honours this year, so I listened. I had a breakdown 5 weeks into the year, from feeling severely out of my depth amongst other things. I picked myself up and kept going, but nothing really went how I wanted it to. I didn’t feel confident and creative at all. I’ve felt anxious the whole year and like I know I don’t have the skill to achieve an Honours. Now I have two weeks left and for the past month I procrastinated. I did some work here and there but not enough, or as much as I wanted. This tactic worked before as I work well under pressure. But for the past month I’ve had no drive to finish at all. This Covid crisis has also thrown me off. I was glad to be away from uni but at home I’ve done everything except finish my work. I feel terrible for wasting my parents £6000+. I will try to do what I can these two weeks but trying to fight the overwhelming dread is hard. I will leave with just a BA, not an Honours. Should I be okay with that? I just feel bad for wasting all the time and money, and wasting the opportunity that many don’t get to have. It’s just eating at me because I’m scared to admit it to my parents and disappoint them.",06Apr2020,1

I like the pot i made. Even painted it and made another smaller pot with the leftovers. But now i want to do more. Problem is im broke. Zero savings. My five month old has more savings than i do just from what we've put away for her. Pottery wheels as far as i can see online are all mechanical and expensive. I want an old school wheel.

12,"I live in New Orleans, which is quickly becoming a major home for the coronavirus. The rate at which the virus is growing in the state, especially the city, is alarming. I have been trying SO HARD to stick to self-isolating for the Coronavirus, but I literally haven’t been able to find a safe place to self-isolate because the people around me don’t care.

I rent a house with two other roommates. As soon as our school was cancelled, one of my roommates drove an hour to see her boyfriend, returned a week later to our apartment for a few hours, then went over to her parents house, where she found out she had fever. Me and my other roommate found out when she posted it on her Snapchat that she was getting tested for coronavirus. So not only did she put herself and us in danger, she didn’t even have the decency to let us know. My other roommate continue to have her friends over and visit her sister and her parents and other friends and then return home every single day. 

So I decided it was unsafe for me to stay there and I went to stay at my best friend’s house, where we would self-isolate with company in a much safer manner than my roommates had been practicing. Unfortunately, his grandmother passed away, so he has decided that even though we’re not actually allowed to have funerals in the city right now, they’re going to just all gather and have a temporary funeral anyway. 

I went to my parents’ house to distance myself from that, and in the one day that I have been here, my brother has had a friend over, gone to the grocery store, gone to another friends house for a party, and will then return home. My sister has been gone all day at her boyfriend’s birthday party, but I’m sure she’ll be home soon before the legal curfew. 

In the process of trying to find a single place to self isolate, I realize I have not actually been able to isolate because even I have been moving from place to place. 

Where the hell can I go where people are actually trying to stop the spread of this disease?? Is anyone actually doing it? Is it just that everyone in this state is stupid and that’s why it has gotten so bad here?? What are we supposed to do?

I know I’m probably being a bit dramatic, but I’m just trying to follow the rules and stop the spread but it just feels impossible at this point.",06Apr2020,1
14,"There is this Rick and Morty animated commercial for Pringles. I feel personally violated that a cartoon that I am addicted to is being coopted to entice me to want to watch the entirety of the commercial. I'm not mad at the producers of Rick and Morty to agreeing to license and create this, nor am I mad at Procter and Gamble for making their commercials at least enjoyable to watch. Though one could reasonably be mad about advertisements about unhealthy foods in general, it is not why I am mad today.

So naturally I bought Pringles at the store today.",06Apr2020,2
15,"Make a long story short a mini van kept cutting me off on my way home. Once we got on a kinda highway (not a full on highway but it leads to the highway) which has a 60 mph speed limit he cut me off again this time i was an inch away from hitting him and he break checked me not once but twice back to back i slammed on my breaks smelled burnt rubber and lickily no one was tailgating me. If i hit him im positive someone would of hit me from behind too. Its a curved road and we were doing 60 mph. 

Would what i described would of been lethal? I drive a 2017 nissan versa. Kind of small car but by no means a smart car. 

We were doing 60 but if i hit him i feel like it would be better than hitting a wall as we were both traveling in the same direction.

17,"Everything was relativly fine just a while ago. In a matter of weeks everything has gone to shit. My father went from acting normal to acting strange in a matter of days, where he afterwards got diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 cancer in the brain.

This is of course really bad timing, due to the corona stuff. We couldn't go visit him in the hospital, which was kind of rough, but eventually after a week he got sent home. This was very nice at first, but as time passes by i feel like I'm losing myself. He gets stranger and his memory gets worse every day, i get to do all the practical stuff like shopping, cleaning, cooking etc. I'm 19 so this is not the issue, but my aunt insists that i can't see my friends due to corona (which i understand) but she also insists i cannot see my gf of two years, which would be really pleasent at the moment. So i can't talk to my friends, my gf, i don't get to be with my mother (as they are divorced) or siblings (as they live by them selves), i don't feel like it's okay to do stuff on my own as my father will probably pass away soon.

I feel like my mother, siblings and other relatives can get a break when they go back to their own places, but I'm stuck in quarantine with my father which im constantly worried about and have to take care of. I'm honestly losing my mind not talking to anyone and having to deal with my father who can't remember shit and acts weird constantly. The only 'break' i get is when he goes to bed so I can relax knowing he is not sad or in trouble. My father is not the issue, I just feel like i can't process what the hell is going on because I constantly have to deal with my fathers sickness.

A couple of days at my moms place would be fantastic, but my aunt always come up with other ideas so I can stille take care of him, e.g. just eating at my mothers place but coming back to make sure he gets his meds. I just haven't had a single day in almost a month where i didn't have to care or be worried about my father, and i just want a day where i can think this whole thing through.

I really wanted to get this off of my chest. Thanks.",06Apr2020,2
18,"This isn't the first time I'm posting about this friend of mine, but she is going through hell right now and I don't know what to do. She lives many states away from me so honestly all I can do is remind her that I am there for her and send her my condolences but this shit is fucked up.

We were texting while I was at work and planning on calling each other tonight. When I got home I let her know that I did and I was free to call whenever but she said she won't be free for awhile. When I asked her why and if everything was okay, she said that her mother did too much heroin and stopped breathing so the cops are on their way and that her father hit her with a bat because she attempted to do CPR on her mother, so her dad hit her and said “let the dumb bitch die”. Her brother also blacked out from drinking too much. Not to mention she was high on a bunch of drugs herself through all of this.

She is now coughing blood and thinks she might pass out. She cannot text anymore, she is just texting me random numbers and letters. Bear in mind, this is just another day in the life of this girl. The cops are always at her house for one reason or another and her family is always beating her senseless. She has overdosed on tons of drugs multiple times before and through it all I have no idea how this girl is still alive but god damn, she is a trooper. She's so nice too, it absolutely breaks my heart that such a sweet girl like this has to go through this much hell. I just wish I could be there with and for her. She says that she loves me for always being there for her through everything, and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I'm the only person that ever has been.

Anyways, I'm not trying to get myself involved in any of this too much but do you think she will be okay? She's obviously very far from okay both right now and in general but I'm worried she is going to get herself killed sooner or later and I'm just at a loss. If anybody can help or knows what I should do please let me know.",06Apr2020,1

21,"Please read this whole post. I’ve tried contacting the admins through all official help channels on my main account but unfortunately haven’t gotten a response. I don’t really know where else to go from here, so I am coming to you, the people of Reddit, for help.

I am a real person with a family, hopes and dreams just like you. This situation has brought me immense sadness, stress, and anxiety, and I just want to feel peace again. I just want to focus on my family during this pandemic. Many of them are at very high risk of being affected severely by this virus, and I am so scared for them. I don’t want to be thinking about an issue on Reddit that could easily be solved during a time like this, but I have no choice. Please think about this as you consider helping me. 

This is something that only a Reddit employee can help me with. It’s something that I know they’ve helped users with before too. Unfortunately as the company has gotten bigger they have been less responsive to the issues of individual users. That’s why I am here today. If they see this as an issue of the community, something that more than 1 person cares about, I am hoping they will find it in their heart to help me. 

I am hoping that if this post gets enough attention, an admin or even a higher up like /u/spez will see it and find it in their heart to help me.

I’m keeping this post intentionally vague for privacy purposes, but it’s an issue that would take them a few minutes to fix. It would literally change the course of the rest of my and my loved ones’ entire lives for the better. 

**How you can help:**

1. Comment on this post in support and bring it as much attention as possible. Tell the admins you stand in solidarity with me and want them to help me.
2. Follow this post for as long as you can. Keep commenting every day. I will keep you all updated on the status of their response. 
3. Cross post this to any communities that would be willing to help by providing further support. 
4. If anyone knows or has any connection to an admin they can get me in contact with, please let me know.

I feel I could be in a much better place in life if I would just not give a shit about what people think about me. Everyone's opinion of me matters deeply to me, everybody from family, friends, strangers, and even people online. I hate how I am aware of all of this, but I continue to let other people opinion to control my thoughts and decisions in life. Its the stupidest thing, I love making music and art, but I refuse to post anything as I am too insecure of my own abilities.

37,"I did not expect to be making this post so soon. Of course, failure is inevitable when trying to recover. It’s a rough journey and there will always be roadblocks. I’ve experienced one of those today. And goddammit, it absolutely sucks..

Recap: I’m a 14 year old female with some (undiagnosed) mental health issues. I struggle with symptoms of depression, symptoms of binge eating disorder, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. I really want to recover so that I can live my teen years happily (and just alive).

On the first two days after post #1, I did really well actually. Yes, I snacked a bit, but it was in moderation. I felt guilty, but I’ll never be able to move forward if I don’t learn to forgive myself. So that’s what I did.

Today actually started off really well. My mind was clear and I felt pretty happy. I slept through breakfast, so I made sure to have a filling lunch. After that, my brothers and I played some basketball and lift some weights. Before I could get comfortable for long, I was called back outside to help with yard work. Honestly, I don’t mind because it’s great exercise! I played some more basketball with my family, ate a nice dinner, and watched a Spiderman movie. Overall, it was an amazing night. 

TW: Eating Disorder- Unfortunately, something kind of clicked in my mind. All of a sudden, I had this huge urge to just eat. I tried to fill up with 3 glasses of water and some gum, but it was no use. It was like someone was talking to me and telling me to eat because I would never be skinny enough anyway. It was so petty of me, but I caved in. I ate 5 cookies, an ice cream bar, and a cheese stick. Definitely no where near my worst binge, but it really stings now. I feel the same sting after each time I binge, yet my mind somehow forgets about it every time it’s in a binge mindset.

TW: Self-harm- Anyway, one thing led to another, and I ended I ended up cutting a bit on my stomach. I was around 3 weeks clean (not quite sure since I don’t keep count). They are very small and not deep at all, but a cut is a cut. And I feel guilty as hell. I just wanted to see the blood and feel the pain. But all I feel is stupid.

Anyway, I thought I would just update my road to recovery and vent at the same time. I’m going to try harder tomorrow. Fight the urges of both food and self-harm. I’m really trying to stay strong for myself and the people that I love. I want to be better and feel like how I do when I make progress. Now it’s time for me to forgive myself because that is the first step to moving along.

I hope you are having an amazing day or night. I love all of you, so if you need to vent or just want a friend, feel free to comment/message me! Please, if you have any advice for me, comment. It always means the world to me.",06Apr2020,1

45,"Eve decided to eat the fruit on her own, it was a unilateral choice on her part.

Then Adam had a choice to make: whether to eat what his wife had already eaten.

He chose to trust his wife rather than listen to God.

So what comes next in this story?  That's the beginning of a story, how does it proceed?

It says that they had two sons together, who grew up, and their oldest son slew their next oldest son.  Was that because Adam trusted his wife instead of listen to God?  Or was it because Cain chose to murder Abel?  Or are those two things like different sides of the same coin?  Did murder enter the world because Adam trusted his wife instead of listen to God?  Or was Adam ignoring God the same as murder entering the world?

And if Eve's choice, and Adam's choice, and Cain's choice, were all free and voluntary, then how could any of them also have been influenced by someone or something preceding their choice?  The definition of choice precludes any influence from anywhere outside themselves, so that Eve, Adam, and Cain all made valid choices.

But then there's Satan, who tricks Eve into making her decision.  So Eve really didn't make a choice, not a totally free and voluntary choice, she had been deliberately deceived by the Accuser himself, who Christ later calls ""The Father of LIES"".

So Eve's choice was plausibly not completely voluntary.  But Adam's?  Cain's?  Were either of these men relieved of their culpability, due to something like their having been deliberately deceived?  Not at all.  They both made the wrong choice free and clear.",06Apr2020,1

A full bred German Shepard my mom paid $300 for. Since the day we got it as a puppy it’s been nothing but trouble. My parents tried raising it in a loving household, playing with it, teaching it, caring for it, but to no avail. It’s killed 4 of our cats, several of our Chickens, killed another baby German Shepard puppy we bought, it attacked our neighbors dog almost killing it, and I’m pretty sure it killed and ate my wonderful little chihuahua I’ve had for 16 years tonight.

First I’ll wait a full couple days. I’ll take the dog out to the middle of the desert when my parents go to work and shoot it in its head. I’ll bury it in a shallow grave so my dad doesn’t find it, and that will be the end of it.

I believe it below me to hold grudges against animals. This dog certainly won’t hold any grudges against me by the time it’s dead. And as much as it deserves to suffer, I’m going to kill it quickly because Im sure I’ll have other things to do that day.

They told him he had to stay home for two weeks and that he had to use up all of his vacation time before they would let him take paid sick leave, which the US government covers. 

This is so fucking shitty that they want us to burn through our vacation time because they don’t want us to use paid sick leave that they don’t even have to pay for.  I don’t even know if this is legal. 

So then, they end up telling him he can come back but he has to get tested first. So, he sees a doctor and pays $250 to get tested. He told me they gave him results within the same hour of his visit, WHICH MEANS THEY DIDN’T FUCKING TEST HIM FOR COVID19. 🤦🏻‍♂️ 

So his results come back negative for whatever the fuck they tested him for, and my incredibly stupid employer says he can come back if he wears a mask and gloves. 

What. The. Fuck. He was never tested for the virus and they let him come back anyway. Meanwhile, two other sick staff were never tested and never told to stay home.

I can’t help but judge in my mind that a lot of the “gangsters” or “thugs” I see around are all block, and all the local hit and runs or robberies are usually black people. Again, I don’t intend to be racist.

It’s my first big relationship about to hit a year and three months. I have great sex with her and she is the only one I think about in any scenario like who I want my wife to be, my future etc. but I still am looking at porn and thinking about other women sexually. I’ve been looking at porn since I was 12. I have always been really sexual. Like always watching porn and always doing something you know? My gf and I actually had a talk around 9 months in our relationship she found out I watched porn and HATED it and I completely get why. It almost broke us up. I agree with her and I agreed I would stop. With lots of control I did stop for like 10 something days and then I broke. And I felt guilty then since I already broke once it was easier to break again and so on and now I’m back to my old self. I am so unhappy with myself like why do I do it?? I am so mad at myself. It’s like I’m someone else when I’m horny! I also more than I ever had before my gf and I’s talk, am afraid of her cheating. She isn’t like that at all but I find every way I can to convince myself that she is and they make no sense but I just keep telling myself she is so it is making sense to me. I just feel such a pull.

“Go get therapy”

I have, and I’ve been getting therapy for four years since I have “major depressive disorder”, ever since then, I’ve been going to multiple therapists and I can only remember 3 of them, all of them telling me useless platitudes and shit that I can get online, they asked me the literal same question every week

“How’s school?”

“Made any friends?”

“How are you feeling today?” 


Here’s a tip if you are a depressed male and want to talk about your feelings: DONT FUCKING DO IT, I fucked up and let my feelings out, I was at the doctors office for a normal checkup like a physical and the doctor pressured me and made me admit that I was having negative thoughts since he looked at my past medical records through his computer, he tried to prescribe me some pills and he wasn’t even a therapist as far as I know, just a doctor, I refused and he convinced my parents to sign away my rights to an mental hospital and I was outpatient there for a week. It was the shittiest week of my life and actually made me want to blow my fucking brains out. nothing has gotten better while my parents sent thousands of dollars down the drain over the years, they probably fucked up their insurance too.

What’s funny about this too was that I started therapy around middle school after I was getting jumped and mocked by my peers almost everyday, and my parents are the ones that have to pay for my pain and suffering that was caused by other people.


What’s the use of trying to be normal, when you leave in a society that treats you as if you weren’t normal?

“Just get a hobby”

I have hobbies like planes, computers, and discussing some of my favorite videogame series and tried to meet people with similar hobbies, for some reason, when I’m around they suddenly don’t like said hobby anymore.

“Just work hard”

And I have, Ive been working hard my whole life to makeup for my lack of physical attributes, I’m even trying to become either a computer engineer or an engineer dealing with aircraft so I worked my ass off and my Engineering teacher awarded me with some “NOCTI” paper that makes it easier to become an engineer, it’s practically rendered useless by my face since people actively avoid me and give me faces of disgust 

“Just be a nice person”
I have and I’ve been taken advantage of for it mainly by women

**Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy**

I have just one question, why am I not allowed to hate the people that hate me?

Why should I keep seeking for the wrong treatment for my problems, I wasn’t always this way, why should I keep fighting and potential mental illnesses I have, why should I not embrace it, why should I not let it soothe and let it guide me? Besides, they made me this way

68," About 10 years ago my life as I knew it changed. I was set to get married but the person had other ideas and just like that all my plans and everything was flushed down the toilet on the eve of my 30s. I fell into a depression then to rub it in I lost my job. This is right when Minecraft came out. Since I had no job and no wife and nothing else going on I joined the alpha testing and via reddit found one of the earlier Minecraft communities being organized and joined in. It was great at first. They set up this thing called mumble and there were always people around to chat with and the game was engaging and for the first time in years since I had graduated college it felt like there were friends around.

The server blew up. We had thousands of users join in 2010/2011 and the server had to reorganize itself from a loose confederation of interested Minecraft players into a student government of sorts. At first I wasn't part of the head administrators team but after some internal shuffling I was brought on as one of 5 head administrators. Around this time I was building a small city and near buy another player was making something cool. Dude joined mumble and everything seemed fine. We were around the same age and were both playing the same video game and became friends on the internet. Everything seemed cool.

The community really started to ramp up. We had a pretend war with a ""griefing"" team (something about ice cream lol) that brought a ton of attention to our servers. This guy helped us moderate the ""attacks"" and roll back the damage and keep the server ticking. I sponsored him into the mod team then he became one of the admins. People started having off-server and off-mumble video chats on some camera site I can't remember the name of. Fine whatever. This but this is also when people started to have interpersonal problems on the server that ended up leveraging the free resources to mediate in the Admin team. It wasn't particularly what I wanted to do but our system seemed to be working and it was still more fun than not.

Then the first ""sob"" story happened. I should have been aware of this as I've dealt with sob story types in my life but my guard was down. This was a video game. People were having fun. But this guy lost all his money and his job too I guess and was getting evicted. We were planning on having a fund raiser event anyway and outside of my control someone decided it would be good to help one of our own in a tough time. We ended up handing this guy well over a thousand dollars. The next week the first pretty shocking event happened that I learned about. Dude met up with a local minor that he met on Reddit for crippling alcoholics or something, got wasted then rode a bike out to this persons house and there was an entire embarrassing situation that I mostly blocked out of my head. It ended with this guy bloody on camera being locked out of this kids house or something. Seriously I repressed this incident in my own head. Who knows what really happened. All this presumably paid for by the good intentions and fund raising of my community.

Fine ok whatever. Things went on mostly as normal. There were a few months of calm but in this time the demographics of the server really changed. All of a sudden there were a large amount of young women joining the server . This is right when the complaints started coming in. Dude made one lady ghost the chats apparently. Another one apparently getting caught up in the moment with other late teens/20 somethings went topless on a video chat and sure enough some 40 something year old man was there and got screen captures of this or something. I can't prove exactly what happened here but something not right. Then the DM screen caps came in.

Great. This guy is creepy af to these kids and I let him in.

When it became time to ban this guy in the truest form of an alcoholic everything became a conspiracy against them personally who does no wrong. Paragraphs and paragraphs of text were generated. Lines were being drawn in the sand. This was it my fun innocent time playing blocks and getting stoned was coming apart and this fucking guy was trying as hard as he could to tear it down on his way out. I had to write several paragraphs detailing this and explaining the ban the the people who weren't fully clued into the extent of the problem. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to write and post knowing that someone who was an adult had to read this but we needed him out and out of contact with the people who were trusting me and the other people in the server to do what they can to keep them safe. This killed it for me, I became really bitter with the game and with the community drama and over the course of the next month or so ended up winding down my involvement and rejoining real life. The connections I made on the server actually helped me transition my old career into becoming an actual systems administrator. I also met my current wife in 2013 at this time too. I never really talk about how intense the Minecraft thing got even though she knows I still play it on single player mode.

This guys next steps? He set up a child friendly Disney themed minecraft server to lure loads of children. The server became big and he was probably exposed to thousands of potential targets. When you look at his profile online he still participates in really questionable communities making questionable comments.

I’m honestly flattered because he’s a talented artist and the portrait looks amazing, but it was a little weird too.

I suffer from depression and anxiety, not uncommon, however these are exacerbated by my aspergers syndrome and tourettes which manifests in physical ""ticks"" and a really nasty stutter which all comes together to give me downright rock bottom self esteem. Well, more like self hatred. 

I was on antidepressants for a long time, however they saw such success that my doctor decided to put me on to something stronger, to swap my medication over from one drug to another. This did NOT go well. I should've asked them to switch it back earlier but tbh, I fell into a lethargic rut and couldn't get out of it. I discovered it was these new meds that were making me feel this way and I stopped taking them, i know i should've gone back to the doctor but that would've been a 3.5 hour drive and again, lethargic. 

Well, my doctor called me last week and asked about my progress, I laid it all out for him, apologized for not contacting him earlier and he immediately switched me back to my old meds. A few days later my new script arrived in the mail and I took it to the pharmacy.

86,"5 days ago, I went out to get supplies to treat my kitten who is 4-5mo, my country is on lockdown so it was hard to find anything but I landed at a chemist shop and they were trying to feed milk to a day old kitten, I asked around and they said that they have been trying to figure out what to do with the little guy, they found it crying on-roadside and it has been lying around since a few hours, I figured the mother kitten has dropped it maybe so I asked them if they could take care of the baby, they said they don't know what to do honestly and I didn't either but I live alone and I didn't want it to die so I asked them to look out for its the mother if she comes back they can inform me and took it home with me. (I live about half a mile away from them)  


The first few nights were very rough and I even contacted those guys to update me on the situation, they said no idea about mother kitten so I kept the baby fed and warm. (Note: I am pretty broke freelancer artist who is trying to work but the lockdown situation has made things pretty bad for me).  
I couldn't find KMR so I did some searching and found 24hour things and it was working kind of, the poop was fine, no diarrhea and the kitten was meowing and sleeping and crying a lot because of weaning so I let it do it on my finger so it doesn't feel bad.

Anyways so my other Kitten(4mo) kept its distance and didn't hurt the baby kitten, till two days back when he sat near him and watched him over. I thought it is harmless but I kept them separate, I hadn't slept much during the last 5 days because I had to feed the kitten every two hours so I kept an eye on him as well. He picked up the baby kitten twice and I made sure it doesn't happen again, last night I slept after feeding and woke up with kitten on my bedside, I didn't know what is happening but it wasn't crying just sleeping. It was alive, and I tried to feed again, but nothing...I opened it's mouth to check if anything is wrong and I could see the tongue was folded touching the top of mouth... I got scared and realized that maybe I have fucked up here. And I am sorry, I really am. And then I waited for a few moments and it took a few breaths and passed away.  


I feel horrible. I don't know what to say my other kitten, it is just one fuck up from me and its done. I was pretty much textbook, I have saved pups before but this... it feels bad. It sucks. I thought I could help but honestly, I feel helpless.  I didn't know who else to talk to, people just say you are doing good and karma and blah blah but it doesn't help. And I feel tired.

87,"I will use all tactics to convince you about UBI.

Argument of authority: I'm a clever dude, and I studied science. 

The social argument (renowned peers fighting for UBI):

- Andrew Yang, the presidential candidate ([here are his arguments and rebuttals](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/)
- Milton Friedman (Nobel laureate): [5 great arguments](https://link.medium.com/frEVk4hRs5)
- ""Martin Luther King proposed a guaranteed income to promote justice and equality""
- [Here is a list of all famous proponents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_advocates_of_basic_income)

My arguments :

1) We end misery, once and for all
2) We get rid of desperate prostitution
3) We increase wages, by removing the artificial demand on the job market
4) We can walk out from a job as soon as the ""hierarchy"" is disrespectful
5) People would be less risk-averse about starting a business, volunteering or experimenting
6) The people would be free, to contribute where and when they see fit. it means less pollution, and less overproduction. It is crucial that we stop overproduction.
7) People could work under the hourly minimum wage, as UBI allows, so that the work is less competitive and less tiresome, for those who prefer it like so.
8) This is what God would want : ""It's not enough to bear fruit, we must share that fruit with others so they can be blessed and impacted by the Kingdom of God"" -- Paul
9) We can automate everything in sight, without feeling guilty.
10) Everyone will be free and happy, relaxed and respected (even the worst jobs), as any job becomes honourable.

Pathos argument:

I will let the French philosoph Rousseau speak famously: ""*The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying, This is mine, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not anyone have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, ""Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.*""

Time and place argument (kairos): We have to push UBI during the coronavirus. Never let a crisis go to waste. People want to work from home, they want to be free from the hierarchy bullshit. We want to be free, and we must act in the coming days. Collect my ideas, unless you find better, and then spread the word on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram. Google for major players, the influencers, and ask their help. Go to relevant discussion boards, and push the idea. Now or never.

Fight for UBI, everyday, until it is established!

It always makes me sob and feel like the second try. I don't understand why I feel that a previous marriage makes me not good enough. Like she was the one and he chose me just because he didn't want to be alone. I know that it's all untrue but it doesn't help me feel better.

We have talked about potential marriage and I always freak out. Don't get me wrong, I would love to marry this wonderful man, but I just get scared that for him it won't be as big as it will be for me, because he already went through it one time. It's like with first kiss, you only have it once. Yes, you kiss all of your partners the first time, but it just isn't the first kiss. It is special, but it's different. And with marriage I can't help but feel that it won't be as magical as the first time. I have tried to formulate in my mind what bothers me the most and I think it's the ceremony. Just that. The organizing, celebration. I'm not afraid and don't feel bad about the potential marriage itself.

Neither of us can turn back time and it's not needed, because I fell in love with the man that he has become after the divorce. He has gone through a lot while trying to find himself and a way to a healthy relationship. We have talked about it but I know that it's hard for him to listen and see all my emotions. My friends are great but they just don't get me. They try to support me, but I'm too heavy emotionally to support.

I need some advice on self help or someone who has gone through something like this. I just need someone who'll understand because on days like these I don't understand myself even.",06Apr2020,1
96,"On the 21st of March I noticed I felt like I couldn’t really catch my breath while I was at work. I do stay active at work, but nothing even remotely heavy. Nothing that has ever made me feel even slightly out of breath, let alone gasping for air. 

Thought that was weird but didn’t think too much into it. Then the next day, similar to how a flu hits you, I was REALLY sick. Felt exhausted, dry cough, stuffy nose, had diarrhea. I have a pretty good immune system so even when I manage to catch the seasonal flu, it never lasts longer than 3 days and is relatively mild for me, so I figured I’d gotten the flu and it would be done and over with in a couple days. 

For the first week it just felt like what I imagined most people experience the flu as. I developed a low grade fever, which was very abnormal for me. I haven’t had a fever since I was a kid. I just don’t get sick. Then I started getting chills. Spent all day and all night sleeping. After around 5 days I was feeling pretty good. My cough was dry but not terrible, not debilitating in any way. Felt like I was on the upward mend. Had more energy.  

Then the next day something took a turn for the worse. The next day I felt like I got hit by a truck. I couldn’t breathe. There’s just no other way to describe it. I went to do my laundry and was gasping for air just from lifting my clothes from the floor and into the hamper. I had to stop and gasp for air for several minutes once I lifted all the laundry into the washer. I started noticing I couldn’t breathe when I walked up the steps. It was like I just couldn’t get enough air in. I didn’t feel like my lungs were too full of gunk or anything. Just felt like every time I took a breath, there wasn’t enough oxygen coming in anymore. Started noticing I couldn’t breathe through the steam in the shower anymore. Started gasping for breath while I was laying in bed, doing absolutely nothing. My fever shot up to the highest it’d been since I was sick. 

That lasted for a few days. Then my cough started getting wet, and I worried I was developing pneumonia. 

Slowly, over the following days, I started feeling like I could catch my breath again. But I didn’t risk it. I did nothing but lay in bed all day even when I was awake. My fever started coming on and off throughout the day, my cough started getting more infrequent. I started to feel a lot better around April 1st. My fever broke for good the following day. My roommate had the same symptoms on the same exact timeline, and managed to convince his doctor to let him get tested for Coronavirus. He got the results back today. Positive.

I still have a cough but I can breathe easily now. I’m 22, I’m active, I eat healthier than literally anyone else I know, I consume lots of fermented foods, I stay hydrated regularly. I NEVER get sick. And this thing knocked me on my ass. 

Seriously, everyone, if you think you’re invincible against this: you’re not. 

Be careful. Don’t leave your house unless you need to and when you do, take precautions. Because if I’m 22 and experienced it like this, imagine how devastating it’ll be for your 60 year old mother or your 80 year old grandparent. Neither me or my roommate know how we caught it or when or where. Be on high alert and STAY IN YOUR HOUSE.",06Apr2020,2

102,"So,after trying to come up with a good way to start this thread,I think I'm just going to start talking,because the more I think about it,the more frustrated and irritated I get.(Btw. I'm not a native speaker so if there are  any grammar mistakes or anything,I apologize in advance)  


So ( has already written ''so'' twice)   
I'm 18 and I've been going to therapy (I mean rn during corona virus I ain't been going anywhere)  
and am being treated for depression and anxiety. Now..for the longest time, I've actually been able to identify with those terms,especially since I've had something trouble me for a couple of years now,but the more I think about my symptoms or maybe even a lack of specific symptoms,the more I think about the common tendency for members of today's society to self-diagnose,the more I've started to doubt it.  
I would say that I am generally quite unhappy in life,and I don't have the motivation for basic things.  
I don't want to go out,and haven't been enthusiastic about going out for a couple of years now,since **I generally don't really see a point in going out**,it's not fun,it doesn't do anything for me and if I ever do get excited,it doesn't last longer than maybe 2 days.  
**But that's the thing**,that's the thing with most  things in my life.**This ability to get excited about stuff,the ability to experience  emotions** like happiness,is something that I don't necessarily see in other people who suffer from clinical depression**.I can get up,do my bed,cook breakfast,even get excited about that as well.But that's also about it.**  
Yet at the same time I experience the inability to actually stay motivated,**( I mean a lot of people have the same ''issue''**) stay in that mood for longer than a few hours,at most even 2-3 days.**Everything gets boring after a while**,and what was once exciting ( and yes I know I've repeated the word exciting more than I maybe should've)..at some point  just isn't anymore.  
**I wouldn't say I experience emptiness,or numbness**,I don't feel like I'm a burden,if anything I feel annoying,but that's more of a fact than a matter of self conciousness or an illness like depression.I've been experiencing some ''bad thoughts'' (dunno just feels weird writing it out like that for everyone to see,but I hope u'll get what I mean).There are things in my life that are making me feel worse ,or that probably caused all of this and that are making me want to escape everything because I can't stand myself and my mind **(WAY OF THINKING)** anymore.  
I am usually just angry,irritable,defensive,refuse to eat despite being hungry,refuse to go hang out despite wanting to and so on..  
After talking to my therapist,she concluded that I have strong depression symptoms but despite her being a ''professional'',I'm just not warm with it (can u say it like that).She also said I have anxiety,but I don't experience panic attacks,anxiety attacks,I wouldn't say I worry a lot,altough I do overthink to the point where my mind and my thoughts completely consume me and control my decisions,and not in a positive way obviously.I procrastinate (like most people on reddit),I procrastinate eating,making decisions,moving from one point to the other (both points being different sides of my bed),watching videos,tv,homework,school.If I experience anxiety,it usually manifest itself as social anxiety,which is also one of the main procrastination causes.  
In general,I just experience (fuck there we go again) very low mood moments that make me feel hopeless,nothing matters,everyone sucks,everyone actually kind of gets me but nobody really understands..and they don't have to...nobody can actually look into my brain and tell me what's wrong,not even my therapist,like I've stupidly thought.I switch from feeling hopeful for a few hours or at times minutes,to hopeless and su\*\*al.  
I could write for hours about what actually troubles me,what my thought process is actually made up of,where or what it leads to,but I feel like this thread is already too long,I feel like I haven't really gotten my point,my problem across,despite repeating myself,and this issue with self-expression and poor wording is probably the reason why my therapist couldn't start much more with me and my diagnosis anyways.  
I dunno,I just want someone to give me advice or comment something so I can have someone else's perspective on this (mess).

I passed all of my exams, I got my driver's licence on my first attempt, I got a new job, I am as active as I have ever been, I made new amazing friends, my finances look good but at the end of the day I'm just not feeling any happiness.
I feel tired, nothing I have accomplished can fill the void I feel inside of me. I was so looking forward to driving now I don't care anymore. I love hiking, but just coming back to my life makes me miserable.

I don't know what to change anymore. I always told myself that if I would meet new friends, if  I managed to change to job that I would actually enjoy, then I would finally see light at the end of the tunnel. 

But it just didn't work out that way . At the end of the day, I miss having a partner, I long for a life I don't have. I keep busy as much as possible to stop myself from thinking about it, but on my quiet times I still feel so tired, lonely and sad, the feeling won't go away. My interactions with the world around me feel fake, meaningless.

126,"Hear me out please. I know cheating is horrible and I am extremely reluctant to even post this question because I know I most likely will get judged and hated but I seriously need advice.

I feel like I need to give background information on our relationship because to me that's what makes the situation so difficult (sorry, if it is too long just skip to the \*\*\*marked paragraph). So me and my girlfriend (let's call her 'Marie') have been officially dating for 1.5 months now, however, the months leading up to us getting together we were very ""on and off"" - kind of like unofficially dating already or at least acting like it. We met very unconventionally in September 2019 because we both were in an inpatient psych ward for a while. Both of our unstable mental health conditions were partial reasons for us not being more serious beforehand. I am bipolar (got the diagnosis just last year, so still adjusting) and she had different problems, mainly depression though. We got very close very fast because we saw and supported each other in situations you wouldn't ""normally"" when meeting and getting to know someone through uni or work etc. I started crushing on her very early on and lightly started pursuing her although I'm not a very direct person.

For anyone who is not familiar with bipolar disorder - basically instead of unipolar depression where you can have ""normal"" phases and depressive episodes, with bipolar depression you have normal, depressive, and (hypo-)manic episodes which go in the opposite direction of depressive eps. When I'm hypomanic, I am mostly in a good mood, I have loads of energy, sleep less, feel more confident and talkative, and my libido skyrockets.

The reason why this is relevant is because after my initial depression (the reason I was inpatient) my mood stabilized and I didn't have any major depressive episodes during the time of getting to know Marie. On the contrary, in November I started becoming hypomanic again (I would now say in hindsight, it is very hard to tell when it starts because it's not as obvious as the depression). I would go on tinder dates to get my mind of her, thinking she didn't like me that way. In hindsight I'm aware that that could have sent mixed signals but, well, that was just the way that I had learnt to deal with my feelings and heightened libido since mid 2019.

Anyways, December comes around and Marie and I end up sharing a kiss one evening. I had kind of confessed that I like her but the next day she tells me that she is unsure if she has feelings for me too or if she just needs emotional closeness because of her depression. She says it would be more wise to wait for her mental health to get better so she doesn't unfairly give me hope. She then said she wanted to just be platonic friends and that I should continue going on tinder dates etc.

I was pretty hurt. A week or so later I was scheduled to go out to a club with a mutual friend of Marie and I but while pregaming we played a drinking game and in the spur of the moment ended up hooking up. I still don't really know why that happened, I don't like her that way at all - I think it was a mixture of needing validation because of the rejection and the alcohol. I didn't tell Marie about it because deep down I knew she would have probably been upset. I thought me feeling guilty was gonna pass, however, two days later, Marie and I ended up actually hooking up. She, I guess, changed her mind about waiting and told me afterwards that she would appreciate if I wouldn't sleep with other people from then on. We weren't dating but kind of exclusive.

I felt pretty shitty about what had happened with the friend and, combined with other stuff that happened, it led to me actually having to go back to the psych ward. The week before that and the first week I was there I was a wreck and actually stopped texting my friends, Marie included. When in January I reached out and apologized I was relieved that she understood. However, she confessed to me that after I completely cut off the contact for 2 weeks she actually ended up kissing 3 different people, some that she met in that time and one that she knew from before. She also said she was curious about potentially sleeping with 2 of the people and asked how I felt about it. I always knew I couldn't have an open relationship so I told her she had to figure that one out for herself but in the end I said that if she just wanted to try it out (she is less ""experienced"" and felt like she needed to explore more) she should and maybe could let me know then. The day after I decided I should also be honest with her about what had happened with our mutual friend.

When I told her she was shocked, extremely disappointed, and immediately wanted me to leave. She said I (and the friend) had lied to her by not saying anything and couldn't believe how we could do that to her. I was confused since it was before we were even exclusive (never mind dating) but she was adamant, blocked me and cut off all contact for a while. Over the next weeks I wrote her two letters, trying to explain my point of view and then decided to wait it out for a bit. February came around and I sent her a message (she had unblocked me) about a concert that she had gifted me a ticket to for my birthday. She responded and we connected again, her starting to ""forgive"" me for what has happened. Then end of February we started dating officially.

\*\*\*Second week of March I went on a vacation back to the states where I used to study to visit my sister and old college friends. One night I stayed over at a friend's house. He liked me back in my freshman year and we always used to joke about it since I came out as bisexual at the end of that year and got into a relationship with a girl which he saw as the ultimate rejection. We ended up drinking and sleeping together. Looking back now it is very surreal since I don't know what exactly made me do it. I partially think I could have been a bit hypomanic again but I definitely don't want to blame this on my disorder since I still make decisions for myself. This hook up has absolutely no romantic weight because I am sure that I cannot develop feelings for guys - I was merely curious what it would be like to sleep with one (it was my first time essentially) and it was a situation in which I knew I could ""trust"" the guy since I have known him for so long. For me it was also definitely a ""one time thing"", I got that curiosity out of my system and that's it.

The weight of what I had done sank in a few days later while I was still in the states. I felt awful, guilty, and regretted having done it. It reminded me a lot of the terrible feeling I felt when I had told Marie about the mutual friend. When I returned from the trip, I had to self-quarantine because of COVID-19 but I also fell into a depressive slump that lasted around a week. Marie reached out but I didn't respond until a week after I had returned. When I texted she immediately came over to see me and told me I should talk to her about what was troubling me. She even said ""you can tell me anything that is weighing you down, even if you had hooked up with someone else or something"" - it caught me completely off guard and I told her no, it was just a normal depressive ep.

Since then I haven't seen her in person because of the quarantine. We have skyped a lot though after my mood improved again. Now that I am back to a normal frame of mind I have spend a lot of time thinking about what I should do. I really do love her and don't want to lose her (even though I know you will probably ask, why did you cheat on her then) but I know the right thing to do would be to tell her and let her decide if she can forgive me or not. The only thing that made me reconsider was something she told me a while back: We have had a few problems with her not being able to get the image of me and our mutual friend out of her head - she is very insecure, fearing I still think about her and is jealous/hurt every time she pictures it. Several friends told me that they wouldn't have told Marie in my position since we were not dating at the time. When I asked Marie if she would have preferred to have never found out, she thought about it and said yes. If it was just that one time, and since she theoretically knows I don't like our mutual friend romantically, she would have preferred I would not have told her.

I suppose my question is now: what would you do if you were in my position? My quarantine ends in 2 days and then I will see her. Should I tell her?

tl;dr I cheated on my girlfriend and am unsure if I should tell her considering our backstory",06Apr2020,0

I figured since we all live in the same home, and my other roommate (we’ll call him N) is a direct coworker of mine, we’d be quarantined, as we should be. But no, he shrugged it off saying “that’s a stretch, go ahead and come in”. This absolutely infuriated me. He’s bending the rules based on what suits him. He’s quarantined other people on the department for much much less and yet he wasn’t listening to me. I get it we do an important job, but isn’t our job to keep people safe? This isn’t that. So I think okay then, I’ll fake symptoms. I want to protect these people and do my part in this. Because let’s say I am a carrier. I share space with 14 other people for 24 hours at a time. Im exposing them, and to be completely honest a lot of them are older and have shotty health as it is. I can’t live with being responsible for someone dying of a disease I knew i was probably carrying. I faked a temp with pictures, lied about body aches. Nothing. I write this as I sit at the work breakfast table. Am I being unreasonable? Or do they really just not care? I feel like I’m a piece of shit either way you slice it.",06Apr2020,2

I’ve been watching old disney shows and trying to remember what it feels like to be a kid again, as a way to visit the past and the feeling of being ok. I miss the thrill of sneaking into the next room over, tiptoeing through the dark, switching on the lamp, turning on the tv and watching the shows and old disney original movies that would play late at night and early into the morning. That was when I felt special, like I was the only one awake and dreaming. I’d stay up until 3am and still be so full of life the next day. I was able to go out and feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, I remembered the lines to my favorite shows and made my friends act it out with me, using the playground as a set. I was shy, but I was an actress and in those moments anything was possible. 

     Now at the age of 21 I struggle to stay up past 11:00, I wake up some days wishing I hadn’t, and the sun doesn’t feel as warm as it used to. I still manage to dream a lot, but nowadays they just make me sad. The possibilities of it all seem to be just thoughts and I struggle to remember what it feels like to really have something to say. Now I live as a contradiction wanting to be nothing and longing to be something. Hoping someday I will be. I’ve been staying up at night and watching old disney shows to remember what it feels like, to remember why I want it, and why I still dream. I want to find that girl again, that loved the sun and acting out her favorite shows. The girl with an imagination that could create an entire world. 
      I’m going to find that girl again and I’m going to make her proud",06Apr2020,1
129,"Hey. I’m a 39F and have a 10F daughter. A bit of backstory...I have 5 autoimmune diseases, as well as small fiber neuropathy, plantar fasciitis, and tendinitis in both feet/ankles, carpel tunnel in both wrists, spinal issues from top to bottom, and severe anxiety and moderate depression. I was diagnosed with most of this in March 2017 after several years of being in pain and nothing really helping (epidural steroid injections, PT, OT, Pain Pump Implant). It became too difficult and painful for me to continue working and I went on Long Term Disability in August 2017 (I was just approved for SSDI this past week also). It devastated me to have this happen. I hate that I couldn’t do as much with my daughter anymore (at least physical and active stuff) because of the pain and how horrible I feel from the medications I have to take. My daughter has been very understanding, helpful, and loving throughout it all. She’s a very empathetic little girl. What I also hate is that she worries about me constantly. She told me when she would be in class she would be worrying if I was ok home alone. That breaks my heart. My daughter shouldn’t have to feel that way at all. She doesn’t need the stress and anxiety about my disabilities. I’ve talked to her about it many many times and told her not to worry so much. But she still does. Well today she saw me fall for the first time and she went into a complete panic attack! I’m proud of her for immediately coming to me and asking if she needed to call 911. Thankfully it wasn’t bad enough for a 911 call! I told her not to call 911 and just to stay with me. How it happened: I was walking from my bedroom to the kitchen and my 14 year old 90% blind miniature poodle got under my feet and tripped me up and I fell straight forward and landed on my front side and my face onto the carpet and slid a little! It hurt so so bad and scared the crap out of me so I was bawling my eyes out! She immediately started screaming and crying, like I said asked if she should call 911. She told me not to move at all and she wanted to call someone for help! I told her to call my mom and dad. They live 60 miles away, but I knew my injuries didn’t warrant an ambulance ride to the hospital, I would be ok, and my parents would be able to help calm us down. She called them and I told my mom what happened while I was still laying on the floor with my face/forehead on the floor. I felt my knees and right elbow stinging (I have mild carpet burn on both knees and pretty bad carpet burn on my right elbow). I felt pain in my neck and head. My knees were already swollen and hurting from my autoimmune flare up that I’m currently in and now they hurt much worse. My mom tried to calm my daughter down and tell her what to do to help me get to my bed, get me ice packs, antiseptic spray and ointment. She was having so much anxiety she couldn’t stop crying and said she couldn’t move to do anything. Just sheer panic mode! I forced myself to stop crying because I didn’t want to make it worse. I calmed myself down and I told her I was ok and needed her help with those things. And told her how proud I am of her for her immediate help and quick thinking! I have fallen before, never on my front side and face, but she’s never seen me fall! The first time I saw my mom fall I reacted the same way she did and I was in my late 20’s! So I know exactly how she was feeling! I was able to sit up and she came over and hugged me so tight! I comforted her to help her calm down. I very carefully got up and she helped me lay down in bed. Got me the ice packs and stuff to clean up my knees and elbow. And after about 20 minutes of sitting with me and me assuring her I was ok, she finally calmed down. I’m laying here with my entire body hurting from the jolt of the fall and from the pain and inflammation I already have because of the auto diseases. I’ve taken my medications for pain and it has subsided slightly. But what still hurts is my heart. It breaks my heart that my daughter had to witness that! For her to feel the way she felt in that moment watching her momma fall! I hate it! I know I’ll have these autoimmune diseases for the rest of my life and I don’t want her to have to take care of me at such a young age or as she’s growing older! I don’t want to be a burden to her. I’m supposed to be able to take care of her and go do fun things and run and play with her! Not be in pain and exhausted all the time! Don’t worry, I’m most definitely still able to care for my daughter very well despite my conditions and she always tells me what an awesome momma I am! I will ALWAYS take care of my daughter as she is my #1 priority! I so desperately want my life back before my body and immune system decided to turn on me! Oh and not to mention me being at a high risk for the Covid-19! We are in lockdown and have to be extra careful because of my immune system being so compromised! Anyways, I’m sorry for the long post. I needed to get this off my heart and maybe get some comfort and kind words. Reassurance maybe. My parents prayed for me and her over the phone. And she and I prayed together. I just feel so bad for her having to experience that. Again, if this isn’t the right place to post this I’m sorry and let me know of where I should post something like this in the future. I’m praying for everyone daily to be safe and healthy during this pandemic! God bless you all!",06Apr2020,1
130,"My states unemployment keeps telling me I voluntarily quit my job. I did not. I was laid off due to COVID-19, like everyone else. I’m a college student struggling to take care of myself, my significant other, and two cats. I have zero means of transportation (no car) and zero income.

I keep trying to call unemployment, but they won’t put me on hold. I’ve called them 36 times today. An automated voice continuously tells me that all employees are busy, to check their website, and immediately hangs up on me. I’ve been on hold with my HR for 10 minutes hoping that maybe they can help me, because no one I know knows what to do.

131,"I’ve had a lot of time to think during the past few weeks in quarantine, and I feel more alone now than ever. I decided I have a story to tell and since I have no one to tell in real life, I’ll share with you all here.

Growing up was kind of tough because we were definitely not well-off. I wouldn’t say we were dirt poor, but we were definitely close to it. My mom worked really hard and her job and she provided most of the income. My father was a self-employed gunsmith; extremely smart but had issues far beyond what I could fathom as a child. I won’t speculate too much, but I will say I believe he suffered greatly from untreated bipolar disorder and likely a myriad of other mental illnesses. My mother brought home the bulk of our income, and he’d blow it all on gambling and cigarettes.

There’s a large age difference between my sisters and I, and I never understood why they were never home growing up. I came to later find out that they were working and likely staying home as much as possible to prevent my dad from taking their money. He had a habit of opening credit cards in my sisters names and maxing out the card with no intentions of paying it off. I know my sisters often gave him money and received nothing but a terrible credit score and trust issues in return. I feel badly for them, it took a long time to get their lives back to normal. They were only in their early twenties at the time. 

I went to grade school knowing my family was different and knowing I didn’t fit in with the crowd around me. I had friends, but I felt different. I could never invite friends over my house because it was always filthy. My mom did her best at cleaning and making sure it wasn’t a mess, but it didn’t matter. Things were falling apart and not getting fixed. We had mice, and mice droppings everywhere. We didn’t have much, and the things we did have weren’t anything to write home about. I remember feeling isolated and lonely... not much different than I feel today.

My mom eventually divorced my dad. I remember thinking it was the end of the world, like every nine-year-old would. My mom quickly found a boyfriend and we moved in with him. I didn’t like him, not because he was a bad person but because I missed my dad and I didn’t want to think he could replace him. He never tried. My moms boyfriend was a good man but I never gave him the chance. I wanted my mom and my dad together, though I realize now how silly that was. We moved about 20 minutes from my dad. He would always make promises to see me, but almost never came. I remember one time vividly— we had plans for him to pick me up and spend the day together. He called me to tell me he wasn’t coming and how sorry he was. I was probably about 11 or 12 at the time. I said it was okay, but when we hung up I sobbed for hours. I missed my dad.

He did make it up to me a few times, we went to a festival and went swimming— something my dad had never done ever during my childhood. It was a great day and I remember thinking how much my dad had changed. I was so excited.

Until I wasn’t.

A week or two later my dad had taken his life. I remember hearing at 8 or 9 years old that my dad was planning to kill himself. What kid should have to hear that? I remember confronting him, hugging and clinging on to him asking him to never do that. 

He did.

He shot himself in the basement of my childhood home.

I don’t need to tell you about how much this changed my life, as I’m sure you imagine the trauma and turmoil it has caused me. It’s been nearly 11 years since he took his life. 

I’m 23-years-old now. My life has changed. I moved hours away. I’m trying to become an adult having never fully dealt with what happened. I hadn’t started therapy until I turned 18, and unfortunately never stuck with it. I find myself crying about missing my mom, crying about my childhood, wishing I could have appreciated the good times more than I did. I miss my family. I miss how simple things were when I was with my mom. But I know I could never move back there, I could never go back in time, and I could never change things. And it kills me every day. I am trying to be an adult when I don’t even know what it was like to be a kid. 

Quarantine has left me alone with my thoughts and I know this story is depressing but I feel like I’m being eaten alive by my thoughts and trauma. And perhaps this isn’t the right subreddit to post, so few free to let me know and I’ll take it down. But I needed to get it out, tell strangers, get it off my chest. I want people to know that I need help, I just don’t know how to seek it. I want to enjoy my twenties. I want to live a good life without a shadow casting over me.",06Apr2020,1

* I don't love my parents, I feel guilty about this fairly often.
* I don't want to live with them, not from the last point but because I want to be independent, and we are separate people in many ways. I;m also stuck with them even though I technically live somewhere else.
* I'm racist/sexist/bigoted, and feel guilty over it, but still not enough to change.
* If I hear an opinion in politics that contradicts my own, I feel despair because I feel like I'm an asshole for the opinions I hold (I know about my last point, that's an exception, that does make me an asshole) rather than actually trying to defend my positions.
* I care too much about women becoming less attractive (In my personal opinion, objectively speaking) usually about breast shrinkage. Especially if they are women I simp to.
* I get distressed over stories about relationship drama I hear on Reddit youtube channels, mostly about bad things happening (even if I can't prove they did), not so much as being empathetic towards the victims.
* I have no proper work ethic.
* I am not sexually/romantically attractive to women.
* I don't know if I'm LGBT or just have intrusive thoughts since I usually feel terror instead of arousal.
* I have been attempted incest in my past.
* I'm unhealthy.
* I'm diagnosed with ""Something like Asperger's"" (what the doctor actually said.)

Edit: Here are some more issues.

* Often times I'm biased in my sympathy towards attractive women.
* Sometimes when I listen to stories about bad parents I hate my parents even though they aren't like the people in the stories (Although they do have their issues, but that's for another day)
* I guess me not going out much and living in a pigsty room also count as issues.
* I eat like shit and don't exercise well.
* I get bored with life.
* I'm unemployable.
* I'm a leech on my parents.
* My hands' skin got cracked and rashy from my mom's soap.
* I have low self-regard.
* I talk to myself and run around because it's how I express my strange made-up adventures when I'm alone.
* I have no concept of money, especially other peoples.
* I also run in public, but I don't hit anybody in the vast majority of the time so I don't think it's an issue if people don't make it one.
* I'm a pushover. Especially to family.
* I've cheated on tests recently.
* I have obsessive thoughts over people I'm fans of.",06Apr2020,1

I thought it was because I was tired, but I don't get it Kanye? Yo, like is the song the anthem for morning sex? Or like, Kanye made his own fuck track/anthem track?

But, I feel like that's just the situation at the moment. Kanye wasn't really rapping about getting it on. Rather, he was letting this metaphorical girl know that he was on his swag -- Was he flexing on her? And, I guess he wasn't going to return the drip to the store because he cut the tags off. 

Also, did she not know that he was a grown ass man? Like was there a chance she thought he was a boy or a less grown man? 

And then, his pants sagged off, because he was taking his ass off? I mean, she got a free concert for one -- that's cool but I think she wanted to fuck. But, typical Kanye wanted to rap. I guess he needed the anthem. You can just fuck Kanye! His gotta hit some solid bars before he lays the pipe.

We understand if you want to eat, you have to keep working, and we appreciate that.  


We've implemented several changes to ensure your safety, and the safety of those around you. First, we've asked our custodial staff to work extra hard to keep the building clean. Secondly, by reducing our workforce, and asking our remaining employees to work harder, we've been able to eliminate approximately 50% of all employees--this has permitted us to implement a 6ft separation between each of our employees, utilizing the newly emptied cubes as a buffer. Lastly, we're allowing our least expendable employees the option to work remotely. If you do not feel absolutely safe coming to work, you are absolutely permitted to stay home. We do ask however, if you do decide stay home, that you make use of the modicum of paid time off that we offer, after which you are welcome to find another job (quiet chuckle).

145,"This is really long. I'm just venting. TL;DR at the bottom, but if you don't read that's fine. I'm venting.

Maybe the panic will set in a few days from now.

I was working with a small company through a temp agency. When I started, the agency told me I was a good fit and it was a temp-to-perm position. But on my first day, the manager made it very clear that they had high turnover. 

That was three months ago, and things were BUSY. I was told I'd have 4 weeks of training, then was thrown to the wolves after less than 2 weeks. Nothing I did was quite right, and they weren't really nice about it, but I'd just take a deep breath, remind them if I hadn't been taught something, and try to take it in stride.

I started at a 14-person company. In my three months there there were a few other hirings, but I saw 4 people fired and 3 people quit. The owner is a tyrant. Things got worse when covid hit. He declared that we were essential, but... There was nothing to do.

Despite there being nothing to do, I was called into his office multiple times over the past few weeks. He'd tell that he didn't think I ""cared enough"" about his company, and I wasn't ""proving myself."" I was never disciplined, as I hadn't actually done anything wrong. Co-workers, who had been there for years, told me not to worry. I was doing great, that's ""just how he is."" He yells.

One afternoon I went on break and went out to smoke a cigarette. He locked door when I went outside. I knocked to be let in... When he finally opened it for me, he started yelling that breaks were only ten minutes and I'd been away from my desk for  11. Again, I was told by co-workers, ""that's just how he is.""

When our state ordered people to stay home, he set up everyone else in the office to work from home. Laptops, routers, headsets... Not me. Scheduled me to come into the office for every shift. He didn't want the office ""empty."" My ""day off"" was Sunday. I'd work overnight Saturday, get home at 8 am Sunday, then work Monday morning. I practically lived there... Yet never actually made it to 40 hours? 

That went on for a few weeks, with him popping in to yell at me or calling because he was watching his million security cameras and wanted to know why I looked at my phone or something.

It all came to a head this weekend. I worked a 12 hr over night Fri into Sat. Came back at 8pm Sat for another overnight and I told a coworker that it was weird he hadn't emailed us the schedule for the next week yet. Co-worker broke down and told me that I'm not on the week's schedule, but he wanted to make sure I worked both my full overnights before realizing it.

He'd asked two people to take my overnights and they both said no... So he said he was hoping to fire me Friday morning, but he'd let me work the overnights and then just fire me on Monday. I asked a second co-worker, who confirmed.

I worked the overnight. 12 hours if a lot of money.

But since I wasn't scheduled to come in today to be fired, at the end of my shift i cleaned out my desk and put a note on his office door that I quit.

I'm not eligible for unemployment. Not only did I ""quit"", but I'm still employed by the staffing agency, which is only offering minimum wage jobs an hour away, in another state. 

But... I'm free of this lunatic. I had a solid night's sleep and woke up without panic. Which felt great.

The paycheck I'm owed will pay rent and I sell antiques online which has been going well, I'm just going to double down on that. I should be more panicked about money. But I don't have to drag myself to the office to be screamed at by that asshole who just wanted to break me down... What a relief

TL;DR
staffing agency stuck me with small company that declared themselves essential, refused to let me work from home, and then just stopped putting on the schedule. But I ain't mad.",06Apr2020,2
146,"I fucking HATE my height. Literally more than anything else about me. And I have a LOT of physical shit about me I hate. Pretty much everything except my gender. I hate being dark skinned, I hate being overweight, and I hate being fucking SHORT. All my male friends are not only taller than my 180cm pathetic manlet ass, but they were eve shorter than me when younger, including the female ones. Fuck my precocious puberty. 

Oddly enough, my height bothered me much less a few years ago, but I still wished I was a bit taller. I've been the same height since I was in the 4th or 5th grade. I kept hoping, praying, and wishing for a growth spurt that never came as all my friends literally and socially outgrew me, like I was some relic of their past childhood or something. 'Why the fuck would she want to go to the prom with a manlet? She's taller than him even without heels!' 

And the thing that pisses me off the fucking most and when people try to tell me I'm mediocre, like that's some kind of fucking compliment or something. That's quite literally the worst thing you could say to me. ""Oh, you're not genetically inferior; you're just [worthless.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/average) There's nothing wrong with being replaceable, without value, and worthless. So many people are fine not existing."" 

I was okay with it in the 7th grade. I thought I wouldn't stay the same my entire fucking life, but I was wrong. I didn’t go up at all since age ten, which was a surprise given that I thought I’d grow more than a height I'd be fine with. 186 cm would be fine, but 195 was always my ideal height. That's how tall Dwayne Johnson is. I pretty much wanted to be just like him growing up. And even now, to be honest. But instead, I'm fat, poor Kevin Hart. And like I said, I could complain about having a small penis (&lt; 7""), or being overweight, or my ethnicity, or my looks (equally ugly as short) and other things, but it's really the height that bothers me the most, because that's the biggest kiss of death for me. It's the one thing that can never be fixed or corrected. Everything else is livable to some extent. But I'm still kinda messed up over what all my friends did, and having an entire stunted puberty and literally never growing up. And like I said, some people are fine with being looked at as worthless, without value, and being the mightiest ant on the anthill, and all that jazz, but not me. I don't like that I was meant to be a lion, but found out I was trapped in a kitten's body the whole time.

Ironically enough, I always appear taller in photos. I’m only “tall” compared to short women and actual little girls age 11 or younger. They're usually a lot shorter than I am. But not even ""always."" In my country, the typical guy looks just like me, but also has zero ambition or life goals, so it works with them. But me? I wanted to rule the fucking world. I wanted to change so much wrong with this broken planet. But I learned early on, people don't take you seriously if you don't ""fit the mold."" No one looks at Peter Dinklage and thinks he could be president, no matter how intelligent or brave he may seem in playing a character. That's how people are. 
 For as long as I can remember, I wanted to try to 'fix' the world somehow, either through politics, business, or show business. Some kind of influence to get people to start turning things around. But society is too messed up for that. That's how I came to hate myself for being a fucking manlet/dwarf, anyway. Among my people, I'm the same height as a woman. Only I'm, y'know, not.

My height bothered me beyond what would probably be normal and to be honest, under a certain threshold, it's 95% the same to me. Being 157 cm and being what I am are the same thing, really. An F is a fucking F. What am I gonna do, fail _further?_ Get an F minus in genetics? 

I always envied guys who were taller than me, because I was sure that my height would be a huge turn off for most girls, given how many times I heard someone say “I’d never date a guy under six feet tall” or saying that anything below 183 (for example) is a dealbreaker. 

But you know what? Fuck society. Fuck what people think. I've honestly become the most honest motherfucker I've ever known. Because when people always preconceive you as being ""too short, unattractive, too ugly, not the 'right race,'"" and so on, there's no one left to please. I don't have to kiss anyone's ass. I don't chase popularity or social validation. There's nothing to gain from it. I'm not an asshole, but people probably think I am. Because I'm blunt and honest and don't care what people think about me, because there's not a damn fucking thing I could ever do to change their minds. They've already made up their minds about me the moment they met me. Maybe with extreme effort, I could make them think a modicum more positively about me. But if I have to work my ass off to earn a shred of respect from them, then they're not worth the time.

This isn't the life i chose, but it's the life that's here now. The old me is long dead. He died when I was 21. I really am a shell of my former self. Metaphorically speaking, a molted skin of someone who used to want to be President of the United States and ""fix the world."" Or a somber zombie. Or whatever lame-ass metaphor you want to use. The point is, I've been dead inside since 21. All because I'm a fucking hamster man. Too short to be the man I was meant to be, on top of all the other physical-social handicaps I mentioned. I still do change a lot of things in the world. Things people never see. But there's no point in mentioning them. There's no ""glory"" behind it, thinking I need some kind of credit or anything. I'd never get recognized for a single thing I accomplished, even if I cured COVID tomorrow. And frankly, I'm indifferent to that. My fucking body decided I wouldn't exist a long time ago. According to idiotic others out there, I am mediocre, after all. Non-existent. Boringly ordinary. Humdrum. Middling. So-so. Objectively meaningless to the human race. And it all started with never growing up. The rest just kinda happened from there.

Few people get it. I certainly don't expect anyone here to. I just felt like I needed to say all of this, though. My life was over before it even began thanks to a fucking medical condition that left me behind all my superstar peers. I'm Captain America without the super-serum. And now, without the heart. I'm mediocre, according to everyone. Even though I'm not. But that's all anyone will ever see. Just... Nothingness.",06Apr2020,1
147,"Every time I try to settle down and read from a textbook or complete math problems, just anything related to studying I find my self reading the words or listening and then after a couple of seconds my mind blanks and starts thinking about something else. It's really annoying because I can't study.  

for example: when reading my science textbook, I try to focus and put my mind to work but it's like a cloud drifting, and then after a few seconds I realize I've gone away and that sentence I just read has gone from my brain. Recently it's been a lot worse due to the quarantine and not having any supervision. But it's so frustrating because it simply takes *so* much longer to finish than my peers and I cannot spend time on my goals. Just wondering if anyone also has these issues and has overcome them or just has any advice for my situation in general. Thanks.",06Apr2020,1

Then i said 1 word in 11:00 PM and she flew into my room and said that she is forbidding videogames for 3 days. I ask her: ""Why? Ive done my homework, read book and have nothing to do now.""

I laugh at nothing for no reason. When I get mad I laugh crazily. It's literally, like I'm going bat crap Crazy and going mental, yet I know it's happening.

I \[M23\] need advice with ex \[F23\]

TL;DR  Ex of 3 years added on snapchat, and matched on tinder. She hasn’t messaged me.  Still sad boi over her. What do. 

So, there is a ton more to this story, but this is the lite version. If people are, or if they want to hear more about this chapter of my life, I’ll write it. I still love this girl too. It’s 4:42 AM and I’ve been hitting dabs all night writing this, trying my best to summarize and not leave out any big important details. 

Mid-March 2016 I was on Twitter and tweeted asking users to add me on snapchat. A very cute blonde added me. We started with, “Hey, do you go to XXXX?” XXXX is the University. It was a cute little joke we had once things had taken off. Alas, that’s how it began. I met her in person before she added me on snapchat. During our college freshman orientation, she was in one of my hiking groups and I met her at a paint/lightshow. I also noticed her leaving her dorm a lot – not that I was paying attention, but you know when you see the same person a lot in one semester? Well that was her. I was often at my friend’s dorm which was an all-females dorm. I was there every day hanging out or smoking a blunt in the parking lot. I noticed her a lot, I thought she was kind of cute. I remember one day sitting in the back of her dorm and noticing her getting things out of her car. She was getting clothes in, I ALMOST asked if she needed help. Little did I know she would be my first, and only love.

Forward with my story, she added me on snapchat. I noticed right off she had a boyfriend, but she was very friendly with me. She would even send snapchats of her laying on her boyfriend. A couple days pass by of us talking on snapchat and we arrange a meetup. We meet at a coffee shop within our university, and sit, talk from 7pm to 12pm. I noticed a couple of her friends pass by us as we were talking, even taking pictures of us and giggling. She liked me, and I could tell. \~12pm comes around and University staff are locking up the building and we had to leave. We walk out, with some of her friends that joined up and hangout on the grass outside. – Off the record here, I had to stop and cherish my memories with her and how it all began. I wish I could go back to this night. We sit and hangout with her friends, it’s March but it’s not too chilly. She has a blanket out and I’m too afraid to get close, but my knees touched hers – oh that energy. Then suddenly, her boyfriend facetimed her, she freaks out and steps away from the group and speaks with him. Lying about what’s going on and hangs up. Crisis diverted. We go back to her dorm room, and kiss. I leave and go back to my dorm, night ended. Softest lips, she said I kissed her super rough later in the relationship, but I got better at kissing. 😉

Fast forward to April 9th, 2016 and she takes my virginity. I couldn’t get my penis to function, but she didn’t mind and took her time with me. I enjoyed it a lot, and after this I’ll be honest, I caught feelings – I believe she did too. We talked about dating a couple days after this and I caught her in her first lie. Now, we were not exclusive, but it hurt my feelings. She went out to the club with her sorority friends and somehow a guy with a cowboy hat kissed her hand? We talked before she left to club and told me that I was the only guy she was interested in. That’s why I got mad, I guess. She tried lying about it and I got angry, but we were exclusive after that. About a month rolls around and I am at her dorm about to leave from class and I glance at her phone and notice T, a future fraternity brother, on her phone with smile faces on the text screen. I asked to see her phone and she grabbed it, said it was nothing. He’s in her Greek family. I left mad going to class, came back after class and she showed me what looked like a conversation with deleted messages – but I couldn’t refute it. I got over this. 

After the semester ended, she went back to her hometown, we talked about how she was doing and if she had been in contact with her ex P. She lied to me on the phone while she was texting him. The next day of her lying to me I ask her not to lie to me again, she does and meets up with P. Turns out she was texting him the night when she was on the phone for me. During it, she doesn’t answer my calls, ignores me for an hour. I am freaking out and screaming and crying when I get in contact, she confesses but says she met up with him at a park to talk. She said nothing happened, and she even said that I shouldn’t have got upset over this and she can do what she wants. As I am screaming and crying on the phone, she laughed… Big huge argument, probably what killed this relationship.

The problem with this is her lying to me twice, then meeting up with her ex without telling and specifically trying to hide it from me. Now, I’m not insecure over her ex: I’m more attractive and fit. I figured it was an emotional thing, I mean she did cheat on him with me. She never would admit that though, that she cheated. I don’t know why she would never admit that. Anyhow, let’s continue.

From this point forward our relationship got rocky, I had issues of trust. I questioned her nearly everyday about specific things she did when she talked or met with him, if she lied. She never would sit and really speak with me about this, it took me effort to get anything out of her to make this work. Communication was really hard and I had to ask many times to verify a situation because she would “trickle truth” me or just straight up lie. I surely turned toxic here, but I was just so anxious over it. I wanted to love her, but I also wanted to be reassured of her love for me. I basically asked her to never meet with him, and I preferred if she didn’t talk. She said I was controlling for this, but in my eyes, she already violated trust with me. Truthfully, I feel like might have been controlling here – but I also feel like I should have NEVER HAD TO ASK HER to stop contact with her ex after meeting up like that. I almost feel disrespected for her wanting to continue a relationship with him, but that is her ex and at one point they had feelings for each other, and I also don’t control anyone. I, however, can set standards to be followed by my partners that are on a basis of respect of boundaries. 

So, I drive an hour to meet her family to pick her up, we have makeup sex and work it out. I can tell everyone knows we are fighting, and I hate this feeling, I had been crying all day. We sit and talked about it and agreed to keep dating. 

A couple weeks after this she goes and gets pizza with T in her hometown. Now, I was never insecure of him only when they were texting, but this caught me with insecurity because of her meeting with her ex. We didn’t say much but I didn’t like this. I couldn’t say much because she would call me controlling, and I don’t want to be a toxic boyfriend, but I also don’t want another man trying to get with my girl. Don’t worry T will be in the story till the end of the relationship. It must be noted that she did go get pizza, I never said a word, and I don’t think anything bad happened at that time yet.

Summer is over and School starts back, T gets coffee with her a lot during the mornings. I shrug it off thinking, “She’s mine I shouldn’t have to worry – if she want’s someone else that’s her own problem”. I Shouldn’t have to fight for love like that, in that manner anyway. I feel like my girl should shoot other guys down, or nicely accept compliments but don’t bite their bait. She ate his up. So, since T’s in my frat we hangout at his apartment sometimes because I’m friends with his roommate. We are smoking weed and he’s super high, he awkwardly said “OP, we all love you man, if you weren’t here, I’d have to take your place”. I asked him what the heck he meant by that and he left the room with his face red. I was angry. I went back and told my GF about this and she told me I had nothing to worry about. That I was worrying about nothing and he didn’t mean it like that. And that I have absolutely nothing to worry about. She really gas-lighted me here.

My best friend J comes up from my hometown and gets to know my GF on my Birthday. My girlfriend is more talkative and excited to spend time with my friend than be with me. When we were hanging out, she was more engaged with him than she ever was with me. I don’t like their relationship and I get jealous. I think they have a thing for each other. They snapchat and text. This goes on for a bit, he tells my girlfriend that I called her a b\*tch behind her back – that I am a controlling asshole and that she should breakup with me. Which I did, but I was venting to my “friend”. She still wanted to be his friend after this. I got mad and asked her not to speak with him anymore and that I didn’t want him in my life anymore. This worked for a while, I guess. He came to meet with me to work things out and I speak with him in a parking lot with my girlfriend in my car waiting. We talk and I pretty much decline everything, and my girlfriend walks up and hugs him. I got so mad after that. After we got into the car, I was asked why the heck she would hug someone who went behind her boyfriend’s back like that? Such an un-loyal friend and girlfriend. This is about in September.

September to Early December is just a bunch of small arguments about all this past stuff. I get more suspicious of T. 

She snaps him happy birthday Dec 21st, tells me about it and I get upset about it. We get into an argument and long story short we breakup after a week. J tells me that he’s not the one that starts the conversations on snapchat. 

We broke up December 23, 2016 at 11:30. She was at work, I was laying in bed crying. She left my items on my doorstep and did a burn out driving away from my apartment so wouldn’t have time to speak with her. Like I was fucking nothing. Left my shit in a box. Like those 9 months didn’t mean shit I guess it didn’t.

Not even a week later she goes on a date with T, they kiss. I always knew he wanted to sleep with my ex. She told me he had the littlest dick she had ever seen, and she talked with him about his depression and basically gave him pity blowjobs. Who knows, she might have lied but she did spend time in his apartment post breakup. I would text her knowing she was over there and she would tell me to leave her alone. One time I swear it was him texting me back. I’m a lucky man to not be in prison right now, I really want to get a college degree and make my momma proud, but that dude almost took my freedom from me. The next week she hooks up with a random on tinder. Then a couple days later she starts talking with J and goes to my hometown to pick him up with her female best friend. He spends the weekend with my ex along with T. I asked to speak with T because I heard they kissed and went on a date, we talked it out as fraternity brothers, and he apologized. He then left my apt and went to my ex’s and got his dick sucked, I should have laid him the heck out. My ex acted like she knew nothing of this, I don’t believe it. I assume a threesome happened because that’s just my luck, but who knows. The morning I went to speak with her, I tried to sleep with her to see if she did  anyone else earlier, I foolishly asked to see her box lol, she wouldn’t let me see, I assume she either slept with J or T. She told me she never had sex with T and never did anything with J. Even though after we broke up, she took J to get sorority end formal. She kissed me and her mouth smelled like dick. Turns out she sucked T’s dick and then kissed me. Also turns out he was hiding in the next room. This really hurt me, I’ll never understand this. Why challenge my manhood like that? I don’t enjoy cuckoldry, or anything near that. She sucked my dick that morning and I left being so happy, I didn’t find this out till after that he was hiding in the other room. I might not be good enough, but no one deserves to be treated like that. 

So, my ex sleeps with like 8 dudes in 2 months, most in my social circle. Almost got pregnant from a random and I was going to buy her plan b or an abortion whatever I had to. I still cared about her, didn’t want her to ruin her life. Bullshit man, I never felt lower. It’ not that I view women as property, I viewed sex as love, and it was like she was spreading her love everywhere to anyone and that it was meaningless to me. That I didn’t mean anything. That I must witness everyone I know with her. Why can’t she just go sleep with people I don’t know? I never had sex any of her friends. Sure, a couple DISTANT people she knew from other sororities. 

Also, let’s call him D. This friend is a mother fucker, but I still like him. He tried getting with my ex too. He’s also one of my frat bros. I don’t know if it worked with him, maybe they fucked but I doubt it.

Anyway, so T moves away, and my ex is now fucking another one of my fraternity brothers, B. She kisses him Infront of me at a party. She bragged to me about his sex is so much better than me, how he made her cum from penetration. I’m super insecure over this, I have never made a girl come from penetration, but I could get her off with oral under 30 seconds. My penis is 6.3x6 I don’t think I am small but oh well. I’m sad over this and I feel like will never please a woman. 

It should be noted that I asked her not to get with any of my fraternity brothers when we broke up. Her response was that I do not control her, and she can date whoever she likes. I only asked that out of respect for myself because I love hard and it was hard for me to accept my friends are fucking her. I couldn’t have sex for months because of this. I’ve saw on this subreddit, if you’re broken up it doesn’t matter who you date – but I still think friends should be off limits. A friend is an ally, how can I go to my ally when he’s getting made dinner by my ex when I’m depressed about her? See how awkward that is? Eh, it’s whatever that’s just my defense.

About 3 months pass and she’s fucking another friend of mine. Bullshit bro. She humiliated me with that one.

After she fucked B, told me I was ugly and how much B made her cum, I BLOCKED HER. Damn I was hurt. I tried to commit suicide. I told her I was struggling, she never called. No happy birthdays or anything anymore. During this I went into a horrible depression. I almost failed out of school. About 1 year into no contact.

I also dropped my fraternity because of all of them fucking her. After 2 years I joined back because all, but one had left the chapter and I forgave him because we were broken up – but I put the blame on her mostly. She knew it would hurt me; the fraternity bother didn’t know me emotionally like her. 

During this time, she was elected president of her sorority, had tons of friends and was living the high life. I was getting high everyday trying to forget her with no fraternity or friends to have my back. I did join my fraternity back. Fuck the rules, I’m active again- and fuck a freak hoe. She graduated college too. I was voted back in my fraternity and leaving. Now, a few still hate me but whatever.

In December, D (recall from the beginning of the breakup) had received a follow request on Instagram and messaged me with the notification. He told me I deserved better. He didn’t tell me she texted him too, and he hasn’t yet. He’s had many opportunities. A friend of a friend told me they had a text conversation about me. 

So, my ass gets to stalking and I figure out her and her boyfriend of 2 years have broken up! Here I was worried they would get married. I mean, my luck they will get back together or she starts sleeping with my friends again. I mean we do have a mutual friend now so I assume after COVID-19 we might run into each other? I don’t know much about their relationship.

For 3 years we had no contact basically. Now she added me on snapchat, it’s been a month since she added me, and she hasn’t messaged me. What does she want? What did D and her text about? What did she ask about me? Should I message her? People change, and I had her blocked for 2 years. I don’t want to block her again, maybe things have changed. 

Honestly, she probably just imported her contacts to Snapchat, and added everyone. I’m overthinking everything. I am so embarrassed she still means this much to me. 

So, what do I do? Please help, through all of this and the three years I still love her. I’m almost certain I mean nothing to her, but I don’t know. I assume that. There’s a ton more to this story but I think this is enough. If you know who I am, please be respectful and don’t spread the post. If you’re her, contact me and just be real with me – please. If you’re one of the that stabbed my back, I really hope you’re improving your character. 

Also some of her side of the story:

She think’s once we were broken up, there is no problem with her sleeping with anyone my friend or not.

She think’s I am controlling, toxic boyfriend.

She think’s I should apologize and be friends with J, after all of this.

She told me that she regrets doing things with T so fast, and it didn’t mean anything. She said that he was just something to fill the void. I doubt it. 

TL;DR  Ex of 3 years added on snapchat, and matched on tinder. She hasn’t messaged me.  Still sad boi over her. What do.",06Apr2020,1

For those of you who don't know, John Prine is a folk singer who is currently critically ill with Covid-19. Even if you don't know his music directly, chances are someone you love was influenced by him. He's famous for taking very simple words and imagery and using them to paint more complex pictures, along with some goofy humor sprinkled in. 

Bill Murray credits John Prine's music (specifically the song linda goes to Mars) as a turning point in him overcoming depression, as one example of how is music has touched folks. 


Anyway,

I know few people will see this, but I wanted to tell a story about John that was told to me by my dad. I'll try to keep it short. 

In college my dad, his brother, and one of their buddies were all huge prine fans and bought tickets to a show. 

College students being college students, they came up with the terrible idea to wear suits to look important and try to sneak in back stage. 

Surprisingly, it actually worked. They walked right past security and just like the movies there was his name as big as life in a yellow star on the door. They walked right on in. 

John, being a bit of a shy fella, was noticably startled, but they quickly explained they were just big fans and wanted to meet him. 

(Keep in mind this was in the middle of him getting ready for a show. )

John picked up a tray of vegetables they had for him in his dressing room and with a smile said ""well it's nice to meet you, do you want some carrots? I'm not going to eat all these"" 

They sat and talked for several minutes, and eventually security popped in and started to throw them out, but Prine assured them he didn't mind and they could stay. 

They talked right up until the show and then John shook their hands and thanked them for their company. 


People say not to meet your heros but I'm happy to say my hero might be the nicest guy alive.



TL;DR my dad and some buddies snuck into Prine's dressing room before a show. Instead of asking them to leave or calling security, he offered them food,  talked with them for about 30 minutes, and thanked them for their company. 



Bonus: years later my dad met him one more time and asked if he remembered. He told him of course he did and rattled off vaguely when and where it was and what they talked about with a big grin.

Get well soon, John",06Apr2020,1

165,"I’m 16, a sophomore in high school and I wouldn’t say I’m popular. I know a lot of people in school and in class I constantly talk to people, yet I find myself lost and lonely all the time. When I do make a friend or talk to one I feel like I get a boost of energy or get really energetic and feel like I’m actually apart of a grind group, but then after a week of knowing this new friend I feel like they get bored of me and revert to their original friend group. If I try to talk to them, I end up feeling like a third wheel. During these tough times fighting the virus (hope you guys are healthy) I always see friends FaceTiming and keeping touch with each other, but I have nobody to reach out to. If I try they seem to push away. A friend of mine from last year recently told me she has the same problem with finding her place in our society, and of all people, she seems happy and bright all the time, but she’s been fighting depression. Ones everyone in school but on a fake face to act like they fit in, do we all feel like we’re third wheeling everything.",06Apr2020,1
166,"So, my time working for this current client (which is my first deployment) got off to a bumpy start because of a variety of current events. As a result, I’m suddenly having to pick up a lot in a very  short space of time, essentially skipping the intended introduction period. My employer seems to have the habit of hyping up new employees’ abilities, making us out to be experts even when we’re new. As a consequence, I’ve been working pretty much nonstop since we started last week, even though the weekend, because I need to try to get on top of things fast. It is stressful to say the least, and I’m afraid of not being able to meet the client’s expectations.",06Apr2020,1
