0,Ok so I just got back from a 3 day trip and felt amazing it was with the entire high school and even though I’m new and a freshman people still treated me better than my family. Even the teachers pet was better than my family. When I got home an hour ago things immediately went to shit. I was told to sit down and have a talk about the retreat and I was immediately told to make more friends (Which is hard when you filter out 85% of the things you wanna say. Thx mom and dad for sending me to a protected Christian school.) after this talk I go to my room everything’s been cleaned out rearranged and I have to fix it back up then it’s time to eat and my mom asks for the twenty dollars she gave me I told her how it fell out of my pocket and I couldn’t find it. So what’s the reasonable thing to do have my whole family bombard me with stuff they don’t like about me and how I need to do things. So I’m now writing this and sometimes I feel like going missing in the woods so I can finally get some place to do what I want how I want where my family doesn’t make me feel terrible.,17Sep2020,1

2,"I used to believe magic was bullshit but now, I'm not sure. I've seen lots of posts on this site on subreddits unrelated to magic (such as TooAfraidToAsk), where laws of physics are broken like a store (and its owners + staff) appearing out of thin air that literally wasn't there the day before, and 99% of the town's residents are under some kind of memory altering spell (similar to what happens in Stephen King's IT I guess?) so they tell OP the store has been there for 20 years and they're crazy, but OP's mom who lived outside of town was unaffected by the spell and OP's mom was also confused as well.

It got upvoted a lot and several Redditors shrugged it off as being an example of magic, as if magic is like a meteor shower or something and is normal, and posted links to a popular subreddit for reporting spells/magical events like this.

Stuff like that.",17Sep2020,1

I work in a major city and in a building with lots of workers. It’s been really funny and infuriating as well.

4,"**Context:** My stepdad sent me a meme one day that was one of those “*Your birthday and first letter of your name is the name of your romance novel.*”

I got “*King of The Smoke and Rose*,”

I told him that this sounded like one of those cheesy and badly written romance novels where the couple kisses in the rain at the end. This amused me so much, I decided to write the ending to this nonexistent novel.

To be clear: **THE WRITING IS DELIBERATELY BAD FOR HUMOR PURPOSES.**

&amp;#x200B; 

__________________________________________________

&amp;#x200B; 

##”King of the Smoke and Rose” Final Chapter: “Love Conquers All.”


And the Princess Calliope of the land of Galorian ran after the brooding king in the thunderstorm. The rain was so heavy, it barraged their skin like watery bullets - and even had a slight sting when it hit them. 

&amp;nbsp; 

However, the force of the rain was such, that it burst through the bricks of the walls that guarded the forbidden lover’s hearts. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Princess Calliope reached out for her prince, grabbing him by the wrist with a grip that could not so easily be escaped. She looked up at into his eyes, her blue sparkling eyes pleading with him, while her rose-painted lips curled into a desperate frown. Her cheeks and nose developed a red hue to them, as the tears welled up. 

&amp;nbsp; 

“ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO LEAVE ME??” She screamed out to him.

&amp;nbsp; 

Her voice only barely overpowered the pounding of the rain against the soil, but the pain in her tone was almost deafening. The king simply stood there, with his resting-“*I’m a brooding male protagonist*” face syndrome. His brown eyes shone with pain and guilt, and his brow furrowed as he looked down the innocent woman he was doomed to harm - the woman he loved most in the world. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Though he remained silent. He turned towards the long beaten path winding through the volatile hills over the horizon. The hills were known for eating people. Death was almost a certainty - but it was a sweet comfort in comparison to the pain of living a life with a heart so empty from loving a woman that could never be.

&amp;nbsp; 

He gently tried to break away from her grip, and continue on his death march. The mud squished beneath his boot, and for a moment, he was stuck - allowing Calliope the chance to try to reason with him again.

&amp;nbsp; 

“AFTER EVERYTHING WE’VE BEEN THROUGH - *THIS* IS HOW YOU RESPOND??!! DO YOUR REALLY CARE SO LITTLE FOR ME?? WERE YOUR EXPRESSIONS OF AFFECTION MERELY A RUSE TO LIE WITH ME BENEATH MY BEDSHEETS???” 

&amp;nbsp; 

Now THAT did upset the King. He’d made love for the first time in so long. The passion between them that night was so real for his numbed heart. She made him feel again, and he was only walking away to protect her. He couldn’t live with himself walking away without making this sentiment known.

&amp;nbsp; 

“I LOVE YOU MORE THAN EVERY CLOUD IN THE SKY!! I’D MARRY YOU IN A HEARTBEAT IF I COULD!!” He bellowed out in response.

&amp;nbsp; 

Princess Calliope blinked in surprise. She sniffled, and squeezed his hand, trying to savor his warmth. He was going to leave her, wasn’t he? No matter what she did to sway him otherwise. The silence intensified between them, the powerful sound of the rain pounding into the earth being the only relief. 

&amp;nbsp; 

The King’s eyes welled up with heartbroken tears. He tried to wipe them away with his soaked wrist, but wasn’t able to do so - as a wet wrist makes for a shit handkerchief. He looked up at the sky, wanting to scream in rage at the Gods for punishing him with their circumstances. 

&amp;nbsp; 

“I’M A MONSTER, CALLIOPE!! I’M *THE KING OF THE SMOKE AND ROSE*!! WE CANNOT BE, FOR I WILL HURT YOU WITH THE DEMONS INSIDE MY HARDENED HEART!!” 

&amp;nbsp; 

Calliope was now enraged. She squeezed his wrist tighter, and looked up at the sky with him, muttering all sorts of colorful commentary under her breath. When she’d regained her patience, a new resolve took its place.

&amp;nbsp; 

If he wanted to march into the hungry hills, she would go with him. For she refused to allow his death to tear them apart.

&amp;nbsp; 

“THEN I’LL GO WITH YOU!! IF MY MORTALITY IS WHAT DRIVES US APART, I WILL FORSAKE IT!!” 

&amp;nbsp; 

The king wanted to scream, and he did just that.

&amp;nbsp; 

“NO! YOU MUST LIVE YOUR LIFE, CALLIOPE!! I CANNOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF YOUR DEMISE!!”

&amp;nbsp; 

“AND HOW DO YOU THINK **I** FEEL, YOU HYPOCRITICAL ASS??” Calliope screamed back.

&amp;nbsp; 

The arguing forbidden couple stood silently in the rain once again. The King of The Rose and Smoke, who’d lived for thousands of years with a heart so hardened by being so bitterly unloved, felt its stone crack under the pressure of the intensity of Calliope’s love for him.

&amp;nbsp; 

“Then we’ll live together!” he called out more quietly, his voice trembling with emotion.

&amp;nbsp; 

He forcibly grabbed Princess Calliope like brooding male protagonists do, and passionately kissed her in the rain. The rain that reminded both of their love for one another - and washed away the heartbroken irrationality that plagued their sense of reason.

&amp;nbsp; 

The two walked away from the carnivorous hills, hand in hand, with loving smiles. But before they went inside the palace walls, the King of the Smoke and Rose twirled Calliope about, and kissed her in the rain once more. 

&amp;nbsp; 


- The End -",17Sep2020,1
5,"Ok so I write this to the internet people hoping that someone out there can provide some useful advice.

I am a 19yo male and for as long as I can remember I've always had this ""thing"" going on in my head that is something like this:

Every time, and I literally mean EVERY 3 DAMN SECONDS that I perform absolutely any action (like for example, smiling) an image of someone doing the same action in a very similar (often identical) way pops into my conscious mind and stays there strongly for a short time just before I perform the next action (like walking or looking or sitting or breathing or talking) and another image of another character pops and again it stays there for a short yet painful amount of time. And this goes on and on absolutely all day non stop. It never stops. Never.

The ""characters"" that show up can be absolutely anyone (not non anthropomorphic tho, I don't see freaking vases or soap bars in there). They can be people I know IRL, people I've seen once and somehow my brain remembers vividly, or fictional characters. There is no filter tho, they can be men, women, children, of any age and race and their relationship with me seems to make no difference at all (Images of people I fucking despise show up as long as the image closely resembles the action that I am performing in that moment). Cartoon characters also show up. 

What's even worse is that words that I hear or think also react with an image. I can't even think peacefully without a stupid damned image associated with it. Certain emotions, situations or feelings also makes an image to appear. 

The ""images"" can also be short videos (that last a few seconds) and sometimes I can hear them. What I hear is very accurate with the actual audio of that video. I don't see the characters like outside tho, I see them like ""inside my brain"" like wearing glasses.

Here are some examples:

When I look angry, I see Michael Jordan very strongly
 
https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200506182307/mj-feature.jpg

When I make a nervous laugh, Joaquin Phoenix's Joker appears (that scene when he laughs after he shots Murray) 

When I think of the word ""derranged"", here https://youtu.be/GoX6-5QPTAo minute 1:52

When I start being lazy, Pawn Stars' Chumlee appears.

When I apply makeup or something, Kylie Jenner shows up.

And it goes like this all day, in an endless, painful and fucking annoying way. 

You could say, ""at least you know who's gonna show up when you do something"" but even that doesn't happen. E.g. when I look angry I don't always picture MJ, sometimes I see Kratos from God of War. It depends on the situation, sometimes my angry look resembles Kratos more than MJ and because of it, one shows up instead of the other. 

I rarely, if not never, picture my own face. It just doesn't happen. It's always someone else. I never see myself performing an action that resembles what I am doing or thinking or hearing in that moment. 

I feel so fucking bad because of this, I feel so fucking shallow and phony. It's like I don't have no soul. I feel like a container. I don't feel like I have any beliefs, values, ambitions, style nor personality. As you can imagine, this has affected pretty much every aspect of my life in a negative way. I don't know if I wanna keep on living if I am gonna have to live in such a pathetic and disgusting way. This is why I am seriously considering suicide, because what is the point of living if my biology doesn't want to express how I really am? It is pointless and also very uncomfortable and weird. I've had enough. This shit must stop right now or I am gonna fucking lose it. 

I've searched it up but haven't found anyone with this problem so far. My bet tho is that it is something along the lines of depersonalization or OCD. I've tried antidepressants, anxiolytics and antipsychotics but it hasn't done any good neither. The images show up exactly the same way as if I weren't taking any medication. I tried several meds over the course of at least 8 months.

More info: I suffered a pretty bad concussion when I was three years old. My dad never really cared about me and never sat down and talked to me about anything, he never teached me anything about life or whatever and just tossed money around thinking that that was enough to be a good father. I was raised by my mother and my two older sisters, and was overly protected all the time, hell, I still am in a lot of ways.

Is there anything I can do to solve this problem? I'm willing to try anything at this point, I'm desperate.

TL;DR: I see images of characters all day that resemble what I am doing at every moment and I don't want to keep on living if I'm gonna have to live in such a stupid and pathetic way.",17Sep2020,1
6,"I’m in my senior year of HS and it for some reason took me 3 years to figure out that I don’t know wtf to do with my life.

12,"Preface: this is kind of related to the upcoming Dune movie.

The trailer used a score by Hans Zimmer. Well, it was more of an epic cover. I'm not spoiling the song.

 I've listened to epic trailer covers since their inception and I learned to mix them. I initially started doing that to cope with my loneliness/anxiety/etc. but seeing that Zimmer finally jumped on the train (J2, Hidden Citizens, 2WEI  included) I was excited.

Reading the comments online, however, sank my heart and now I need to call my therapist.

The mere thought of people disliking what I'm interested in just... sends me down a hole filled with thorns. The more I try to climb, the deeper the cuts are, so I just stand in this hole until the thorns wilt... if they do.

This doesn't just happen with music, though. It happens with almost everything. And I have been told to my face that they aren't interested in what I say/do/am. And the people who've told me this are supposed to be very close.

I feel like I am the only person who likes to draw cartoons as an adult. I feel like I'm the only one that likes to mix acapella tracks over commercial orchestras. 

I feel so damn lonely right now, I feel like I'll never meet anyone besides my twin sister, who taught me how to draw. She is hurting right now, so she hasn't drawn/mixed/talked about art in weeks. I am helping her with her self-care because grieving has taken a toll on us.

It's aggravating. It really is. And the only other person that at least tried to be interested, my mom, DIED this year, so I haven't been able to share without feeling crucified.

Why the hell do I feel this way?",17Sep2020,1
13,"I grew up in a well off family in india. Went to good schools back home and went to college in the US(no debt). My parents are middle class and worked really hard to send me to good schools/college.

My parents had a business before but now it might shut down coz of covid since its tourism based and they are getting old too.

18,"So our friend group has a guy in it that we all love very much but he has a bad habit of thinking absolutely everything is cringe. Specifically anything that the internet would lead you to believe is 'bad' to like, he refuses to even try being open minded about it.
Some examples: 
We all watched Ted and refused to look up from his phone the whole time because it was Seth Mcfarlan related.
We went to hot topic and when we picked him up and brought it up he said ""did y'all seriously go to hot topic?... I'm not even gonna say anything about that...""
We all went to spencers together and he seemed very uneasy there. He saw a shirt that he liked but he refused to buy it and we think it was solely because it was from spencers.
He says he doesn't like something and when we ask why his only reasoning is that he's heard that it's terrible and if we challenge him on that and say it's a bad reason, he'll just stop trying to defend himself about it and change the subject.
He wont let us know the type of stuff he listens to or likes because he says it's private and he doesn't want people to make fun of him for it but then he makes fun of us for liking anything that isn't shrek or memes. 
He's an amazing friend otherwise and we love him. How do we tell him that it's not cool and that it's making us feel guilty about our own interests without making him mad at us?

20,"I'm 19, and biologically, I'm male. However, mentally...I've never really quite felt that.

If we're going by ""feminine"" and ""masculine"", it's pretty much just stereotypes, but...

For the record, I did always like a lot of stereotypically rather masculine things. I've always loved dinosaurs, and knew everything about them. I love video games. Especially Pokemon and Mario. I don't mind watching blood and gore, or sex and nudity. I like to swim. I like to hike.

But then again...I also liked a lot of stereotypically rather feminine things. I like to sing. I like to cook. I like to write romantic stories. I like to draw cute things. I'm very affectionate, and love hugs and pecks on the cheek, though I always ask first. I even like hugs and kisses from strangers as long as they're trustworthy, hygienic, and smell nice. I am ""motherly"" towards animals and children too. I also like to feel cute, pretty, beautiful, and sexy. I shave my legs and paint my nails. I wear very low-key subtle makeup sometimes, to just cover up dark spots. I like ""modeling"", as in taking pictures of myself, lol. I also love wearing short shorts and showing off my legs. I also cry a lot. Like 2-3 times a day. Usually when seeing a beautiful, touching movie, or series, or a beautiful song.

From that um...I guess by quantity I have more feminine things. But the fewer masculine things are still quite prominent in my life.

For most of my life in public I've presented as masculine...which to me meant quiet strong type that didn't show much emotion. But it's made me pretty miserable, so I'm looking to be more open about my true emotions and all, and how the events of the world effect me.

Physically...I look more masculine for sure, even though I paint my nails, shave my legs, and wear short shorts. My body and its features just don't look feminine, so even though I'm doing girly things, it's not feminine looking.

I'm looking to grow my hair to chin or shoulder length, but I won't look more feminine with that either.

I'm not necessarily ashamed of looking masculine, but I do wish I looked more feminine. And I often do fantasize about being a girl.

However, hormones and sex reassignment surgery can be risky, so I'm not sure I ever wanna do it.

Plus, my masculine strength could come in handy in a world full of creeps.

I don't like showing off my physical strength or anything, but I'll fight to the death to defend me, and my friends and family if I have to, because I love them and would do anything for them!

I also have quite a temper and anger issues, heh...don't know if that's a masculine or feminine problem. Both guys and girls can be quite angry from my experience.",17Sep2020,1

23,"From reading a lot of Reddit comments, it seems like a lot of people are not aware of how to budget, or how things like credit cards and loans work.

It seems like a shame, since these are pretty important life skills and are ultra easy to teach and learn in two minutes. I hope this helps someone out there.

**How to make a budget**

Add up all the money you spend every month. Add up all the income you make every month. Subtract how much you spend from how much you make.

Is the result a bigger number than what you want to save? If so, good. If not, spend less.

Don't know how much you should save? The more, the better. The rule of thumb is, save as much as you can.

**How loans work**

A loan is where someone gives you money now, but you have to pay all of that money back later. They charge you money for this service. The fee is called interest.

**How credit cards work**

When you buy things at the shop, you can pay using credit card instead of cash. Then, every month, you get a bill for all the things you paid for using the credit card that month. You have to pay this bill using cash in your bank account.

If you don't pay the full amount of the bill, then you have to pay the remainder later, but they charge you interest for it.",17Sep2020,1

There’s just sooo fuxking many underlying issues with my parents that my siblings and I absolutely hate being home. Everyone hates being in this house. I’m so angry at myself for stress eating and eating like my problems will go away but it just causes so much more self worth issues bc I hate how I look and feel. I’m angry that I’m 21 and I am made to feel ungrateful bc I’m just tired of hearing my dad bickering at all of the things that we don’t do i.e pick up AFTER HIM. IM SO ANGRY THAT IM 21 and I was barely able to find a job bc of this pandemic and I don’t have the money to move away on my own. I just feel like I’m stuck here bc I know if my mom leaves then my two other siblings will follow her and our youngest siblings will obviously have to go with her. I’m so angry that I’m out between this I love my dad but he is just so mean and so bitter towards everyone and everything that it’s makes me sad knowing how much he hates how his life turned out. It makes me angry that I see families with parents who aren’t toxic or problematic and they actually have a relationship. I’m angry that only now at 21 years old I realize that my parents had fucked all of us up. My brother is SEVEN years old and even he is over the uneasiness in the room when both of them are in the room or if it’s just my dad. It makes me so angry that he feels that. So fucking angry that he is afraid to even say hello to my dad bc my dad can be such an asshole. I’m angry that I am the only one that my dad shit talks to about my mom or siblings bc no one has a fucking relationship with him. I’m tired. I’m really tired and angry and sad and I feel maybe I just shouldn’t even be talking about his bc someone probably has it worse than me but I’m just so fucking mad. I’m so over this it’s so tiring trying to act like I enjoy being home. I’m so fucking sad that my brother has to go through this and it can only get worse with the way my mom is changing and the way they both don’t give a fuck about anything or anyone anymore. I understand why my mom is saying these things but it’s so painful to know that this is what a relationship does to people. And it’s just so upsetting how much they hate how their life turned out. This style has been so normalized for all of us that our oldest brother(34)  who got away from this at 19 literally told us that we all look dead inside from being here. I’m sorry this was long  I don’t know who to turn to for this bc honestly I’ve realized recently  that it’s difficult to talk about my feelings to anyone and I’ve always struggled with that and yeah i do partially blame my parents. I don’t even know if I’m talking about my feelings or if I’m just ranting. I’m just really sad and angry and tired.",17Sep2020,1

""Make sure you zip up your backpack when you come home""

Because we found a roach on the wall last week but our apartment is always spotless, but it's totally my fault I probably brought it from work.

I forgot to zip my bag up and she starts bitching when I exit the shower she's going through every pocket in my bag for some fucking reason

""Why do you even need a bag to go to work leave it at home""

""Because I ride my bike to work and I need a lunch and change of clothes...""

""Why can't you take the bus""

""It takes an hour and only thirty riding""

She has access to her own car and if she really cared she would come get me but 930 is 'too late' and she will lose sleep as would my son.

I feel like she just wants to bitch and complain and turn me into some sort of problem and any time I stand up for myself im alwyas an asshole for getting defensive because she is always ""just asking a question"" but in reality of she was asking a question I wouldn't be getting the KGB shakedown every time I don't follow her orders.

I mean, I feel like apart from the fact that Corona itself made it more difficult to keep friends close, a reason why I distanced (pun intended) from almost all the friendships I have is that everyone just seems not to care at all about the restrictions or the importance of actually caring about what’s going on with the virus. I feel like their attitude is making me want not to talk to them and it’s bringing out so many negative feelings.. Cause for as much as I want to try and not to be biased, I can’t really ignore the fact that one’s attitude towards this terrible situation tells a lot about a person. I’m from Italy, one of the countries that had it worse, and even tho the cases are progressively growing again, everyone I know is just without masks, going for vacations (also to places with worse conditions) and just generally not caring..

43,"I got rejected from another job application today. I spent half an hour in front of a webcam at the uni library yesterday talking about why I’d be great at this burger joint. I wake up the next morning, finish my lab report and read the email. I immediately went to the gym, upped every weight by one unit and pretended I was killing shit for 40 minutes.

Australia’s job market fucking sucks so bad man. I’m a competent, fairly-hard working and super polite 18 year old. But I can’t get a job because every position has 20 applicants with more experience than me. The end of my first year at uni as approaching and if I start next semester without a job I think I’ll just kill myself. Not because my life sucks or whatever but because I literally won’t be able to cope with how much I hate myself.

I’ll probably have a job by then considering I’ll have nothing to do for 3 months but apply for them. I’ll probably take this post down in 20 minutes because I know it’s stupid to pin this much of my self esteem on my employment status. But I have little to no work ethic for uni, let alone cleaning my fucking room or doing my fucking crunches or anything. If I used literally any other metric I wouldn’t feel any better

Fuck man. 2020 sucks. If it weren’t for this corona shit I would be on campus right now, and probably have a job and a girlfriend and all that other shit. Instead I wallow in my misery at home and drag myself to the library once or twice a week.

It took me a long time to cut the umbilical cord and understand I had parents that never should have had children in the first place, but I did end up cutting contact, best thing I ever did.

I got myself a house, a decent job to start anew in a sense. I had no social skills or contacts but dedicated time to improve that part of me. I plainly wasn't good enough to date, no sense of conversation, not attractive, not desirable and so forth and so on. I hit the gym, got in shape, went to therapy for depression and to work through my childhood, picked up writing and BJJ, started building a library in my house because I love a room dedicated to books.

50,"My ocd has to do with rushed, promises to God. My ocd tells me that there is a chance, 3 years ago, I made a rushed, promise to God about not sticking gum or booger on my home office desk.

It tells me that since, I did not have that period, problem with ocd promises, maybe my promise was valid and that I cant blame my illness and justify myself.

I do not remember such a promise. I did not have ocd issues with rushed, promises that period, but I had an ocd fear about a punishment from God. I would not dare to make a promise that it is easy to break. And if I ever made one, I would remember it. I remember nothing. I spend almost, 3 years without even knowing or suspecting that there could be such a promise about my home office desk.

This hypothesis appeared in the last months. I got a bad feeling coming from my home office desk that I used to stick gum (some years ago, i think) I get a bad feeling as if there is a chance that I may have made a rushed promise.

56," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk 



Another instance is when she said she booked me in for a mock interview and I said ‘is that ok?’ And I sort of turned my head away and nodded like I was being moody and I wasn’t I was just tired/lethargic and she was like ‘you could look more enthusiastic about it like’ abruptly. Is that bad? :/

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor  was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘this is brilliant news, very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

Alao: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it",17Sep2020,1

70,"A couple of years ago I had a sort of a mental break, when I talk about it I say ""I popped the lid"" because I can pinpoint the exact moment it happened. It was Thanksgiving Eve 2017 and I was getting ready to go to sleep. I was staying at my parents because we had spent the day hanging out with family; eating and drinking. Before I went to sleep, I smoked a little bit of weed from a vape pen, something I had done a few times before when I was in the mood or it was offered. Nothing was out of the ordinary but as I laid down to sleep I felt the effects of the weed kick in. Cool, great, chill. Then I got up to go to the bathroom. As soon as that door shut I felt an immense level of worry and fear rush over me. I had never felt it before.

Some months earlier, two musicians that I was a fan of, Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington, had killed themselves a few weeks apart. I was sad about it but nothing physically emotional, which is the way I always was with many things. This is a trait that inspired my friends to nickname me a ""robot"" because of my general reaction to most situations. I’ve also always been an optimist and believe there is a way even when there isn’t an obvious path which is the only outlook that I think may have saved me in the months, years following the night I popped the lid.

Back in that bathroom, I was drenched in fear, but from what? It felt like someone had commandeered control of my brain and I couldn’t get it back. I stood there, breathing in the mirror and suddenly I understood why Chris Cornell killed himself, like some great revelation was buried deep in my brain, the place where I bury everything that I don’t even know I’m burying is hidden. It was here and it was terrifying. Why is it all making sense, I don’t want it to make sense, it can’t make sense because it if it makes sense, what does that mean for me? Could I do this? Should I do this?

I didn’t wake up the next morning. Someone else did. I was afraid and worried about nothing and everything. It was a literal walking nightmare. I reached out to a friend I knew had dealt with anxiety and asked for his advice. I tried to explain to my mom that morning what I was feeling. I went online to read about bad trips from weed. How long could this last? It was Friday and I had plans later that night I had to cancel because I wanted to lock myself away. The feeling stayed with me until Monday at work. I thought the feeling would dissipate if I got back into life but it didn’t. It got worse. Every day introduced a new fear that I worried about from the second I woke up until I laid down in bed at night and fell asleep. My waking moments had become hell, my brain had turned against me. Nothing I read on the internet was helping but all of it connects with what I’m thinking and what I’m feeling. Still, I thought I was alone.

I’ve always had mild anxiety, specifically with airplanes. I never realized that I could identify my fear of flying as anxiety until only recently. Depression was new though. Before I popped the lid, I couldn’t comprehend depression, I didn’t understand what it was. Like many, I guess I assumed it was a great sadness. It’s not. It’s a deep f\*\*king hole in the ground that drags you so far from the surface that you forget what the sun looks like. You forget what life is. A prison in your mind that strips away hope — one. second. at. a. time. Until there is a nothing left, and then you hit rockbottom. You feel nothing. I felt nothing. I started to disassociate. I don’t think my brain could handle the 24-hours of fear and worrying so it said enough. I was still here, I was still me, but I couldn’t feel a connection to anyone or anything.

At my lowest point, the most beautiful moments were when I could be alone and allow myself to feel, to cry, to look into the past and find the things that made me happy so that I could learn again what it was to be alive. I remember watching *Armageddon* because the nostalgia was invigorating, and that damn emotional arc of Harry sacrificing himself for the greater good - it was the fix I needed. I watched *Arrival* and it was another dose of that hope fuel. On my darkest day where the “You should kill yourself” thoughts were overwhelming me to a point of exhaustion, I made some turmeric tea, sat down in my room and put on *The Big Sick*. I won’t say that it saved me but it’s a movie that I’ll forever associate as the cushion at the bottom. And sometimes that’s all you need.

It has taken me close to three years to climb out of that abyss that I fell into back in 2017. I always believed I could do most things on my own but it was when I started opening up about what I was struggling with that I began to improve, mentally. I realized I wasn’t alone. When I would reveal to some friends and coworkers I was comfortable talking to about personal things that I was struggling with some mental health issues, they would often respond with some variation of, “I’m dealing with the same thing, let’s talk.” I was shocked at first, “How did I not know they were also living this life and I’ve known them for so long?” People want to help. One coworker was immediately helping me find a therapist and as a result, I found my way to the therapist I’ve been talking to for the the past three years. I didn’t know if therapy would work and there were times when I didn’t believe it was but it was all I had. I needed it to work.

That first year was a mental mess. I would talk to him once a week but I would unload the whole truck. Every intrusive thought that I had he was being bombarded with. No matter how dark or appalled by it I was, I spoke about it with him. We unpacked it. We found threads that ran through every fabric of my life. Dots were connected. I learned to rethink how I processed the world around me. I don’t know why or how it happened. It was gradual. Every week the days where I was worried or afraid of some impossible scenario lessened. My outlook on life changed. I became more compassionate and emotionally available. I improved. I got closer to the surface. I could see the sun again. I could listen to Chris Cornell sing again. I was me again.

I don’t know why I chose to write to this today but I hope that finally writing this out helps anyone who may be struggling right now. I’ll leave off on a bit of movie hope fuel. I just rewatched *Castaway* the other night since I haven’t seen since I was a kid and it hits on a new level in your thirties — “So now I know what I have to do. I have to keep breathing. And tomorrow the sun will rise, and who knows what the tide will bring in.”",17Sep2020,1

73,"I'll try to be careful with my words but as a warning: this is a very happy post. And very rambly

So I'm a 21 year old student who works like half a week while also studying (I mean that's why I'm a student but yeah). 

Around a year ago my then girlfriend of around 2 years dumped me, and it was kinda a bad breakup in the end. But because of the relationship and everything I had expierenced, I learned so much about myself and my small world. I decided I wanted to move out of home and live on my own. So I registered at a housing website, which I hadn't done before since before I wasn't planning on moving out anytime soon. 

I registered last December and kept responding to housing offers, but since I just registered, I had no chance since most housing offers give priority to longer registered people. I listened to friends and their recommandations for other housing websites, but never registered to other websites. One fateful night during a work break a friend fully convinced me to try an other website, so I registered, reacted interest in a 'drawing' house offer (they choose at random) and the next day, I got a mail that I could look at the room I reacted to. I actually couldn't believe it! 

It was a pretty small room, in a complex with multiple people. I had around 20 m² to myself. 1 room, all kitchen/bedroom/living room. We had to share the toilet, showers and washing machine. It was pretty alright, all I needed was my bed, kitchen and computer. I started living here around mid-February.

Around a month ago, our shared bathroom got fludded with water. This event motivated me to look for a new living place, this time a real apartment where I have everything to myself. I was still passively looking at times, but after this I looked for offers each and every single day. I saw sooo many good houses or apartments, each with a good feeling. ""This is gonna be the one"". Nope. ""Alright, I can feel it, this house is mine"". No sir.

Until finally, about a week ago, I woke up to a see a mail in my inbox. ""You've been selected to look at this apartment"". Out of almost 1000 people. I look at the apartment photos again and in that moment I basically decided: this is my new home. I started looking into when I could look at the apartment irl, and the extra costs like electricity and internet, costs that are completely new to me bacause all costs were already accounted for in my current room. The apartment was a bit more expensive, even without all the new costs, but I can get around 200 euro back as ""housing benefit"" each month.

My soon to be apartment has around 2,5 times more m² than my current room. It includes a seperate closed kitchen, a living room, a small bathroom with shower, a toilet and 2 bedrooms. One of the bedrooms will probably become a workplace or gameroom. One of the things I'm really excited about it looking for new furniture, probably together with my mom and little sister. And finally being able to comfortably invite people over. In my current room, I had a big cleanup every night if I knew people would be coming over. Plus everyone was gonna be in a pretty small room, without a table to place their drinks on since there is no space for that. But soon, I have a proper living room! I can't wait to see the apartment at the end of this month!

So yeah, ever since this news and confirming it's gonna be mine (well when I give the final word after seeing it, but I'm like 99% sure I'll confirm) I've been in a near constant 'high'. I talk to family and friends about it, I tell new people I meet and everyone is like: ""Wow you're doing great!"" or ""You're so lucky!!"". And I am, I realise that. I am very lucky to win 2 'drawing' offers in a single year. So yeah, I kinda just wanted to type that out somewhere, since I am so happy in this very moment. I complain a lot about how students that work have no time at all, and students that live at home can't learn to become independent until much later because of the costs, but appearently it is still (in some senarios) possible.

It doesn’t mean you get to talk down on me. It doesn’t mean you get to call me a monster with no remorse or regrets because I do.

I regret opening up to you. I regret letting my guard down the one time and be treated like garbage. I have ears. I have eyes. I see the things you write, I hear the things you say. My silence does not imply consent. 

You don’t like the things I have to say so you never talk to me again. You don’t like my views or my thoughts so you pretend I’m not important. You pretend I’m not even there. 

You no longer invite me out to lunch with our friends. And they’ve followed your example because you are a “good” person. Because you are empathetic, because you are kind.

I am not unkind. I am real. I’m not going to lie to suit your narrative.

77,"Because only average meaningless people would see a positive in being considered mediocre or unvaluable. Seriously, who the fuck wants to be mediocre? Literally worthless? In regards to ANY thing in life, whether it be physical size and strength, intelligence, social status, or anything else?

What is beyond mediocrity, or “above/below average”, is also a 100% subjective thing among people, but mediocrity itself is not, nor ever has been, an automatic “acceptable metric.” Just because the average American man is 210 pounds doesn’t mean America doesn’t have an obesity epidemic. A country can have an average IQ of 88, but it doesn’t mean they’re “smart enough.” Getting a 64 on a test may be getting more than half the answers right, but it still doesn’t mean you passed. And coincidentally, 180 cm is 64th percentile in height in the US. That means a good 34% of men are still taller than you.

So yeah, if one-fucking-third of all men are still bigger and more powerful than you, you’re still a small little weakling on the human food chain, even if you’re more like a guppy rather than the plankton. And frankly, some people are fine with being physically weak and pathetic. But I’ve never been fine with that. I’ve never been fine with being a lion trapped in the body of a mouse. Others are fine not being rich, or smart, or good-looking, or good at attracting women, or other things. Being physically fit and strong *used *to be what I prided myself on and took great worth in being all throughout my teens. But not since my own body betrayed me. I gave up physical activity years ago. What’s the point if my own body couldn’t even bother to fucking finish out puberty?

Furthermore, where I come from, almost every man is taller than that. I’d literally see different women everyday downtown who were at least 5′10″. I made a mental game of it. It’s not hard to come across. And in general, people - both men and women - do not want mediocre, valueless traits in someone. Whether this be height, looks, income, personality, or anything else. Often times, none of them can be mediocre or valueless if you want to impress someone. But to put it simply to all the smooth-brains out there, “Average does NOT equal ideal.” And mediocrity and genetic worthlessness is not something any person with worth should value being. And when it comes to male human height, strength, and health, optimal is 184 cm, or a little over six feet tall. There’s a reason evolution exists, you know?

So yeah, ideally, all men should be at least that tall. I don’t give a fuck if other men are just as genetically unhealthy as I am, or less. It’s not a positive that you have cancer, but don’t also have AIDS and COVID to go with it. So being “slightly less than absolute shit” among human biology is equally not a positive. IDGAF if I could technically be worse; under a certain threshold, it almost all means to same thing to me. 180 cm might as well be 155 cm; they’re both still a “failing grade.” At least adult male heights under 173 cm are *valuable *for their rarity; being genetic trash *and *common is perhaps the literal worse thing I could imagine. In other words, if I’m going to be short, I should’ve at least been a *rare *short height, not a commonly short height; between 173 (5′8″) and 182 (5′11″). So you’re genetic trash AND disposable among humanity? Yeah. That’s worse than simply just being 5′3.” There are other things this applies to among the human body as well; not just height. Things like blood type (anything but A), eye color, etc. And no, your genetics aren’t all you are! But shit, if you’re literally genetic trash among your species, then that really sucks.

Again, most people couldn’t care less how physically flawed and weak they are among other humans. But for me, who wanted a career as an athlete and used to be super-athletic, it is a pill almost too bitter to swallow. All my hope and dreams died between the ages of 18 and 20, when I expected to finally, literally grow up, but never did. That old me officially died, along with all of my dreams. And yeah, sure, you could still try to scrape something by in the aftermath of this corpse where life once existed. …I guess. But the enthusiasm, want, or desire really isn’t there anymore. Like, an Olympic sprinter who got hit by a drunk driver one night and became a paraplegic trying to now compete in the Special Olympics. That won’t make you happy again. All of this, because my own body decided to fail me. Being betrayed by my own body, yet still expected to respect it somehow? It’s like a murderer who killed your wife, children, and parents all in one night, who you’re supposed to be roommates with. But sure, the other midgets can be happy in Lilliput. But the old me has long since died.

Long story short, I am legit shorter than most males I grew up with and knew, shorter than at least 10% of females where I grew up with, and no one who isn’t mediocre themselves sees any positives in being mediocre/valueless among themselves. Not in height or any other category. However, mediocre people admire it, since someone took the time to write an entire question just about me, some random person on the internet who has studied human height. “Why complain about being slightly less than trash but still trash nonetheless?”",17Sep2020,1

I went into it super confidently, but once I got to the test I realized that I had completely forgotten how to solve certain problems. I had no fucking idea what I was doing.

Some questions I managed to figure out or already understood (at least I think I did), but i didn’t know how to do a lot of them. When I completed the quiz I didn’t even look at my grade because I already knew I probably did badly and didn’t want to increase my frustration and stress to a higher point.

After years of this sort of situation happening with math tests and quizzes, I’m so fucking done. Whether I study or ask for help or get tutoring doesn’t seem to matter. I forget what I “learn” by the time the assessment comes, and always barely manage to pass the class.

To make things worse, my grass this year haven’t been off to a good start in general. I have a C- in Algebra, a C- in History, and a C- in English. Usually I’m good at english, but somehow, not participating in one group discussion managed to kill my grade.

I’m just so stressed out.

There's some real art and beauty, fascinating challenges &amp; like everything in life some real pain from pursuing your passion in life. Maybe you build cars or invest stocks, design architecture or hack the government.

I am a healer in world of warcraft, the video game. Before that I was a drug dealer. It's funny, when I was selling all day everyday I had this dream that I could one day give 'this all up to move to the middle of no where and just play video games'.

It was a dream. Just a silly dream.

I will be honest whilst living with my parents it was a perpetual holiday but once I was kicked out and homeless that holiday quickly became a nightmare but you know what, I remember the last thing I thought of whilst I was waiting to die.

It was healing. It was the people in-game. It was that special place. I remember being curled up in a ball just silently sobbing really, hungry and cold. All I cared about was healing.

This is what I do it's who I am i'm not the best healer in the world by a mile. I'm still learning I make mistakes sometimes i'm not playing my best. Your attitude in the game matters, whether or not you're tired from work if you've had a fall out with your partner that day -- all this reflects into your healing.

Sometimes I have panic attacks, I used to get them every month when I was unemployed (probably a lack of food in hindsight). Now that i've been working just over a year I have had just one, it was about 2 months ago. When I have a panic atttack I purposely go on the game and heal, in the past it wasn't like that I simply had no other choice but I noticed that I actually *play better* whilst having a panic attack. There is nothing else to focus on and I get so excited when the panic attack comes on now I am literally shaking my keyboard is bouncing I lose a part of my sanity in those panic attack heals and I don't even mind.

*I would forfeit my own soul -- for the realm.*

It is a quote but the idea is there. 

Lately I have been so stressed about healing in-game I have noticed players not trying their best simply because I am there maybe they throw the game because of me, it's very complicated it's not something I can easily summarize in a reddit post more something I would be better explaining in real life but it's very important to me for new players to enjoy and stick to the game because if they don't one day the game will die if I don't keep people playing this game there will be nobody for me to play against. 

When people meet me for the first time I need to be impressive, professional I am here if they need help and if you're on my team I will try my best for us to win and if we don't we will get them next game.

I need new players to stay motivated; challenge themselves so they can not only improve as a player but as a person too and ultimately to have fun!

Lately I have been slowly letting go of that stress by convincing myself it is *the healing that matters* if I am stressed I cannot heal my best and if I cannot heal my best I might as well stand up and kick my tv over right now. I guess the stress is helping to motivate me -- but I also put a *huge* amount of responsibility into myself in a way it is actually very difficult for me to have fun in-game and a video game is supposed to be fun. 

But at the end of the day I am Servarside, 


Protector of the Realm &amp;


Commander of the Alliance.

I do not have time for games. 


I am your healer and if you want the heals to be the best they can be you better hope i'm not having fun cus if i'm having fun i'm not concentrating enough i'm not focused enough I will make mistakes.

I have this ideal of adulthood that I've been trying to live up to. It's prettier from the outside, and honestly I don't even know if it's true. It's just rooted in my outrageous stubbornness and bitter sense of pride, and at the end of the day I still sleep with that ache of worry and loneliness. I'm not an adult because I do things on my own. I do things on my own *because* I'm an adult, or I'm trying to be, and there's no one to rely on anymore.

My parents have admittedly given up. They divorced weeks after I left for college, and after 30 years they're shifting their focus. They'd rather be grandparents now, rather explore love a second time. They'd rather be my friend. I think it's probably easier than trying to nurture someone with problems into maturity. They even told me individually, ""I've moved on. I've restarted."" But I'm 19 years old and I can't.

My boyfriend is gone. A lot of my friends are gone.

No knowledge otherwise or skill to speak of

No music to share but cartoonish changes and dialects

You wish to tell me that I’m a tough guy

A strong man with a recklessness in passion because of my fashion

I lack not what you wish to perceive as desire

I only carry within me so deep inside that burning fire

This is not refusal through your accusations but clarity

I am not what you desire

I am me

I cannot be more than that or less

So I say there was only one and hold this meaning

For alone the stars still shine and days are gleaming",17Sep2020,1

102,"I got yelled at a lot by my mother when we I was little, a lot of the time it was for minor things but I know she didn't really mean it and that she was just stressed because we were poor and she had a lot of other things she had to deal with other than me.

Out situation has gotten a lot better, she met a fantastic guy and she is noticibly feeling a lot better which means that she very rarely yells at anyone.

Although to this day one of my worst fears is getting yelled at by someone who is angry and everytime it happens I feel so small despite being a large guy, it's almost comical tbh.

Well, today it happened. One of my favorite teachers and a person I really respect got really angry at our class and started yelling, if I'm being honest it was justified but I won't go deeper into why it all happened. Anyway, immediately I got that panicked feeling again and despite me being someone who can really keep it together I almost felt like this was the time I was going to Crack open

He then explained that we should just let it go and he was a really cool dude about it, which is why I respect him so much. But I haven't let it go yet, I still feel as tense as I did when he yelled and my mind keeps playing that and almost like soundbites from when my mother yelled at me.

I don't know what to do as I can't stop being so tense and last time something like this happened I was this tense for almost like aweek. Has anybody had this feeling before and do you have any tips on how to get rid of it?",17Sep2020,1

107,"The lease is in her name. She has a job and can afford rent on her own. He also has a job and obviously makes more than her and that's why she's with him. He's an abusive asshole who has cheated on her. She, from what I gather, is a sweetheart. Help me understand why she stays with him and lets this happen. It's just embarrassing at this point. This has been going on for two years, probably more. Despite constant fights, ""moving outs,"" and drama, they just got a new puppy together. They're probably going to get married and start a family, and that scares me for the kids' sake.

Ive been clean since september first and its honestly the hardest thing Ive ever dealt with. No its not meth or heroine, but its still majorly effected me and my life. Im in the worst shape in every possible way. But Im changing everything. Cut off the toxic friends, got an amazing  girlfriend who genuinley cares for me as much as I do her. And Im getting the help I need for my depression, anxiety, and adhd. Part of me would love to go back to my old life because it was easier, but I wasn’t really living.

114,"I just feel absolutely hopeless. Ever since I was around 5, I’ve always cried a lot and been too sensitive for a guy. It started with my family constantly berating and making fun of me for having possibly the worst taste buds in the planet. I refused to eat much food simply because I thought it was gross. I’d always get called skinny, weak, a kid that is never gonna grow up, etc. and it got under my skin so much as a young child that I’d break out into tears, my younger family members noticed and would sometimes make jokes about how sensitive I was. They wouldn’t intentionally try to be cruel since “cruel” to me was just making a joke about my insecurities but I couldn’t deal with it. I didn’t notice it was an issue in that point in time though. Sometime in early elementary school, I’d also developed a habit of crying nearly everytime I was screamed at by a teacher, getting incredibly sad to the point of crying whenever I’d be made fun of, and that sorta thing and it made my life a living hell in Elementary. Thankfully, the issue wasn’t as big in middle school (but I was definitely still incredibly sensitive) although I stilled cried maybe around 4 times throughout the whole 3years in front of people. Freshman year, the problem really only was an issue once while sophomore and junior year (now) being spent without an issue. I’m still just kinda ranting because I don’t get it, why can’t I control it? I just got yelled at by my mother during a driving lesson for making a mistake and I slowly started to tear up and it’s so shameful. I just wish I could control my emotions",17Sep2020,1

The past year of my life I've fallen into a pretty dark place. I've never felt more lonely or sad in my life. It's like my brain has just... given up. I no longer feel motivated to do anything. 
My normal ""escapes"" no longer work anymore.  
  
It's fucking hard to just keep going every day. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but none of them really understand. I feel alone and afraid, but most of all, tired. I just want it all to stop.

118,"Bf and I were talking about our futures and goals and kids came up. We’ve talked about being on the fence about kids before, both of us swaying either way multiple times, but these were just passing comments. During this talk, he said that he is leaning towards yes for kids, he wants at least 2, and he wants biological kids. 

I think that if I were in a good place to have kids (financially, relationship wise, etc), Id have them. But the thought of being pregnant really scares me. I have EDNOS/OSFED (eating disorder) so I feel like seeing my body change so much would be really triggering. Medical stuff and bodily fluids freak me out, so the birthing process makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I pass out getting IVs, I get extremely nervous for surgeries, and the recovery from giving birth freaks me out (all the tearing and my vagina being out of whack for a while, being bloated and just not myself for weeks-months after the fact..). Not to mention the actual process seeming really fucking painful. And all of the things that could go wrong (i.e. my friends sister got an epidural (?) that accidentally went BACKWARDS meaning her whole upper body went numb instead of her lower body and she almost fucking died). It just terrifies me. 

He doesn’t want 1 kid because he wants his child to have siblings. So id go through that process TWICE. Ugh. 

His comment about bio kids made me a little sad because I’m adopted, but he’s really worried he wouldn’t be able to bond to an adopted child (uh, hello, I’m right here with my parents who love me more than anything). It wasn’t something he said out of malice and his feelings are valid, but it just bummed me out a bit. 

This isn’t a pressing issue as I have *years* before I’d even think of getting pregnant. And we would obviously need to sit down and talk things out again to make sure we’re on the same page. But it’s just been on my mind a lot lately and I didn’t know where else to talk about it (pls direct me to a sub if you know a better place??). 

The wording in my title is weird, I know. I’m not some baby machine that exists to pop out his spawn. He absolutely doesn’t think that either. But I just love him so much that part of me thinks I would go through birthing a kid(s?) because that’s what he wants. I mean, I’d want it too if I decided that. I’d want a family with him. But I mean more like, if he had his heart absolutely set on having biological kids whereas I was on the fence between adopting a child and having a child myself, his wants would probably push me towards having a biological child. 

I guess I just want to hear about how giving birth went for other women. Was the pain worth it? Would you/did you do it again? Is it as bad as it seems?",17Sep2020,1
119,"      Sooo, let me explain. First of all i am from Portugal so English is not my first language, excuse me if i do any mistakes. To begin with, two weeks ago our school year started. it's my last year of high school so I'm really getting forward to getting in the university.
      When the first day of school began, i noticed a cute looking girl. She was short, smoking hot brunette. I could tell from her style she was kinda different from other girls. she was wearing big black boots, a black skirt, rings, lots of make up. She looked like a rockstar or something. and had that aggressive look that really draw my attention. She also had band patches on her bag ( stuff like metallica etc.) but I'm not really into metal.
      Anyways everyone one in our class was talking about how gorgeous she looked. She was also an introvert didn't really talk to anyone and took her breaks to the school's toilet smoking lots of cigarettes. 
      Here comes the thing that really blew us away. A friend of one of our classmates knew that girl, they used to be in the same school. and she told us that, that girl used to deal drugs in her area that she had to move away because the police learnt about her and was following her steps. (bare in mind we are talking about a petit 16 years old girl) We were also informed that she used to be in a relationship with relatively older guys 25-28 , while she was 16. Telling their previous classmates that she was fucking with her boyfriend all day.
      Don't get me wrong she doesn't sound like the ideal person. But i don't know... the day i saw her i thought, oh a girl that's definitely different than the others. i was really excited with her mysterious personality. but then came those news and made me sad, i was really into this girl  but i couldn't live with a drug dealer. ( to clarify it we are not talking about weed). this story might sound a little bit crazy for high school at least here in Europe, I've heard that those things happen everyday in America. Anyway i really wanted to get this off my chest, cuz i was really excited I've founded the one but i was wrong...",17Sep2020,1
