1,"I don't know I just felt the need to post.

  
We're co-workers, part time shop assistants while we're at college (different colleges/Unis).

&amp;#x200B;

We could be talking for 2 minutes and she'll dive right into how she wanted to study law the whole way through school but decided last minute that accounting was going to be a better fit for her.

Or I could talk about how I used to get horrible headaches, and she'll get really invested in the conversation.

  
We flirt back and forth, subtly but it's there.

But I'll ask how her trip to New York was and within a minute she'll be asking if I'd ever move there, where do I see myself in 10 years time, married? Kids? Closer to home or the other side of the earth?

It just strikes me as odd but also oddly nice that no conversation is wasted..

We don't get to talk a lot, we only know each other through work and she doesn't have many hours.. So every time we talk it's like she's cramming an hours worth of a meaningful conversation into those 5 minutes, it doesn't matter who else is around..

I'm also always met with a great smile, which adds something to my day.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday I learn something new about her, she doesn't like gory details, she's a fan of gin and a hater of Whiskey.. Small things.",23Mar2020,1

3,"I'm a hardcore introvert and even I'm ready for this shit to be over with. 

Every unnecessary business is closing. Grocery stores, pharmacies and banks remain open. I still have to go to work. I just wish I could quit and sleep until all this is over, because somehow it's even MORE tiring than before shit hit the fan",23Mar2020,1

6,"Don't know if this is the right place to post, but i just need to vent off a bit, before letting friends know, since I'm myself still a bit confused with the situation.

So first off I don't know much about my father, he left us when he was 4 (i am 20 now) and spent time in prison for about 10 years, and i haven't heard from him during the prison time, or after (until today).

The other things i know is that he fucked his way across europe, since i do have about 7 half siblings that i know off, in different countries of europe, and I did get to see some of them when i was really young, but i can't really remember much of it as well, just like from my father.

Any information I have ever gotten from him was always kinda wacky, since my mom absolutely despises him for obv reasons, i feel like the very few information she gave me from him, was always worse said than it really was. My grandma from father's side, that i have actually broken contact with, did the exact opposite, whenever i visited, she would talk about how okay my father actually is and how it was just accidents over accidents and pretty much only talked about how bad my mother was at raising me, even though she was trying her hardest, as hard as a single mother in this situation can, so i decided to break contact with my grandma (who lives 400km from me, maybe shouldve mentioned that), along with the rest of my father-side family, that acted pretty much the same, all that happened when I was 12 btw.

so 8 years later, its not my grandma who tries to contact me, its not my aunt or anyone from my father side-family, no, its my father himself who found my mom on facebook apparently, and has now given her his email adress, so i could type him, since he wanted to know how i was doing.

So i gave him a small message, with my phone number and am currently awaiting his answer.

It's so confusing, and new, and scary, since i didnt have a father figure for literally my whole life, and everything i heard about him has always been bad, since i've only been with my mom. The facts that i do know though are those 7 half siblings across europe, and that he payed the child support for literally every single one of them, but me, because he couldnt in prison.

When i got 18 i got a letter saying that the guy still exists and BTW owes me 18.000 Euro of child support, which he never payed back just a cent of, which made me feel bad about my mom again.

I just dont know how im supposed to treat the guy, or what i want to say to him, what i want to tell him, its just.. what the fuck do i do? Anyone else with similar experiences of your dad going 'fuck you' for 16 years and suddenly reappearing??

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",23Mar2020,1

8,I‚Äôm a streamer on twitch (female) and last night I drank too much and went live. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until one of my mod‚Äôs messaged me saying I was a hot mess. I was very emotional because I got a handful of very generous donations and I was dancing a lot. All while playing the game. I deleted the video and clips before I even re watched it because I didn‚Äôt want to cringe. I asked my other mod‚Äôs about it and they said it was all fun and everyone was just having a good time. But ever since then I‚Äôm feeling so anxious and embarrassed. I noticed I feel this way after I drink a lot and it‚Äôs obvious I need to slow my roll. But does anyone else experience this guilt feeling?,23Mar2020,1
9,"Not sure if this is the right sub but I know there are some good people on here so...

Some time ago I was watching an amateur couple‚Äôs videos on a NSFW site and suddenly developed a massive internet crush on the girl! I was just looking for some porn and ended up catching mad feels! She was breathtaking to me and I‚Äôve never wanted anyone so much in my entire life!

I‚Äôm not a loner, I have loads of success with ‚Äúreal girls‚Äù, but I lose self-respect each time I watch those videos and fantasize about her being the mother of my children! üòÇ No I‚Äôm not sharing the links.

Am I being too hard on myself (pardon the pun)? Have you ever had an internet crush you felt utterly pathetic about? Any tips for dealing with it? Should I stop watching the videos?

Thanks for listening!",23Mar2020,1
10,"I‚Äôm posting this mostly as a way to vent, maybe some advice. I am a dog walker for a small local business and I work as an independent contractor. I don‚Äôt have health insurance or sick/vacation days, I would not be eligible for unemployment. We are still up and running with no plans to stop and it‚Äôs giving me a lot of anxiety. My job fits into an essential/life sustaining business as we do boarding sometimes and is considered remote as we do not have a brick &amp; mortar location/store front. I feel that my boss is keeping open for both her and the employees financial sake which I guess is ‚Äúgood‚Äù but I feel like we are taking a huge risk to both ours and the public health. I also can‚Äôt believe how many people are still keeping us on for walks since most of them are home for/from work now. One of my coworkers who I interacted with last week even called out sick the other day!

This all makes me really uncomfortable but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in a position to speak up, none of the other employees have and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm rolling in money, I basically work paycheck to paycheck and don‚Äôt even have a months income saved up (I was honestly just saving it for taxes anyway). Besides going to multiple homes with people in them during the week, I haven‚Äôt gone anywhere besides my own home, the grocery and the gas station in like a week. I also luckily planned a mini staycation for myself last month for this month so I will definitely just be self quarantining for like 5 days. Otherwise I‚Äôm just waiting for the state government to make a shelter in place announcement at this point. 

I am going to start maybe wearing a new set of gloves to each house I go to. I‚Äôm not sure what other precautions I can take, I‚Äôm not trying to go overboard. But I also feel like my anxiety is valid and I am just so incredibly baffled as to why my boss and some of our clients want to continue to risk people‚Äôs health like this. Having to close/greatly reduce business would cause financial anxiety but keeping it open is...still causing me anxiety. It‚Äôs a lose lose situation.",23Mar2020,1
12,"Last week I saw mention of Italians recording short videos of themselves to track the chronological progression of their daily lives while this virus is going on. I wanted to do something similar. I thought it would be a great idea to record a video as a video journal on my personal smartphone. 2 to 3 times a day or more, with 2-30 minute length videos I've been recording messages to myself every day. The only rules for myself is that I don't share it with anyone or anywhere. Not until this is all over at least. 

Don't let anyone know I'm recording these videos and go into a secluded place anytime of the day that I can, or make sure to whisper so that no one else can hear me. Speak candidly as if I'm talking to myself and not followers on a youTube page. Don't hold back on what's on your heart or mind, but try to keep private information about yourself or others out of the video if you can help it. This is in case someone else sees the videos. Don't worry much about your appearance if you don't want to but try to keep it PG-13, in case someone might see it. Try to be honest with yourself and when talking about others. This is like a message in a bottle, and it's very therapeutic to me.

I am sharing this for anyone who may like this idea to consider. However I'm mostly thinking of the extroverts since I've heard they have an incredibly difficult time adjusting to ""social distancing."" I have my own ways of dealing with isolation or lack of contact with other people. I thought this might be beneficial for my social-butterfly brothers and sisters, but anyone can do this if they want. 

Even if my videos were all uploaded, I must admit the things I say are not perfect. I don't always say things that are flattering to myself or others. Again, my rule is to be honest with myself since I don't plan to make others I know personally, even aware of the videos. Make up any rules or goals for yourself that you'd like. I think it's a fun distraction and a way to handle how I'm feeling. 

I can safely advise you to seek professional counseling if you need it. In many places there are free services available.",23Mar2020,1

14,"It's night time and I'm laying on my bed. My fairy lights are the only light source besides my phone screen. I know I'm not doing well, because I'm listening to Joy Division in the night. Again.


I feel lost. My last lover left me on read even though he told me that he wanted to be a part of my life. I mean you are a part of my life by being on my mind all the god damn time, but I'm not playing a part in your's. So what you said wasn't really a lie, but not what I expected. It's just really hard to get over you without closure. It's hard, but not impossible!


Moreover I finished school recently. Everything feels so big and massive, it's really threatening. The threat of the future is back. How exciting!


Sometimes I want leave everything behind. I imagine running away would be a fun activity if it wasn't too dangerous atm because of this virus. I know running away won't solve any of my problems. But something sounds really alluring to me when I think about wandering to the nearest big mountain to think about life, to reflect on my actions, even if it's just for a few days. 


I have friends and a loving family. All of them support me. I just wish that I had a lover with whom I could be close with emotionally and physically. I know I should not depend my happiness on another living being than myself and it's not about that. It's this special bond you can have with a partner but not with a friend. I'd love to have that. The experiences I had never lasted long. I know I'm only 19 years old, so it doesn't mean anything, but I occasionally think that there could be something wrong with me. 


It makes me mad that I'm not satisfied with what I already have. There will be better times, I know it for sure. I'll find someone who'll love me as much as I'll love them. I'll face my future (I mean there's nothing else to do than that, haha). I'll find a way to live my life in a good way. Maybe I'll go for a walk to next mountain and think for bit.",23Mar2020,1
16,"So, my dad‚Äôs parents who are very elderly and frail live in the next county. My uncle and aunt also live in the same town. My parents had planned to visit my dad‚Äôs parents but under the current circumstances, they decided to cancel given that we‚Äôve all recently been in situations where could have unknowingly contracted COVID-19 and the concern is that if they were to go ahead with the visit and my grandparents contracted it, it would most likely end with them dying in great pain, alone, in hospital.

My uncle, however, responded by saying he‚Äôs kept visiting them, partly for groceries, and has essentially accused us of being selfish because we don‚Äôt want to make the long journey to visit (and put their health/lives at risk). It‚Äôs unclear what he actually expects my parents to do upon arrival but I feel he really just wants them to do what he sees as doing their bit, despite the feeling at our end being that staying away for now is actually the best thing we can do for them.

34,"  Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

37,"Sometimes I just wonder if I am actually something to someone. I don't know why but, except for a few moments, it's like I am on autopilot.

I feel so empty but maybe because I once knew how's it like to feel fulfilled?

I find myself wondering if I'm navigating life or if it's the other way around.

Am I making my own choices or no? Is considering the consequences, calculating whatever else then making a choice based on that.. Is that truly living?

When can I stop thinking about what's next or what has past? When can I live in the or a present moment? Do I need someone to help me out or can I do it on my own? Do I need the smile of another person to be happy? Do I need their eyes to see where I am? Do I need their voice to speak my mind?

The free time I spend with myself doesn't feel like it's mine. The busy times I spend with others is... different.. I don't know how.

Am I alone in the presence of myself? Am I present if that what I always think about?

Why is time a liar? It supposed to have a fix value but it runs with me in different speeds.

Am I a fool? Am I lost? Or what exactly?

Am I troubled? Do I actually believe in something? How come when I want to answer anything my first thought is ""it depends"" ? Why am I trying to suppress this thought and be decisive?

Who am I acting for? I tried to fake it until I make it but I ended up feeling fake.

Are my feelings real? Am I responsible for them? If they are mine, why aren't they how I want them? And if they are not mine how are they real? How should I be responsible with how I feel around others then? 

Am I deep or do I live in delusions that are? Am I too short to stand in the deepth of my shallow thoughts? Or my legs are long but they aren't touching the bottom?

I can turn these thoughts around but it's a roundabout road and they'll just come from a different side.

But that‚Äôs not reality and I put the needs of my country and the world above this so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

I‚Äôm just sad that this year, we seniors might not have our traditional ending.

And if this COVID-19 fiasco continues to get worse (which will likely happen if Italy is any indication of anything), I‚Äôm just afraid that my shipdate to go off to boot camp might be affected.

I have my parents and my siblings, a job, school, goals, hobbies. I‚Äôm a person. But to someone just looking at me, I‚Äôm just another face.

My family would care because we‚Äôre raised to prioritize family, and I‚Äôm grateful that to have the support system that I do. But I have no connections that I built on my own.

No one, outside of that part of my life, would care. I would be another harrowing reminder of mortality, but I wouldn‚Äôt be someone they‚Äôd miss.

48," I‚Äôm not a strapping young intern being treated like I‚Äôm younger, I‚Äôm a teenage girl who‚Äôs close to graduating being treated like a baby by my friends who are the exact same age because I‚Äôm a *gasp* virgin. 

 Normally I‚Äôd brush this off, but this has been going on for years. It‚Äôs been improving a bit, but my last virgin friend just lost hers and now it‚Äôs back with a vengeance. My female friends have this strange illusion that I am a pure innocent baby who needs to be protected from the big bad scary sex. It‚Äôs gotten bad to the point where I‚Äôm excluded from all conversation that is even remotely sexual. Once, while hanging out with them and making them some ramen, they were talking about how they want Jason Mamoa‚Äôs hulk-sized dick in them. Suddenly, the room went silent- ‚ÄúOP is in the room! Shut up!‚Äù. Never mind the fact that my friend‚Äôs 12 year old brother was in the room, no, clearly I‚ÄôM the person who shouldn‚Äôt be hearing this. I‚Äôve never even said anything or told them that I‚Äôm uncomfortable with it. They‚Äôve just assumed on their own. 

 Another time, I invited them over to my place. They decided that they wanted to talk about the big bad sex, so they decided to in my OWN HOUSE lock all of themselves in a room without me to talk about it for hours. I spent that entire hangout in the next room because me being there was apparently too much for them to bear. It‚Äôs quite insane. They‚Äôve just designated me as a baby for no good reason. I‚Äôm taller than half of them. I box quite a bit and have handed their own asses to them a few times. I‚Äôm not exactly small or baby-faced. It‚Äôs just some strange role they‚Äôve given me. 

 It was getting better, but recently I‚Äôve started talking to a guy after 2 pretty fucking traumatizing boyfriends (one cheated on me with my best friend, the other pretended to attempt suicide because I wouldn‚Äôt suck his dick) and by god it‚Äôs started up again. All I got was ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT DO IT‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not missing out on anything!‚Äù, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always a downside!‚Äù (That didn‚Äôt stop you lot apparently.) My other virgin friend has been talking to a guy for a few weeks, has never met up with him in person, has never dated anyone before, and now wants to hook up with him during a global pandemic. She got ‚ÄúYou go girl!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM SO PROUD OF YOU!‚Äù, and ‚Äú_____‚ÄôS GONNA GET SOME DICK‚Äù. I‚Äôm tired of it, but I‚Äôve already been bitchy lately and I don‚Äôt want to stack that on top of it. I‚Äôm just tired of being given a role that doesn‚Äôt match up to who I am at all. I‚Äôve already told them I‚Äôm not a baby, but apparently they didn‚Äôt get the message. So here I am, ranting about it on reddit. Sad.",23Mar2020,1

We are following all guidelines and will have the doors locked and hand deliver the food to the front door of the store. For delivery we will be putting them In plastic bags before the hot bag and you can have them grab it from the hot bag them self‚Äôs as well as you do not need signatures on the receipt to eliminate contact with customer unless it‚Äôs for a write in tip

I *need* to make mistakes in order to get shit through my head. While this has its benefits, for the most part, this is a very, very bad thing. If I want to truly learn and understand that I need to wrap up during sex, I need to go through a pregnancy scare first. If I need to learn and understand that sleep is crucial to my health and well-being, I need to pull an all-nighter and suffer the consequences. If I need to learn to drive defensively and not aggresively, I have to get into an accident as a result.

And just to clarify, I'm 20 years old. I **know** the difference between right and wrong, and what are good and bad decisions. But for some reason I'm still too immature to actually do the right thing. My theory as to why this is the case is because I believe I haven't lived nor made enough mistakes in my life to truly learn and understand the consequences of my actions. I'm not using that fact as an excuse to go looking trouble, I promise. It's not even in my control; I cannot control the fact that I need to learn this way. It's just how I'm built. Is it a negative trait about me? Absolutely. Do I wish I could just learn by being *told* what's right and wrong without having to make mistakes myself? Without a doubt.

Why in the world I function this way is way beyond me, but one day I just know I'm going to make a mistake and not be able to afford the consequences and fuck my life up for a long time if not for good.

82,"A little background, I was chatting with my sister about how I deal with their expectations of me and their impressions of me. I‚Äôm generally someone who deals with my emotions and my thought process alone. I prefer to only let people see the final outcome of my personal decisions. But of course, parents are parents and they want to know what goes on in our heads. 

The thing is, I‚Äôve decided to enrol in a University course in Australia (ps. I‚Äôm not from Australia) but it was only a recent decision (like 100% sure). Australia has always been a possibility, but for a long time, it was just that, a possibility. Everybody knows that young people generally are indecisive and I was no exception. But my parents disliked inconsistency and believed that it was a sign that you had no real opinions, that you were easily influenced. I personally always had a feeling that I would choose Australia in the end but like any other teen my decision wavered throughout my adolescence. However, I never let on about this thought process and instead generally told my parents little milestones I had about Australia. This way, I can have my personal dilemmas in peace and my parents can see consistency in my decision.

This has always been the main thing that I‚Äôve used this ‚Äúmethod‚Äù (I‚Äôm calling it a method but I feel like I can‚Äôt be the only person who does this) on but I do notice that I use it on other aspects of my life as well (yes, including socially). In short, I leave ‚Äúbreadcrumbs‚Äù of my thought process to guide people to a final decision that I‚Äôve made. It‚Äôs less of a conscious thing and one I feel is more ingrained into my personality. This has generally led me to being well-liked by other people and generally getting what I want. Win-win situation if you must. I always believed it was just a way to have everyone satisfied because there were instances in which I had momentary feelings that I shared that just turned out to be an inconvenience and an embarrassment later.

Well, while chatting with sister about this she says that it was manipulative because I knew people would do/act the way I wanted them to and I purposefully dropped a trail of ‚Äúbreadcrumbs‚Äù to follow, all while leading them to think it was just how it is. She said it‚Äôs not natural to do that and that it was better if I just discuss my emotions/opinions as I feel them instead of evaluating before telling my family, that way it was more sincere.

I never thought it was a bad thing before because it‚Äôs just the way I functioned all my life. I never even consciously realised that I did this because it‚Äôs just... well, me. But I feel like what my sister said also makes sense so now I‚Äôm torn. Am I a bad/manipulative person?",23Mar2020,1

96,"Hey all,

So without getting too much into it. My past relationships have been so far from ideal, i haven't had the best run in the dating world at all. From a low enough income area in the US, and being young and impressionable comes with all types of issues. For example my 2 last partners lets say have been ended for a variety of reasons - one was arrested for drugs and the other because of a domestic confrontation.

While that is important part of it, its not the main point of this post. When I was younger a guy I was dating wasn't as faithful as one might hope, and I ended up contracting an incurable STI - stupid i know. By no means the worst one, but of course by no means does that reduce it.

Recently I've left that whole life behind me when trying to progress with my life, moving on to bigger and better things. Things were progressing nicely but i was always missing someone to date - but i thought that was fine as I was basically trying to recreate myself (moving to new area, new friends, new hobbies etc)

But then along came Brian. Like a bomb.

We hit it off so well. Too well some might say.
He is a charming, funny, charismatic, handsome guy - the type who can take over a room when he enters it without even trying. We met and became friends first, which slowly progressed to us dating exclusively for the last 4 months.

However, during this time, as bad as this might sound - i failed in telling him about my STI (he himself is clean), and although i took as much precautions as necessary on my part, I didn't insist he wore a condom (i suggested not, he was the one that always was). And of course telling him afterwards was too little too late, there was weeks in between. 

Anyway when it came out, understandably he was annoyed but more disappointed. In the past any issues I had in relationships escalated quickly and resulted in shouting matches, but Brian wouldn't even let this happen. He was so calm the whole time, even when I wasn't and never spoke down to me once. He simply just wanted to talk. 

He explained that although the STI side of things isn't necessarily the end of the world, as there are certainly worse ones out there - but to him the main issue was the fact I could not tell him something like that, as if it was the other way around and there was even a 1% chance of putting me at risk his conscience would make him tell me - no matter how difficult a conversation it might be. 

If anything his argument showed me how a relationship should be. There was no shouting, no below the belt digs or backhand comments - he dealt with it so maturely, which upset me even more (im leaving out details for privacy reasons). 

This was all yesterday and I have been crying non stop since, ive texted him but no response. Is this well and truely finished?",23Mar2020,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt üëî and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off.

Why have I wasted so much time in this?"" Don't get me wrong, I love gaming. But I feel chess is more important to me. As soon as I devoted my time to this game, I felt liberated mentally. I'm no longer inclined to check the news often. I focused better and got things done faster. I feel ""emptier"" in my brain, as if it was filled with water and someone drained it. I don't think I plan to game ant time soon. I might revisit my PS4 every now and then but won't spend hours on end. My goal is to enter a professional tournament one day, nothing is easy.

I keep hearing about people saying that waking up at 4am, and 4am specifically, is amazing and they are more productive because of waking at specifically 4am. I believe this advise comes from Joe Rogans podcast where a few guests attributed waking at this time is particular as a reason for their success.

This advice completely overlooks everyone not on a standard 1st shift schedule. I have to be at work BY 4:30am, which means I have to wake up at 3am. Waking at 3am must make me more productive than those waking at 4am, naturally? Fuck no it doesn't. I'm dead ass tired and don't want to do jack shit when I get off work at 3:00pm. To full night's sleep and wake at 3am means I have to be in bed around 7pm. In the summer there is still sun and kids playing outside while I'm trying get a night's sleep.

How about those on 2nd shift that get off around midnight? I used to get off at 1:30am, home by 2:00am. I'm supposed to get 2 hours of sleep to wake at this magical 4am?

143,"Thinking about the different strategies, the main thing would be to identify and contain the virus, such as they've done in Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. And maybe China (not entirely trusting their good news). That's the ""containment strategy"", which involves testing people who are sick, then testing everyone they've come into contact with, then isolating all those who test positive until they're not contagious. A few places seem to have done well with that.

The US strategy, on the other hand, is to *only* test people who are sick, and ignore all the people they've come into contact with unless they show symptoms. Because we don't have the beds, we don't have enough tests, and we don't have the PPE in the healthcare system to manage the numbers.

We're not trying to contain the virus (the window of opportunity for that seems to be long gone), we're trying to slow it down, so everyone doesn't get sick all at once. Which would also overwhelm the system. The whole thing could take months at this rate, it's basically throwing in the towel and trying to make the best of things, regardless of whatever crap the president spews - always saying it's almost over. It's hardly started.

The main problem I see is that in Asia where they have done extensive testing, 30% or so of people who get it and spread it have no symptoms. You never catch those people unless you go back and test the people that the sick have had contact with. There are no plans to do that, which means the vectors continue to spread freely.",23Mar2020,1

I fast for 1-2 days because my body dysmorphia make me feel like I need to lose weight. Then I have a sudden realization that life doesn‚Äôt matter and I should just eat everything and then kill myself. So, I binge. I‚Äôm too pussy to throw up, so I restrict and fast some more. Then I go for a month only binging every fucking day. Gain a lot of weight. Do some other unhealthy coping mechanisms. And finally fast again. Repeat. Over and fucking over again.

152,"Early last month (February 1st/2nd) I had a weird illness that lasted about 2 weeks.

I didn't have a fever, but I never get fevers.

Early on I woke up with extreme sore throat that turned into a dry cough and I had stomach upset (going to the toilet) for about 3 days. Loss of appetite. Sore throat lasted over a week. Cough lingered.

I also had shortness of breath for a day and after this I was wheezy and had to wake up at night to use an inhaler. Time between symptoms and the last time I was in a busy place was 10 days. I had my flu shot late last year. But it felt very similar to the start of the flu except the stomach upset and shortness of breath for a day (felt like I had been running on a treadmill)

Resources are limited so I cannot get tested sadly, but I'm wondering if anyone here has.

Mom caught it off of me 7 days later, she had a fever of 38.5 C, muscle aches, and loss of taste + shortness of breath and wheeziness. No sneezing or congestion, still has a bit of a cough.",23Mar2020,1

Before the surgery I was comfortable with every part of my body bar my breasts but now I can‚Äôt look in the mirror without feeling overweight. I‚Äôm convinced that people will think I‚Äôve just gained weight which is the cause of my breast getting bigger.

157,"Just joined Reddit for some help. This is my first post which is honestly *embarrassing*, I don't wanna be a problematic here but I guess I got desperate. 

I'll be very brief. I have low confidence - in **speaking** in front of people and **some** low self-esteem.

**Backstory:** Mom was willing to pay for singing lessons but my C and S-E just blew my chance and I regret it everyday. **-** We had a dance presentation in church and I didn't mind dancing in the room but I purposely hurt my ankle before performance day for reasons. **-** There was an art club a few blocks from my house that had teachers to help but the other people who're already there had really good art so I didn't join.

I am confused about this- before I was a sassy, confident freak but then I suddenly turned timid out of nowhere. 2, I grew up in a very supportive circle - in the church, school and family but for some reason I'm getting this negative mindset. 

So, Is it normal to suddenly become timid? Is it normal to feel negative even when having a positive and supportive circle? How can I improve my C and S-E? I am planning on taking confidence courses so are those really helpful? Are these things even a problem or am I just overreacting?",23Mar2020,1

I'm feeling lost, unsure, confused

Im constantly thinking about some kind of problems in my life, and I feel like if I tried to explain to someone fully just what goes through my head I'd just seem like I crazy person. Probably because even I don't understand what's wrong.

Im not feeling sure what I'm doing with my career. Lately I just obsess about is this or that the right job for me to do in my life. I study psychology, but really I'm not feeling that invested in it.

In my home where I live, my relationship with my father is a mess.

I've started going to therapy but I just want to share with people that I'm feeling absolutely Terrible.

And now tbh I think to myself am I just doing this to get some kind of attention? Do I really feel bad? Idek, I'm that much of a mess",23Mar2020,1
