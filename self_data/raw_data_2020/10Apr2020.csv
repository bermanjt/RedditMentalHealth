Remind yourself that all of this will pass by. We can all go through it together. Seriou, if you have a safe place outside. Go outside. Get some air. Get some exercise. There’s more to life than just fear. We got a life. Taking away our social activities it’s making some people crazy. Honestly I was so anxious that it literally made me sick. But I’m getting better. I’m going out to my yard. I’m relaxing I’m breathing. There’s more to life than just death and sickness all this news is just seeing panic. Never forget that all of you live. That you’re here. That it’s your life. No virus no fear no nothing can change that. I’ll finish with a psalm verse:

“1,000 May fall at your side, and 10,000 at your right hand. But it shall not come near you.”

4,"Hey bros! I’ve been studying/living abroad for 2 years now and I’ve long come to term with my sexuality and accept myself for who I am.  I’ve currently been in a relationship for 3 months now. I recently got to meet my boyfriend’s family and they’re lovely people, but it just makes me upset that I’ll never be able to give him that kind of experience. I’m from an extremely conservative country and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to come out to my parents. We had this conversation before we became official as I’m quite aware that it’d be selfish to mislead him and wanted him to be fully aware. He said he wasn’t bothered and that what we have is too good to just throw it away and that we should see where our relationship takes us. So this isn’t more of a question but a rant. I’ve seen so many posts telling queer people the right thing to do in situations similar to mine would be to leave (if financially dependent) their family if they can’t accept and love them for who they are. While I somewhat understand the reasoning behind the advice I can’t help but disagree. Sexuality let alone homosexuality is not even a concept my parents fully grasp. My people have barely been exposed to homosexuality so not only would I have to come out to my parents but I’d have to introduce this completely foreign idea to their lives before coming out to them as that idea. Personally, I find it selfish to expect them to accept this entirely foreign concept and it would ruin my relationship with my family which is the last thing I’d want. I love my parents, especially my mom, too much to let that happen. We’ve suffered and endured too many things together and she has already made enough sacrifices in her life (and never once used them against me) for me. I’m just very frustrated when people think it’s internalized homophobia or lack of acceptance of oneself when they refuse to leave their family if they can’t “love and accept” them for who they are especially if they’re from extremely backward societies. I’m sorry if I sound stupid I know a lot of you will disagree with me as it is quite a controversial opinion I just had to rant somewhere.",10Apr2020,1

but the weird thing is, i have no idea where this came from. i can’t give a single reason. i have loving parents that have always made time for me (although they can be overprotective) i have great friends, i’m academically successful.

I have always held lots of things in and I think after 11 long years I need to completely let go of all of the these feelings. I have so much fucking anger inside of me its ridiculous and I literally thrive off of it. I lie to myself everyday about where my energy comes from and I lie to myself about the feelings I have in my head and in my body. I lie to everyone around me about my true-self and my true thoughts and I have no idea how to let them out. I am scared, I am alone, and I am not sure how to do this anymore. I do not want to die but I do not know how to let go of this. I have only known this for so long and do not know what I am without these feelings. I feel like if I truly let myself feel all of these things I will go crazy so I just let stay inside hidden. It is so much easier that way usually, but I cannot go on like this anymore and I must change myself.

13,"No one probably remembers, but a few months ago I posted on this subreddit that I was pursuing musical theatre as a career, and that I had just landed my first role in a musical. It was such a big moment for me, like all my hard work leading up to this was finally paying off and I could finally get my foot in the door for this career path.


But now with this global pandemic not only has the show been cancelled, but the rest of my senior year. No prom, no graduation, no senior trip, no senior skip day, that’s all gone. All these things that I and my peers have looked forward to doing for the past three years has been taken away from us. We didn’t think it would go this far. We didn’t think we would lose everything like this. We’re going to be known as the class that never made it.



I understand why the decision was made, and deep down even though it hurts I know it was the right thing to do. The lives of thousands of people across the globe are much more important then what goes on in a high school. I feel guilty even making this post for that reason, but I just have to vent someplace. 



I struggled so much with my mental health and home life all through out high school, and my light at the end of the tunnel was that I had to walk across that stage and get my diploma. I wanted to show everyone that I made it. 


People like my underclassmen friends, friends that graduated the year before me, adults in my family, teachers and staff through email, all apologize to me and my class constantly about how it’s such a shame that we had our senior year taken away from us. And even though I appreciate the sentiment, it’s just so hard to take to heart. Because all those people had all those memories we won’t get anymore. They had or will have a graduation and a prom, senior year is supposed to be the best year of your youth. They all got that. And we didn’t. I hate being bitter like this, I feel so bad, but it’s hard to believe they have empathy for what happened to us when they’ll never have to worry about it happening to them.


I know it’s just high school, and in ten years everything in high school isn’t going to matter. But it matters to me right now. Graduation was something I would pretend to have when I was a toddler, I would dress up in my mom’s bathrobe and pretend it was a graduation gown and pretend a paper scrap was a diploma. It never, ever occurred to me that it would never happen. It was a given. But now it’s gone, and it almost feels like me and my friends were robbed of one of the biggest moments of our lives. Our senior year was stolen from us. And it doesn’t matter how they try to make it up by doing an online Zoom party or having teachers send us motivational messages to remind us they care, it’ll never be the same. 


What was a guaranteed throughout our whole lives was taken away. And it just makes me wonder what’s going to disappear next?",10Apr2020,1

17,"My girl is 17,and the last time she had an iq test, she was 8 and basically nonverbal, so they scored her at 49. I always *thought* she was smarter, but I'm not a professional. Years pass, she gets As and Bs in school. She can't write, so it's all verbal assessments, so I'm kinda think teachers are grading her generously. I try doing workbooks with her at home, and she just will not do them. So, yeah, my kid has an iq of 49 and she just stats busy at school. She super musical, very outgoing and is now very talkative.

So, cue the pandemic. School was shut down four weeks ago. One week spring break. One week for teachers to get their lesson plans together. I'm still working full time the third week so we don't do much school.

I'm down to 32 hours now, so we work on math today. I've been told, again, I've seen no work, that she understands the basics of algebra. So, this week's lesson was exponents. They just did exponent of two, but she understood the lesson on the first try, wrote the answers with some help from me then USED THE FREAKING CALCULATOR TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM!

21,"So here's my story. I am 19, currently in North America. I moved here 2 years ago, and was in South Asia before that. Before moving here, I've been focused on studies and just serious stuff (read: boring) in general. I didn't listen to any songs during my teenage, any movies/books/series/shows whatsoever. 

Growing up I never had trouble in South Asia, as Asian communities in general have kids that are just focused and that's praised. I never felt the need to ""be in the know"". Fast forward to now and all my friends are talking about songs, their artists from the past or something that they have watched. I sit there clueless. Feeling completely alienated. I swear that celebrities would pass by and I wouldn't even know who they are.

How do I connect back to pop culture? I feel like so much has been out there that's it hard to find what I like and too much to catch up too. Don't know where to start or will I ever finish the must see shows/movies and stuff as it will take an incredible amount of time to see/hear everything. I feel pressurized which in turn isn't allowing me enjoy these things, which is one way the prime purpose of these things. What do I do?

29,"So, right now, I’m a high school senior. That obviously means that because of all this Covid stuff, I’m probably going to miss out on graduation, on my last week of high school, on all those final high school memories that I’m supposed to get to make, but I never saw all of that as a loss. In fact, I’ve been celebrating inside. High school was absolute crap for me from beginning to end, so I didn’t want to make any last memories. I just wanted to get out as quick as I could. In fact, before all of this Coronavirus stuff happened, I planned to keep going until the last day, induce vomiting to get out of graduation, and then move on and never look back again. That’s how terrible I felt about high school overall. So I saw it as a blessing when I realized that I’d never have to go back again.

Deep down, I knew how I felt was selfish. I knew all of my classmates besides me were looking forward to their end of the year stuff, and it was crappy of me to be happy about all of this, and even to wish for it to extend to the end of the school year. I didn’t wish for more infections of course, I was just hoping our state government would extend the lockdown long enough that I’d have no more school left. And sure enough, it happened, and I celebrated.

But I just watched a video. It showed up in my recommended randomly, for no reason that I could see. It was a “Dear Class of 2020” video.

31,"I'm posting this on my main account because the first step is accepting myself and facing my problem. 

I hate everything about myself. My skin, my color, my size, everything. The only thing I love is my eyebrows, my hair, my eyes and my grades. I have no friends. It's almost as if I'm not good enough. I know I am. 

""But why not therapy?"" Because therapy ***does not work for me***. Trust me. I've tried. Going to a counselor that I've met 3 times and pouring my heart out is not affective. I am physically unable to speak to another human being other than my mom about this issue. I get reduced to tears whenever I even think about seeing a therapist. 

Why is it that every time I find a person I can trust they backstab me? Or blackmail me? Or turn on me? Why am I the one to not a have a friend group and sit at lunch, to be noticed by no one and spoken to by no one?

My anxiety says ""What if you.... What if they're looking at... What if they don't like...."" ""You aren't good enough"" Yes I am. But why can't I see that?

Why do I loathe other girls for what they wear and their perfect body? Why am I jealous for other girls' bodies and beautiful muscles and bubbly and attractive personalities? 

Jealousy? I have never heard a word such as that. Why in such a time of supposed mental growth do I feel the need to add such a negative word to my once virgin vocabulary; once filled with words of kindness and love. 

Why do I feel as if no one accepts me? Why cant I find anyone who is willing to be my friend without me having to give them chances? 

It's me. Yet it is not. 

I cant look in the mirror without being sad. I cant even change out for gym without feeling like I am underweight. 

Doctors, oh the doctors. Do you have a eating disorder? ""No, I'm just petit."" It hurts. 

""You're so skinny"" ""You need to eat"" ""Just binge some junk food"" I laugh it off. ""Haha. I know."" It hurts. It makes me so sad. People may not realise it. But it hurts. 

I try to workout to get my body looking more appealing. I simply get discouraged by the seemingly never ending cycle of motivation and desperation. 

Why? How can I judge if I am truly ugly if I cannot see my own looks or personality with a clean slate? How do I know that people aren't silently judging me or wishing they weren't spending time with me?

When will I be able to find my 2 or 3 friends that stay up with me until 3 am laughing while watching movies? When will that be me? When? 

I want this never-ending nightmare to end. Not through death (never through death) but through an awakening. You are good enough. Accept who you are.

It was small about 15 to 20 at first and then 7 to 10 or so. Finally, two days ago there were 3 that popped up after about a month of no activity. The crushing reality that I hadnt defeated these parasites after the last battle almost destroyed me.

But I perservered. I bagged everything I needed to. I cleaned everything I could. I finally convinced my landlords to get the pest control people but with covid I had to spray myself. I DID ALL OF THIS. Normally I wouldve broke down. Tried to kill myself or just got really high. Now I'm sitting on my freshly encased mattress and boxspring with leg dishes to catch the bugs and a room that is probably cleaner than when I moved in. I dealt with a problem and I perservered.

I understand that when you live your life guided by a moral code you can be too stubborn if it's too much. You can become narrow and stuck-up in your ways, which I don't want to be. It's equally important to keep an open mind, to be able to look at things from different angles and broaden your horizon.

Coming to the realization that it was in fact not a joke, I proceeded to take the notice to the office and kindly speak to a manager in a very anti-Karen tone to see if something could be worked out due to the fact that (forgive this run-on sentence) I don't have x amount of dollars to go drop on some new tires rn because, hello, I'm jobless. Unsurprisingly, the property manager was a complete bitch and threw the its-in-violation-of-the-lease-you-signed card. Apparently, theres a small section that outlines if your vehicle isn't in ""working condition at all times” it will be removed from the premises. What a dick move right?

May I add, this same ""luxury"" apartment complex has not sent one email regarding the COVID situation (like every other semi-decent business in the world), is continuing to keep all amenities open including the gym and pool (who knows if they're disinfecting anything, they certainly weren't before the pandemic), and are refusing to extend rent-relief in any way, shape, or form to residents who have lost their jobs.

Under normal conditions (i.e.- the world not succumbing to a deadly plague and me having a freaking job) I wouldn't hesitate to comply with the tire thing, obviously. But what ethical human being sits on the decision to tow somebody's car during a time like this? It just amazes me that in the midst of global uproar and economic downfall, the housing industry is taking advantage of it's residents by disregarding their health, safety, and financial well-being. How do they think they're simply going to swing by unscathed by this impending recession?

Also, I find it mildly disturbing there exists no legal safety net for renters in the event that a global emergency prevents them from obliging to EVERY detail of their lease. Like, wtf America?

Maybe I'm overreacting. I get that. But just know, people will remember the companies that took care of them during this time, and the ones that shat upon them.",10Apr2020,1

52,"When I was maybe 12 I was out trick or treating with my friend and one of the houses we got to just had like 6 cans of soup set out on the porch. We knocked on the door and a college aged guy opened and very obviously didn’t have candy and I guess he just forgot it was halloween? So instead I asked if I could take a can of soup. I had noticed them immediately because there were just unopened cans of soup on the porch. 

I think about this every now and then and Im still confused as to why this household just had soup out on their porch. They definitely didn’t have them out for trick or treaters because he was really confused when I asked for the soup. He let me take a can. 

Why did they have cans of soup on their porch? How did they forget it was halloween? Were the cans of soup important? Did they have some game involving the soup planned? Did I ruin whatever’s plans they had for the soup? Would the soup have just been left if I didn’t take one? I probably would have just stolen a can if he said no.

53,"All I did when I was a kid was from the moment I got home from school until I was kicked off the computer was write stories. I would hardly ever finish one, and would start a new one the second an idea came into my head. Now that I’m older I have been wondering for a while how many stories I wrote. I counted the ones I have been able to transfer to my laptop from the computer and the total was 62. Each story was a decent length, like at least 30 pages. Most of them we’re LONG and I would have an extra document describing the characters for reference and some sort of plot. Reading them back, I definitely think I had a talent. Of course they’re not good, but at my age I wrote better than most adults could. I know there were more stories on the original old computer, as well as other computers around my house but all computers are gone from my house and have been replaced by laptops. I was only lucky enough to transfer some from the original computer but I’m so glad I have them. I like reading them every now and then, when a story I haven’t thought about since I was 10 pops into my head and I have to know what happens. Just wanted to share.",10Apr2020,1

63,"My entire life I have been thinking about everything.  Figuring out who I am, life and death, trying to understand all of my character and personality traits, my strengths and weaknesses.  Understanding relationships and the pitfalls other people encounter.  A lot of this would result in annoying my friends with long form discussion about not-so-fun topics.

""Who cares?"" ""You think too much man"" ""You just gotta stop thinking"".  I would reassure them that I am 'getting my work over with now' and ""I feel as though I am getting close to being done"" and I'm finally getting to the finish line.  I wanted to know the deep root of everything, not just baseline truths.  I was always skeptic of almost everything I heard and made sure to investigate thoroughly.  

4 things I know to be true after practically 8 years of inquiry.  


And to be fair, it's nothing new, the egyptians were describing all of this with the symbolism behind the eye of horus.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

0) Try to envision your life as if you woke up tomorrow and you were all alone on an empty planet.  There was not a single building or anything to remind you of a life that once was.  Nobody was around, there were no animals or anything symbolizing any sort of culture.

First, you would realise how much time we spend on actions and thinking surrounding the relationships we have to others.  Fear of being judged often leaves us not fully expressing ourselves or we strive strongly our entire lives for materialistic wealth so we can feel better than others.  All the problems the mind creates for us would be revealed.

Also what would we think about who created the world we live in?  We would think that it is us and identify that we must be the world that we are inhabiting.

&amp;#x200B;

1)  The problems all humans beings share is seeing the world in a view of subject object.  
Our mind, the thing that we believe to be us, creates an experience of the world as subject object.  
The majority of the interactions we have with the world and others reinforces this mindset.  
If we are the subject, everything else is object.  
As we identify the ""I"" in statements like ""I am hungry"" to be the physical body, we naturally see everything else in object to that experience.    


This was extremely important to our survival but in a land which is bountiful for many, is driving us to fulfilling desire after desire and wasting much of our time and sanity.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Every desire we have is due to identification with subject &gt; object.  


Deep down inside of you, if you meditate for long hours, study,  begin to work on yourself, begin being more kind to yourself and those around you and start to rid yourself of negative habits and perceptions,  you will begin to experience deeper levels of who you really are.  These experiences I can only really describe as 'bliss', 'wholeness', 'fulfilled', 'contentment' and ultimately a feeling that this is enough and you are enough - ceasing of longing for perfection and acquiring.  


For many of us this sense of contentment is felt, although temporarily, at a moment of a good orgasm, being recognized for an achievement, know you did something really good for another person, when you are truly connecting with someone you love, when you are in the zone and working progressively towards a task you are looking forward to completing, etc.  


This sense of being is over quickly as we have been distracted by a particular emotion, task or goal acquisition as to feel in harmony with life and ultimately who we really are - we are life.  What is stopping this from the permanent way to experience life boils down to our identification to the body and to a mindset of subject object.

&amp;#x200B;

3)  Who are you really are, how to stay in bliss and how to feel like enough  


You must change your identification of what you see as yourself.  
You should rest your idea of who you are based on one idea.  
Who are you when you are asleep but not dreaming?  
That is the same thing that says ""I---- am hungry""  
""I ------ am sad""  
That feeling of ""I""

That is who you really are - that part of you also never dies.  
Furthermore

If you have been fortunate enough to have some extremely vibrant lucid dreams, you will find that they are exactly like the experience you are having while being awake, just you are in control.  You look down at your body - its there, your hands, they are there too.  You are walking around in a world your mind is making up, showing you how easily it is to trick you into believing in a world.

  
Regardless of what religious beliefs or other, whether you want to believe that/experience that or not, one thing is for certain.

You were unborn for however many billions of years  
If you are lucky, you will live to be 100.  
Think about when you were 5.    
That seemed like just a second ago.  
When you are 99 and about to die, your whole life will feel like a second ago.  


This world is a dream.  


4)  How to see it this way and not just have it an intellectual concept that is in one ear out the other.  


It will happen inside of you all by itself.  


As you get older, life is going to throw shit at you.  


You will have pets who contract serious diseases such as cancer.  You will spend thousands of dollars to do absolutely everything you can for it and sit by as they suffer and ultimately die.  


You will have issues with friends and family that you will do everything you possibly can in your power to help them and it does nothing to help them or change them.  


Over and over again you will experience terrible circumstances surrounding relationships, illness, sickness and death as you come to terms with how little power you actually have.

In moments like these, or perhaps after a few hundred rounds of moments like these, the person you are who sees the world as subject object is breaking - you finally come to terms with the fact that you can't control or ultimately change anything.  The only thing you can do for relief is to change yourself, and then it is ready to delve into your true identity of what is ""I"".

&amp;#x200B;

5)  Identification with the I, now what.  


a)  Form.  ""When you name me, you take away all that I can be"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle to even call someone depressed or anxious as the label will often reinforce a permanency to the ailment.

 if you name something, let's say you call a form of a cat a cat.  The mind is mentally projecting a certain list of things in how a cat should be.  That's why we react so strongly and curiously when they do something out of character.  ""My cat acts like a dog"".   You will see how your concept of form is invading how you perceive the outside world, and ultimately come to understand that your entire experience, from the views you hold so dear in relation to religion, politics, etc, are ultimately just a limiting projection in your own mind.  ""If a tree falls in the woods...""  Think of the implications to absolutely everything you have a name for.

For example, a ""Chair"" may seem hard, but its actually just energy slowed down to a certain vibratory rate as to seem as though its solid and we are energy slowed to a certain vibratory rate wherein we cannot pass through it.  Then our mind thinks its 'chair'.  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

b) Absolute gratitude and bliss.  
Every single person you have seen as negative or an enemy is just a projection.  They are just you in different forms.  The bees, the wasps, the cats, the bully you had, it was all just you.  As you start to see people as you instead of object, you have gratitude for having experienced it rather than seeing it as obligation that commonly is associated with objectification.  I feel so blessed to have every single bit of love that I have in my life, even if it may not be all that I wish it could be.   Now you have no enemies - you begin to understand why some people are against capital punishment. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Everything you see, everything around you from the tiniest atom to the biggest skyscraper, all just energy that due to time/space and the senses have slowed down to a state that you can perceive with your survivalistic brain.",10Apr2020,1

67,"This might be a long one. Let me start of by saying dating has been really hard on me lately, im still young i know, not even 20 yo yet. Ive had a girlfriend for 1,5 years at the end of school and my start of time at university. The thing is about my break up with her is, it wasn't that she did it, i accepted that and moved on after a while, its how she did it.

It was the day after we looked at several appartments, since we were looking to move in together, i have never been so happy and optimistic in  for the future than ive been there. But then, literally next morning, she was gone, without a word, without an agrument, just a semi-long text she sent me afternoon, telling me why she thought it wouldnt work. I have trust issues ever since. Any time my best friend, who is a girl, sleeps at my place she has to promise me like 4 or 5 times, that she will be there when i wake up. I know its stupid, but that shit scared me, maybe even for life.

Following the next months, i have been dating a bit, i met some girls in local-community apps, met up, it didnt work for me, noone to blame, im still friends with one of them. But then came the next girl, it was insane. We literally met the day and already annoyed the people around us like we were a fresh couple of extroverts. It, sadly, was just one day she was in my city, but i swear to god, the walk from the student bar where we sat, to the place she stayed, was the happiest ive been in my life. She leaned in on me, gave me quick kisses on the nose, looked deep in my eyes like noone before. Sadly i did the schMosby and didnt kiss her cause of my trust issues. Of course we texted afterwards and lon story short, it was all perfect till i brought up that i have trust issues and deal with loneliness because of how i got dumped. She first acted like it was ok, but its wasnt. She grew distant, stopped being cute with me and everything. I met her once again, planned a super nice date to maybe win her back, but she literally left halfway through to meet up with a guy she met a party two days prior....ye my trust issues grew.

I have psoriasis on my face. I wear a bandana most of the time to cover it up, ive met a girl a barhopping night from the university. We were out of our head drunk when we met, but we clicked. We didnt remember a thing, but decided to meet up. It was fun, untill she ghosted me after a meetup where i didnt wear my bandana. It hurt bad, there grew my body issues.

I still met another girl but she just said, i wasnt her league after weeks of fun and cute texting, when i asked her if shed want to meet up. It hurts.

That werent the only ones, the last one is more like a category of people i met.

Now im lying in my bed, trying my best not to cry all the time, but its hard. Im lonely, really really lonely. And im insanely scared that it will stay like this. Im not a good looking guy, im kinda chubby on some parts and the psoriasis of course. Both things i cant really change unless i take hard drugs and work out 4-5 times a week, but i dont have the time for that.

So now to my point, its hard for me to hate these guys. Because lets face it, many many young men feel like me, seeing their hot friends even getting approached on the street from time to time, while dating for them is just a 98% chance of getting hurt badly, which is bad, cause they are already hurting. And of course you ask yourself, whos fault is this shit??? And there are really only 3 answers.

If you choose to believe you are at fault, you spiral down, start hating yourself and your very being. Thats the part i chose.

You can blame the datingsystem as a whole, than you spiral down into this retarded world of pickup artists and other shit, where you just become a heartless predator and a creep.

Or you can, like the incels, blame the women. And start going deeper and deeper into misogyny and shit.

And the thing is, i cant blame them that bad, i know how they felt at the start, and probably the only reason im not an incel is because of my best friend, who showed me time and time again the wholeheartness a women can give. But most peeps dont have that luck. Of course they are wrong, stupid and and frankly dangerous, but they are also victims, because lets be real here, they have been hurt badly time and time again with no net to catch them ever, could you say about yourself if youd be in this kind of situation, you wouldnt turn your frustration and your anger into hate? Many might, but all are at risk of doing so.

Its always said, that you have to love yourself to love others, which is bullshit, i hated myself when meeting my gf of 1,5 years. And it never interfered with the relationship, in the contrary, it helped me alot, i stopped hating myself because of it, of course i started again after i had to start dating again, but hey..

Dating is shit, its luck based, and if its been easy for you, you are majorly lucky, and you should stop making fun of people who are not single by choice, people are trying.

69,"The Merriam-Webster dictionary technically defines code-switching as “the switching from the linguistic system of one language or dialect to that of another.” In everyday layman’s terms, however, code-switching simply (yet more broadly) means “the modifying of one’s speech, behavior, appearance, etc. to adapt to different socio-cultural norms.” Ok... now that we’ve got the definition out of the way, let’s discuss the reasons why Black people code-switch. 

I saw an article by Amina Dunn on the FACTANK website that states “Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely than their white counterparts to say they at least sometimes feel the need to change the way they express themselves when they are around people with different racial and ethnic backgrounds – a phenomenon sometimes called “[code-switching](https://www.britannica.com/topic/code-switching).” And black college graduates, particularly those under 50, are especially likely to feel this is necessary.”

I saw yet another article online titled “Black And Biracial Americans Wouldn’t Need To Code-Switch If We Lived In A Post-Racial Society” by Chandra D. L. Waring that states “… because dominant culture is white, whiteness has been baked into institutions as natural, normal and legitimate. So there’s much more incentive for people of color to code-switch – to adapt to the dominant culture to improve their prospects. White people rarely, if ever, feel this same pressure in their daily lives.

Even the late W.E.B Dubois, world-renowned scholar and civil rights advocate, wrote about code-switching more than a century ago. In his book “The Souls of Black Folk” Dubois said “For African Americans, it (code-switching) is a performative expression that has not only helped some of us thrive in mainstream culture—it has helped many of us simply survive.

Now all of this is good in terms of seeking a positive personal outcome, but I have to ask my Black brothers and sisters two very important questions:

**1.** Why bother to code-switch when you can simply work at improving your vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, enunciation and articulation of the English language? 

**2.** Why wait until you get to a job interview, perform a lecture or business presentation or mixed company that includes or is predominantly White to display your natural-born intellect (you DO have this) and your ability to articulate yourself intelligently? 

These are things we should do for ourselves; AMONG ourselves and allow it to become part of who are as intelligent Black people and individuals. Why did I add the word ‘individuals.’ Well… the word ‘individuals’ was added to emphasize the fact that we, as Black people, tend to get so caught up in being “Black” that we literally and mistakenly impose too much of the negative aspects of our habits, speech and mentality upon one another in the name of Black culture. It is the year 2020, but many of us are still yet to leave that “plantation in our minds” and look at anything that resembles standard English and decent grammar as “acting White”… and we have GOT to outgrow and get past this nonsense Black people. It’s time to evolve!

African American Vernacular English (or AAVE), with all of it’s bad grammar and messed up word pronunciation is part of who we are as Black people in America, and I get that. It is something that is embedded in our souls due largely to the effects of coming to America as slaves and having to learn English the best we could and passing it down… again… I get all that. Yes we have our unique slang, jive-talk, trash talk and sometimes these things are a necessary evil, and I do it too (most times just for fun)... but is AAVE, slang, jive-talk, trash talk and ghetto mentality the sum total of who we are and what we are as Black people? I think not, and we have proven this time and time again, but it seems that a great many of us did not receive the memo.

These are modern times and we, as Black people, need stop trying to hold each other back with all the tribal and crab-in-the-barrel nonsense. We must stop trying to make one another believe and made to feel that we have to settle for and accept the subpar and bad grammar skills that were passed down to us. We should NOT be expected to be inarticulate or speak some ghetto dialect 24/7 just to make certain family members, friends, classmates or co-workers feel comfortable just because this is what they are used to from an interracial standpoint or what they from a racist or stereotypical standpoint. This is not an authentication of our Blackness. It is merely an acceptance of ignorance… no more, no less.

Therefore, in contrast to the authors I discussed earlier, I say let’s use reasonably good English and speak coherently, sensibly, rationally and intelligently for ourselves. Let’s think above and resist the tribal narrow-mindedness that so many of us experience within the Black community and the overwhelming influence of ebonics. Let’s refuse to dumb-down for the racist who would encourage us to speak like “normal Black people” with a hidden translation that means “act like a nigger.” Continue to educate yourself; work on your vocabulary, word usage, pronunciation, enunciation and grammar skills. If you do this for yourself, then trust me… you will soon learn there is no real NEED to code-switch because all you ever needed to do is simply be an intelligent BLACK person.",10Apr2020,1

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence",10Apr2020,1
84,"Sorry for so much writing, I needed to get some things off my chest.

So as many other people have, I lost my job due to the coronavirus. I worked at a small business in a city where everything was shut down pretty quickly when all this started happening. I live with three other roommates (who I met on Craigslist, but we've grown to become good friends). They all are still getting paid their full salaries and just working from home. I've been trying to stay positive and just hope that unemployment pulls through, but going into week 4 of no income and absolutely no work to do from home I'm starting to get depressed.

They are all working from common areas of the house, so I feel like I'm constantly tiptoeing around them. I feel obligated to stay hidden in my bedroom because they're actually working and I have nothing to do anyway.

They're all saving money during this because of not going out to restaurants/bars every week. So they've started online shopping and splurging on things they normally wouldn't. They're talking about what they're going to buy with their stimulus checks. (im still panicking about when I'll even get mine because of not choosing direct deposit with my tax returns)

Finally, they're all complaining all the time about being bored because they can't go out and do what they want (go on dates, random shopping trips, go out drinking, etc.) They leave the house any chance they can to go sit at parks or go to target or the liquor store, it doesn't feel like they're taking any of this seriously. 

I feel like I'm completely losing it with them. I've tried to show them articles about people who are really struggling right now, or remind them that they live with someone who's life is crumbling because of all this and  they just continue to complain. I don't know how to keep my sanity while living with people who are on the complete opposite end during this pandemic.

Obviously it is a bit of jealousy, I'd love to be online shopping with no money problems right now. Fuck I'd love to be able to afford the groceries I want right now. It is their money and they are obviously allowed to do whatever they want with it, but its like they can't even remember the person sitting across from them, that they're talking to, is drowning right now. 

Not sure my reason for this post, maybe to hear from other people who are struggling but managing to keep it positive? Recommendations on how I can keep my sanity?  or maybe I just needed to vent about the people I'm stuck around 24/7.",10Apr2020,1
85,"I'm not going to shit on women and I'm not memeing. I just personally really dislike them - I'm not gay either.

When I see women I actually get agitated. I don't like being around them. The last time I saw my mother and spoke to her I got so agitated I started pacing back and forth and she called me out on it, I couldn't help it I was so pissed off. When I overhear women speak in a lecture room or in public I get extremely aggravated by it and want to shut them up unless they are saying something that interests me (very rare).  I loathe them on a visceral level, I don't have to go out of my way to feel this when I hear a woman talking or see them, it comes automatically. Sometimes I'm alright with them when they have little kids with them and are being nice to those kids though, because I like kids. I literally do not speak to women at all or go out of my way to interact with them at all because it makes me so uncomfortable.

91,"I gave birth to our baby 7 weeks ago. It was really traumatic and I nearly died, because I lost two liters of blood (doctors estimated I’ve around 5 liters of blood in my small body, so 2 liters is a lot) and needed blood transfusions, which weakened my immune system a lot. The first 4 weeks were hard because I couldn’t walk any longer than 3 minutes before I was out of breath and needed to sit down immediately. I thought it was just unfair that I experienced something like this, but I was just grateful that I survived.  My husband is home during quarantine due to his workplace closing down (which means he doesn't get any money which worries him a lot).  
Yesterday was just the perfect day and I need to tell someone about it because I’m just grateful for everything: baby woke me up really early around 6 a.m. and I got up so my husband could sleep some extra hours. I just sat in the living room, played with our baby and watched the birds on our balcony while breastfeeding. Than FaceTimed my mom so she could see our baby and my husband got up shortly after that and joined the call. We had a great conversation (which seemed impossible just a few years ago because I’ve always had problems with my family - being home was toxic for me, my mom wouldn’t let me make my own decisions and always had a problem with my husband (then boyfriend(&amp; previous boyfriends)) because I spend too much time with him and not with her. That’s why I basically moved in with my husband after being a couple for one week - we were 16 and lived with his parents. It all stopped when we got married because she somehow could pass the responsibility for me on to my husband). After we hung up my husband made breakfast for us. We ate, played with our baby and I asked my husband if he could watch our baby as soon as it falls asleep so I can do a little bit of gardening on our balcony. He agreed and after breastfeeding baby fell asleep and even stayed asleep.  
So I was on our balcony, it was warm and sunny. I could hear birds singing and smell the flowers. I put some flowers into bigger pots while thinking about how good I feel and how much fun gardening is. My husband opens the door and tells me that I look really beautiful today. I say “Yes, it’s because I’m truly happy” and I see how happy this makes him. I proceed with gardening and my thoughts wander back to what I said to my husband. I realize I’ve never felt this happy in my entire life and how grateful I am to be alive. I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety since I was 10 and I never thought I would make it past 18 and every new day was an accomplishment but a regret at the same time, but I always told myself that someday I’ll be proud of myself and that my future-self will be thankful for this when everything is finally going to be okay. And here I am now: almost 22, have been depressed for only a handful of weeks during the last 1 1/2 years and my anxiety is getting better slowly. I guess today’s that day. I’ve waited for this for so long.  
I don’t feel this emptiness any longer, because our baby is finally here (we planned on getting a baby this year for the past 4 years).   
Later we even baked a cake which we had for dinner and afterward, I could draw something while baby was sleeping on my lap. My husband played video games in the same room and we just enjoy this opportunity quarantine gave us.

Sending out love to everyone who’s alone during quarantine or stuck in a toxic home or working during these crazy times. It’s going to be over someday and you’ll look back and be proud of yourself and that you’ve managed all those difficult times. Stay safe!   

(Sorry if it’s hard to read, Englisch isn’t my first language and I slept like 4 hours every night for the past 7 weeks)   

TL;DR: happiest day so far, grateful to be alive, for finally having a baby, better relationship with mother, more time with husband, more time for gardening, drawing and video games due to quarantine.

She always convinced me the guy was a friend, and I really believed her. I was too naive and stupid to look at the obvious signs because I really really liked her.

She told me she loved me just a couple weeks ago, I said it back. Then recently the signs got pretty obvious, so I questioned her about it and she got so mad at me for not believing her/ trusting her. 

The devil on my shoulder wants me to be an asshole to her, and to tell the other poor soul because he doesn’t know. The angel on my shoulder wants me to move on.

I told her I needed to speak with her so we met up, I told her I knew and she told me “you can hate me, you can hate me” she got into her car and sped away. She then blocked my number. All I want is closure for me to move on but she won’t give it to me, won’t speak to me.

This was Tuesday and yesterday I saw her leaving the other guys neighborhood on my way home from work. The poor bastard doesn’t know.

You have a new family now and you're closer to them than you've ever been with anyone, it's what you always wanted.

I live with my brothers now, we'd die for each other, we'd do anything for each other. We share a big house in town and it started out great, in fact it's been great for years.

I'm so fortunate to have found the best friends anyone could ever asked for, but now things are changing.

I was going to church around 8 o'clock it was fall at the time so it was already dark and it was raining

Half way to the church this guy shows up all of the sudden
He didn't have an umbrella so he yells at me to wait for him. I was surprised and didn't expect anything like that, when he got to me i started to speed up because i got a weird vibe from him and i wanted to get to the church as fast as possible to get rid of him and i thought he would speed up also so he can stay under umbrella but nope. He took my umbrella out of my hand and told me to slow down a bit. I was scared at this point so i said okay. He wasn't walking normally he slowed down a lot (like those small short steps) and i did also (i was scared and there was no people around not even cars) He started touching my hair saying that it looks really beautiful and asked me why do i look sad (i was scared) he even said something about me being a beautiful girl (i don't remember exactly how he said the sentance) then he started moving my umbrella closer to himself (i figured out that maybe he did that to make me move closer to him because of rain but i didn't and my whole right side of head and body got wet) 
He started asking me questions like: what's my name and surname, how old i am, where i live, where i go to school, where was i before and where was i heading. I lied about everything except my age and the church. His tone of the voice changed after i said that and he told me that he's happy because not many people my age go to the church. i just smiled nervously. Then he starts telling me about some place where i can ask some people for help if i ever needed it and he wanted to show it to me ( i honestly don't know what he was talking about)(now we got to the path where if you go right you get to the church and on that whole right path are benches next to each other in a row) i declined and said that i really needed to go to the church, took my umbrella quickly from his hand and started to speed up. I didn't heard any footsteps i think he was just standing there looking at me (i felt that strange feeling as if someone was watching me) i was to scared to look behind so i really don't know but i do know that he didn't move because i would hear it if he did..... After i got out of the church (about 1 hour later) i saw a man sitting on a bench (the clothes were the same as the guy from before) so i took the other longer path to my home so he wouldn't see me

107,"My boyfriend Mark (34M) and I (30F) were spending the quarantine together in my apartment until we had a major argument two nights ago. We agreed it would be for the best if he left, so he packed his belongings and moved back to his place. We haven’t called it the end yet, but I am fairly certain this is where our relationship has run its course.

I adore Mark. He is kind, trustworthy, honest, caring, selfless, attractive, easygoing, and responsible. However, our relationship was like a sinusoid with long, happy highs and sudden, hurtful lows. Even that Wednesday, everything was going perfectly – we had dinner and were getting ready to play a board game – until it suddenly wasn’t.

The problem is, we don’t see the world the same way. We hold different things valuable, and we find it hard, if not impossible, to find common ground. We think differently, too. It’s almost as if we spoke different languages sometime – we don’t seem to be able to convey the meaning to the other, and misunderstandings arise. 

Over the past six months, there were a couple of moments when I believed we should break up, always arising after a similar, major disagreement. However, I cared about this person so much that I couldn’t bring myself to end the relationship. I didn’t want to be with anyone but him. And I still don’t.

It’s pathetic, but it’s my first long-term relationship. We've been together for over two years, and he makes me comfortable in my skin. I am afraid I will not meet anyone else whom I can trust as much as I trust him.

109,"Words, context and perspective matter. and it is for this reason that I decided to identify myself as a Black man upfront to avoid a misinterpretation in terms of the intent of this post. As a matter of fact, I had to revise the title and add this edit for the same reasons. Now... let's get on with the post.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Merriam-Webster dictionary technically defines code-switching as “the switching from the linguistic system of one language or dialect to that of another.” In everyday layman’s terms, however, code-switching simply (yet more broadly) means “the modifying of one’s speech, behavior, appearance, etc. to adapt to different socio-cultural norms.” Ok... now that we’ve got the definition out of the way, let’s discuss the reasons why Black people code-switch.

I saw an article by Amina Dunn on the FACTANK website that states “Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely than their white counterparts to say they at least sometimes feel the need to change the way they express themselves when they are around people with different racial and ethnic backgrounds – a phenomenon sometimes called “[code-switching](https://www.britannica.com/topic/code-switching).” And black college graduates, particularly those under 50, are especially likely to feel this is necessary.”

I saw yet another article online titled “Black And Biracial Americans Wouldn’t Need To Code-Switch If We Lived In A Post-Racial Society” by Chandra D. L. Waring that states “… because dominant culture is white, whiteness has been baked into institutions as natural, normal and legitimate. So there’s much more incentive for people of color to code-switch – to adapt to the dominant culture to improve their prospects. White people rarely, if ever, feel this same pressure in their daily lives.

Even the late W.E.B Dubois, world-renowned scholar and civil rights advocate, wrote about code-switching more than a century ago. In his book “The Souls of Black Folk” Dubois said “For African Americans, it (code-switching) is a performative expression that has not only helped some of us thrive in mainstream culture—it has helped many of us simply survive.

Now all of this is good in terms of seeking a positive personal outcome, but I have to ask my Black brothers and sisters two very important questions:

**1.** Why bother to code-switch when you can simply work at improving your vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, enunciation and articulation of the English language?

**2.** Why wait until you get to a job interview, perform a lecture or business presentation or mixed company that includes or is predominantly White to display your natural-born intellect (you DO have this) and your ability to articulate yourself intelligently?

These are things we should do for ourselves; AMONG ourselves and allow it to become part of who are as intelligent Black people and individuals. Why did I add the word ‘individuals.’ Well… the word ‘individuals’ was added to emphasize the fact that we, as Black people, tend to get so caught up in being “Black” that we literally and mistakenly impose too much of the negative aspects of our habits, speech and mentality upon one another in the name of Black culture. It is the year 2020, but many of us are still yet to leave that “plantation in our minds” and look at anything that resembles standard English and decent grammar as “acting White”… and we have GOT to outgrow and get past this nonsense Black people. It’s time to evolve!

African American Vernacular English (or AAVE), with all of it’s bad grammar and messed up word pronunciation is part of who we are as Black people in America, and I get that. It is something that is embedded in our souls due largely to the effects of coming to America as slaves and having to learn English the best we could and passing it down… again… I get all that. Yes we have our unique slang, jive-talk, trash talk and sometimes these things are a necessary evil, and I do it too (most times just for fun)... but is AAVE, slang, jive-talk, trash talk and ghetto mentality the sum total of who we are and what we are as Black people? I think not, and we have proven this time and time again, but it seems that a great many of us did not receive the memo.

These are modern times and we, as Black people, need stop trying to hold each other back with all the tribal and crab-in-the-barrel nonsense. We must stop trying to make one another believe and made to feel that we have to settle for and accept the subpar and bad grammar skills that were passed down to us. We should NOT be expected to be inarticulate or speak some ghetto dialect 24/7 just to make certain family members, friends, classmates or co-workers feel comfortable just because this is what they are used to from an interracial standpoint or what they from a racist or stereotypical standpoint. This is not an authentication of our Blackness. It is merely an acceptance of ignorance… no more, no less.

Therefore, in contrast to the authors I discussed earlier, I say let’s use reasonably good English and speak coherently, sensibly, rationally and intelligently for ourselves. Let’s think above and resist the tribal narrow-mindedness that so many of us experience within the Black community and the overwhelming influence of ebonics. Let’s refuse to dumb-down for the racist who would encourage us to speak like “normal Black people” with a hidden translation that means “act like a nigger.” Continue to educate yourself; work on your vocabulary, word usage, pronunciation, enunciation and grammar skills. If you do this for yourself, then trust me… you will soon learn there is no real NEED to code-switch because all you ever needed to do is simply be an intelligent BLACK person.",10Apr2020,1

112,"It's a Matrix quote from the oracle, and I'll tell you why I used it. I clearly remember when my downfall started. I vividly recall making a conscious choice in my head and then deciding to make the wrong choice all those years ago. It started a snowball effect and ultimately created a version of myself I was not comfortable with. A decade or two later I decided to undo the self-harm from that by making one positive choice after another. I think I've succeeded but the choice is there again, it's always there. Perhaps for each of us. It was a simple choice of morality in my mind but regardless it changed me forever after that point. I was probably too young or immature to handle the choice itself or the fallout from it. I'll stop beating around the bush, I choose to indulge in ""adult online content"" at a young age after a friend introduced me to it. 

Before my friend, who I have long since stopped associating with, I had a healthy view of pron. Don't do it. Why even do it? The way those actors treated women is no way I wanted to see anyone be treated. ""C'mon man don't be a p\*ssy everyone watches pron. Are you gay or something?"" Back then being called gay was enough to peer pressure you into anything second only to being called a p\*ssy. Now it's just a bigoted outdated way to coerce someone.  After he was gone, one day when I was alone I thought about visiting common xxx sites and I remember thinking this which I'll translate for brevity: ""If I do this my 'innocence' will be gone. My perspective I have about women will change. Why would I do this? Because it will... be pleasant, to do so.""

I wish I never made that choice. At least not at that time. I think I was 13 then.

When I got much older I attributed my self-destructive ways to this one seemingly harmless choice because, ""everyone does it right?"" It took years to get over it and there were many pitfalls. The toughest choice I made to better myself was to turn back the clock and think of who I was before I made the choice. I'd have mental conversations with young me and ask him if he'd be proud of who I became. If not, why not. Sounds impossible? No, just unpleasant. I had to adopt the mindset of young me, and as an adult somehow merge the two like grafting a part of a plant onto another to save it or make it new. Again, it wasn't easy or pleasant to do this and it was certainly embarrassing at times. It's like rebuilding a house and destroying the foundations as well before placing a new house on top of it. 

Here's why I'm posting this here.

I want to remind/advertise that we all have choices to make ranging from the simple and harmless, to the complex and potentially devastating. It can have far reaching consequences for ourselves and others as you are already all aware. As I hear of more domestic violence cases around the world and other unfortunate behavioral choices, just know that we can make another choice to undo the self-harm we may have brought on ourselves. Maybe that means gaining better control over your temper, or maybe it means conquering fears. But it is possible. You'll be faced with the choices time after time. 

""The real test of any choice is having to make the same choice again knowing fully well it might cost."" Would you do it? Personally, as long as I am aware of the choice and equipped to handle it, I would say no.",10Apr2020,1
113," I've never posted here before and have no idea if this is too serious, but I'm not sure what subreddit is best for just wanting to get it out. 

I don't think I'm asking for help, but I'm laying here in bed and I feel weird and numb. My grandmother is in her 90s, she has memory issues, but she wasn't sick a week ago when I called to say hi. Just one week ago. My uncle is sick too. He lives with her, he took care of her for decades and now he's also in ICU on a ventilator. I had no idea until today that they were in the hospital all week. I think my mom didn't want to worry us. She said they were about to discharge my grandma after 5 days, but her fever came back and now it's too far along. They must have gone just a day or two after I called last week.  

This is the first time I'll lose somebody. I feel so scared for my mom who's losing her own mom. I can't fly home, my mom can't visit her own mom, or her brother, and I can't help them. I'm a thousand miles away and I'm helpless. I wish I was closer with them. They were usually the only two relatives we spent holidays with.   

My grandmother was my only grandparent I had,  and I love her so much even though we didn't see each other much. I always thought my dog smelled like her house and now I'm weirdly smelling my dog and tearing up. She's Italian and an amazing cook, although it's been a long time since she could cook. It feels nice to remember those things but it feels mean to think of them now. Like I'm giving up on her already or something. 
 
I feel like I should be sobbing instead of staring at my phone. I feel bad for not feeling more. My boyfriend says that's normal but I feel so numb. Or I'll cry and immediately feel like it's an overreaction and I wasn't close enough with them to care this much. I know that's ridiculous to feel, it seems so stupid when I write it, but I don't understand my emotions at all right now and I couldn't keep staring at my phone feeling useless and confused so here I am.   

Again, I don't think I'm asking for anything, I really don't have any clue what I need right now. But if you have any advice I'll likely still be laying here for awhile, so I'll have plenty of time to read comments.   

I don't know what else to write. Tell people you love them. Stay inside. Be kind.

I come inside pretty wrecked to be honest and enter my hallway to see the neighbour opposite me just arriving home from work and another neighbour coincidently just coming inside I think he had just been out for fresh air and my last neighbour who joins my flat with her 2 children poking her head out the door and we all laughed and stuff and she said it's good to see that you're all still alive and I was just fumbling struggling to get my key in the door whilst holding a can of desperados I probably looked a wreck but it was so surreal.

120,"So back in December or January after Christmas, me and my friend were going out to get food and have a fun time driving around in his truck. We stopped at my work after going to the grocery store and buying buffalo wings for a few things. I was going to get my friend some stuff since I didn't get him anything for Christmas, and one of my coworkers was going to give me a few vape pods. 

I want to clarify I don't vape to look cool or anything like that. I just do it every here and there for the nicotine effect. My friend doesn't even know I vape. I don't brag and stuff like that. 

So when we get to the store we microwave our chicken wings and we go look around. I hadn't worked for a few days so we got some new stock on the shelves. He picked out a yo-yo ( yo-yo's are cool) a tire gauge, and some slime. 

As we are checking out this little boy who looks around two asks his mom if he can get a candy necklace. Its one of those cheap ones that come in the 100 pack that have the elastic bands. His mom says no, and the kid walks over to me and hands the necklace to me in a gesture like ""can i have it?"". 

I ask the mom if its alright if i get it for him and she says something like ""oh no its fine"". I tell her its not a problem and checkout with the necklace. That necklace cost me 25 cents so it wasn't even close to a big deal. After checking out I gave the kid the necklace and we go get our chicken wings and I got my pod. 

We leave with our food and had a good night playing video games. Later on in the night My mom calls me and has this angry voice and says ""were you at (insert store name) today?"" I say yes and she continues ""were you wearing your white red hot chili peppers shirt?"" I say yes a little worried ""did you buy a kid a candy necklace?"" I had to think because it wasn't in front of my mind or something I deemed important. I reply yes and she drops the fake angry tone and says the mother posted what I did on Facebook and wanted to tell the parents that they raised a good son. 

When my mom got home she told me that she said it was me. From that a got a little bit of praise for it. Honestly I was upset my mom told them. I didn't do it for thanks, or anything like that. I just spent 25 cents on a kid who wanted some candy. 

At school the principal and counselor mentioned it and told me how nice I am. I was really embarrassed and told them not to praise me for it. The counselor asked if she could talk about it on her weekly video, because that month was random act of kindness month or something like that. 

I said she could as long as she doesn't mention my name or anything that could give me away. It felt nice getting praised but I felt selfish that i felt like that. 

TL;DR I bought a kid a candy necklace and praised way more than what I should have.",10Apr2020,1
121,"It's now a pattern that I've seen and I need to overcome this; I'm tired of hurting people.  There's something wrong with me that needs to be fixed.

I'll be overjoyed with a girl and ecstatic to be with them.  All the niceties and emotions of a new flame are there.  

Then suddenly and without warning they're gone; the emotions and feelings I had vanish.  It's frightening.  I don't feel anything for them anymore, better said I don't feel anything anymore.

Is it depression?  Is it something else.

The only tie in I have a is a really rough breakup almost 3 years ago that took a long time to overcome.

Other than that I'm not sure.

I had confidence for a few months before this, but I still wished to be someone else. Now I don't, at all. It went from 89% to 100%

126,"I read a good thought experiment on another topic and I think it’s an interesting way to think about Trump promoting drugs that aren’t proven to work. Here it is. 

Even if there’s a one percent chance of these drugs being effective, and if people take them in consultation with their physicians to make sure they’re  safely taken, it’s logical to promote them from a government perspective because it could save lives. 

Think about it this way:

You’re on an airplane when you hear a loud sound and things start violently shaking. A minute later, the captain comes on the speaker and says:

There’s been an explosion in the engine, and the plane is going to crash in 15 minutes. There’s no chance of survival. There is a potential way out—the plane happens to be transferring a shipment of parachutes, and anyone who would like to use one to escape the plane may do so. But I must warn you—the parachutes are experimental and completely untested, with no guarantee to work. We also have no idea what the terrain will be like down below. Please line up in the aisle if you’d like a parachute, and the flight attendants will give you one, show you how to use it and usher you to the emergency exit where you can jump. Those who choose not to take that option, please remain in your seat—this will be over soon, and you will feel no pain.

What would you do? The drugs are the equivalent to the parachute. We don’t know for sure that they’ll work, but the chance is better than zero. My argument has nothing to do with a technical healthcare perspective, Trump’s actions are simply a question of logic and the need to motivate people to try the drugs from a social psychology perspective. 

Obviously getting covid doesn’t mean certain death. In the case of the thought experiment analogy, dying = no effective treatment while surviving = effective treatment. The point is even a 0.001% chance of effective treatment is better than nothing.",10Apr2020,1
127,"I would consider myself a proud American, but lately, well for the past 5 or so years, I just am nearing the tipping point. I used to believe in my fellow countrymen to do the right thing. I never thought we were perfect, but in the end I figured we’d get it right. After all, our flag stands for freedom right? Yet, now I’m watching people I respect, some of who are very intelligent, fall for this Stalinistic, backwards, borderline fascist rhetoric. Let me preface this by saying, I’m not a liberal by any means. I’m a gun owner, I’m from a small farm in the south. 

I just genuinely fail to understand how people can support someone who bold face lies constantly to our faces. Completely back burners our best interests in favor of his own, and basically is a living mockery to everything this country stands for. It’s infuriating. Watching my family and friends lose benefits they depend on like WIC, SNAP EBT etc. Watching our country basically be ignored by our federal government, while people are being buried in mass graves. A never ending circle of “well that isn’t under our blanket of responsibility.” Trump telling us he wants to open the country back up, and saying the shutdown is a democratic plot to ruin the economy so that he won’t get re-elected. I just want to scream in people’s faces FUCK YOU, THIS SHOULDNT BE POLITICAL. MY GRANDPARENTS SHOULDNT DIE SO YOU CAN REMAIN IN POWER YOU LITTLE SNIVELING CUNT. 

Watching our president only help states that pander to him, all the while he golfs, and gets fatter and donates money to make himself look good. Endorsing news networks that actively try to mislead us. Not to mention all of the scandals involving foreign governments I won’t get into. 

I can’t even formulate a coherent structure for this, I’m just plain pissed. I see people who think like myself, but i feel so helpless. I vote for every election. I write my senators. I contribute. I try so. Damn. Hard. But we’re still here. Still watching our country slowly slip into this fascist system. Slowly watching our government become more and more ineffective while trump lines his cabinet/staff with friends, business partners, shareholders and assholes who are wholly unqualified for their jobs. Firing people when he decides he doesn’t like them. Saying “send them back” to natural born Americans. Forbidding Dr. Fauci from speaking because his fragile ego can’t stand the spot light not being on him. The list goes on and I’m sure you all know it well. 

The world is laughing at us. Yet, people will still defend these assholes to the dying breath, over party allegiance alone. Sounds pretty nazi-esque to me. Our party system is Pepsi vs. coke at this point. 

How do I feel better about this? I can’t ignore it, I don’t want to watch the last bit of the America I know die. I don’t want to move, I can’t abandon my home.

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

132,"i have suffered with anxiety and depressive episodes for quite a while. i’ve had bad social anxiety most of my life, and i started going to therapy for general anxiety management when i was 13 (i’m 17 now). anyways, the therapy has helped me a ton, my anxiety is no longer debilitating, and it has helped with navigating depression. if you are struggling with your mental health, there is no shame in seeking professional help. 

that being said, i wanted to share a few things i have done to help maintain my mental health and better myself as a person, in hopes that i can help others. this is by no means a “cure” for mental illness, it’s just a few things you can do to help yourself. 

- i used the energy i was using to bring myself down to pick myself up. whenever i thought negatively about myself, i turned that into thinking about something i could make better about myself. 
- every time i had a panic attack i accepted that it was happening and that is okay, instead of getting mad at myself for letting it happen. 
- i accepted my feelings as truths and stopped getting mad at myself for feeling them.
- i let go of my anger. the people i was angry at couldn’t feel it, so it wasn’t hurting anyone but me.
- i stopped canceling plans &amp; isolating myself. no matter how much i didn’t want to, i still went out. eventually i found that i really enjoy it and started going out of my way to be with other people. 
- i stopped taking on other people’s problems. i used to use other people’s problems to distract myself from my own, so i focused on myself for a while. 
- i spent more time doing things i enjoy. doing things instead of sitting in bed all day was really hard, but after some time of self improvement, it was easier for me to get up and be productive. 
- spending time outside. being outside has always made me feel good, so i try and spend at least 30 min a day outside. 



this is all a process and it takes time. i gradually started doing this over the span of about 2 years, and i am still not completely where i’d like to be. it’s not a smooth process, there will be times when it feels like you are getting worse, but you need to keep fighting. getting to a point where you’re happy about yourself is a feeling beyond words. it’s a constant battle, but it’s worth it. this is the best i’ve felt in years and i hope others can feel this way too :)


note: please don’t discredit these things because of my age. many people have told me that my mental issues are not real bc i’m “too young”. they are very real and they affect me greatly. it hurst to hear people invalidate me when they don’t know what i’ve been through. i don’t want to talk about what has happened to me bc it could potentially be triggering to some people, and frankly it’s no body’s business but mine. thank you :))",10Apr2020,1

The older girl met with this guy (whom I’ve never met, and I’ll tell you why in a little bit) back in, let’s say....2015, and they had been dating ever since.

Well, back in August of 2018, I had just planned a trip to Florida, and was really looking forward to it (I was going to WDW for the first time), but I knew I had to face this wedding first. And my family knew it would be a formal event. So I went with my family, and I was nervous, because I had to give up a good friend of mine for her fiancé. When I got inside the church, I saw a horrible thing: a “Please No Camera Phones or Photography” sign (presumably put up by the bride).

Horrified by this, I pitched a fit inside the sanctuary, and once I saw the bride’s father, I tried telling her off, but he took her side and just smiled at me (he should’ve known better). My mom said it was either etiquette or copyright reasons (which I did not believe). The “no cell phone and camera” advisory was also in the program. I stormed out of the church with my father, and I was crying and punching him while he was driving me home. I have never been humiliated by a friend like this before. How could she insist on rear-ending guests, and banning photographs by them is a disgrace! This was definitely NOT my friend! She would absolutely NEVER do this to people! And I love her like a sister. Ever since then, I have been furious with her, and I wanted to talk to her parents about this, but my mom said they had nothing to do with it.

This whole situation has made feel very guilty of the fact that I haven't visited him at all. Please guys help me to figure out if what I feel is right or wrong. 

Today, on his birthday, he decided to go biking so drunk that he has fallen of the bike multiple times. He ultimately came home on foot. His grandma with whom he lives (because he hasn't got his own flat or saving to live properly) told me, that he literally crawled upstairs to his room.

I had called him before this all  happened to wish him best wishes and to announce that I would come to visit him and give him a present. He asked me then If I could get him some weed (yeah, sometimes I help my dad to get some pot because I know it's better than alcohol). But he didn't sound drunk on the phone, so I let him go on a bike to another end of the city while he was so drunk that he could get some trouble with police or even get some serious injuries... 

He had invited also my boyfriend before all this happened. But when he finally got home and I called him, I expressed my concern about visiting him drunk. He told me that that might be true but he added that anyways  he was going to stay home If we wanted to visit him.

143,"## Who am I?

The truth is I am the most unorganized, complicated person you will ever meet. I am quite the walking contradiction. As loud as I am, there is a lot that people don’t know about me. I am sensitive, I am deep, and I am profound. I feel everything in extremes and it’s the best and worst thing about me.

When I’m happy, I thrive. I glow from inside and it shows on my face because I smile with my eyes. I hug people and remind them how much they mean to me. They really do mean a lot to me. I take gentle care of things that need help, like plants or worms stuck on the sidewalk. Colors become vibrant and I can’t unsee all the good around me. My skin turns gold and I take good care of my body. I become generous with my time and money. I set goals and have ambition. Life has promise and I’m excited about living. I have passion like no other.

When I’m sad, I am devastated. I do this impulsive thing where I perform my emotions for the crowd as I’m feeling them. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep... I dry heave into trash cans and toilets. I fall into music and let it consume me. When I cry, I am inconsolable. My eyes swell shut and I find it hard to breathe. Being sad freaks me out, so I desperately cling to things that make me feel alive. I do things that make my heart race. Things like bike 50 miles to my moms house, climb to the tops of buildings and hang off the edge, or make plans to swim with whales. I have to make sure my heart is still there. I become irrational. I only see black and white. The smallest things cut deep because I am so sensitive.

When I love someone, I pour my entire soul into them. With my hands and my heart, I build pedestals unique to each person. I let myself sit at the bottom and I always worry I am not doing what I should be for them. I want to provide in any way that I can and I make that a priority. I sacrifice everything I can for someone I love. This has definitely came back to bite me in the ass more than once. I give the wrong people full versions of myself. I give the wrong people too many chances. I give the wrong people unconditional love. I learn my lesson, and I continue to do the same thing over and over. I can be incredibly counterproductive with my love. I always mean well, but I never can get it quite right. I am stupid and messy when I love someone. I am still and wide open when I love someone.

I am constantly worried I will disappoint people. My mind can be unkind. I run through everything wrong about me like I run through a grocery list, making sure I didn’t leave anything out. I wonder, “What if I was smarter? Nicer? Quicker? Better?” Every move I make is in consideration of others. I don’t know what it’s like to only look out for myself. When I feel I have done wrong by someone I love, it is near impossible for me to forgive myself. I am also a really bad liar. I always end up telling on myself one way or another.

I have the tendency to be annoying and relentless. I put so much calculation in every move that I become clumsy. I cheated on the only girl I’ve ever truly fallen in love with because I thought I was doing the right thing. Do you see what I mean? I ruin relationships and burn bridges and cry in the ruins of my own damage. I put myself into other peoples shoes too much and not enough. That’s the reason I miss people who don’t deserve to be missed. That’s the reason I don’t pay attention when I should. I only ever feel the need to do the right thing, despite how the situation treats me. I have an unusual sense of justice. I think I hate that the most about myself. My past is a collection of broken promises and bad decisions. Sometimes, I am moved to believe I will never recover from it. Maybe I deserve that.

I am resilient. I pick myself up everyday with the strength I built alone. I work hard to earn respect from my elders. I challenge myself everyday to be better than I was before. I stumble getting there like the drunk I *was*, but eventually I make it. I am stubborn in my beliefs. I make waves in steady waters. I have unfortunately broken hearts and I am ashamed of it all. I have tried to kill myself 7 times in my adult life and I always am on edge wondering if I’m just living my life to meet an eighth time. Will I be successful when it happens? Or will I fail at that too? I had to blacklist a song because last time I listened to it I tried to drive my truck off a bridge and now I am finding myself listening to it again.

I overdo everything. I overthink everything. I overstep a lot.

It is exhausting being me. Someone in my family once called me “the sad clown”, and honestly they aren’t wrong. I am in pain and I want to make sure everyone else is happy. I never talk about it, I never express things. I never want pity. I don’t need anyone to save me. The amount of work I have to do with myself is enormous. All I want to do is reach out for help.. and sometimes I try to. I long for an extra set of hands sometimes because this is so hard to carry alone. I am afraid I won’t be able to do it anymore one day. I am afraid everyone around me will realize I’m not strong. I am afraid everyone will leave because I am not strong. My display of weakness has a way of ruining things for me.

I forgive too easily. My heart is softer than most. I see the good in others no matter what. I am a perfectionist, I am my own worst critic. I wish I wasn’t so insecure sometimes when it comes to how someone feels about me. I take things too seriously because I don’t want people to think I don’t care enough. I am too heavy because I don’t want people to think I am incapable of depth. In contrast, I am careless about things because I don’t want people to think I have *too much* depth. I am always trying to be on my best behavior for others. I am soft to people even when it gets me in trouble. I wish I could be cold. I tried that a couple times too and I never could get it right either.. I wish I knew how to protect myself better.

But.... Maybe this is my protection. I can never have the right people surrounding me, if I cannot be the right person for them. I can never move past the pain I’ve always known, if I never choose the pain of growth first. I still choose compassion. I still choose glowing warmth in a cold world. I will still see the good in people. I will still hold out hope and pray for them. I will still do my part to encourage growth and evolution in the most stubborn of people. I will still embrace and forgive every single time. I will keep my arms open for anyone who’s afraid. If I always move with love, I will never lose. Maybe one day it’ll kill me.. And when it does, I hope people remember this stuff about me. Sure, everyone will recall my mistakes and the ways I’ve let them down.. But I hope they follow that up with memories of me working hard to redeem myself. I hope they remember I tried as hard as I could to be a **good** person. I want to be remembered for my gentleness. After all I’ve dealt with in my life, you’d think I’d be tough.. But I still choose to wipe my tears and remain tender.

Call me stupid. Call me reckless. Call me love blind. Call me irresponsible. Call me selfish. Call me whatever you want... I’ll just be thankful you took the time to call.",10Apr2020,1
144,"- [ ] I’m a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv already got them’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 
- [ ] .the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again",10Apr2020,1
145,"I figured I'd share in case anyone else would benefit. We are an immune compromised household so it's beneficial for us to do this. So I prepare the house for the groceries and he brings them in. I wash my hands. I go ahead and properly wash each item down and put it to the side and dispose of each bag. Making sure the bags and clean groceries don't touch. While I'm doing this, he strips down and puts his clothes in the washer and goes and takes a shower. By the time he's done, I have all the groceries wiped down with a warm soapy washrag. We change places. I take the rag and go strip down and put the stuff in the wash and hop in the shower and he puts the stuff away. It's efficient and seems to be the best way so far.",10Apr2020,1
147,"It's not just about the pandemic although that does make it worse. It's shining a light on how fucked up *everything* in America is but more than that it shows that most people still just couldn't give a shit. Our government no matter which party could just let every one of us suffer and die and they don't give a shit as long as their money and their donors' money stays safe.


I'm not even trying to start a political argument because that's what always happens when I talk about this anyway. This is a cry for help.



The state of our country and the world literally makes me want to kill myself and I don't see that there's anything I or anyone can do about it. My therapist can't change the world, neither can medications, moving to another country is too expensive and difficult, voting doesn't have any power anymore, there's nothing.


Absolutely nothing I can do. I've already stopped reading any and ALL news and deleted all social media accounts except Reddit where I only go anymore for help. None of it still is enough.",10Apr2020,1
148,"I bought myself a really nice bike when I moved to Colorado over the summer and only used it a handful of times before I had to leave to go back to the town my college is in. Ever since then, it’s been sitting in our living room because our city has really busy roads and all the college kids drive crazy. 
Ever since corona it’s been a ghost town but I still kind of forgot biking was an option and I turned into a real couch potato. I was probably only exercising 3 times a week, which for me leads to a steady increase in chonkiness. 
My roommate ended up borrowing a bike from her friend today and we just rode around town and to a really nice time and I’m so happy we did it. It was just kinda out of the blue but it was just what we both needed. 
I know it’s not really a big thing but just being able to spend time with a friend outside has made me feel a lot better about quarantine and more excited for it all to be over. 
Now we are gonna ride our bikes and explore town every other day and I already can’t wait :)",10Apr2020,1
149,"My girlfriend has most of her family living in Guatemala.  


We've been together for 13 years, and we don't want to get married or have kids. Her family back in Central America don't understand that concept for the most part. Having kids and/or getting married is the biggest deal for any girl in her family. 

They also like to gossip about family members, never directly ask a person a question - They will, however, ask everyone else till it becomes a rumor. Like how a cousin is gay because they aren't married, or has a roommate of the same sex. This goes from seeing stuff on Facebook to a phone chain that blows up across the family in a matter of hours. So sharing things on Facebook doesn't happen much for us because it turns into rumors pretty fast.  


My girlfriend always wanted to try pickled eggs, and we were never able to find them out and about. So while we're in lock down, I figured I would try to make them. I did; and she was so happy that she posted on Facebook something along the lines of:  


""so happy, after 13 years my boyfriend is making me pickled eggs!""  


Well, the translate on Facebook somehow turned '**eggs**' into '**uterus**' and the rest of the terms into saving and being happy about it.   


So naturally instead of asking my girlfriend what this meant. The chain went off.  


one aunt called another, and cousins called cousins who texted, who emailed, and Facebooked and Snapchatted till they figured that she *clearly* was **pregnant**.   


Within a few hours clothes was being collected to send to the USA, and who's house for when she'd come to visit with the baby. Names for boys and girls where tossed around, none of which had my family or ideas at heart... My girlfriends parents looked at their phones after so many missed calls and asked what the fuck was up.  


Needless to say, we are going to take a photo of her cradling a swaddled jar of pickled eggs to send around to the family.",10Apr2020,1
