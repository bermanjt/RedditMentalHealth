0,"Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

One instance she said she booked me in for a practice interview and I just looked down and nodded and she said annoyed ‚Äòcould look more enthusiastic about it like‚Äô when I didn‚Äôt mean it like that 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. 

üí°She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


‚óæÔ∏èI got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence. And she seemed very moody about it at the time tbh",22Dec2020,1
3,"So I'll start off by saying I don't have a bad life. I have a roof over my head, I have food on the table. but I've made some very ""bad"" decisions this year that have left me in what I feel like is an irreversible depression. 

My family is religious. and my parents were somewhat strict in my early-mid teens. I told myself I would move out as soon as I could when I became adult because I despised their lifestyle. Well, I did. And I dropped their religion and started questioning and discovering things by myself. I also got a boyfriend. Without my parents knowing at first. I am an adult and I was living on my own paying my own bills, but my parents lost it because they didn't approve of him before I started dating him like they told me they would have to for them to ever be ok with me being with anyone. even with me being out of the house. Then I decided to move in with said boyfriend.

So basically I had 3 very difficult conversations with my parents, considering their religion doesn't approve of my lifestyle. ""Hey I'm not a Christian anymore and I think that's ok"", ""hey I have a boyfriend"", ""Hey I'm moving in with him, no I'm not pregnant"".

Needless to say parents lost their shit. They wouldn't talk to me for a while after each, the latest being the moving. Ive received some very un-christian messages from them and been avoiding them like the plague. I do have love for them but I can't take being confronted in anger from dad. Or my mom, I really don't remember seeing my mom cry ever before the ""I have a bf"" conversation. 

During this time of little to no talking, I moved in with bf and quit my job of 2 years. I was waitressing, my bosses were shorting me. I got a new job within 2 weeks, training to be a manager for the new job. Within 2 weeks of starting new job, I got into a decent car accident where I got hit in the passenger side and my car ended up wrapped around a tree. while on the clock for said job. first wreck ever, its been almost 2 months since and I still am so overwhelmed I can't even think about it without my head hurting. car is gone, hospital/ambulance bills have come in, and car insurance won't cover me because trooper who never got a statement (other driver admitted fault) put me at fault. I had to buy a new car out of pocket (I had decent savings from waitressing), but its a piece of shit. I am so unhappy.

boyfriend is great. sometimes. during everything I've said, I found pictures of other women on his computer. which would be ""fine"" except they're people I know or like his ex laying in OUR bed before I moved in. Yes, I threw away all the sheets and blankets once I got the courage to even look at the bedroom again. My anxiety screams at me because I've always been left in past relationships for other women. He promises it wasn't ""like that"" but my anxiety screams still. We have sex less too. So that's encouraging... not.

that's not even half of it. in the past 3 months I've hit a dog with my car I wrecked, gotten turned down by my dream EMT job twice without a reason, been all but completely abandoned by my family, gotten strep throat, gotten a extremely painful IUD insertion, lost my decent amount of savings on paying rent and gas and food without a decent income, and become extremely stressed financially and otherwise that id turn myself into a mental hospital, but I know I can't afford it. I know I need help but I can't financially afford it. which is part of the reason I need help. fucked up, right? I was also yelled at and had things thrown at me by a corporate employee at new job, ended up having a panic attack I almost called 911 for because I thought I was going to hyperventilate myself to death. legitimately. never in my life have I felt so out of control. there's so much more but I know I already sound like a self centered bitch. 

So I know all of this is my fault and solely my fault, but I am so extremely lost. Ive sat in my bedroom contemplating suicide more times than I can recall. I feel like my boyfriend hates me. I feel like I'm not going to get anywhere in life. I feel like I'm going to run into the ground financially. Ill be alone on the holidays due to bf working. Which is hard because holidays have always been hard. My last paycheck for 70 hours plus 10 hours overtime was $481. That won't even cover rent and gas. I know I need a lawyer for my accident but the thought of more bills or even having to recall the wreck makes my head go numb. I feel like I'm drowning. I have a $1500 ambulance bill due by Christmas. I feel like there's no point in life. I'm almost to the point that I'm hoping bf breaks up with me so I have no commitment to anyone so I can die without having to worry about the effect. I know I sound so self-pitying but I am at the end of my rope and the fact that everything has happened in such a short time, i feel like it will never end. I feel smothered. I feel numb. Ive shut everything out. I feel like it would be so much easier to just die. I don't see myself being anywhere better in the future. when I was younger, I knew I would kill myself before or when I turned 18. Ive passed 18, but now I can't see myself being here tomorrow. I am literally living minute by minute. I can't even do day by day anymore. I'm not going to kill myself but I feel like I don't even actively exist anymore. I'm a corpse. I breathe and sometimes speak. I am so tired of living. I'm in over my head. I need help but don't know what to do or where to start.",22Dec2020,1
6,"I‚Äôm a college student and I want to switch my major. I‚Äôm not happy with what I‚Äôm doing nor do I want to do anything in biology. I only chose this major because it was the closest thing to getting prerequisites done for grad school, but now I‚Äôm even contemplating that. 

I talked to my parents and they said I‚Äôm running away from my problems and should just tough it out. Is that a valid thing to say? Should I just stay and fail more classes? I‚Äôm not happy. I‚Äôm a junior. I don‚Äôt understand how me wanting to get into a better situation is me running away from my problems. That ticked me off that they keep saying that

They assume I will run away from all of my problems or things that are ‚Äúhard‚Äù. If that was the case I would have moved out from home long ago.",22Dec2020,1

18,"Hi! My names Buggsy and for a while I‚Äôve been living unhealthy. Some of my favourite activities include: smoking weed, drinking liquor, shotgunning beer, getting takeout, watching tv and video gaming. 

My goals are simple. Cut out the bad, replace with good. My first step is cutting out all alcohol except for after dinner digestifs and red wine. I read about the benefits to both the heart and digestive system with just an evening glass of wine or cognac. 

Second: smoking. I smoke way too much bud, so I‚Äôm going to cut it slowly, then hopefully minimal or zilch. 

For takeout, personally it kinda goes with smoking. I can cook, I will be making recipes and posting them for everyone to read on my page as well. I‚Äôm going to be doing a healthy mix of greens, coloured fruits, fibres, poultry, white and pink fish, and some selective red meats. Homemade bread is also always on the table as store bought bread can contain SO MUCH sugar. For example, my loaves take approximately 1.5 teaspoon of sugar, store bought brands like Villagio can contain 21g of the white devil, and that‚Äôs in Canada where food safety regulations are much stricter than other countries such as the US. 

Exercising is something I struggle with. Not because I‚Äôm lazy, simply because I don‚Äôt know how. Every weight loss/muscle gaining workout or healthplan is typically blocked behind a paywall I cannot afford to access. If anyone has tips, I‚Äôd love to hear them!

Anyways, that‚Äôs my introduction, and I wish y‚Äôall follow my journey.",22Dec2020,1

21,"I want to make movies, and I want to act, and I want to make music. I want to create things for people. I can do all of these at a small level, but it would stay with me. I live in a small town in Minnesota and I feel limited by it. All entertainment is local and community driven, but I want to break out of that.

I want to go to film school, but I don't feel like I have a great portfolio yet. I just recently got my own camera, and I'm now working on building the portfolio up. I only have one friend who's really into film like I am, and he's moving to go to film school next year. We're both seniors in highschool. I want to go to a good film school, but I also would need to take generals, I think and I wanna take a gap year. During the gap year I wanted to work toward my dreams try to make my hobbies into something more than just hobbies.

I know film school is considered by some to be not worth it, but I really need to make connections and get some good experience. Is it a bad idea to take a gap year if I also want to go to film school? Should I just go straight to school?

How do I get to where I want to be? Is it feasible? My dream school would be usc SCA, which is why I feel like I need a great portfolio. I have so many ideas, I just don't have the resources or people to make them into reality, and it makes me a little sad and frustrated. Thank you.",22Dec2020,1

24,"2020 has been nuts. But it's not all bad. I proposed to my fiance and I'm excited to marry her next year!

But, Idk what comes next in my life. All the big achievements I set for myself seem to be accomplished.

Ive had a high paying job for the last 3 years as a cloud SRE.

I got engaged

I bought a house. 

I've sought medical help for my seemingly life long depression and anxiety. 

I really feel accomplished with my life, things are coming together. Really my next exciting goal is having kids with my amazing fiance. 

But, I've been goal oriented my whole life. Seeking ""success"" which my therapist has helped me realize how unhealthy my relationship with success was. 

But no matter how much I learn, I still feel lost. What do I do? Video games aren't fun. Learning tech and programming hasn't been fun since it became my career. I really feel like all there is to do is coast to get paid to eventually fund trying new hobbies. But even then, there is no guarentee the attempted hobby will be enjoyable to me. 

Has anyone dealt with this? How do I find what's next? What really excited me for the future. 

Maybe I'm just expecting too much since working on my depression. 

Appreciate any advice people have",22Dec2020,1

And he told me delete discord and never ever use it again plus staying away from social media for a few months.

33,"Because fuck me my sadness bogs everyone down. I have a good friend who's the most empathetic kind person I've ever met and of course he'll listen because of course he cares and wants to help. I just end up doubling down on reasons why life is shit and he can't out argue me on that. It sucks to see that light go out in his eyes when he realizes that he can't help one of his closest friends when he places all his self worth on the ability to make other people happy. He'll never admit it of course but I'm not stupid. 

So I'll smile and tell him that it's not as bad as I made it out to be, and that I appreciate his advice, and ask if he wants to grab a drink where we'll do dumb shit together like we always do. I'll still be fucked up but I'll hide the worst from it from the man because I don't need to make other people hate themselves for their own personal ""failures"". That's my job heh.",22Dec2020,1
37,"My dad died last month due to COVID which sucks serious ass. It was a long hospital stay and though thankfully I got to see him in the hospital before he passed, it was when he was ventilated and sedated. So I didn't even get a chance to talk to him in person. With the holidays coming up I am a mess. Seeing my mom dealing with this makes me a mess. Knowing my siblings get to become adults without my dad there makes me a mess. Right now there is no healing; only sadness and stress. 

To add too that. My boyfriend (to whom I just moved in with) just got an interview for a once in a lifetime job. No word until January for the next steps. If they take him, they'll want him asap. Which is great but wed have to move a 7 hour plane ride away for this job. Meaning I'd be away from family when I might need them at my lowest. I'd most likely move with no job and no health insurance for a hot minute. which is only concerning because I do have a chronic health condition. But I dont go with him I know I'll regret it so no mater what happens I'm gonna follow.

But damn knowing that in my heart doesn't make it any damn easier. The fact I cant even know for certain if I'll be in the area when we have my fathers memorial in the spring makes me cry. Leaving the apartment I love is making cry. Thinking of my dad makes me cry. I'm crying everyday. And it's starting to take a toll on my boyfriend. And normaly I'd reach out to family and friends about all this. But I cant because he doesnt want to worry my family I'd might be leaving. Which I get but I'm losing my damn mind. Which in turn is ruining his mood. 

I'm fucking losing my marbles and probably gonna have a proper breakdown. I cant process my emotions properly and when I do it hurts my boyfriend and I fucking hate that I am.

She is only 12 and I cant imagine having this happen to me at 12. These two feelings mixed together is the strangest thing I've ever felt, and I guess just need someone to tell me that eventually she will be okay. I cant handle the anger I just want to hit everything and I want to do very select things to that man, I just need some silver lining if there is any. I cant go see her  (covid) and shes not taking any calls right now. I just wish I could talk to her for a second. My chest just hurts, and my heart is breaking.

40,"Social media ""platforms"" have been pushing for cancel culture and are attempting to curate content online to what they see fit. The IMF wants to impose a social credit score system through major banks as part of its new system.

My belief has been and will always be that freedom of speech is necessary. It doesn't come without consequences. If people are part of a news organization and lie about the reporting by omitting details that are fundamental to the main picture, that's liable for a lawsuit. However when it comes to posts and ideas that are not mainline, I like seeing how people respond to it and learn why people respond to it the way they do.

Personally I don't care about conflicts on the Internet. It's not important. Social media is social media, and you should never post ideas that are core to your belief on the Internet unless you are publishing a book or you own a brand. Everything else comes after that. Normally it shouldn't matter what people write online because for all people know it's probably not what they are thinking. You cannot know for certain what the beliefs of a lot of people are from their Internet usage unless they're stupid about how they use the Internet.

What strikes me as insane is CEOs, bankers, politicians like the secretary of state of certain states having access to censorship, moderators because of ideas they don't like. Wanting to create profiles and use punative measures/actions against people who aren't overly attached to the Internet strikes me as people who care too much about too little in their life. If people like joking around in posts, if people like posting other people's ideas, who cares? There's websites that people can use for serious information, then there's social media, a place people shouldn't take too seriously. 

Easiest example is people who make political content. Oh no, someone makes politics you don't like! These people admit behind closed doors that they aren't conservative at all, they do drugs, they cheat on their partners. A lot of ""helpful"" content that people put on social media is advice they do not follow. So why should people take social media as some serious place of ideas? Why should people be up and arms about it? To protect other people from their self? Perhaps it's better to teach people that social media isn't something that should be taken too seriously than demand punitive actions and destroy people's lives over.",22Dec2020,1
43,"Hi. First time posting here. I guess I feel like I'm at a standstill in my life. I feel detached from everything.

Long before the pandemic happened, I began to feel less like myself. I started to drift away from my friends, because either I or them, made little effort to see each other eventually. Plus, that time I began to be homeschooled too. I enjoy studying a lot but the pandemic postponed all my final exams (im a high school junior) and completely ended everything I've loved about learning; hell, i cant even do a free online course anymore without switching back to youtube or sone videogame. 

But as this year is almost ending, I, have this sinking feeling that I don't even know myself anymore. It sounds pathethic but what I mean is I feel like there's nothing I am passionate about. Reading and writing , has always been my hobby, i guess, but I havent picked up a book and happily read through it through the past 3 years. Same with movies and music, I want to know more, deeply, about things I like but I am scared thatI don't have anything I truly like cause this is what it feels like. It's like a huge part of me has slipped away throughout the years without me noticing it. And it's even more vivid because as a highschool junior too, I gotta plan our extracurriculars and stuff, I am perplexed on how to manage it. But there are so many, way too many things I would love to do, man.

And it is so terrifying to me cause I used to be an energetic curious person and I want to be that person but I don't know how to be. I see what my distant friends post on social media and I guess I feel sad. I see brilliant people and I reflect on my greatest ambitions, I want it, like I would die for it but I don't have the skills nor the motivation to do it. 

I'm just venting. Drop me any advice or a word of encouragement idk. I just want someone to talk to.",22Dec2020,1

I honestly can‚Äôt imagine anything making me happy. A recurring injury has made it so I can‚Äôt stand up for over an hour at a time, I‚Äôve got no job and no ways to make money and am barely scraping by on money from my parents.

54,"I love my sister. She's funny, energetic, and can be an absolute joy to be around. But she's 137 lessons behind in school and has 4 weeks to do all of them. She used to take baths so frequently that she almost cost us the house with the water bill. She won't even throw away her trash when the bin is right next to her... 
I'm not gonna go into detail on why she's the way she is but she has depression, anxiety, ADHD and maybe some other stuff. I say that because she had ADHD this whole time and I had no idea until my mom told me a few weeks ago, so there's no telling what else she has. 
However, I don't know how much longer I can blame her laziness and outright refusal to work on her mental illnesses. 
My god... Where do I even start... 
To begin with, my sister isn't the only one to point fingers at, my parents are complicit in this to. They love us to death but my god, if there's one job they're bad at its parenting. They gave us unlimited, yes, UNLIMITED access to the internet at a young age giving my sister, my brother and me irreversible psychological damage. Whenever something goes wrong they just get mad and cuss so now we respond the same way. They never knew how to criticize us so idk about my siblings but now I'm a fucking snowflake and any criticism, mean-spirited or not, hurts. I could go on and on. But the aspect they're weakest at, without a doubt, is discipline. I'll give you an idea. You know what they did when my sister got caught drinking at school? They took her phone away and made her do chores. THAT'S. IT. last year in online school (that me and her were doing pre pandemic) she didn't finish all her lessons in time and had to do summer school. So what did my mom get for her on her birthday in summer? A MOTHERFUCKING NINTENDO SWITCH. That was the signal to her that it didn't matter how shitty she did in school, our parents are too fucking scared to do anything. Fast forward five months later and this is where we're at. 137 overdue lessons and 4 weeks to do them. Besides, it's pretty obvious that she has no intention or interest in doing them. While I was taking a break from schoolwork, I was on my switch and saw that she was playing terraria while she was supposed to be working. 

My brother is the polar opposite of my sister. He struggles with depression too but is extremely hard working and has been for the last 4 years. Right now he has a loving girlfriend, his own living space, and lives with her and her brother. Again, I won't go into detail on why she's like this, but my mom doesn't want her spending the night over there with a guy neither my mom or sister know. I've gotten to know my brother's girlfriends brother and I don't think he's the kind of guy to take advantage of someone sexually but I understand. Before he moved in, my mom wanted my sister to spend the night so my brother could talk to her about the importance of hard work, but job related shit happened and it didn't end up happening. 
According to my mom, my sister's """"""""plan"""""""" is to never get a job and live with my brother when she's an adult. This just hurts so much because we know how difficult it will be to convince her otherwise. She knows that we're not just gonna throw her out onto the street if she doesn't get a job. She knows we love her and she's taking full advantage of it. 

Theres so so so much more I could talk about but I think I've said enough.",22Dec2020,1
59,"So.. on sunday night, monday morning 2am, I go out for a 20 minute walk. 

I come across a man who needed me to call his phone because he dropped it in foliage. This man is a 25year old, who didnt look disheveled,  but he had in his pocket a liter of vodka. So I stay my distance, call his phone, he finds it, and I'm about to go on my way. But he wants to know if I want to talk, because he was so happy that I came along to help him.

Quick note, I eventually trusted he didnt have covid because he is in the military and did an isolation period recently. 

So we walk and talk about everything from topic to topic as drinks do. He offered me vodka but I refused, for a while.

We walk to his house, and he goes to grab his 2 Huskies (I cant turn down a chance to walk dogs) so off we go again. Eventually I succumb to the vodka and I have some. And a bit more. And a bit more. 

Ya so, one minute I'm at a park, next minute I'm at the hospital and its 9am  thankfully this ordeal was quick, they run my blood, tell me I'm drunk and send me on my way.

My phone dies within minutes, I have no money on me, but I vaguely know where I am and I begin to walk a 1 hour 40 minute walk home. 

Man.. I walked past the point where i couldn't walk anymore, gaining a new respect and understanding of people who complain to me when I take them on walks longer than they'd like. 

Because I was going mostly straight down one road, eventually I try my luck at hitchhiking, later than I should.

One dude eventually drives me just 3 minutes up the road before he had to turn. He offered me money for food but I refuse. I needed bus money, but I thought I had no mask, even though I was coming from the hospital (still drunk apparently)

I  keep walking, getting 0 more people to pick me up. But I see a dude coming out of a store. I stop and stretch my leg as he was on the phone. I was planning on asking for a drive, but he asks me first if I'm okay. ""Not really"". This man is working and cant drive me, but gives me a mask, and the  a 20 (I think I'll bring him back the 20 soon) . I get change from a convenient store across the street, wait for a bus and get on. At this point I can hardly move my legs. 

Off the bus, I get a timmies breakfast sandwich, and limp home the last few minutes, up the stairs and I to bed. 

I sleep until 9pm, and my legs are still just as sore. Now at 1am, I've grabbed an ice pack , but still feeling 60% of the pain. 

So ya, that was my escapade, and my legs have never been so sore. I still wonder how I got to the hospital, most likely thing is I got ultra drunk and may have passed out and he called them. Cest la vie",22Dec2020,1

I can realise I'm dreaming, and decide to focus on my surroundings and then you realise how weird it is. One time I dreamt I was in a street talking to someone, I realised I was dreaming and started looking around. A busstop with a commercial poster had a big face on it which kept changing to never really be one face but the combination of a lot of familiar faces. I jumped up and I could float-walk in the air, looking at the windows and rooftops.

Usually I just go with the flow of the dream though. I see where the dream takes me and just keep in the back of my mind that I am in total control.",22Dec2020,1

66,"Someone has a compulsion to rearrange his books. Due to anxiety and the fact that he cant ignore his ocd, he tries makes a rushed promise to God or to Gods that he wont ever bother himself with this compulsion (rearranging the books). He makes the promise in order to force himself stop worrying or thinking about the compulsion. He asks for a curse in case of breaking the promise in order to make sure that he will never break it. He may have confirmed the promise/deal by doing the cross sign 3 times. (in the past, he has told God or Gods that a promise will be valid only if he validates it by doing the cross sign 3 times) He said that to seperate ocd promises with the real promises. His promise was still, an ocd promise but he maybe tried to validate it by doing the cross sign 3 times. He did not want to do it but his ocd knew the trick that if he did not validate the promise, the promise would count as ocd promise and therefore, would not count at all. So, he was forced by his ocd to make the fake, ocd promise into a real promise by doing the cross sign 3 times. So, his promise (ocd or real) was that he will never bother himself with the book rearrangement.

One day, that man was praying with his thoughts to Gods and wanted to say that he did not break the book promise. For an ocd reason, he worried that it may look as if he is mocking Gods because of his fast prayers. So, when he wanted to say that he did not break the promise, he randomly, started thinking/say it more clearly and slower in order to prove to Gods that he does not mock Them. That guy now worries that by doing that (speaking slower to prove to Gods that he does not mock Them) he may have accidentally, broke the book promise. His promise was that he will never bother himself with the book compulsion and he compulsively, said to Gods that he did not break his promise in order to prove to Them that he is not mocking Them. Did he broke the promise?",22Dec2020,1

Elementary school and half of middle school did not go well for me. My parents also have trauma from school so they decided to put me in an online school.

My teachers quite literally hated me, but I finished with a high GPA despite this, since this school was half-automatic, using an archaic website from 2011... It had quite literally, no social environment, except for the occasional email for teachers, and center visits for exams and new courses. I don't know if this is good.

My leftover friends from elementary were very toxic. I didn't know how to make new friends as well. I stopped talking to them around July this year. I don't have many close experiences with people aside from evil children and adults. My life has basically been in quarantine for the entirety of high school. 

I definitely did not take advantage of my situation enough back then to learn the things I wanted. I was never happy. I'm now 16, and  I am behind, social-wise &amp; knowledge-wise. I can still catch up.

121,"My ocd is about making deals with Gods or promises to Gods as a way to fight ocd compulsions. Since I have ocd fear of Gods, I use this fear by making promises to Gods in order to force myself NOT TO do cd compulsions. The fear of Gods is stronger than the fear of NOT doing an ocd compulsion. So, I am forced by my anxiety to mak promises to Gods that I will NOT do the compulsion and I ask for punishments/curse in case breaking the deal by DOING the compulsion.

For example my ocd is telling me to rearrange the books. I do not want to rearrange them but I cant ignore my ocd. So, I try to find a way to make ocd stop giving me anxiety for not doing the compulsion. So, a promise is being made to Gods about not rearranging the books. A punishment/curse is asked in case breaking the promise. The fear of the punishment/curse is stronger than the fear of the compulsion. So, using this fear, I am forcing myself not to do the compulsion and the anxiety for not doing the compulsion is gone because the fear of the punishment in case of breaking the promise (by doing the compulsion) is bigger than not doing the compulsion.

I do not want to make these promises and sometimes, I end up worrying because of HYPOTHETICAL promsies. I cant remember if I ever made a promise about something and because my weapon against ocd are these promises, I worry if I ever made a promise about something and then, forgot it. Sometimes, by doing something that I want that happens to be the same action with the compulsion or something similar, I worry that I may be breaking the promise. Just because what I want to do happens to be the action of an old compulsion. For example, if I want to rearrange the books like a normal person ( no ocd) I will worry because in the past, I may have made a promise to Gods about never rearranging the books (because that time the compulsion was about rearranging the books)

So, I feel like I am trapped in my daily life. For example, I may want to watch a movie and I will start thinking that in the past, I may have made a promise to Gods not to watch that movie because ocd was telling me to watch it as part of the compulsion. So, the usual trick may have been used ( promise not to do the compulsion) in order to fight ocd. And since, I was able to fight my compulsion with the fear of the promise/punishment/curse, days later, I may want to watch that movie like a normal person and not because my ocd is asking me to watch it. I find myself worrying that by watching that movie because I want (like a normal person) I may still, be breaking the promise to Gods.

I have told Christian God (and because Christian God maybe is not real, maybe other Gods heard me) that I do not want to make these promises. Œô told Him ( or Them if they heard me) that I would only, mean a promise if I validate it by doing the cross sign 3 times.

My ocd learned the trick of the fake promises. One day, I tried to make a fake promise and ocd kept giving me worries for not doing the compulsion because it knew that the promises are fake. So, I could not use the fear of promises because I knew that the promises are fake and do not count. Maybe I was forced to mean the promise for some seconds, and tried to validate it by doing the cross sign but I stopped at the second time and canceled the promise.

Now, I am not sure if I ever validate a promise by doing the cross sign 3 times, if it will count or not. Even if I make the cross sign 3 times and try to mean the promise for some seconds, deep down, I do not want to make it. I am just, being forced by my anxiety to make a real promise (since the fake ones do not work)

Everyday I worry in my life. The reason I worry is because I have a fear of a specific punishment from Gods. That specific punishment was asked some times, as a punishment in case breaking the promise. (with or without the cross sign)

That specific punishment is invisible. I mean, it cant be seen. Its maybe something similar as if someone asks as a punishment to be always, unlucky in his life. If he breaks the promise, he cant know if the punishment/curse ( unlucky) happened or not.

The punishment that I fear is being transformed to something ugly but being unable to see it. I do not want to say a lot of details about it.

So, the reason I give much attention to my ocd story (promises) is because I do not know if Gods accepted the promise. Someone has a fear of germs. He washes his hands. He can persuade himself to stop worrying by not washing his hands. He sees that he is ok and maybe worries less. (he has witnessed that his ocd is wrong)

In my case, the punishment is invisible so I cant stop worrying. You will tell me about Jesus but my ocd doubts a lot. So, I cant say to myself ""relax Jesus knows"" because Jesus maybe is not real. What if there are Gods (not from a religion) that do not care about my ocd and accept these promises?

How can a therapist help me and convince me that the invisible punishment did not happen/will not happen or that Gods do not accept those promises?

Can you please talk to me? Can you calm me down? Can you share your experiences? please do not just, tell me to go to a therapist. Talk with me.",22Dec2020,1

Till this day it always pops into my mind now and then how scary I acted... easily one of my biggest regrets so far every time I think back on it I just feel super embarrassed. I know it probably sounds dumb, but it‚Äôs just one of those memories that stick in your head",22Dec2020,1
126,I'm having a blah day. But you know what? I'm not in a depressive spiral! Yay! I feel like I can overcome this feeling today. 2020 wasn't a bad year for me. I'm hoping 2021 will be even better. I have hope. Feels good.,22Dec2020,1

For many years, I have been struggling with depressive episodes and am in therapy for it.

Two days ago, I finally felt GOOD. I am noticing that it's slipping away, BUT at the very least I felt good for two days, almost three now.

I don't even feel that bad anymore about a girl that was supposed to reply to me but didn't. I gave her more than enough chances, we agreed to go on a date on the 27th of December, but she was going to chat me and call me she said. Guess what? Both did not happen. I have been going after her for quite some months, most effort came from me.

The date probably won't happen and I don't feel that bad anymore, I'm somewhat relieved actually. I have a new mattress, can still work from home, which is great and I want to get my ITIL 4 certificate next year. I also meditate more (guided meditation), exercise more and try to tell myself that I can handle most issues that come my way and limit myself from getting in a downwards spiral with a lot of negative scenarios.

I am documenting what is happening so that when I feel terrible again, I can try to get myself out of a funk.

Have a good day all!",22Dec2020,1
