0,"I’m moving back to my hometown due to COVID. Whatever, it happens. I’m not ashamed. 

At first, I was actually excited! All of my friends are here. 

But since I’ve been back (still got some more moving to do, so I’m not officially fully back yet), I’ve noticed that a lot of these friends, well... they have their own friend group now. And since I’ve been gone for so long, I am not really involved anymore. 

Understandable, but also, kind of lonely... 

I’m realizing I don’t really have anyone, anymore. Maybe that’ll change with time, but it definitely cuts deep currently. 

I guess being back will be interesting.",07Jul2020,1
1,"I’m a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 

Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again and she filled out the application form for me for it and I didn’t ask",07Jul2020,1
2,I’ve never been more nervous to try and prove myself. We were in the substance abuse treatment field but now we are strictly marketing recovery treatment websites  instead of caring for patients. I’m in charge of video production but it’s becoming way more complicated not being able to film subjects and testimonials of addiction. I’ve been rehashing old videos I shot and editing them for corresponding websites. I will eventually run out of material during this quarantine. My new boss has never given me any direct orders either which is concerning. I’m just trying to be as useful as I can in the only way I know how right now. I know times are tough and my situation is nothing compared to what others are going through but I just needed to vent.,07Jul2020,1

4,"I’m 20 and a week ago I found out I passed my (community) college course in childcare and that night I applied for a job at a nursery near where I live. I really can’t believe my luck that I was accepted for an interview at the only place I applied and that I can easily get there via bus since I can’t drive.

Tomorrow I’m to go in for a “casual chat” followed by a formal interview on Friday. 

I’ve been trying to get into uni but I haven’t recieved any offers. I’m going to try again next year but hopefully until then I can just work. I’m trying not to get my hopes up with this job but thinking about the money I’ll make (no longer minimum wage!!) im starting to get exciting at the thought of actually being able to move out by my 21st birthday. I could even pay for my driving lessons/test without my parents help.

I’ve wanted to move out for years due to a not so happy home life, but the thought of living away from home has always seemed so impossible until now. If I get this job I think I could actually move in with my boyfriend in a year and split rent with him. 

It’s exciting to think about.",07Jul2020,2

i’ve never felt like my fathers daughter. just an unnecessary burden in his already complicated life. 
i don’t know that much about him - he lost both his parents. has a flexible job. hasn’t had any work due to the pandemic. hates doctors and dentists and thinks they’re all scammers. is never home and only comes back at night to eat and sleep. 
from a young age he told us we weren’t allowed to complain- he hates people who complain and he “never” complains. (in reality he complains about everything, how difficult his job is, how the food is cold etc) so our house is pretty much falling apart because he doesn’t want us to complain (roof leaking, bathroom leaking, etc) and because he’d rather invest in a farm than in this house. i’ve had dental issues my whole life, due to bad genetics. i always get cavities that he tells me to ignore because he’s currently going through a rough patch at work. then the cavity gets really bad a couple of months later, i need a root canal, he gets angry because it’s so expensive and i should’ve ignored the pain and not complain. 
sometimes i need a ride back from school if my mom can’t drive me back. so i call him and he yells at me for not telling him in the morning (i usually find out i don’t have a ride home a couple of minutes before i call him). i go out with my friends 2-3 times a year and never have enough money because he refuses to give me money because restaurants are too expensive. i get 1/4 of the average allowance my friends get because he’s always going through a rough patch at work (but still eats in restaurants every day). i’m always broke it’s embarrassing. i went to a major i didn’t want because the one i wanted was too expensive (less than $300 difference) i can’t talk to him because we’re not allowed to complain or he’ll get mad and remind us of how difficult his work is and how much harder he works without complaining. of course, he has some good qualities, he occasionally makes us dinner,sends me credit occasionally, drives me to school in the morning if he’s in the country, pays for electricity, gas, our tuition (all parents pay for their kids tuition in my country). but i’ve always felt really guilty when i want something. on my birthday my friends got me a lot of presents and i was really happy and i showed my dad and he said “that’s really bad because now you have to get them presents which means i have to pay for these presents” he said it in a joking way although i’ve never asked him for money to get a present for one of my friends, i always save up for a really long time or ask my mom. if he hates us this much why is he still in our lives? most of the time he isn’t, i barely see him, but when he is it’s always like this",07Jul2020,1
8,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? When i do eat i are fried eggs and bacon on toast is that bad?

I drank a lot of water today and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal? I’m down to 11.3 now  but hardly any different at all I was thinner when I was last that weight :/",07Jul2020,1

In light of the recent worldwide events, I see the veil of depression that has fallen into most people. A lot of people have become irascible and confused. In contrast, I always thought life was going to be hard, and I had to build up from there. I never complained and always sought solutions to the most immediate problems.

11,"You guys who are teens or just live with your family should really cherish the time you spend with siblings. It's harder to leave home than in any form of media makes it seem. 
 This is probs too long but I tried to fit in everything I'd tell someone if I were in a conversation so sorry lol. I hope this is a fine place to put this stuff sorry if it isn't. 

**Tl;dr** My sister is leaving and I'll also be gone by the end of the year and I [M18] won't be able to see her unless she visits me for a really long time.**


Anyways, my sister is leaving tomorrow to babysit. We always play Rihanna's *Same ol' Mistakes* when it's nighttime and I have the best memories of us getting lost in cities or riding home to florida from South Carolina while listening to it. So tonight will be the last tine we ride in a car together for a really long time and as I sat next to her listening I actually cried lol. I played it off as yawning though. 

I just needed to talk about this somewhere. Around September or October I'll be done with my online classes and be preparing to take my ASVAB to get into the Army. And because of that I won't be there when she comes home. Due to parental stuff I did have to leave with my biological dad until I was old enough to say no so we've been seperated before, but I always knew I'd see her again. This time though—if I get the job I want—I might not be able to visit anyone for like 2 years!! because I have to go to language school. Like, I dont think anyone will ever know how awesome of a person she really is. I know everyone says that about their siblings, but she really is the best person on the planet. (Even though Im starting to sound like a sis-con haha)

She said she would beat up a kid in kindergarden. Whenever I said I wanted to run away she would leave with me until I second-guesses myself and never call me stupid. She has taken the fall for me 1000s of times and when she went to parties with weed and stuff she never let me go because she didn't want me in the middle of that. She buys games for me and even guves me money for no reason sometimes. Heck, today she said ""Put my money back in my purse. Though if you just take 20 dollars without me looking I wouldn't know"". 

We've always been together. Everyone we met always talked about how close we are compared to all other siblings. Like this list could go on and on. Being an adult is the hardest thing I've ever done so far.",07Jul2020,1
12,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that:

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

13,"     So, I've been friends with this girl now for quite some time now, but not very long. Over a decent period of time, I started having feelings for her. Always having the mindset that teens shouldn't date and always being the person who tired not to be close with people, I immediately tried to just ignore everything and move on. I knew I never had a shot with her, so I just wanted to get everything behind me.


     After a couple of weeks, I realised that the only way I'd get over how I felt was to be honest. I texted my crush that night and told her I needed to tell her something and made sure that any secrets we shared would stay between us. I wasn't ready to tell her at that exact moment, but she wanted to know if I could let her guess a few times. Her 3rd guess was that I fell in love. I don't believe in young love, but I realized that was close enough, so I said yes. When she asked me who the lucky girl was, I got scared and didn't respond until 4 that morning, so I knew I'd have plenty of time to delete the message if I wanted to.

     This is what I sent her:

     ""Lucky"" isn't necessarily how I'd put it, but the girl is you. I was planning on keeping this a secret and letting go of my feelings, but I couldn't. No matter how hard I tried, they came back to me. I told myself to forget how I felt and accept that I never had a chance with you. Sadly, I couldn't and I've been struggling with this for a little while now because it's hard to just throw away these kinds of feelings. So, I talked to some guys on r/teenagers and one guy had a good idea. He said that confessing my feelings to you would make it easier to let go. So, now I'm telling you. The good news is that it will be a lot easier to get rid of my feelings for you now that you know, meaning there's no real reason we should stop talking because of this, although I get it if that's what you want. My only request is that you don't ghost me. If you don't want to talk anymore, that's fine. Just tell me first. Please. Goodnight, ****).""

     She told me not to apologize about my emotions and that she still wanted to be friends with me. For the rest of that day, I felt relieved. Unfortunately, the relief was short-lived, as I still had feelings for her the next morning and days after that. My mind was full of random thoughts like ""You make a close friend after being alone for 15 years and it's not enough? You want more?"" and ""You're so greedy and selfish that you can't even appreciate having a friend."" and stuff like that. A few days after confessing how much I liked this girl, I realized that talking to her everyday was making it harder to get over her, so I sent her this: 

     ""I thought things would be easier and go back to normal when I confessed everything to you a while ago. I felt relieved at first, but it was short lived. I never got over you. I never stopped liking you and it's hard to because I just love talking to you. I can text you again once I forget about the way I feel about you. Hopefully it won't take long. You're an amazing person. Every guy or girl you date will be lucky to be with you. Just know that. Talk to you later, ******)"" 

     Once again, she was understanding and kind about it. So, I didn't talk to her for 8 days straight. I spent 5 days feeling sorry for myself and 2 days to watch YouTube and Netflix and eat chips. So, yeah. I handled that horribly, but it's in the past. Just thought I'd share since I had nothing else to do. We're still taking often and she's remained my best friend, which I'm very thankful for.",07Jul2020,1

Today's been a tough day. I keep thinking about this memory of you that makes me cry. It won't leave my mind alone. It's been a couple years since our friendship ended (not on good terms), but I suppose memories don't have an expiration date. Just looking to get the memory out of my head for the time being so thought I'd post it here.

You and I were roommates. After a long day of classes, I was lying on the couch, nearing the onset of a peaceful nap. So close to sleep that I couldn't move or speak, but with awareness of my surroundings just barely intact. You entered the room. You didn't realize it at the time. You mistook me for completely out of it, but I heard you. You commented to yourself ""God, he even smiles when he sleeps.""

It'd be reasonable to wonder why my slumber was so peaceful. Why was I so content? You see, right before you entered the room I found myself reflecting on life. I was thinking about all the hard times I'd dealt with in the couple years prior and how nice it was having you as a friend. How my life had turned around when you entered it. How much your friendship meant to me.

You see, you were that smile. You were my peace.

I never shared this with you, but it's one of my most cherished memories. One of the few times in life where one dares think to themself that life's going good. I miss you sometimes. But today I missed you a lot. I don't know why. I really shouldn't after how you treated me. I'm very grateful for having had you as a friend, but the way you ended our friendship really hurt at the time and still does. Not too long after this memory I'd watch your friendship slowly sour, like milk past its expiration date. Stale and stagnant, you'd end our friendship without much in terms of conversation, closure, or fucks given.

Maybe one day I'll dare again to be foolish enough to think life's going alright. Until then I've got this memory. Thank you for that. You may have thought I'm always happy because of the smile I put on, but that's not true. Thanks for reminding me what good feels like, even if it was fleeting.",07Jul2020,1

32,"Today I woke up after a maximum of 2 hours of sleep heading into what I was fearing to be reinforcing failure to put on the shelf along with the countless others. Today I was taking exams for an electrical contractors license without electrician certification or formal electrical education. 

Tense is not big enough to express the level of neuroticism I have been putting myself through as the days counted down to test day. Less an less sleep. More, but no where nearly enough studying (my opinion) and worry that I might not know what I’m supposed to. 

The hopes of my wife and kids to let us on a positive trajectory and into our own space weighed heavier than my own expectations for myself. To finally show that I can achieve something. That I can see something through to fruition. Maybe it’s a bigger deal to me than for them. 

I feel wildly excited yet not brimming like I think I should be. Not sure if it’s my adhd meds keeping me from being my normally over exaggerated overly enthusiastic self, but I feel more...more...solemn maybe. Maybe because of my age, maybe because I didn’t know I could do it and I did. Maybe because it’s the first time in a long time I’ve had this big of a win. 

I feel like maybe I can do the zillions (or at least a few) of the things I’ve always wanted to.",07Jul2020,1
33,"Recently I had a discussion on a science-related subreddit because I was confused and ignorant about some aspects about the theory of relativity. However like many others some pr*cks gripped with the curse of knowledge would proceed to downvote these and that so that the discussion became apparently more toxic, judgmental and prejudiced against the asker. Instead of changing his view to a better one he would double down instead with the impression that the users there are subtly hostile against him.

35,"Emotional advice is welcomed too! I am going into my senior year at a different college, and it’s oddly heart-breaking? I feel like I lost a part of me that I didn’t know existed. The college was more than just a college to me. Its where I met my soulmate. It’s where I’ve been able to grow and learn as an independent adult. I was able to find myself and be myself. School wise It’s where I found my passion and purpose. I had all of the same loving and encouraging teachers the past three years. Tbh it’s the teachers I’ll miss the most. They helped me build my confidence and took time out of their day to help me reach goals.

37,"She does things like drive with a suspended license or smoke weed on the beach. Look, that's not the problem. I do stupid stuff now and again and I used to do way worse. 

The problem is that whenever I caution her or say anything like ""be careful,"" she accuses me of ""attracting bad vibes with negative thinking."" Earlier she was on the beach and put up a FB story and I said ""Pretty, wya?"" And she said she was on the beach smoking a blunt up in the next county over - a much more strict county. Our county is under a curfew. While I don't believe that county is, the cops are out. I told her to be careful because my friend ended up on misdemeanor drug court getting caught smoking a joint in public up there, and even I got caught up there once too. She goes ""For real bro I'm just gonna stop telling you anything cuz of your negativity."" I just said ""Go ahead, you don't have to tell me shit."" She's been kind of lonely lately cuz her girl left her, so if she wants to be a dick then I don't need to answer her messages. 

I'm just ranting because...idk man, we are both about the same age, early 30s. Im not saying that smoking weed or driving on suspended is immature. You gotta get to work and your license is suspended? I get it. Or you can't afford the medical marijuana card? I got the card because I've been to jail for more than just a night or even a week in my past , and now I will do anything to avoid going back. A month ago, I needed to jaywalk because of construction, but there was a cop sitting right there and I wouldn't do it without asking first. Again, I'm not judging my friend. I'm just scared of the police. I don't think it's somehow just fine to smoke with a card, but without one it's wrong. That would be dumb. What I find immature is breaking the law or doing shit you know may not end well and then blaming any potential consequences on ""bad juju."" 

As I type it out, I realize that it really is a bad character flaw. It's an inability to accept personal responsibility for one's actions. Lol can you imagine if she was actually caught smoking on the beach (during covid, past midnight when people 100% aren't supposed to be out there)? She would blame me for my ""negativity."" Like, for bringing it upon her. You know what I mean? She believes in The Secret which is bad enough, but she didn't even read the book. Idk, believing you're invincible from being caught is immature. She also says her religion (some sort of Santería) protects her. Idk if her preferred deity was on vacation when she got the license suspended in the first place or something, and I don't take much stock in any religions, but I still don't need someone cursing me.

Just sucks cuz we had become pretty close over the last six months, but I think she may need to apologize to me for our relationship to continue. I mean...lol I don't even judge her, I tell her to be careful cuz the cops up there are really fucking bored and awful. I don't appreciate her calling me negative (over this. I can be negative sometimes, and being called out is sometimes appropriate) and implying that it'll be my fault if she's caught. Ever since getting ""clean"" (I use my medical card and I am tapering off a MAT drug, but I don't use anything else. I was a bad junkie for awhile, but I've been doing pretty well the last 15 months), it's been hard to find friends because it seems like they are all either AA Big Book or Bible thumpers in recovery or they are junkies. I can't be around either one. When I do find a friend, I really try to make it work. But I've also become a lot more discerning about who I choose. I can put up with a lot of shit, but I have dealbreakers I need to stick to in order to maintain my sanity. I hate hypocrisy. I've noticed that when friends do shitty things I don't like (I don't mean like chewing too loudly, I mean like canceling plans last minute or saying racist shit), things I maybe would have ignored 10 years ago, I'm more likely to say something to them, even if it risks the friendship. Maybe it's because I was really bad off about three years ago - really bad. Homeless sticking needles in my neck hoping to die bad. And I saw how few friends I really had. And I learned to be okay with it. I don't need fake friends - they're not useful to me in any way. 

If you made it this far, thank you for listening to me rant.",07Jul2020,1

I've seen dead animals, even cats before, usually strays on the highway


But this cat, was in a neighborhood. It was some kids cat.
A literal 1 minute walk from my house. As soon as I saw it I felt like shit for so many reasons. I just imagine the family realizing their car is gone, looking for it, eventually finding it dead. Now the parents have to get ready to tell their kids that their car got run over. That would break a kid. I can't image the pain I'd feel if my dog died.


I imagine the driver too. Probably just going through the neighborhood, didn't even know the cat was there. It was right on the edge, must have just hit a wheel. He/she probably heard a ""bump"" and checked the rearview. They probably know that they hit a cat. That's got to be eating them too.

I recently did this on a Streamers discord community.

After about three years of getting to know everyone, becoming a moderator, making countless art and donations to the community, helping with streams and videos and becoming good friends with people from I community. I destroyed it.

I explained a bit about recent events that happened and used them as an excuse to leave. 

Though the events DID happen I don’t really think it’s why I did what I did.

I had a good friend of mine kill himself. I had issues with a group of people and got a bit of trouble for it.

I used those as an excuse? Or maybe... Idk.

Still, I hate that I do this to myself. I loved being with those people and I ruined it.

The owner talked with me a bit, he told me to take time to myself. Get better, and try to rebuild those friend and relationships. Come back to the community.

45,"My bf and I have been dating for 4 (5 in Oct.) years. we love each other very much and we hope to marry in the future.  It started out as a sweet innocent young love when we were 16 but now we’re both 20 now and grown. We really want this relationship to last and happy with ourselves... except my parents. My parents don’t like the fact that we are together mainly because of our cultural differences and i must admit that we didn’t really make a good first impression. I understand from my parents POV, they don’t want me to lose my cultural heritage and want to keep it going for the next generation, language barrier, and just because. We have tried so hard for their approval. I can’t bring him up or we end up in an argument so i never have a chance to tell them that he is a good man. They have created this image of him as a monster; they’d tell me that his people have multiple wives, he’ll never really love me, his people beat their wives, etc. but this is all from propaganda they’ve heard and seen from media. 
My bf’s culture is the opposite of what my parents imagined. Whenever we try to have a talk my mom threatens to call the police and beat him. I don’t want him to deal woth this. I really love him and we can’t hang out. We haven’t even gone on our first date! i know how much this hurts him but i appreciate him sm for his patience and for still loving me. We only facetime and text which my parents banned me from but I still sneak . Sometimes i’d sneak to his house after school for a quick 30 mins -1 hour. We don’t get enough time woth each other. 

My parents said that if i end up marrying him, they disown me. They’ll erase any trace of me from their lives, i’ll never be able to see my younger siblings again, i won’t be able to come to their funeral and they won’t come to my wedding. Of course I love my parents and I don’t want to be disowned, but I also love my boyfriend. I’m 20 freaking years old!! I often think about if they will ever forgive me when we end up together, and who will walk me down the aisle? Who will i turn to for mother/wife advice? will they still want to see their grandkids?

53,"Xpost from r/narcissisticparents   


My parents are divorced - I used to live abroad but because of Corona I moved back to my home country and stayed with friends for a while. My dad's then girlfriend didnt like me very much and thought I was rude and selfish - mainly sarcastic. Everytime I came over to visit she would shout at me.

Couple of examples: She would be cooking food and I just ate at my friends' place, but in order to show some kind of interest Id say ""oh that smells great. I've already eaten but Id love to try some if thats ok... thinking I could then compliment on the cooking. She yelled ""YOU EAT HERE, OR YOU DONT EAT HERE - AND YOU EAT WHEN WE TELL YOU YOU CAN EAT"". I was like fuck me thats a bit much.

I use my dads address as a postal address and I won some kind of chocolate basket - they send it over to my dads address - a few days later I asked my dad if he received a package for me and he said no. I said, weird because I thought theyd send me chocolate. And both my dad and my dads girlfriend laughed and said lol, we've already eaten that... we did think it was weird someone would send us chocolates.

Everytime I came over my dads girlfriend started to give me the silent treatment more and more, until she completely stopped speaking to me unless she needed to shout. I didnt feel welcome so decided not to go there after my last visit. Especially when my dad wanted to show me something in the bathroom and when I came back downstairs and took another sip of my beer it appeared to have perfume in it. It burned down my throat and it took a few seconds to realise my dads girlfriend basically tried to poison me. This was the last straw and I left and decided never to come back...

My dad had regrets - we made up, he broke off the relationship and I moved in with him after he apologised in order to try and rebuild the relationship. (I moved in as im trying to buy myself a house and its taking a little time so it seemed like a win win). Anyway moving forward - I went away for a few days with my mum and ended up getting a gout attack. When I returned home with my dad I told him about the pain and he said ""we'll now you know how I feel every day"". He once fell off a roof and has foot issues, which I understand, but I find it a weird response. Anyway, I said I was going to try and lose some weight and better myself, so the next day I bought some salads and fruit. My dad came home and saw me unpacking the salad, looked at it - then at me and laughed hysterically saying ""what is a fat guy like you doing with a salad?!"". I tried to explain that I was trying to be healthy and that he should be supportive - but nothing.

Also literally 2 hours after I plugged in my laptop, my dad asked if I could pay towards the energy bill. This after I had replenished the fridge, bought 3 orders of pizzas during several visits without him even suggesting that he would contribute. I also gave him a flatscreen TV for his birthday and a new phone and ipad - thinking... well I dont know what I was thinking to be honest.

We were talking about me renting a place and that it could be far more expensive and he started laughing and said one of his colleagues pays 4 times for his rent what he pays for his mortgage. Im like, man why are you laughing... I understand you're proud youve done well but what the hell, this is not nice. I might need to pay that much too if I cant buy a house.

Anyway, I was still there until yesterday evening - my dad said he wanted to talk and at 8pm I asked him what he wanted to talk about as he hadnt said anything yet. He said, oh not now - Im tired, lets talk tomorrow. I told him Id rather talk now as Id be thinking about it for the full day, and it responded with ""so be it"".

I went to bed - 3 hours later I went to the toilet - and back to bed. my dad knocked on the door and said that he didnt know I was still awake, but as I am awake it would be better if I left because it wasnt working out. I said I needed some time as I was already looking for a house. I also lost my wallet that day so no longer had my drivers licence, ID card and bank cards. I needed to wait for these to get replaced so I mentioned that and asked when he wanted me to go. ""Yesterday"" was the answer and he went to bed.

I packed up my stuff and left. He has now texted me that he didnt mean it like this and wants to talk.

TLDR: My dad threw me out at midnight and now wants to talk - again.",07Jul2020,1

57,"Zürich hat in den letzten Jahren grosse Veränderungen in Bezug auf die Essmöglichkeiten erlebt. Das kulinarische Bewusstsein der Stadt bewegt sich in Richtung Vielfalt und Qualität. Sei es für den Alltag oder für einen speziellen Anlass, es stellt sich immer die Frage: In welchem Restaurant soll ich heute essen gehen?

Obwohl die Auswahl an Restaurants häufig eher begrenzt erscheint, ist dies überhaupt nicht der Fall. Zürich bietet eine grosse Vielfalt an Gerichte und verschiedenste Küchen. Man muss nur wissen wo.  
Diese Liste soll dir helfen einen Überblick zu erhalten und dir vor allem inspirieren Neues auszuprobieren. Die Restaurants auf dieser Liste sind deshalb in keiner Weise geordnet und möglichst vielfältig gewählt.

### 1. Yume-Ramen

Im Restaurant Yume-Ramen werden die Nudeln und die Brühe für die Nudelsuppe täglich zu 100 % in-house zubereitet. Dieses Restaurant steht ganz in der Nähe der Europaallee in Zürich. Die Stars des Menus sind die verschiedenen Ramen. Mit einem solchen Restaurantnamen ist das logisch. Jedoch sind die anderen Gerichte ebenfalls köstlich. Das Menu, zusammen mit der Einrichtung und der Energie der Mitarbeiter, hat dieses Restaurant einen authentischen japanischen Vibe.

### 2. Kronenhalle Restaurant

Das Restaurant Kronenhalle bietet regionale Gourmet-Gerichte. Die Location in einem jahrhundertealten Gebäude am Bellevue in Zürich ist unschlagbar. Es wird grossen Wert auf Service gelegt. Das Service, zusammen mit der traditionell schweizerischen Kost, bietet den Gästen ein authentisches Ambiente.

### 3. Tiffins Asian Kitchen

Mit einem Lokal an der Seefeldstrasse und mit einer ausgezeichneten asiatischen Küche zieht dieses Restaurant über dem Mittag die Arbeitnehmenden der Umgebung magisch an. Über dem Mittag ermöglicht ihr Menu-System eine effiziente, aber dennoch köstliche Mahlzeit. Ihre Ente à l’orange ist meiner Meinung nach die beste Ente, die man in Zürich finden kann.

### 4. Baur’s

Das Baur’s, besser bekannt als Baur au Lac, ist eines der exklusivsten und luxuriösesten Restaurants in Zürich. Dieses moderne und elegante Restaurant mit Kronleuchtern serviert kontemporäre Interpretationen klassischer Gerichte. Nebst dem ausgezeichneten Service ist die umfängliche Weinkarte ein besonderes Highlight. Die Location am See und die hohen Standards dieses Restaurants ist ein fixer Bestandteil der Zürcher und Internationalen High-Society.

### 5. Giesserei

Die Giesserei in Örlikon serviert authentische und innovative Gerichte in einer ehemaligen Giesserei. Die Wände wurden nicht neu verputzt. Dazu kommen das Kerzenlicht und die Rohrleitungen, die überall hinführen. Das Alles ergibt ein authentisches Post-Industrielles Ambiente. Das Menu besteht aus saisonalen und regionalen Gerichten, die jeweils mit ihren eigenen Innovationen in der Moderne überführt werden. Weil sich die Giesserei so nahe am Hallenstadion und an der Zürich Exhibition Hall befindet, eignet sich dieses Restaurant besonders für einen speziellen Abend.

### 6. Rüsterei

Mit einem Lokal im Sihlcity bedient die Rüsterei mit einem Restaurant, einem food Truck, einer Bar und einer Cafeteria jeden kulinarischen Wunsch der Gäste. Das Ambiente reicht von informal und relaxed bis luxuriös. Das hängt ganz davon ab, zu welcher Zeit und zu welchem Anlass man in die Rüsterei geht.

### 7. Clouds

«Das Lokal im Herzen von Zürich mit Open Kitchen und Blick über die ganze Stadt. Mit Cocktail Bar, Bistro, Smokers Lounge und Privé für spezielle Events.» Dieses Restaurant im Prime Tower hoch über der Stadt, ist etwas Besonderes. Das Menu beinhaltet viele exklusive Cocktails. Darunter ist auch der eigene preisgekrönte Gin.

### 8. Hiltl

«Hiltl – Vegetraian since 1898». Laut Guinness World Records war das Haus Hiltl das erste vegetarische Restaurant der Welt. Das Hiltl wird derzeit in der vierten Generation der Familie Hiltl geführt. In diesem Restaurant können die Gäste von verschiedensten vegetarischen Gerichten à la carte, vom beliebten Buffet oder als Take-away geniessen.

### 9. The Butcher

«Frische Fleisch-Burger, abwechslungsreiche Vegi und Vegane Burger und leckeren Fries. Burger zu dir nach Hause bestellen oder online vorbestellen und vor Ort abholen. Qualität zum besten Preis. Grosse Auswahl. glutenfrei, vegi \&amp;amp; vegan. Handgemachte Buns.» – The Butcher. Mit mehreren Standorten in der Schweiz, davon ein im Niederdorf in Zürich, ist The Butcher ein wichtiges Restaurant in der schweizerischen Burger-Szene.

### 10. Marktküche

Im Restaurant Marktküche wird die pflanzenbasierte Küche zelebriert. In diesem eher gehobenen Restaurant können die Gäste ausgezeichnete vegetarischen Gerichte geniessen. Unter den hippen und trendy Zürcher Restaurants, die sich auf vegetarische Menus spezialisiert haben, ragt die Marktküche besonders hervor.

### Fazit

Die Auswahl an Restaurants ist riesig. «Wo gehe ich heute Essen?», ist manchmal eine schwierige Frage. Das muss aber überhaupt nicht sein. Man muss nur einen guten Überblick haben. Das Ziel dieser Liste ist es dir diese Einsicht in die kulinarische Welt von Zürich zu geben.  Habe ich irgend ein Restaurant vergessen? Schreib es bitte in den Kommentaren.

I put up a post just throwing out my feelings, and I got nothing but warm and helpful replies from a dozen different strangers.

Old, young, experienced, or wet behind the ears, they all gave me one more reason to keep pushing ahead. Some offered advice, some gave an open inbox in case I needed a chat. Others spoke of their own journeys through love and loss. Thanks to all of them, I healed, forgave myself, and began to smile again.

I made a bunch of different AIs, but today I improved my strategy and built AIs that have context from your existing conversation and tries to communicate conversationally rather than as a question-asnwering type chat.


The best news?


I built this particular one on The Ricky Gervais Show featuring Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington - all the transcripts I could find ;)


http://jare.cloud/the-ricky-gervais-show-featuring-steve-merchant-and-karl-pilkington-chat-bot/


I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...


http://jare.cloud/sexy-flirt-bot/


I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....


http://jare.cloud/banned-books-bot/


(note that the last 2 are being re-trained from acting as question-answering bots to being more conversational bots that have context from the last messages as we speak :) be about 5 more hours before they're live-worthy....)


This one simply draws it's wealth of knowledge from a subsection of reddit posts, and is probably the most likely to beat the Turing test of all of them:

63,"I cannot help but feel saddened by my lack of dating... ever. I know that it is not because of my physical appearance, but it's because of my lack of motivation. I have alway been attracted to women, however i have never felt a true urge to pursue a relationship until now. The closest i have ever gotten to a relationship was with my only female friend emma. At one point she expressed her feelings for me but at the time i was confused about my feelings foward her. I had a huge crush on her at the time but we had been friends since childhood and she was kind of a sister to me so said no. I have regretted that decision ever since and that was 3 years ago. She was the closest i ever had fo a girlfriend. Because that i became deppressed for a long period of time and i would often cry at the thought of what could have been. Ill admit that i still have feelings fir emma however i now know that this is because eof teenage hormones. 

For about a year now i have put fourth efforts into dating, however only recently did i find the motivation to use a dating app. I chose bumble because of my lowkey crippling fear of rejection. I have been getting matches pretty frequently and my messages are filled with girls hitting me up but the conversations rarely last more than a few texts. Even if i am attracted to them, i just dont have any motivation to continue the conversarion so i often end up leaving them on read.

At this point im telling myself that becauee i am still attractive enough to be considered ""hot"" or ""cute"" that i do not need to be pressured into dating at this moment and that the ""right one"" will eventually come but i dont know what to do/ or think right now my mind is litterally an enigma.",07Jul2020,1

65,"will try to keep this from being a long post but typing this will be my own antidote.. and hopefully will be someone else antidote to. I'm going to keep this as real as possible 100% no bullshit. I will break this down into 3 major things that utterly destroyed me long term.

 I'm 21 years young man, and I am 260 lb, 6'3 height. My Birthday is in 10 days...

its 5 am right now and reality, or should I say the ""truth"" just hit me full force in the face.

I struggle with terrible anxiety, I am mentally messed up and overweight physically. I've discovered the red pill and finally took it  7 months ago, but I did not apply anything, I only learned knew stuff but I didn't apply any of it to my life. I didn't apply anything financially, anything mentally, physically I didn't apply any of it to myself, I got so focused on ""banging a chick"" that I broke up with when I was a beta male nice guy. I got it in my head that I would use this new knowledge to make her submit back to me. I really fucked up guys...

I've realized I haven't actually taken the red pill and just stared at it all this time... 

Games, being a Gamer really fucked me up from age 14 to current 21. it has completely messed up my vision. I live in poverty with my mom and grandma only, my mom manages to make ends meet and I am jobless... I used to have a job but the pandemic kinda got laid off from it. I thought games were the answer to whenever I felt sad or depressed or even to speed up time because I wanted the day to be over with. the game ""League of Legends"" really messed me up, I spent over $400 on that game and don't even get me started on MMOs and just buying games in general. Id Find myself uninstalling a game because I want to quit the dopamine feed then I am right back playing it 5 hours later like its a drug. games broke up some of my friendships. even though I have good communication skills today, my school life was terrible due to games locking me into that fantasy world mindset and I still feel some social anxiety from it. countless hours wasted, countless times I've realized that once I hit a certain level... once I hit a number of wins and gain the ultimate rank, nothing in my real-world will change, I will still be a loser in both my parent's eyes, friends eyes (if there are any left) and society eyes. I've decided to finally quit playing games and I am deleting them for good. because what I thought was my passion for games was really my poison, and I've overdosed off it.

Anime, Growing up from around 10 to current 21, I lived a life full of anime.  loved anime, went to conventions and I even had my fair time of binging 13 episodes nonstop, each episode being 25 mins each. I found myself going through 5 animes a week, waking up and the first thing I'm doing is finishing up the anime I was binging on. Anime has managed to severely fuck my mind up, actually doing some things characters do in anime in real life. or just pretending I'm some badass anime character like I was a kid again. Anime has been the ultimate escape for me. I didn't want to admit it... this entire time I was thinking anime was just a way to kill some time or because I enjoyed it ""I actually enjoyed it' but because I was excessively overdosing off it. I've seen the good the bad and the ugly parts of anime... I've even challenged myself to watch as many anime as I could for an entire month. Binging 140 episodes of an anime in 2 weeks. I've come to realize what I considered a good time to relax was really just an escape from reality that damaged my train of thought and put me even more into the blue pill mindset. id always find myself needing to eat food every time I watch anime, every time. so I've decided to completely shut off watching anime series. I will be taking a very long break from it, it maybe for good.

PMO, yes Porn masturbation and orgasm. this was the icing on the cake, I've been watching Porn since I can remember, it started at 12. it got really bad leading up to the years... I would do it in the front room if no one was in the room. I would do it in the bathroom shower, practically every chance I got growing up. it got bad to the point my actual search history (i won't go into detail) got really terrible and honestly, my mind was really fucked because of this. I experienced temporary ED when I was with this chick, I couldn't even get up it was horrible. my social skills went out the window, I even got into the mindset that I don't need a woman for sex I could just masturbate all day... and to top it off, I did it often, multiple times a day. my hygiene took a toll on it. I even procrastinated on doing so many things I told others I would do because of PMO. so I've failed no-fap and semen-retention multiple times, never made it past day 3. I've realized the reason I couldn't make it past day 3 is that the other 2 major things anime, gaming was keeping me in the same cycle. I've also found myself doing PMO when I was just plain bored. I've realized the reason I keep relapsing is simply that I am not confident in myself at all...but most importantly I decided to abstain from PMO for a very long time, I now see the truth and the damage it has caused me over 10 years. I am just glad that I am still young enough to fix myself.

Every day I look at myself in the mirror and I just stare into my own eyes... it's like I'm dead inside but I have no thoughts of suicide. I have dreams to be great, I have dreams of being my own boss, I have dreams of being fit and in shape. but now I can finally see clearly what's been weighing me down. it's been the things I felt the most comfortable doing... I'm done with the matrix, I'm done with the blue pill. I've had enough of this damn beta male life and I will finally swallow the red pill for what it truly is and apply it. I am thankful that the most-high has shown me the blueprint that I must walk, and I am thankful that I didn't fall any lower and be in a lot worse predicament with my life at an older age. 

I am very creative with talents...but no one else knows I have those talents... I am determined to completely change my entire life. Because I simply have no other choice... 

thank you for reading this, and I hope this shed light on the others who have fallen deeper into the abyss then I have...",07Jul2020,1
66,"I just started a new job close to a month doing landscaping.  I'm on a crew with 2 other guys.  Were always to busy going around town to be able to go back to our shop for lunch so we eat wherever we are.  This means if you want to eat you have to bring your lunch or buy something.  I always bring my lunch and for the most part so do the other guys.  Sometimes when they don't though they'll spend anywhere from 10-30$ for lunch.  Even most days when they do bring a lunch they'll still stop and get some more chips/cookies and a drink and spend another 10$ or so.  

Recently one of the guys mentioned he needs a new pair of boots cause the soles are coming off on the ones he has.  I suggested he get a pair from the brand I get because they last for a long time(the pair I have are over a year old and get constant use but are still in great condition) and only cost about 150-200 depending on which ones you get.  He kind of chuckled and said he can't afford that.  I didn't say anything but I was thinking to myself, ""you can't afford something you actually need for your job but you can afford to spend 200-300$ a month on junk food when you already have food at home"".  If he would just not buy a bunch of shit from the gas station for literally one month he could get himself a really nice pair of boots.

74,"July 7th is Tanabata (Star Festival)! People write wishes on pieces of paper. If we could make a wish, we would like for men with BPH patients to find relief from their uncomfortable symptoms. What is BPH you ask? Well, BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) is the medical term for prostate enlargement. It is a condition common in older men where they may experience frequent urination, slow or poor urinary flow, straining to push out urine, stopping and starting of flow, urine retention in the bladder, incontinence, urges, etc. 

We wish for men to have a longer night's rest, so they don't have to get up many times a night to go to the bathroom because of BPH!  


We wish for men to have more energy in the morning because they didn't lose sleep!  


We wish for men to have less stress from dealing with the uncomfortable symptoms of BPH!  


We wish for men to have a better quality of life by successfully managing their BPH!  


We wish for men and the public to have awareness of BPH- it's a matter of when, not if, it will develop!  


We wish for men to consider natural and holistic approaches to mild BPH management- physical activity, healthy nutrition, complementary medicine based in traditional Chinese medicine and studied clinically (such as UMOOZE)!  


What are your wishes for your BPH?     ",07Jul2020,1
76,"In narrating my story, you might be tempted to think I'm justifying my behavior.  I'm not.  I am a despicable piece of shit.  I've come to know this so comprehensively it no longer matters to me to mitigate the shameful parts.  I'm already living with the knowledge that I'm nowhere near the good person I thought I was-- and that's saying a LOT, considering I've been jailed, I'm clinically depressed, and I *always* normally teeter between self-hate and cowardice.  I didn't know I could get lower; but now I live with the terror and shame that I have no idea how fallen I truly might be.

Three brief points of defense: first, unmedicated depression is a motherfucker.  Second, all contact from me has stopped-- and between her blocking me on some accounts, me asking her to block others, and me essentially doxxing myself to two people close to her as a plea for accountability, I swore to never have unsolicited contact again.  Hopefully these failsafes work where my personal integrity did not.  Third, the alt account I used to negatively harass her with was a fabricated persona-- so the critical and hateful things I said were not my *own* feelings.  My pride wants her to know that; but it doesn't matter ultimately because *I still said it all, and I still was harassing her.*  Plus, regardless of whether the words themselves were affirming (my personal harassment) or demeaning (the alt account harassment), the obsessive *behavior* is consistently mine.

That's a fuckton of preamble.  Here's the bare bones of what I did.  I had a personally and psychologically miserable winter, and became unhealthily obsessed with connecting on a personal level to an internet model with whom I tricked myself into thinking shared some intangibles (wit, social conscience, depression, family conflicts, etc.).  I subscribed to her premium content and sent a lot of money and a lot more messages over the course of half a year, with almost no response.  My depression and desperation grew as time passed, and some deep googling got me her address, to which I sent a letter and some dumb gifts I hoped would be encouraging and humorous, at a time when she herself was having life problems.  Again, depression is a motherfucker, and I was oblivious to how scary/shitty/creepy a move that was.

Months pass, still no responses.  Any properly functioning person would understand this to be an answer in itself, but not I.  She responds quickly and consistently to trolls, though, so I created an alt account and persona of a trans person whose partner had committed suicide from depression, then began to attack her under the premise that she exploited her own depression for likes.  It worked.  I got responses.  Looking back, I had no idea what I actually hoped to accomplish by the negative harassment: sure, I was disappointed to not hear from her on my main accounts, but not bitter.  I truly appreciated (and could clearly relate to) her speaking up on depression, and I genuinely felt concern for her as a person-- or at least, the person she presents to the interet.  But I had no plans for what the negative harassment would lead to, I just did it on the side while I blanketed her with positive messages.  Yes, I know, it's fucked.

At some point she was able to connect my alt to my real accounts.  I'm still unsure how (her given reason didn't make sense).  It doesn't matter, though, as it all came crashing down-- not simply the accounts, but my own self-image.  I realized how horribly I acted-- both as myself and as the alt-- and I cannot stop reflecting on all the compounding horrible decisions I made, how I was able to justify them at the time to myself, how dehumanizing I was, how delusional, how thoughtless, how cowardly, how selfish.  It's terrifying, honestly.  

And I can't say I'm better now, cause I don't know how to trust myself again NOT to be that toxic.  Weeks have now passed (maybe a month?) since it came crashing down, and I've thankfully not even tried to reach out to apolgize or explain myself, which, as much as *I* desire to do, would still be a form of harassment.  

If she or anyone familiar would see this, they'd know right away who I was.  But I'm getting to be OK now understanding that there might never be a way for me to apologize and explain; so this confession isn't a backdoor way to that end.  Rather, it’s a reminder/warning to myself, semi-publicly, that I have to be ever-vigilant. 

I have nothing to hide from my *actions* and will honestly answer questions as insightfully as I can manage, and accept all condemnation and hate as it is given-- but I will keep identifying details away.  I'm sorry for being like this, and I'm sorry for what I've done.",07Jul2020,1

81,"Had no clue what to title this lol so bear with me. 

My step-mum and I had a little bonding trip the other day, during which she talked with me about how her kids had been sexually abused by their babysitter (13-15 year old boy) for two years as young kids. We were talking about the trial and hearing her talking about it broke my heart. She said that she wrote a letter to the judge, pleading to trial the boy as a minor and not an adult, seeing as he was so young. ""As a mother, I wanted to kill him. But I also didn't want to ruin a boy's life at 15. He ended up with 24 court mandated therapy sessions, and nothing else. The alternative would have been to have him rot in a cell for the entirety of his youth, probably longer, and have him be no better of a person and probably more violent, and likely end up being a repeat offender. The prison system is part of the criminal cycle like that, it's complicated. I was angry at how mild the sentence was, but I also realized that no sentence would have felt right. No sentence would have given my kids back what they lost."" 

I got chills and teared up when she said that. I'm paraphrasing, but that's pretty close to exactly what she said. 

It made me think of my own youth. I was sexually abused as a child, by another child, for two years. I took no legal action, mostly because I was living abroad at the time and it would have been essentially impossible for me to do so and I didn't even cross my mind as I wasn't really sure what was happening, and I've never told anyone. My mother was physically/verbally/emotionally abusive growing up, and I *absolutely* could have taken legal action, had I been in a country where I had citizenship, and -- being honest -- if my father had been on my side, but we tended to brush these things under the rug back then and pretend they were justified/not happening (they are now divorced and things are firmly out from under said rug). 

I wonder what would have happened if my family had stayed in the country where I was born/my parents are from. I can't imagine legal action would not have been taken. Maybe my mother wouldn't have been so abusive, but I see that as being one of those things that no matter how you change the story, it remains the same. I wonder if I would have been removed to a foster home, or if she would have been arrested, or something like that. 

It's pointless to think about, maybe, but now that my mother and I have begun to reconcile, it does occupy my thoughts, even before my step-mother told me what she did. She's stopped drinking, she doesn't hit me any more (not unheard of of course, but it would be weird, considering I'm now in my 20s), she says very nice things to me, etc etc. But she has these moments where her true colours come out. Last summer, she blew up at me and we had an honestly terrifying screaming match after she claimed -- **NOT** for the first time -- that *I* was abusive as a child. I was a nerdy, quiet, pretty happy-go-lucky kid with depression who had attempted suicide twice by age 9 and was subsequently diagnosed with CPTSD. I'm of a mind that a *child* **can't** be ""abusive"" (a child can be kind of an asshole lol, but almost always at the behest of their parents/upbringing, so it's really hard to blame them or fault them personally for it, they're a literal child), but even besides this I was *not* a troublesome child. I was *incredibly* easy, all things considered. Maybe a little bratty, but no more than is usual for a literal *kid*. It set me the fuck off, so I let her have my piece of mind. I don't even remember what was said, but I remember screaming ""Don't you *dare* talk to me about forgiveness, I've forgiven you, and forgiven you, and forgiven you"" and...idk what else. Then again the other day, she showed her true colours yet again by going off in a very know-it-all, annoying tone of voice, about how my father (who I actually had a relationship with growing up, became a little estranged from post-divorce, had a good, long conversation with a month ago, and now we're back on speaking terms/hanging out/actually having a good relationship. Difference being, there was a foundation there to fall back on) is buying my loyalty and love, *""have fun loving a manipulative asshole who buys your love""*). Rich words coming from her, clearly. 

Anyway. This has gotten derailed, but goddamn it's hard. I don't want to cut her out completely, mostly because I'm afraid she'll kill herself (this has also been an issue; any time I express my own ""negative feelings"", negative feelings being my *personal needs*, she becomes derailed and has attempted suicide in the past/has suicidal ideation) but she's reached a stand-still in her growth away from her abusive past this past year and I'm not fucking having it, ya know? I'm an adult. She looks to me for her emotional validation, and always has. It's exhausting, and makes me weigh all my actions against her *re*actions. And of course, this pattern effects other relationships in my life I actually give a shit about with people who actually love and *see* me. Not majorly anymore, thank god, but it has completely broken some in the past and, well, *not fun.*

As i was walking i saw a young man probably at his mid 20s, he was just leaning towards a building and looked really sad but i just walked passed him. After 30 mins or so i was walking back home and saw the same man crying as quite as possible, but he could not hold back and just like that he continued crying out loud for quite awhile.

I never met this man so it was the first time seeing him cry and i had no idea what those tears really meant.

I had no clue but for some reason i felt sad but at the same time i was glad he poured out his sorrow without holding back.

I stood there, i didn't wanted to ask what was going on but rather i wanted him to let it all out.

So i walked and leaned towards the wall keeping my distance, i was trying to consult him without words.

We stayed there for a long time.

I'm diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety, osdd-1b, and a plethora of other stuff really. I'm honestly just a fucking mess. I got in an argument with my roommate today about how I don't know if I can work when things lift. I had to move states and am completely unmedicated and my anxiety is the worst its been in years. He started telling me pretty much to suck it up because him and my partner also had disabilities and compared to them I'm ""the least disabled"" of us all. I said I wasn't medicated and it was hard for me and he told me he had some prozac if I wanted cause they didn't work for him.

I took him up on it. I had the entire bottle emptied into my hand and everything was just so fuckin loud, like I was about to shove them in my mouth and just end it when my phone vibrated. I got nervous it was my partner or something, but it was a reddit notification. I had forgotten a debate I had started in another sub and the other person finally replied.

I put everything back in the bottle and put the bottle on the counter and just...replied. I don't even know why. I've always been someone who wants the final word on things I guess. It distracted me long enough to just put the bottle back in the cabinet and go back to my room.

I'm writing this because you keep posting on subreddits like If you are going to get the help you need.

It was a good short relationship, you both agreed to end it, yes you were happy in it, but you ended it because she had some issues before you could go any serious, you spoke about it, you are still friends, stop being a little whiney bitch and being depressive because of it.

You are loved and cared about, even If you think you aren't, accept who you are and how you live things, it's okay having ups and downs, it's normal, don't make a fuss about it.

And for the love of god, stop looking at pictures of you two together, it doesn't help, let it go, it's okay, someone will appreciate you, and care about you, and you both will be ready to be together.

As a wise man once said

    ""Shut up and wait"" - Grandad

110,"TL;DR I have a great job opportunity that requires a temp pay cut. I know my BF will want to pay more of my share of expenses so we can maintain lifestyle, but, my pride hates this. Do I need to get over it? Or should I put my foot down?

&amp;#x200B;

Been dating the same guy 2 1/2 years. We're probably close to moving in, but at this point share no expenses and split everything we ""share"" (like dinners out, vacations, etc) 50/50.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an amazing career opportunity to do international development type work for eight months without having to move. This is the sort of work I have always wanted to do, but, because it would require a move it's a dream I gave up so I could stay with my BF (he has to stay where we live). Now my company is offering me a chance to ""check that box"" with an eight month project - but I have to take a 20% pay cut for those eight months.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, this means some cutbacks, like reducing spend on vacations, less eating out, etc. I suspect when I talk to my BF he is going to offer to pickup the slack... instead of us splitting things 50/50 he puts in more for the time being.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, my pride really does not like this. But if I say no I feel like I'm basically making him live with less just based on my pride.

111,"I'm 46. Working in a loud casino, going to loud concerts, wearing loud headphones, shooting with no ear protection (as a kid with my partially deaf father), and other ear abuse my entire life finally caught up with me. I started realizing that I was going tone deaf. 

I stopped being able to hear or understand voices in a certain range.  It was worse in my right ear. I started having trouble recognizing where sounds were coming from. People would walk up behind me on the right &amp; scare the heck out of me. Then the tinnitus started. That finally prompted me to seek professional help.

Due to a forceps injury during delivery, the right side of my head is warped. A large blood vessel has settled into my ear canal. It simultaneously stims my auditory nerve &amp; increases my risk of stroke. Yay, me! I'm also about 40% deaf in my right ear. My left ear, in spite of trying to destroy it, only has normal aging loss, &lt; 5%. 

To 'fix' the blood vessel means going through actual *inside-my-skull surgery*. Opening up my lid &amp; spilling my brain juice. I'm conflicted because the tinnitus makes me want to bang my head on concrete. But cranial surgery is intense. The docs don't recommend it. It might be permanent nerve damage from loudness, and the surgery might not help it anyway. So I smoke a lot of pot. It doesn't *stop* the tinnitus, it just makes it easier to ignore.

The deafness, tho. I think I've been deaf on my right side my entire life. I have always been ridiculously easy to startle. If something's making noise on my right, I hear it on my left. There were a couple of times where I was late coming in from recess because I didn't hear the bell at all. It has me looking at old school maps &amp; how the playgrounds aligned w/the school buildings 🤣 

My parents weren't the greatest, so my hearing could have easily slipped through the cracks. Because of my skull, my eyes are goofy, too. That took precedence. I've been reminiscing a lot, since I'm unemployed &amp; quarantine &amp; crisis-of-the-week, etc. I'm coming to realize that between my eyes &amp; my ear, I've been living w/some significant design flaws. My dread of PE finally makes sense, as do social problems &amp; stupid misunderstandings I've had.

Then it just went quiet.
