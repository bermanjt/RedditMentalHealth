1,"I am pretty content with my life, I enjoy most of my days. 

But almost every day I get this moment that I just say to myself ""Fuck i wanna die"".
I dont really mean it, I am not going to kill myself or hurt myself. This is just me admitting that something is missing, or something need to change.

Does anybody else get those feelings?",08Feb2020,1
3,"Even if right now, your life is shitty, even if you are drowned by your life (French expression on), I'd really like to hear it 

Of your read this port of my post, it mean you're probably interested in what I said , so please don't tell me ""there's nothing that get me happy today"". Try too find, even if that's little things like "" I ate something I like today"", or even ""I loved the weather today"". Maybe it look weird to you, but seeing the little thing that make us happy is making life a little easier",08Feb2020,1
4,"This is very unusual for me. I'm a pretty decent looking guy so I don't have problems attracting girls in my age group. My current girlfriend who I'm in a (non-serious/casual) relationship with is 24. So it's not like I'm attracted to a 50-year-old woman out of ""desperation"" or ""last resort."" I have many options available, so being attracted to this middle-aged woman is highly usual for me.

I don't know what caused this. I was at the gym 2 weeks ago and saw this woman, she looks like she's either 47 to 50. Within that age group. She looks healthy for her age though. She doesn't look like the average wrinkled up middle-ager. You can tell by her face that she's a middle-ager, but her body looks really good for her age. When I saw her working out, I couldn't stop checking her out every few minutes. There are other girls at the gym that are way better looking than her and I probably have a chance at dating some of them. But for some reason, I'm turned on by this middle-aged Asian woman.

It's the weirdest lust I've ever had. I've never been this turned on before. And when she walked by, she smelled really good too. She's all I can think about the past couple of weeks. As expected, whenever I came home from the gym, I immediately looked up porn videos of ""short-haired Asian milfs"" and masturbated to them furiously. Out of all the porn actresses I could find, she looks like an older version of ""Ran Minami.""

The lust is so bad that I don't care if my current girlfriend leaves me. All I can think about is this woman at the gym. She goes by herself, so I don't know if he's married with kids. My dick is throbbing with pain just thinking of her as I write this post.

I don't know how to approach this problem. It's almost week 3 since this all started and she's still all I can think of. The only thing holding me back is the age gap. I don't know what to do, this is driving me fucking insane.",08Feb2020,1

6,"You might have heard the saying that it doesn't matter how hard you work in life it isn't possible to be successful.

Its obviously not true for everyone but for a majority it definitely is.

Each and every leader and government for every single country has become corrupt in one way or another, if you doubt that you're one of the more simple humans.

Death is just around the corner. We all know how easy it is to die - - a crazy person could kill you at anytime if they caught you off guard, a plane could come crashing through you're roof. Quite ridiculous examples but I think you understand.

Lastly, money doesn't always bring happiness. This one is quite important we all think being successful is being rich where as some people think it's being happy and fulfilled, having meaning in your life. Anyone who pays attention to the world around them can see that mental health has sky rocketed. The amount of people who will admit they are not happy or want to die is greatly disproportionate to those who are happy.

9,"I'm good friends with this ex, we get along pretty well and once in a while we chat a bit. She's by far the hottest woman I have ever been with, the only thing I wished were different about her was her height, I'm so much into tall women. Today we began chatting and I started teasing her about her height, she got into it and we were left wondering what would she be like if she was 1ft taller. I got pretty turned on by this and it was clear she got too. When saying good night she even said she would dream about that.

So, yeah, awesome, I wish she was actually much taller.",08Feb2020,1
10,"Long story short she got sick in the end of December and just hasnt gotten better. Everytime we make progress one way she gets sick another way and through it all she hasnt been eating enough at all. I've been syringe feeding her for a little over a month in hopes her appetite will come back but it just hasn't... 

We made the decision at the vet appointment Tuesday, and then the vet recommended one last thing to try. I'm so mad we got hope again. I want to try anything but coming to that decision was so difficult. Now the medication seems to be sort of working but she still isnt eating. 

Monday is coming quick and I just can't bear the thought... having her home is so hard. Knowing these are the last days we get to cuddle her. I'm so incredibly sad. And I have no idea if it's the right decision..",08Feb2020,1

Really hits home for me as a eternally miserable person who isn't good enough for people, never really got anywhere so it puts it in perspective talking to people like this. Still seeing someone like this who works hard and has done so much she and others like her deserve happiness. Hope you guys are on your way.

14,"Sometimes, I get into a really negative mood and feel so horrible that I want to die for very vague reasons.  I’ve looked at what I posted on Reddit recently and I’m feeling concerned. I’m only now remembering what happened to me. I felt horrible then but now I’m feeling fine. I’ll probably go into another bad mood swing again but I really don’t want that to happen.",08Feb2020,1
16,"Hello reddit,

I just thought it'd be a nice exercice to write a bunch about myself and where I'm at in life. So while I'm at it, why not share it and perhaps somebody would, for some reason, could enjoy reading it. (beware English is not my native language)

I was born in March 2003. I have an older brother and sister. My sister and I have a degenerative eye disease. My sister is pretty much blind and I have about 30-40% of my vision left. I've always been a pretty quiet person and always liked to think a lot. I started learning piano at age 6.

I also discovered Minecraft when I was around 8 and would spend quite a bit of time playing it growing up. With the help of my brother in grade 5-6 I made a server to play with two of my friends and soon other kids of my class joined. Then after awhile one day everything on the world we had been building was griefed. I soon found out who was responsible for it and was kind of hurt because at this moment I realised they weren't really my friends but were just using my server to play with their friends. I didn't have many friends in elementary school actually.

Then came high school. I didn't know anybody when I arrived there. Being the very shy person I was (and still am) I spent maybe the first half of the year either eating alone or not eating because too anxious of eating alone. Then I'd spend the lunch time at the library, and sometimes when it was not open, I remember just waiting in the bathroom. Then I slowly started making friends and hanging out with them at lunch and during breaks.

Since then, I've been with that group of friends for the past 4 years. However, I've never really become close with any of them, and I practically never see them outside of school. Also, I've been kind of depressed/lonely throughout all high school. I've kept gaming a lot with one friend from elementary school (with who I had started the Minecraft server), so at least that was great.

About 3 years ago, I started learning about things like physics, maths, philosophy, etc. which I found very fascinating (and still do). My interest for music also greatly augmented and, especially since one or two years I've been expanding my horizons on all kinds of music and everyone thinks I'm totally weird for some of the music I listen to (also I started playing drums/percussions when arriving to high school).

One other thing, every summer, since I was 8, I went to a summer camp for 4 weeks. Last summer was the last time I was going there. Every year it was mostly the same people, so it was nice to see each other every year. In the last years we'd do some hiking which I really enjoyed. Last summer we hiked for 17 days (6 guys and 2 adults not sure how to call them). Lots of fun, and lots of mosquitoes too. I mean, a LOT.

One year and a half ago, when I was feeling rather lonely, I decided to sign up on a penpaling website. I started penpaling after returning from my camp, and I've never stopped since. It's been such a great experience. I've kept in touch with one my first penpals and we've now known each other for about a year and a half. She was the first person in my life in which I confided and she helped me so much, I'm really grateful for her.

I also made friends with another penpal about 6 months later. And her, she has been the most wonderful person in my life. We exchanged emails for about 8 months and then moved on to texting. Since then we've been talking almost everyday and I had never felt more loved and cared about in my entire life. We also had a few vocal and vid chats which are extremely stressful for me but I really enjoy them. Tomorrow, it will make exactly one year she first wrote to me. We're planning on doing a vid chat and I'm so excited!

Though I feel kind of insecure. I still am kind of depressed / have pretty bad anxiety and I sometimes talk about it with her. She always tells me she's happy to be there for me and she's okay with it but I really hate the idea that I might still be kind of a burden for her.

One other thing about me, for the last couple months I've been learning to code and I quite enjoy it. I have to decide what what I do in college before the end of this month, so I'll probably go in programmating or whatever it's called. I'm just not sure with my vision, and it also makes me rather anxious to picture myself doing that for the rest of my life...

lol I doubt at this point anyone is still reading, but I guess I'll add that in the past year I've been getting increasingly concerned by the environmental cause. I've since been trying to eat vegetarian and I think I want to make it one of the center points of my life.

Soo, there's me :p I probably forgot a lot of things but there's already way too much lol. If you're still reading, thank you so much! Feel free to leave any type of comment or question.",08Feb2020,1
17,"I was just talking to my girlfriend about this because she loves compliments and enjoys being the center of attention. On the other side of this, I feel like compliments and attention in general makes me uncomfortable. 

When she says things like “you’re handsome” or “it’s going to be ok” it feels like these words are coming out of her mouth and just bouncing off me. I feel like when most people hear good, reassuring things like these it’s like they stick on them. Because these words actually make them feel better. 

She recently recommended me this song by The Beach Boys called “Don’t Worry Baby”. Is that how people feel when someone says something nice and they’re feeling down? What am I doing wrong?",08Feb2020,1
18,"It gets really hard sometimes. I try to breathe and when that doesn't work I go outside or look something else to distract me. But the thoughts still try to bring me down for every mistake I ""think"" I make:
• You failed your first opportunity for a long lasting relationship at 22. You're never going to find someone to love. You have to cling to her, she's the only one.
• Oh, so you think you're doing good as a leader of this club you're trying to start? Anyone here could be 10x better than you without even blinking.
• You're so weak. Anyone can play with you and manipulate the shit out of you when they please.
• Trying to exercise more and play basketball? Ha! Like that's going to change anything.
• So, you're trying to make more friends with this RP thing? I'm just waiting for you to screw this things like everything else.
• You got scammed in your first ""big buy"". All that work wasted. You don't deserve money.
• You really think that girl from your volunteering likes you? Have you seen yourself in the mirror? You're hideous.
• You really think you'll ever be happy? Just look at your raising family. That behaviours tend to repeat over generations man, so quit this hopes of having a lovely wife and daughter someday. Either way she'll probably is going to inherit your depression.
• You're a child. You'll never be a grown ass adult.

I don't think ""normal"" people have this many thoughts attacking you every day. But as my ex said: alcohol is not good for people like you and me. And she was right. That shit was just making things worse.

24,"Hi there! New user here at Reddit. I am trying to write an article that can help people to manage large amounts of stress and I'm thinking of writing one about dealing with large scale examinations (was a student and had lived through this) and major projects.

There have been endless advice out there listed in the web, but I really want to hear what you guys have done to cope with such things. Can be about the most stressful examinations or any insurmountable work challenge in your life that you have overcome. Hope that will be alright, thanks for the help !

25,"I wish I didn't have anxiety or depression. Both are making me want to take my life again, just so I don't have them anymore. 
So much is happening right now but mainly, the depression/anxiety tend to hit me at the same time for a month or two at a time and this one has me especially frustrated.
Tomorrow is my one year anniversary. I was so happy, but just last week my depression decided to have it be naught. Now, everything is horrible. 
I cannot take a second without some sort of reassurance. I've been pumping out art just so I could stop thinking. I feel terrible around my friends and classmates... I feel like such a bother. I feel like I should be invisible.
It's like... No matter how or what people say, I always feel like they say it with malice. Like they don't care about me, that they're being disingenuous...
I was so tempted to kill myself this morning. I said my final thanks to all those I felt needed it... 
My head hurts and I feel so tired..
I want to cry...
But worse, and going back to the anniversary, he hasn't been texting me as much not just over text... But in person as well. I'm scared of my worst fear coming true, losing someone I love. And I hate for it to be him; with my anxiety, I feel like he's more interested in my other friend but I am pretty sure I'm just disregarding what interest and affection he shows me...
I don't know anymore... There's so much more, but I feel so disoriented... I can't even focus in class, I was sobbing in the back as hidden as possible... I burst out crying in another period...
I feel worthless and hopeless...
I've been crying...
Things always get better, but God damn the timing of this one... Damn the pain. Damn the confusion. Most importantly, DAMN THE EVERYTHING.
I don't even know if I wrote down everything... I can't finish this thought but... I don't know if everything that's bothering me is all here...
My head is all o these things at once..
 And typing them out to sort and say them coherently... Is so hard...
I haven't been eating or drinking or showering as well as I had before...
I hate this...",08Feb2020,1

****AND… I’m a Republican because I believe the richest corporations in the USA should not pay taxes at all.

8 - I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.

7 - I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.

****AND… I’m a Republican because I believe hate speech is ok.

6 - I vote Democrat because I’m way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that get police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion.

****AND… I’m a Republican because I believe our children should have frequent ‘lock down’ drills and live in terror of dying before they graduate.

5 - I vote Democrat because I’m not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy.

****AND… I’m a Republican because I believe birth control is a sin and people who cannot abstain from sex until they are properly married and comfortably funded should be destined to ignorance and poverty. How else will we make more Republicans?

4 - I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it.

****AND… I’m a Republican because I believe legal asylum seekers are less than human and should be kept in cages while their children are given away because they dared to seek a better life. I also believe that Social Security is an entitlement for the poor and should be de-funded as it is socialism.

3 - I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit.

****AND… I’m a Republican because I believe that even though businesses make millions and billions in profits on the backs of their employees and their ability to do business in the USA, their shareholders deserve more of the profits than the people.

2 - I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.

****AND… I’m a Republican because I believe the constitution can be ignored whenever it suits me and my word is the law.

And the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it’s better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher or fish here in America. We don’t care about the beetles, gophers or fish in those other countries.

29,"   Gather around everyone. It's time for another random story about myself. I have a very peculiar habit involving our beloved candy coated chocolates, from the Mars company, that developed around age ten. The Movies ""Mars Attacks"" hit theatres, and I was instantly a fan. At the time, my family would rent from blockbuster, each kid would get their favorite box of candy, and we would enjoy Friday evenings together watching the movie.... I loved M&amp;Ms. 
    After my first viewing of Mars Attacks, I grabbed two of the Mars candies, fancying them invaders from another planet, and squished them together using my thumb and forefinger.  One of them would inevitably crack, resulting in the other being my Martian ""Champion"". In my mind, I was forcing these seemingly innocent childhood delights into a gladiatorial battle to the death. Weeding out the weak in the M&amp;M gene pool. 
    The loser of this barbaric feat of strength would become delectable treat for me. The champion would inevitably reenter the thunder dome, until my victor ludorum was crowned. From that day forward, this is how I have chosen my favorite color M&amp;M from each pack.",08Feb2020,1

32,"I'm in my 20s now. I've had this issue for a while and I stopped trying to figure out what the issue is. Doctors can't help, a majority just see me for 30 seconds, tell me I have anxiety, and send me out. Therapists see me for a few minutes, tell me I need to see a doctor, and send me out.

I've become somewhat ghastly over the past few years. I was a pretty attractive teen, you could see what kind of adult I was going to become. But something went wrong and at around 18 or 19 my body/brain fell apart. My brain is a complete mess, like literally so bad that I can't hold a job down. My body on the other hand, it's been better.

Symptoms I had included hair falling out, dry eyes, exhaustion, breathing difficulties that lead to me passing out, soreness everywhere, tremors, nausea/sickly feeling, eye bags, wrinkles, grey hairs, patches of hair loss everywhere on my head except the back, lost facial hair, painful cramps in my limbs at night. The areas under my neck and my nostrils are so swollen I can't even breathe in comfortably anymore, and the doctors just said that was extra tissue caused by damage and sent me out. On top of that, my face is ugly as hell, my jaw looks malformed, and my face just seems like I was infected by a fungus right before I entered adulthood.

Because I can't hold down a job I've been ruminating about some kind of self employment but I'm severely limited by my psychological/physical issues which include serious obsessive compulsions. I can't do anything unless I perform an exact procedure. I am diagnosed OCD and schizoaffective. My mood issues worsen obsession. I can't afford medication and I am really not faring well mentally.

34,"I'm not conventionally attractive by any means, and I'm not some average-looking chick fishing for compliments: I am probably a 4 at best. From having a bald spot the size of a quarter and short, unmanageable hair to my broad nose and overall unappealing face. I have no sense of fashion, and couldn't tell you the different types of makeup if my life depended on it.

I find the process very hectic, frightening, and annoying; though I know that it's important to look presentable for the outside world. I have no one to help me with this process, and I'm just feeling incredibly lost doing this on my own. I just wish that I could have learned to placed importance in my looks during my teenage years instead of just being so ignorant and not taking such things into consideration.

I feel like I have to catch up at the age of 23 while women have been instinctively doing this during their early teens. I know that some people say that beauty is subjective or that it doesn't matter matter at all, though I honestly beg to differ. Your appearance is important in helping to make a good first impression, whether it's during a date or an interview; it's especially important if you're a woman.

I don't hate the fact that such things are a fact of life: I just hate the fact that I can't get with the program and fully assimilate, that I don't fit in or even seem to feel motivated to do so even with the benefits of making such sacrifices. I don't know how women are able to do it, and I just wished that I had their knowledge.

I guess I'm looking for advice, as I'm just at a loss of what to do. I'd post a pic or a link to said image to give you a better idea of what I'm dealing with, though I'm unsure of how to go about that.",08Feb2020,1

There was alot of people around him, and over the course of the five minute video (he was just barely alive but was in major shock) some people recorded. That is extremely disrespectful and I know nobody would ever want a crowd of people recording them in public flailing around for help. Some people did help, try to calm him down but there was not much to do. I mean it would be better to just walk away instead of violate this person as he's dying for your internet points.",08Feb2020,1

**BONUS Extra hard mode:**

I don't have a smartphone either. Even when my brother worked for Verizon I didn't bother getting one through the employee thing. Haven't ever really wanted one honestly. I really only feel like I'm missing out on GPS/maps when I'm on the road, but otherwise I'm content with a dumbphone. Didn't wanna be that guy always looking at his phone instead of looking literally anywhere else. I have a tablet, but it's just for e-books and redditing on the shitter really.

I still have a substantial DVD collection boxed up in a closet somewhere. I still have a few shelves of books I should get back to - I haven't read an entire book cover to cover since I discovered reddit probably. I've been going to the library, but have so far been pretty consistently still choosing internet over reading. I'm torrenting some shows for the fiancee so she doesn't go nuts (she pretty much subsists almost entirely on crappy procedurals...def no shortage of those ffs). I'm trying to think of all the other shit I need to do before D-Day arrives. But I'm actually a bit anxious for it to hurry up and get here, preparation be damned.

---------

**WTF am I thinking?**

I wonder that myself sometimes. The reasons for doing this? Well, I might have a bit of an internet addiction. I don't really care about that except as it relates to my productivity, which has fallen to near shite levels when I'm at home. And however I try to /r/getmotivated, I can't. But I do know without internet I'll be forcing myself to do other things. All those things I used to do and enjoy. I'm sure they will come back to me. Right? There used to be...things. And....stuff. And I...did them? I think. Hopefully it'll be like riding a whole lot of little bikes. Duck-sized bikes? Let's go with duck-sized bikes.

-------------------

**But...reddit?**

I don't enjoy redditting anymore and have not for quite a while (outside of /r/moderatepolitics anyway). It's most of what I do to waste time though nonetheless, and it needs to stop. The community at large has become increasingly and unbearably toxic, in line with discourse in general I suppose. [People = Shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqcXgODTeOU)

Ever since reddit's surge during the last campaign season I find reddit to be pretty insufferable. I even took a break for a few months because as far as I can tell the trolls have mostly driven away or buried any semblance of the types of conversations you used to be able to have on the platform. Like when I joined reddit I think /r/news had something like 5 million users maybe? Now it has almost 20,000,000. It's just not the same demo at all, and trying to have a fact-based discussion here is nigh on impossible.

Myspace taught me I should avoid certain social platforms like Facebook, and I've never been compelled to actually comment on Twitter. For whatever reason reddit has gotten a pass all these years. But it's not worth keeping internet for something as trivial as reddit, that's for sure. I'll still be able to get on here and there, but not having it at home will be a breath of fresh air I expect. Not exposing myself to the toxicity of my 'fellow' man I KNOW will be a load off.

**What am I giving up along with the internet (and reddit)?**

Almost everything I do will change. I'll be dropping...youtube, netflix, hulu, amazon, steam, origin, instant access to news and the stupid shit people say about it, streaming radio, wasting time on reddit like I am doing right now this very second....

What else? The ability to be confident in my internet connection's security. I need to pick a personal VPN and get it set up on my laptop and tablet. I'll have to use one of those devices to pay my bills. I don't even check my important email addresses off my home network, so this will be potentially nervewracking from a security standpoint. Like, I segment my home network. I'm a little security obsessed.

I'll be giving up a nearly $100/month or so bill from Comcast. Definitely not gonna miss that. Just what it enables. While money isn't really a factor in my decision, I'll at least have a little extra scratch to do other things with. Also will obviously no longer pay for Hulu and/or Netflix. I always have one or the other at least - I usually do the whole subscribe --&gt; binge --&gt; unsubscribe thing and cycle through services. So a little more scratch there too. Minus a few bucks for the VPN, but that should be nominal.

--------

**What will I still be able to do?**

I'll still be able to update podcasts with gpodder occasionally and listen to them offline at home. I might have to get an antenna for my tv so I can have access to some news? I haven't watched 'TV' TV for almost 20 years now, but I feel like some access to local news is probably smart. If I get an FM radio I can listen to NPR. Do they make FM radios anymore lol? This is literally the only situation I can think of in which I might need one aside from like an extended camping trip maybe?

I will still be able to play some computer games; anything not reliant on Steam's DRM and everything on my GOG and Humble accounts. I even have a hard time focusing on games these days too. I have a ps4 but honestly barely play it anymore. Meh.

---------------------

**What am I gonna miss the most?**

Hockey. It's hockey season. Trade deadline coming up. Playoffs on the horizon. That is gonna hurt the most probably at first, but I still think this will be worth it. I am only committing to minimum of two months no internet, so perhaps I'll get to watch the playoffs. Meh. Hopefully I just keep it turned off. It's not a necessity. It feels like it, but it isn't.

-----------

**What am I gonna do with myself**

I have no idea tbh. I'll still probably be on the computer a lot at first, but if I don't have anything else to do I will probably continue fucking around in Unity or some other IDE and also editing videos, just with far less distractions.

Read books. Play music again. Fucking write things for pleasure instead of merely for arguments' sake. Drink...about the same lol. Possibly go to the gym? Wow typing that felt weird. I'll have to utilize other people's internet and public wifi, so I'll have no choice but to get out more. It'll be good. Right? RIGHT???

------

Anyway, this is probably not a great post, but suppose this is what this subreddit is for? 

Bottom line: I have been considering doing this for at least a year. Procrastinator I am, finally getting around to it. We'll see how it goes. I suspect just like when I lived in the mountains I won't even notice it's missing before too long. It'll take a bit to adjust, but I'm optimistic about the potential I will be enabling once I do so. Nervous about it too though...but in an excited way. Like I said, have considered this for *way* too long before finally pulling the trigger. I'm committing to *at least* two months. Hopefully more.

So in conclusion...Thanks random asshole /r/news mod! You helped me get motivated by being a power-abusing, unaccountable dick! So I guess I actually owe you one. Just one.

In exactly three weeks, I will be entering unexplored territory. Feels like I'll be living in a completely different world from ya'll...and that sounds fine to me.",08Feb2020,1
37,"I wish I could go back to being your little boy.
I wish I could cry like how I used to at age 4.
Sometimes I just want to explode and cry in front of you.
I wish I could put into words the things I want to tell you in person.
Sometimes saying those things to myself my voice cracks like I'm not strong enough to utter the words without collapsing into tears.
I want to cry and let it all out because I know you will heal me.
I've always felt better after a heart to heart conversation with you.
I don't feel lost anymore, I feel right at home.
I feel like a once blighted house recently renovated.
You are my foundation, I can be strong and face anything through you.
If I could give you all my time I would.
I miss you and I wonder what happened to us all the time.
I wonder why we used to be so angry with eachother so much.
I regret every nasty memory.
I wish I could bring this all up to you but you're a happy person.
You don't think about these things like I do.
And if you do you must be too caught up in your routine to give thought to us.
For a while it felt like we were fine and then we'd blow up on eachother and it was a continuous cycle. But you don't know how much it killed me.
I hid it well but deep down my world crumbled everytime we went from peace to conflict.
I can't have conflict with you and I don't want it.
I was immature and not in control of my emotions. I was lost, for a while it felt like I was thrown into the world alone.
I've never been so lonely as when I was in a relationship and seemed to have it all together, because how things happened to me taught me the truth.
The truth that this world is a dark, cruel and unforgiving place. And life is so fragile, happiness too. But when you come in the room and kiss the top of my head before you go to sleep, I can't help but reminisce when I was your baby and you read me books and spent time. I would give anything to go back to that place. 
I wish you knew how much I love you. I love you with every fiber of my being. Our relationship is the purest and now I have realized my destiny. My existence serves to make you proud.",08Feb2020,1
38,"hello. allow me to introduce myself, or rather, tell you a bit about me...

i'm an 19 year old guy. now, i won't give more personal details because i honestly prefer the aspect of anonymity which is indigenous to reddit, so you can simply call me 2BCalm.

anyways... here is what has been on my mind for the better part of 2019 and 2020 so far...

first of all, let me tell you about one of my core principles and the story behind it... it's secrecy. (oh, the irony!)

so, not long ago, i've heard; according to some studies; that if one wants to actually achieve a goal (career, project, studies...), then they're better off not telling anyone (i.e. friends, family...) about it because; as it turns out; it can actually increase the likelihood of reaching said goal.

also, since i'm keen and a perfectionist in nature (yeah, call it boasting, i don't care), here's some sources i've found to support what i've said: [here](https://wanderlust.com/journal/why-you-should-keep-your-goals-to-yourself/)

uhh... what else am i willing to talk about?? oh, reddit! yep. well first of all, iirc, i discovered reddit around mid 2018 (i won't get into how as you'll shortly know why)... and ever since, i've been throught A LOT (both good and not-so-good) of experiences (phases, ""friendships"", obsessions...). i may not be able to talk about all of those experiences cuz it would take a great amount of my time, and above all, i personally prefer not to relive those memories (i moved on).

well, ever since i stumbled upon this strange platform, i've been on and off many reddit accounts (now all deleted) and each one has quite some stories interesting (again, both good and not-so-good) associated with it (and also some unique usernames which i still consider to be cool despite the memories associated with them).

anyways, as of now, this is my current (and only) account, i wish to keep it that way.

i came to the conclusion that reddit; compared to instagram, facebook, twitter...; is actually quite unique as a social platforn (and yes, i think it's better than both of 4chan and tumblr, fight me! haha).

i got used to its absurd, dry and dark humour, inside jokes, comment sections, subreddits (only the few ones i like tho)... and unlike facebook, it's a cool site with a very decent userbase and also user interface (i'm referring to reddit mobile of course haha).

anyways... besides my reddit experience (aka my real life), well... let's just say that major work needs to be done (don't worry tho, as it is MY job to worry about those matters and not yours).

the more i think about it, the more i appreciate and cherish these rare (sort of) and happy moments (writing posts like this, browsing reddit, or doing stuff i enjoy in general) in which i can contemplate and talk freely about whatever's on my mind and also get to forget my worries and enjoy the things i like (again, i prefer to keep em a secret).

btw, keep in mind that i'm not seeking any validation or for that matter, friendship (no hard feelings btw). nor am i willing or intending to chat with anyone who's reading this (not that i despise others or that i'm anti-social, it's just that i wouldn't like to relive what i've been through before, which is the burden of relationships (platonic in my case) with people like those who i've met here in the past), instead, i just want to post stuff like this with the sole purpose of doing something different for once in my ""reddit career"" (haha) and also, to simply document my thoughts.

cuz for most of the time since i've made this account, i've decided to just lurk around and not interact that much because it's more ""neutral"" and ""quieter"" if you're getting what i'm tryna say.

anyways... that's about it haha... feel free to ask me anything in the comment section and i'll answer IF i can. :)",08Feb2020,1
40,"So basically what had happened was I brought my girlfriend over (light skin mix (this does come into play later) she’s 18 and I’m 19, and my mom was really happy to meet her. She was super happy and really liked her despite her being black, which my mom is not a fan of. They were getting along up until... my mom started using some racial slurs to say the least. I asked my gf to excuse for a quick second and I went to go talk to her. I didn’t know/expect her to be drunk when I got home, this explains why she was so happy to meet her. So I told her to either get it together or we were leaving. My mom came back out and calmed down for about 45 min before starting this bullshit again.

She got up and started saying very hurtful things to both of us, but my limit was what she did next. She repeatedly pushed my girlfriend and ended up slapping her twice. Me and her have been dating for 2+ years (and before you start asking about years and stuff, we tried to keep it low before really telling anyone, and yes this lasted for 2 years). I jumped in, and without thinking about my actions because all I could see was red at this point, punched my mother in her nose and lower jaw area. She was bleeding from her nose and lip and started blaming me and said she would call the cops... I’m not worried about legal repercussion, I’m worried about my relationship with my mom and my girlfriend, I feel like she might break up with me because of my mom. Did I do the right thing by punching her, in defense of another?",08Feb2020,1
41,"I grew up in the country and we didn’t use a dishwasher I mean we had one it was some really old kind but we had one. But to the best of my knowledge I just thought it was a drying rack because that’s what my grandma told me. Or maybe didn’t even tell me that we didn’t use it as a dishwasher and she always had it open and drying the dishes. So I mean that’s just what I thought. I’m pretty sure she knew it was a dish washer and knew of it’s magical powers but just didn’t trust it. 

   So yea I didn’t find out until I was like 12 I would say when I was at a fellow country’s kids house. But more on the rich side of things like they had this big beautiful White House with a white fence all around and a big back yard with a trampoline and pool and his grass was actually green. But he was really nice and was my best friend. 

  Anyway I was there and I saw his mom doing the dishes after we had ate lunch there and being the guest I offered and said “do you need any help putting the dishes on the drying rack?” And she started cracking up. And I was so confused because like what’s so funny? Well yea she was like um sweetie do you know what a dishwasher is? And I was just like a what? So yea that’s the day I found out what it was.

   And then when I got home I told my grandmas that I think that her drying rack was actually a dish washer and I was all like isn’t that amazing?!!! So she then told me that she already knew that but that it was just broken. And I believed that. It probably wasn’t broken she hated new technology. Her fridge and mixer were both 30 years old. I remember because she would always tell me to be careful with things saying how mad she would be if I broke it because it had held up for 30 years and she’ll be dammed if I broke it after it had lasted this long. 

  So yea I was never actually showed how to use said dishwasher. I’m (15 f) now. I mean even when she died I mean no one ever showed my dad how to use a dishwasher so yea we just used them as drying racks anyway and I was just told that they were broken. I live with my my mom now as of a few weeks ago and they keep using that dishwasher of magical abilities I don’t really trust it. But one of these days I shall have to use it and so bring up the fact that I’ve never used one before so I have no clue how it works. I wonder what else I’m oblivious to. Oh for a while i didn’t know what a dryer was and just thought every one just hung their clothes up to dry. But I quickly figured that one out while being at my rich friends house. 

   Yea I was so confused that day on how his mom kept bringing his clean laundry all folded. And walking past with his sisters laundry also. And I was like wait how so much laundry in one day. So I sorta jokingly said “you must have at least 3 clothes lines!” And he started cracking up and told his mom so she  started laughing and said oh follow me. So then I saw their laundry room that had a washer and dryer. And his washer was so much nicer than mine and he had a dryer. 

  Lol this happened with lots of things I wonder if she remembers all this and still gets a good laugh out of all that. Lol wait until the day that I learned about phones that weren’t attached to a line. And car windows that you used a button for instead of turning a window handle for. And garages?! Lol when her mom asked if I wanted to come along with them to go bowling and so I was so excited because we were going into town to do something fun instead of just getting groceries that we can’t get ourselves or locally sold. That was a adventure. First “um but I where’s you’re car?” Then everyone putting down their window down and me asking “how do you put the window down I think my side is broken where’s the window crank?” Lol I loved that button to much when I found out about it. Then being so excited that the arcade there wasn’t out of order and that his mom got quarters for us. (Lol the lies!) I was just like “oh I just need a few nickels” (I had only ever been to a sucky nickel arcade only a few times). And when his mom bought the food there and didn’t have us eat before we left and didn’t have Vienna  (those little canned sausages) sandwich’s in her purse that I always looked forward to having when i went out and about with my grandma. (Mustard and some Vienna sausages on brown wheat bread but only one slice of bread that was folded over on its self to make a sandwich)

  
  And when we first got there I was 9 at the time but before we walked in I was like “ok what age I’m i?” And she was like “what your 9 right?” And I was like “yea but what age I’m i nowwww?” And she got it and started laughing and was like “oh you’re still 9”. Lol at the desk thing when he asked me ,so how old are you sweetie and I said “I’m 9 and I’m not even lying this time.” Wait I actually think that was my first time bowling so yea I didn’t really get it and kept tossing it and it would like be in the air for a few seconds then you would hear a loud bang and it would start to roll backwards. So yea I had to use that little kid thing with his little sisters they realized real fast after having some good laughs.

  Then after we stopped for ice cream at a big brand name place and everyone was ordering big things instead of a one scoop on a ice cream cone. I thought for sure that his mom would be mad and put a end to it.

  TLDR: little country kid learning about modern technology and things rich people do that are foreign to little poor kid

Thanks for reading this all I don’t know I have just been having one of those nights that I think about my grandma a lot and my life there. I miss my friend also I wonder if he still remembers me I was 12 when I last saw him. And his mom I wished I thanked her for being so kind to me. I guess the last time I went there I didn’t know it would be my last. 

   I don’t even know his last name to find him anywhere on social media. I hope he doesn’t forget me and one day we can hang out together. Lol I bet he doesn’t even remember the trip to the bowling alley because it wasn’t a big thing to him. He seemed to always remember all the things I would forget though like my crazy imagination would come up with some fun games and adventures. 

   Like the time we got stuck it a ditch out in the pouring rain because of me and i had to climb out then help him and try to get him up then fail and run to get help all covered in mud. Or the time we stole a chicken (later we got in trouble and had to apologize and return it but it was fun) yea so we chased that chicken around after we climbed over someone fence. We captured it then brought it to our tree house and fed it worms we had dug up before. (Ok now that I’m thinking about it. I had chickens so why didn’t we just get one of the ones in my grandmas chicken coop to play with?) 

   Yea that plan had a few hours in the making of digging up worms then finding a basket and rope so that we would be able to get the chicken in the tree house. We also snuck some blankets from his house because we didn’t know if chickens got cold or not (surprise the chicken didn’t like the blanket and instead pooped all over it). 

   Anyway my grandma came outside and looked up and saw a random chicken that wasn’t hers that we were trying to pet while over feeding it with worms. And to apologize we had to do some yard work for them but it was fine because we snuck into their barn and pet their horses after and the old guy caught us but was like “hey you guys want to ride?” 

   And I had never mentioned that I knew how to ride a horse so he was all in shock when i got the horse to go faster then was jumping over some small hurdles and going around barrels. Ah this post is so long but um I have just been thinking about him and my grandma and his family all night because I miss them all. I remember how we met on the school bus in kindergarten and I was so scared because I had never rode a bus before and I got in the bus and he was just like here you can sit next to me. 

   And he told me that he already knew how busses work because of his older brother. And so he told me what bus number we were on and we were in the same kindergarten class too so after school he let me walk with him to the school bus and stand in the right number line. And from then we were best friends. He told me where he lived and I told him where I lived so after a few weeks of school we organized it to where we would hang out at his house then after I would walk to my house. 

So thanks for being my first friend. Trust me I haven’t made that many friends without you. It turns out that no one else likes my imagination like you did.",08Feb2020,1
42,"I was showering and I thought I locked the door because I specifically remember double checking it (I always do, it’s an old house, the lock is a bit tricky) so yea I thought I locked it but I guess I didn’t. I was done with the shower and in the process of changing my clothes when my housemate barged in. I instinctively covered myself but I think there was a split second when he saw me naked. We both said sorry and he hurriedly closed the door. Anyway I committed six months to this house and it’s only my second week and I feel awkward now kill me :)))",08Feb2020,1
43,"So this was about a year and a half ago. I was 21 and desperate to get CHEAP/new car. First of all let me start off by saying I was young and dumb (still young and dumb). I tend to make irrational and quick decisions when i’m excited about something. For personal reasons that I don’t wanna get into I was not able to receive a license until I was 21. So when I finally got my license I needed, let me re-phrase that...had the biggest urge/desire to buy a car like the day before my license came in the mail. Also getting a car would allow me to start a new career.

Now for financial, and impatient reasons I was going to finance the car. Now when I say finance I really mean have the LOWEST monthly payment possible. My job requires me to drive 100-200+ miles a day mostly highways so leasing was out of the question. I also did not, and still do not want to buy used. Which is a whole separate argument for a whole different day. Anyway I was literally looking for the cheapest 2018 model car ever created. 

It’s a week before fourth of July and the cheapest car I could find was a 2018 Chevy Spark for around 13k. I figured what the hell I’ve waited 21 long years on my skateboard I can wait another week to try and get the “fourth of July deals” to increase my wheel size from 59mm to 200mm. 

Boom after checking “cars.com” everyday, on July 7th 2018 I pull up with my dad to a chevy dealership 90 miles away from home. Me, feeling like a Russian mobster (I’m Russian haha) on the outside, and as excited as a young school girl on the inside walk inside with my dad. I pull out my phone and show the sales guy the ad I saw. 2018 Chevy Spark for $10,001 in a lightish blue. 

Keep in mind I did NO research. I read NO reviews. My mind was set on this Chevy Spark. You could tell me 9/10 Chevy Sparks are reported to have a mind of their own and drive off of cliffs at 50k miles and I would still buy it without a second thought. 

Now I’m sure all of you can relate to a certain degree. You know the feeling of being so damn excited for something. The feeling of wanting something so damn bad that you would do irrational things to get it. In that moment you don’t want to hear anything negative about your decision. You just want IT. At the time it was the only thing I could afford so in my mind it was either the Chevy Spark or never drive a car again in my whole life. 

Back to the dealership, the sales guy asked if I wanted to test drive it, and for that 90 second circle in the parking lot (I didn’t even take my time I just wanted to get back and sign the paperwork) I fell in love what felt like for the first time. I didn’t even fall in love with the car I fell in love with the feeling of driving hopefully my neat future car. 

This is a Chevy Spark LS. I’m talkin manual windows, no power locking, no center console, cheap speakers, feel ever pebble on the road, get blown off the highway when a gust of wind or even ANY car passes by. I’m talkin a car that teaches you what claustrophobia is. A car that feels like you’re sitting inside one of those electric cars for toddlers. You get the point this was a bare skeleton with a piece of plastic around it. But I loved it. 

I had pretty good credit at the time so I was able to finance my first big purchase. 7.9 APR at 178 a month. At the time thats literally all I could afford. Ya know with insurance being so stupidly expensive if you’re young. So after a long day of paperwork and the sales guy telling us he literally can’t even drop a penny off the price I drove my baby home. 

Fast forward to January 1st 2020 around 5pm: “DAD I NEED YOU TO COME TO ME I JUST SLAMMED INTO A PARKED CAR GOING 60”

Okay okay I know you’re excited to hear what happens next but let me back up a little.

For my job I spend A LOT of time on the road and in my car. 200+ miles/6+ hours a day is not uncommon.  I’m about 5’7 and 150 pounds so I’m not the biggest guy. I’m a nice guy, but the Chevy Spark taught me what it feels like to be uncomfortable. It taught me what anxiety is. It taught me that you can have road rage at yourself. 

A little insight on my job; Im an in home sales man for home improvment. The owner of the company I work for (he took a liking to me because he is also Russian) knew I was planning on getting a car. He told me when I get a car he will train me in becoming a sales rep. Promoting me from my position as a telemarketer. So knowing this made me that much more in a rush to buy a car. We drive to appointments everyday, and sometimes just sit in the car to wait/chill in between appointments. So basically 2/3 of the work day is spent in the car, and the work days can sometimes be 9am to 11pm.

Me being naive and irrational did NOT think about these things when purchasing a car. I did NOT realize how important comfort is when sitting in the car all day. Sure the first 6 months I was so excited about having a car that I did not think about these things, but things quickly changed. 

I started to get really angry and started to despise working. I would wake up KNOWING I’m about to be very uncomfortable and annoyed inside of my car. 

Every detail about the car is horrible. My left elbow rested on what felt like rough old cement, and the rigid surface would leave marks on my arm. My right arm would always be itchy from the cheap cloth armrest. My left leg literally had no where to go. THE WORST PART ABOUT THE CAR THOUGH, my left knee would literally almost ALWAYS be touching the manual window roller handle. Half the time the handle was either directly on top of my knee or directly in front of my knee. I had nightmares about crashing the car only because I knew when I did that handle would be the end of my knee. 

There was no storage compartments in the car. I had no where to put my phone, my change, my wallet, anything else comfortably. Because it’s a tiny hatchback my back seats would ALWAYS have to be pushed forward to fit all of my work stuff (giant bags). MEANING I could not push/lean my seat back enough. It was the equivalence to those people in the asian countries that live in the tiny apartments that look lime walk in closets. 

Now I’m a music guy so listening to music is a must. Not even a year and my speakers started to blow... The speakers sounded like an old nokia phone in the first place. Or a better description would be when your earphones break so you have to pull out the old trusty $9 backup earphones from ross. Constantly I would think about installing better speakers but just never got around to me

There are 2 lessons to be learned from this pointless post, but one of them is how important comfort is when picking a car to own. I will now NEVER sacrifice comfort in the future. Not just in a car, but in anything.

Okay now....January 1st 2020 at about 4:30pm on a very main road. My new years resolution was to stop smoking cigarettes so this was day one!

So around that time of year it can get slow for my job. So as a side hustle I started doing Uber Eats. Let me take a quick second to say CHEVY SPARK DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR RIDE SHARING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE 5 SEATBELTS. I was EXTREMELY mad when I found that out AFTER I bought the car.

Since the car is so uncomfortably small it took many many attempts to find a phone mount/holder that was just okay. I finally found one that required my phone to be right in the middle. Keep in my mind this is my first day using it. Also keep in mind I am Russian and it was just new years. RIP to my liver the night before.

Here I am driving 60 on a very main road. My phone is right in the middle and I’m looking at it trying to figure out where I’m supposed to deliver this burger to. *Uber eats; pick up food from restaurant and deliver to customer* As I’m looking at my phone in the middle, while singing along to my music, most likely thinking about life, 100% hoping my headache would go away, wondering what my girlfriend is doing, admiring how warm my new north face jacket that I just bought is. Basically doing everything but paying attention to the road (And I’m sorry my grammar is getting worse as this post is going its 3am and I stopped caring as much LOL). I’ve been driving for a year and a half now I’m so confident in my self I can drive with my eyes closed using my feet.

Anyway, BAM I look up and my car is basically inside of an Audi SUV. “FUCK!!!!!!” “Fuck fuck fuck fuck” *close my eyes cause its a dream* *open them cause I’m waking up after a nightmare* “FUCK”

This is my first accident. I was going 60mph, at this point I’m completely speechless and very shocked. Every one always told me that car was a death wish but after about 5 seconds of stating in front of me I immediately climb over the airbags and exit the smoking, pulverized hunk of plastic. 

I slammed into a parked car on the right side of the road. Really horrible too, thank you seatbelt. I don’t even know what to do in this situation so I’m dumbfounded. Witnesses are asking if I’m okay I was so all I could say was “yeah I’m okay” 

I called my dad, and after what seemed like a minute he shows up. The owners of the parked car came out of the restaurant all normal accident stuff. I had a sprained finger, bruises yada yada. 

Now my insurance wanted nothing to do with is since I was doing uber. I filed a claim through uber’s insurance and they said I’ll be covered. Awesome, score, BUT I didn’t know what gap insurance was at the time. I failed to do my research which I always end up having to learn a lesson cause of sometimes heedless decisions.

I had 8 thousand left to pay off my car loan and 40k miles on the car. I for sure thought it was over. I was done, game over. Every one told me the insurance would pay me 5 MAYBE 6 thousand for the car leaving my to pay off the rest. 

Now I’m not religious but by some kind of mystical higher power I was blessed. I pretty much hit the jackpot. My payout was $11,200...

I purchased the car for $10,001...

I got my loan payed off AND received about 2k.

Now if that doesn’t scream second chance I don’t know what does.

To wrap up this long long meaningless story I just want to say a few things. 

If you read up to this point I applaud you. It wasn’t a hell of a ride to read this story. It wasn’t the script to the next big summer blockbuster. It was more like, a carnival ride for children ages 3-6. 

But there are some important lessons and morals to be taken from this.
1. Fuck the Chevy Spark
2. Comfort in a vehicle is very important
3 Do your research and please get a car that you will love even 2 years down the line. Get something you like. If you cant afford it wait until you can if you can be patient
4 GAP INSURANCE
5 Don’t make hasty decisions like me

After lots of research I am getting ready to finance a 2020 Toyota Corolla SE next week, and I’m very excited! 

We live and learn. We make mistakes and we learn from them. I know when it comes to stubborn minds like myself we won’t listen/pay attention to advise that much until we have to pay the consequences. I try to listen more and look things into a different perspective as I get older because the older you get past 18 the more bad decisions screw you over. The consequences weren’t as bad as a teenager but now wrong avoidable decisions can really change your life for the worse. Adulting isn’t easy but thats just the game we call life.

44,"Watching a YouTube video with the comments turned off is the most dull and isolated thing ever. Seriously, not knowing what others think or feel about the video you're watching, not knowing if other people enjoyed it or hated it too. It's like you and only you alone watched it.",08Feb2020,1
45,"I was recently seeing this one girl for a bit but I didn't feel like she was as ready to jump into things as I was (which is totally fair considering her circumstances). I, however, couldn't help but to get frustrated over time and ended things because I felt like I was getting led on or used, but looking back I realize that I may have been too emotionally immature to handle things properly regardless of the outcome.

I feel like this sort of immaturity has been a bit of a recurring theme in my love life and now I just feel so childish and frustrated with myself.

Is there some sort of formula or series of steps that I can follow to gain emotional maturity? I'm so tired of being a child in a grown man's body...",08Feb2020,1
46,"I had five days to get all kinds of important stuff done. You know what I did? I sat around and played video games and scrolled Reddit. Did I do my taxes, no! Did I return the power cable that was damaged, no! Did I fix our invisible dog fence, no! Did I eat tons of junk food? Yes! 

I managed to go grocery shopping, clean the house and do laundry. Oh, good for you! You got basic things done! Here’s your hug and kiss and accolades for a job well done! And I wonder why my wife called me a disappointment and she feels like she was taken advantage of.

I’m afraid to say I’m sorry this won’t happen again. I don’t know how to stop or change. There’s part of me that doesn’t want to change, making yourself a better person is hard work.

19 years with slight blurred vision but decided to try contacts because emo disliked glasses. Anyway was walking dog at night and looked up.

Holy fucking shit it was beautiful there were stars everywhere, I’d never seen them before with my real eyes it hit me and only on pictures.

Just a massive coincidence that the song playing at the time was champagne supernova, the vocals only version by Liam which I think is even better please just listen to his voice in this. One take apparently.

Honestly one of the most magical moments of my life and idk if it was a sign (oasis reunion impending aha) or just some mad coincidence but it was beautiful and I couldn’t stop looking up and smiling :) 
I don’t even know how I missed that I’d never saw stars before it just wasn’t a concept in my head I guess lol.

54,"There's this person I used to be good friends with, and during our last year of college (2019) we were partners on our final project.

We did a really good job, but for the entire process our relationship was very strained and toxic. I was miserable, worn out and mentally not doing well for the last 4-5 weeks of the project, and by the time the project had finished, (for reasons other than the project itself) we were no longer friends and she had blocked me on all social media.

Bad things occurred from both ends, and I don't really believe she and I can/should be friends again, but recently one of my professors contacted me, cited our final project  as the reason and offered me an opportunity to do a test at a nearby studio, which could lead to an actual job.

The field for this job is not really my speciality or area of professional interest, but my first, gut instinct when I was told this was that I should recommend my 'friend' for this job instead, despite the fact we aren't really fans of each other and haven't spoken for nearly three months. But she does good work, and she was 50% of that project as well.

I remember her saying that she wanted to go in the career direction that this opportunity could lead her in.

Should I just recommend her anyway and chalk it up to a random act of kindness?",08Feb2020,1

She was reading a WEBTOON I was somewhat familiar with and we had a great conversation afterwards.

I gave her my number. And things were really cute after a while, I was gonna call the morning after and ask her out on a date.

But we ran into two issues:

* She’s incredibly busy, and is only free Saturday.
* She has a kid. 

Now, I love kids. But I’m also 22, still in college, and my career isn’t even off the ground.  But I feel like I’d only do that if I were 27-30, I dunno doesn’t seem right now.

57,"I live a privileged life in a wealthy country, and I’m trying to understand why I should care about people who don’t. 

When doing a college group project for proposing solutions to social issues, my professor criticized us for identifying “trivial” issues like societal pressure and income inequality instead of more “severe” issues like the deadly conflicts in the Middle East and Africa leaving millions dead or driven away from their homes.

One student pointed out that, since we have virtually nothing in common with the people who live in those places and we haven’t even come close to having such experiences in our own lives, we shouldn’t be expected to empathize with them, stay engaged, and come up with impactful solutions. One student even went as far as to say, “I’m already busy with my own stressful life; I don’t care about people in Africa.”

I think this is a very common mindset among people in my country (and perhaps most other wealthy countries). Why should ordinary people in rich countries be expected to care about the lives of people in developing countries? Privileged people have their own problems too.

To a certain extent, this makes sense to me because, at the end of the day, people are self-interested and their perspectives are narrow. I also personally don’t feel like there’s much I can do to change what’s going on in other parts of the world, so I just end up throwing money at some charity and calling it a day.

However, I completely agree that none of us are merely observers of our society, and we all interact with it and benefit from it constantly. But I still have trouble justifying why I should care about people who I’ve never met, living completely different lives than me, in a faraway place both geographically and culturally. Assuming that I’m a selfish privileged brat (and aware that my iPhone is made in China), what specific ways would caring about those people benefit me? I’m genuinely interested in your thoughts.

Thank you guys so much, thinking about this has already been eye-opening for me. I hope this can help me and others in positions of privilege to expand our perspectives and recognize our responsibilities in today’s global society.",08Feb2020,1
59,"Story time, this is a long one

yesterday evening I went to the kitchen to grab something to eat and my sisters and brother were playing cards there or something and they were talking about how we will no longer use the furnace since It's not that cold anymore and we will keep warm by using gas. 
I was told that specifically.
It didn't matter to me that much so I just sait okey and thought nothing of it. This morning when i got up for work i go to the kitchen to grab something to eat and make coffe and as im a professional idiot I promptly forgot what they told me the night before i go to light up the furnace since it was cold in the house and left for work. I just came back home and was told by my sister with dissapointment in her eyes I nearly killed them all.

What happened was, the valve on the pipes that connect the furnace with radiators in the house was turned off and for gas was turned on and the heat and pressure the fire made was too much and the pipes started bursting boiling water all arround the house and the pump that pumps water through pipes was turned off as well so the pressure of water broke it. Here is when the real shitstorm began, the gas pipes ALSO STARTED LEAKING!! everyone was up by the sound of bursting water and there was so much steam in the house you coudn't see freaking anything in front of you. My sister goes to turn on the light and my brother had to push her away from the switch as to not spark the gas (panic and adrenaline probablly) while they were standing in flood of boiling hot water. She tried to grab the valve and burned her hand really bad on the furnace (nobody knew that it was on)

I nearly killed my two sisters, a brother, my brother in law and my three little nieces.

Now neither the furnace doesn't work due to the broken pump nor the gas due to broken pipes. 
I don't know what to do, I knew I was and idiot, but to this level...everybody hates my now and they should I don't blame them.
I can't trust myself anymore.

TL;DR: almost killed my family in sleep because i accidentally  fucked with gas.",08Feb2020,1

63,"Just gonna post this in case I need to refer to it later. Yes, it is ""shallow"". I'm not gonna risk ending up with somebody I don't like and wanting to cheat on them. Anyway here goes...

Myself: Male, gay, 27, average body type (skinny-fat? lanky?), white, introvert, bipolar and depression, high-functioning autistic, will post a pic next week.

Now, what I look for...

* **NO OLDER MEN.** Almost every date I've gotten has been men 40+ and I'm sick of it. And no, lying about your age won't help, I can always tell you're lying or find out easily. I'm 27 and deserve a guy in the 22-32 age range perhaps. 

* **No more obese men.** Again, every single guy who shows interest in me is obese. I get sick of this body type. Especially being in the le 40% obesity rate country (additional 30% non-obese overweight), I rarely get access to guys near my body type. I deserve a body type like mine that I enjoy.

* No flamboyant, loud, obnoxious, and/or extremely feminine men. Just not my thing. I'm into more quiet introverts like myself, who are kinda gender-neutral and not too feminine-presenting. I support gender-nonconforming individuals, just don't wanna date, fuck, or even befriend most of them tbh. Sorry.

* Controversial, but white men only at this point. My history of dealing with other races is uh... yeah, no. I could type novels on it. It's not good. That and I'm visually only into a certain subset of white men out of anybody. I wish I was into men of color but I'm just not. I'm into Nordic looking guys with light hair/eye colors and small features. I like some face/body hair but don't go overboard. 

* Sexual details: prefer smaller cock (4-6""). My sex drive is very low so don't expect more than like twice a week if that. I generally don't do anal penetration so a ""side"" would be nice. I don't bottom at all and probably won't top well. No fetishes/kinks but I am a furry so be okay with *anthro* porn. (No ferals, real animals, or underage. Anthro characters only.)

* I need a lot of attention and am extremely cuddly and clingy. If you have lots of other friends, I will get very jealous. So I prefer you not have them. I have none at this point. You must cuddle me and spend time with me constantly. God knows I need it.

* **No successful people.** If you have a college degree, a stable career, your own house/independence, talents, skills, or are well-liked, I'm not interested. I will get too jealous and potentially self-harm. It's not good. I want a fellow loser like myself.

* Must be at least somewhat a Nintendo fan. I don't agree with a lot of what they do either but they make most of my favorite game franchises, and other companies just focus on shooters or RPGs which I'm not into. If I wanna play Switch games with you, you should be more than happy to, and at least know the game we're playing.

* Must be okay with just staying in and doing nothing. None of this ""adventurous"" or wanting to ""go out"" stuff. I'm an extreme introvert and staying this way. You should be too.

* If I can tell you're gay by looking at you, listening to you, or seeing your profile on Facebook/Twitter/whatever, it's an instant no. I want a guy who can be mistaken for straight. Not sorry.

* If I tell you not to do/say something, listen and don't do it. Don't insult my appearance. Don't make me watch a movie I don't want to. Just actually respect me, because nobody else does.

* Respect and love white men. None of this ""social justice"" bullshit that's just gaslighting and bullying disguised as a good thing. If I see anything anti-white from you, I will be extremely turned off. 

I'll add more when I think of more. :3",08Feb2020,1
64,"So basically my dad kicked me out of the house and for the past 2-3 months I’ve been living with my mom. I thought this would be a good change of scenery but boy was I wrong. Long story short, my mother is diagnosed Bipolar 1 &amp; 2 and me being here, I think, put her in a manic state. She was just waaaaay to happy and it seems like for people with bipolar disorder, having too much of one emotion is a bad thing. I’ve been trying to keep her level and in control of her emotions but it only makes the situation worse. Recently I’ve had to pick her up from jail, watch her bring meth addicts into the house (which I have to clean up), go through her killing BOTH of the pets she bought me (a tortoise and a chameleon, mostly through neglect, nothing completely psychotic), and finally take here to the police station for abusing crystal meth among other things. All of this has proven to be quite a bit to handle and I’ve been coping with alcohol and marijuana. And might I add, I have a crazy tolerance now. Just yesterday I went through 2 whole blunts and maybe 10-12 bong hits throughout the day. This is on top of an entire liter bottle of Jack Daniels gone in the past 3 days. Well in my drunken and high stupor I recorded a video journal and uploaded it. Other than watching it in iMovie for less than 30 seconds in order to splice two video files together, I haven’t watched it. I might leave the post up but I don’t think anyone will watch it.",08Feb2020,1
65,"I’m from the American south. I grew up in a very conservative evangelical family with six children. My parents are big supporters of the Republican Party. I’m now a self-sufficient adult, but I’m visiting home right now, and I’m realizing we’re not very similar at all, and I’m really sad about it.

I don’t hate them. My parents genuinely love me and care about me. However, I’ve been slowly learning more over the past ten years or so and expanding my worldview, and I assumed they were doing the same, but I’m not so sure anymore.

I found out they want to put prayer in schools and reverse Obergefell vs Hodges. To be honest, I am shocked. I thought surely they were liberal enough to believe in a separation of church and state. Apparently they also believe the world is only 6000 years old and that evolution is a modernist conspiracy.

My dad started talking about Trump, and he was overwhelmingly positive. I kept my mouth shut, but then he called Romney a spineless “unprincipled” coward for voting for voting for impeachment, and I spoke up and said that standing for your beliefs and not your party is the opposite of spineless, and he got angry. They have absolutely no idea what I believe. I think they think I vote Republican.

They found out I’m not especially religious, and now they won’t stop asking me if I’m attending church, if I’m “saved,” etc. But it seems to me that they’re wrong about pretty much everything, so religion is likely not an exception.

I’m not angry, I’m just sad. I thought they were better than this.",08Feb2020,1
67,"I realize that I need to change who I am.

Yesterday, I got the closest I have ever been to killing myself. I decided that it wasn't worth it, though. 

I don't have any friends. I don't have a girlfriend. I see a therapist, however, I avoid telling him the bad things that are actually happening in my life. I just sort of talk to him casually. I touch on the bad stuff, like my self-harm problem. But, I try and move on as quickly as possible. You might see this as a waste of time. However, its the only time where anyone will talk to me for 45 minutes without interruption. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate the person I am. I just want to live out the rest of my life as a scripted character. Hopefully, one that people will like.

On a positive note, I am doing well in school. I have a 4.0 GPA and I am in college. I am addicted to doing homework. If I am not working on homework, I inevitably become depressed. It seems to be the only thing that can captivate my mind long enough to distract me.",08Feb2020,1

69,"Rant ahead, I just need to get it off my chest. It's going to be all over the place and I'm sorry. 

I needed a break from my job for a few days as Christmas and New year are always exhausting emotionally and mentally for me, and ever since I started working in a big 4-star hotel is even worse. So I took off for a week. Went to a different country to see a friend I haven't met in person in almost a year.

She's my best friend. My better half. I've been in love with her for a decade now and the feelings never really wavered even though for the last five years I've been living thousands of miles away and we've barely seen each other. We talk every day about anything and everything still.

The whole week has been basically perfect. It reminded me of why I fell for her in the first place. Everything felt as if the last time we met was just some days ago. We just naturally clicked the same way as usual. We've both been attracted to each other for a long time but never acted on it. We didn't this time either but it didn't matter. It wasn't necessary.

And now I've just left her at work and headed for the airport even if there's still four hours left until my flight leaves because I can't stand the city on my own without knowing when I'm going to be able to see her again. I'm sitting in a BK, crying my eyes off while my chest feels like it exploded in millions of microscopical pieces. Knowing that I have to go back to a job that I only half like and that's breaking me mentally, to a place where I live alone, with close to no friends, and virtually no-one to rely on but myself.

I'm usually good at keeping my mask on, tricking the world and myself into believing I'm fine, but right now it's so f*cking hard not to break down. I've never resented myself and my decision to carve a somewhat decent life for myself (which I still wouldn't be able to do here in her country and I'm perfectly aware of it) more than right now. And I don't want to tell her how much it goddamn hurts because she knows and it's enough that one of us can't stop crying.


So yeah, I've just given myself a week of heaven and I don't know how I'm going to settle myself back into a mind numbing routine while keeping a lid on my wrecked emotions.

72,"MBA in business, (self-made) very financially independent, In my 30s, Iq 128. Not anti-social, -I have no need to hurt anyone,  but narcs/sociopaths trying to trick me and asking for it, will get seriously emotionally backstabbed.

Male (herd) animals and humans unconsciously immediately get danger warning of a predator by me, often at a distance. It's in my eyes and general behavior, -I do not have much control of it (predatory fearless dominance  traits). 

Once I had two dogs being walked starting barking on 50m distance, one fleeing it's owner and getting close up ready to attack me. I calmly looked him deep in the eyes, and that was enough. Because of this I consciously many times force myself to look down to avoid eye contact. Most people in today's society though, have lost more or less the connection with their true self and do not pick up the warning signs. But animals do, -cats have the same calm predatory gesture and stare, that is why dogs become uncomfortable around them.

I like science in general. Especially social anthropology, evolutionary biology and philosophy of mind, as well as behaviorual psycholog and psychiatry (obviously).

I do not get lonely, but just realizing you belong to the 2% of the population makes you at least feel not quite belonging in the pack I guess. This troubles me somewhat, and I guess that is why I am writing this post. Feeding one's ego though as most of human's social interactions is really about, I literally really have no interest, or need for.

73,"I still haven't figured out exactly how I feel about it, but I haven't been able to talk to anyone about it, for obvious reasons. Hopefully sharing this with y'all will bring me some peace. I'm using a throwaway account. TLDR at the bottom. Here's the story:

I (21M) recently reconnected with my cousin (18F) and we've gotten along really well. We've been hanging out pretty often for the past few months and I enjoy spending time with her. No matter what we do, we always have a great time and I feel like I can talk to her about everything. She's a very joyous person and I just feel so happy and comfortable when I'm around her. She's also very attractive, but even though I've been aware of that for months, I never thought about making a move on her.

Earlier this week we went out for drinks (just the two of us). Lots of drinks. We were having a blast but we were also quite drunk after leaving the last bar, so after walking around for a bit we decided to sit down on a bench. Long story short, we ended up making out for like an hour in different spots cause we kept stopping on our way home. I still don't know what got to me, but we did a whole lot more than just kissing (no sex though).

We went out for dinner with some friends afterwards and just played it cool and had a good time. We went home a couple hours later. Nothing crazy happened then, I just dropped her off at home and went back to my place. I was still a bit drunk when I got home, so I locked myself in my room and started thinking about everything that happened. The craziest part is that I wasn't feeling guilty at ALL cause I really enjoyed it (and no, I'm not from Alabama). I googled ""I made out with my cousin"" and felt a bit relieved when I noticed that a LOT of people have posted similar stories on Reddit/Quora/etc. Not saying that it justified what I did, but at least I wasn't the only one.

Long story short, I went out with her yesterday and we ended up hooking up again. We talked about what we did and agreed not to tell a single soul but I asked her if I could post it on Reddit, so here I am. I know what we did was wrong, but then why did it feel so right? I feel like it's a known fact that kissing someone you're related to feels super weird, but I didn't feel that way at all with her. I felt like I was kissing someone that I'd just met and I really don't regret it.

I'm not entirely sure of what I'm trying to get out of posting this, but please don't be too hard on me and let me know if you've experienced something similar.

TLDR: My cousin, who I never interacted with until recently,  and I hooked up after getting drunk. We did it again while sober. I don't regret it and I even liked it.",08Feb2020,1

78,"I don’t want consolation. I just need to vent. 

I come from a good family. We love each other. We are not sophisticated. We go to a fancy show once a year as an extended family. I love the occasion and the mutual love. I hate how sophisticated we are pretending to be. 

We’re smart. One of my parents went to university. I’m a medical student. My sister is an engineering student. One of my brothers has a high profile job. But my youngest brother is the one who I am jealous of. He’s creative and interesting and definitely on the spectrum. His brain works in different ways. He’s unique. I know he’s unfulfilled at the moment he’s so consistently interesting and surprising. I am predictable and unoriginal.

And yet, I love that I am a medical student. I like the stereotypes that come along with it. It feeds my insecurity. I remember being younger and idolising those medical students i met. But they’re fucking human. Sure they tend to be nice and caring. But I swear most of us are built from an identi-kit. Privileged. Middle class. Undergone no hardship. High achieving. Sporty. Arrogant. Had everything handed to us on plates.

All of that makes them(/me) very boring. Everything is so superficial. How are you supposed to connect with someone if you’ve never felt pain. What is there to be vulnerable about when everything about you is supposedly perfect and all so similar to everyone else. 

I’m so conscious that everything I do is to project an image for other people to see. I record my runs so people can see on strava that i’m active. I put up a story at a houseparty so people know I have good friends. I’m rather down so i’ll put up a story showing me having a good time. Even when i run I speed up if i see people coming the other way. Knowing fully that they are not paying attention to 1) who I am 2) how fast i’m running 

I have this visceral compulsion for people to think highly of me when actually they don’t think about me at all. And secondly, I’m entirely fucking average. 

At the moment I have very little self control. I watch a lot of porn (when i can be bothered) or netflix. I do this knowing I’d enjoy reading more. But that’s too much effort. I even signed a pledge so i would run 5 times a week. If i don’t, I donate money to a pro-life charity (scumbags). The real reason I did this was to appear edgy. Not to make me run. Everything I do is so i can tell someone about it. I’m so painfully insecure.

And yet I’ve taken great measure to appear the opposite. I know lots of people think I am the opposite of insecure.

I can’t help thinking what a fucking waste of space I am. I do hardly any work. My friends are some of the nerdiest/hard-working people I know. And yet I only do marginally worse than they do. I waste unacceptable amount of time feeling sorry for myself or playing chess puzzles (oooh edgy). I can’t help thinking how unstoppable I would be if i actually applied myself.

The catalyst for all of this was I got dumped a month ago tomorrow. I was literally falling in love with this girl. She was (seriously) intelligent, witty, sophisticated, charming, beautiful. She has this incredible work ethic, and knew how to take what she wanted. She was so open and confident sexually. Really fucking empowered. She was everything I was attracted to. Everything. 

I’d been having a rough couple of months. Working on a project and crumbling under the stress. I wasn’t depressed, but I also wasn’t my normal self. I took her to meet my family and some friends from home. I thought things were going great. Then 1 week later, she ends everything. Seemingly out of nowhere - though i’m sure there must have been signs. We’ve not spoken since.

I’m still absolutely heartbroken. But i can’t help but be amused at the irony. We were on and off for 8 months or so. Before that she had been in this relationship and been dumped. She had baggage and admitted this from the beginning. It started off as fwb and progressed to something more serious. 

I know that i didn’t understand her emotionally. She was so tormented and I struggled to empathise (‘privileged, undergone no hardship etc’). Looking back it’s clear that I could never fulfil her. And yet by her ending things I know exactly what she’s been through. The pain. The longing. The being harsh to yourself and learning to be kinder. The wanting to work on yourself. Wanting to be over someone even though you still crave them. And knowing that you would turn down their advances to protect yourself, but there is no one you want more. I think about her constantly. And I know that she doesn’t feel the same about me. It hurts so much. 

I want her more than anything. But i think for the moment, just being sad about things is an acceptable alternative.",08Feb2020,1

80,"I don’t want consolation. I just need to vent.

I come from a good family. We love each other. We are not sophisticated. We go to a fancy show once a year as an extended family. I love the occasion and the mutual love. I hate how sophisticated we are pretending to be.

We’re smart. One of my parents went to university. I’m a medical student. My sister is an engineering student. One of my brothers has a high profile job. But my youngest brother is the one who I am jealous of. He’s creative and interesting and definitely on the spectrum. His brain works in different ways. He’s unique. I know he’s unfulfilled at the moment he’s so consistently interesting and surprising. I am predictable and unoriginal.

And yet, I love that I am a medical student. I like the stereotypes that come along with it. It feeds my insecurity. I remember being younger and idolising those medical students i met. But they’re fucking human. Sure they tend to be nice and caring. But I swear most of us are built from an identi-kit. Privileged. Middle class. Undergone no hardship. High achieving. Sporty. Arrogant. Had everything handed to us on plates.

All of that makes them(/me) very boring. Everything is so superficial. How are you supposed to connect with someone if you’ve never felt pain. What is there to be vulnerable about when everything about you is supposedly perfect and all so similar to everyone else.

I’m so conscious that everything I do is to project an image for other people to see. I record my runs so people can see on strava that i’m active. I put up a story at a houseparty so people know I have good friends. I’m rather down so i’ll put up a story showing me having a good time. Even when i run I speed up if i see people coming the other way. Knowing fully that they are not paying attention to 1) who I am 2) how fast i’m running

I have this visceral compulsion for people to think highly of me when actually they don’t think about me at all. And secondly, I’m entirely fucking average.

At the moment I have very little self control. I watch a lot of porn (when i can be bothered) or netflix. I do this knowing I’d enjoy reading more. But that’s too much effort. I even signed a pledge so i would run 5 times a week. If i don’t, I donate money to a pro-life charity (scumbags). The real reason I did this was to appear edgy. Not to make me run. Everything I do is so i can tell someone about it. I’m so painfully insecure.

As in I am you and you are me and everything that has ever lived is just one single actual being, split into an infinite number of beings experiencing life simultaneously. Through out history and in the future but all at the same time because time only exists for purposes of human perception. 

Leaving the egg is impossible, until every life that could possibly exist is lived and ceases to exist at which point we are “born” into our true celestial selves.

So looking at the history of just this planet and everything that has ever happened on it (like not even gonna try and touch on the future here) and going by the above idea that everything and everyone on the planet and in our universe is actually just one single entity?

It has occurred to me that I am one serious giant gaping universal asshole. So are all of you. Because according to the above? We are each-other and all of us together makes one single entity. 

I don’t want to be a giant gaping universal asshole and you know what? Since considering the egg story and its effect thinking? I’m not so sure I’m against mandatory population control and eugenics anymore.

86,"I am a freshman in college right now, and I have felt lost and empty for years now searching- hoping- for something to actually happen where all of the pieces of me will finally come together and I will feel whole.

At first I just thought ""maybe I'm bisexual/queer"" and although I am not excluding the possibility of that being a part of me, I realize now that my sexuality will not be what makes me feel whole. Knowing who I am and what I want, speaking for what I want, and being true to myself. I came to this realization where I broke one of my most constant ideologies and things I held close to me and high: my moral code. I have always been someone who has felt like how they act is the objectively best or right thing to do; what I would do is the best thing for the situation, and that what I want usually does not factor into this, so I remain okay with that outcome. I created a situation where I made morally grey/cloudy decisions, and did not realize how wrong I was to be living off of technicalities in what I say in response to what others want from me. I wont go into details just because it sounds childish to write it out, and yet I feel like absolute shit for acting how I have. 

I have realized I need to develop a backbone, that sometimes it is okay to actually take what I want, no matter if it isn't the best thing to do. Without doing what I actually want to do while also attempting to be the best person I can, I have led myself into relationships where I hurt others, as I leave abruptly when I realize that I am only doing this because they wanted to. I hate saying this but I feel like I need to be a more selfish person so that I can stop being a dick and hurting others that I do truly care about. 

I am sorry if this is confusing to those that read it. I, myself, have no idea what I am but I hope that going through this and attempting to find what I want in the world will lead me to actually having more stability and possibly fill this emptiness I have created for myself. I really just want to be the best person I can be and from looking at what I have done previously I don't know how I can look at myself and not just say ""you're a piece of shit."" and I absolutely hate that I can do that. If anyone has advice for how to possibly fix this I would love that; I need help and I know that, I just have no clue where to start and I would love any answers. Thank you.",08Feb2020,1
87,"I'm 32 years old today. Nobody noticed, that's not what matters anyway.

What matters is that it has been like this for 32 years. I never had a friend, I never had a partner, I never had someone I could talk to, confide into, build a more meaningfull relation with. My parents were the only ones that I talked a bit with, and I mostly spared them my problems. They are dead now, I'm happy they didn't have to see how empty inside I am.

Why do I get up in the morning to go to work? why did I study and get two college degrees for so long? Why do I do sport to keep fit? Why do I travel? Why do I write?

For no reason at all. I'm a social being, as much as I would like to be the exact opposite, I see value in the things I do with someone else. I like feeling like I belong in a group. I listen to podcasts and group talks just to quiet the absurd silence of my flat and delude myself into thinking I'm not that alone.

I saw a hidden waterfall in a backyard country and felt like I should take joy in my find. It feels empty when there's no one to share your hapiness with. 

I wish I could say there's always tomorrow. But why would I kid myself? I shook up my wardrobe, my hairstyle, went to therapy, went to hobby groups I liked, went to local events, went online dating and whatnot. It's simply really, if you manage to make yourself interesting, people will follow. It's really all there is. I know I'm boring, took me three decades to learn it, but why do I have to be so disposable when I feel such a need for the most basic social life?

I've done a few things in that time, two degrees, an interesting job, read some good books, saw some cool movies, saw some unexpected countries. But I haven't lived. I see people and I see them feeling alive, having done things they can remember with a smile. I remember the emptiness of what I've done.

I need to feel loved but no one cares about me. If you need to feel loved but others don't care about you, it isn't. The only moment I forget that is when I get drunk, and it feels good.",08Feb2020,1

I gave you that . You know that outcome , which is why i made sure i dealt with it . I made sure i let you go before i put myself back there! Why? Because i knew you would come running back, tail between your legs. I knew as soon as you got wind of another male around me it would change everything you felt. I know as i had to put up with that from you. Watching you with someone else , yet telling me you still wanted to see me and sleep with me . I tried to tell you how bad that made mr feel. But still you think i should have been able to cope with that. Now i ask you . Can you cope with it ? Seeing me with someone new ? I told you your time would come to feel that and you didn't listen.

90,"I just got out of a very toxic relationship where my ex and I would break up once every month and then get back together a few days later. That went on for about 10 months. 

Part of the things that were happening was my ex was cheated on in her past and she had a lot of trust issues and insecurities and she would question everything I would do. She was questioning the very things that she said made her fall for me. Well I eventually stopped doing those things because I thought they were upsetting her even tho it meant I was losing myself in the process. 

Once I lost myself I found myself getting very angry and reacting in a very negative way every time I was getting questioned because I know I wasn’t doing anything to break her trust but she never believed me or listened to what I had to say. I knew it was going to be hard to help her and I knew going in I had to be patient with her and understanding but I lost all sense of self respect and self love for myself because of my reactions and episodes that I had. Everytime I look back on them I find myself cringing at the thought of them and I can’t look past them. 

But now that the relationship is over I am still struggling with how I handled certain things and I am finding myself going to places like Tinder, Facebook, and other social media’s to find love from other people but that is leaving me feeling even worse about myself. I want to get to a point where I feel like myself again and feel happy being by myself and loving myself but I honestly just don’t know where to start or how to even go about doing that.

93,"kWh is a unit of energy. A non-standard one only used by utility companies, and people who don't know any better. Energies on the scale that we'd use kWh are usually measured in J (Joules). Other units like the electron volt are used on smaller scales, that is a specific use case though.

This unit nonsense leads to confusion about basic electrical concepts among some.

You are charged based on how much energy you used on your electric bill, and what time of day you used that energy. You may even have a certain amount of energy to use that's cheaper, then when you use it up they charge you more. There are different schemes for different companies, but you're always charged based on your actual energy consumption, at least in part.

The average monthly energy consumption of a home is 900 kWh. For arguments sake let's not consider the different prices during different times of day.

First let's change kWh into something not obnoxious.

W = J/s

kWh = k * J/s * h = k * J/s * 3600 s = 3.6 MJ

Cancelled seconds with seconds!

M = Mega = 1,000,000

Total energy used by the average home in Joules.

3.6 MJ * 900 = 3240 MJ

For simplicities sake let's say a kWh of energy is 10 cents. They usually divide this up into multiple different charges on your bill, and they may also include a flat fee. Anything to make it confusing.

$.1000 / (3.6 MJ) = $0.02777777777 / MJ .1000 = 10 cents, 4 decimal precision for cost of electricity.

bill = $0.02777777777 / MJ * 3240 MJ = $90.00

(Round to two decimals on your bill obviously, need to keep the precision of 0.02777777777 and round after.)

They say they use kWh so it's readable on a bill, and people are familiar with W (Watts) from ligtbulbs. Obviously that's why k is there, but why include Watt hours? It serves no purpose to have units that cancel out and not do the cancelling.

I think 3240 MJ is perfectly readable.

This obfuscation of a basic unit leads to people thinking incorrect things like they're buying power every month, and not paying for their own energy consumption. It's insane how vital delivering energy from a &gt;&gt; b is, and the bill shouldn't be hard to read. Let's start with normal units. Watt hours is wrong.",08Feb2020,1

Hi everyone,

I’ve always had an issue with this, and lately it’s gotten worse. Anything I ever do I NEED someone to tell me it’s good. I can’t just be happy with whatever it is. Play piano? Does the music sound good. Paint figurines? Does it look how you’d want it? Does it look okay? Implemented XYZ, does it help? Is it useful? And before I needed that “yes it looks great” or “yes that’s helpful!” But lately it’s felt empty. I know that’s a bad habit because I won’t ever be happy with anything I ever do (and I don’t mean completely, IIRC none of us truly are, but for me it’s especially bad.) Is there any advice or stories you guys can tell to try to help me stop with this behavior? Or what I can do to help myself for once?

Thank you.",08Feb2020,1
96,"I'm really not sure whether it's gonna be casual enough to read but why not ( sorry for my English, if I make loads of grammatical errors)

My name is Felix Alling, I'm from Denmark I'm 21, I spent 6 months in 2017 with my dad's very close friend in Dublin after a few mental health problems following up after my mother passed away.

Anyways I decided to take a gap year since i really wasn't sure about what I wanted to do so I ended up taking a flight to Dublin where I met my dad's friend who I'll call 'Derek' from now on. So Derek was a really nice person, he had a wife but no kids, and for the first few months I just worked at a Lidl ( a job which Derek helped me get) and did various household chores for him and his wife since that was the least I could do. After about 2 months Derek suggested that I should probably start travelling around Ireland and so with the amount of money I had earned from my job at Lidl, I decided to start my tour. (Derek's wife even gave me her car to travel!)

So I decided to start my tour in a county called meath. So for my first day I went to see the newgrange, which was basically a prehistoric monument, older than the Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids. Anyways, since hotels would turn out to be expensive, I found a cheap bed and a breakfast run by a woman, who I'll call 'Cara'. I'd talked to Cara on the phone before but I'd never met her. So it's around 6:30 pm in November and it's pretty dark, it's also really foggy in Meath. I type her postcode on my GPS and start the drive, I drive for about 2 hours on a road which is completely empty with no houses or buildings, and all I can see is fog in front of me with a few occasional cars which would zip past me. Finally after about 2 hours and 10 minutes, my GPS says my destination is coming up on the right and then I realize I've basically booked a really cheap bed and breakfast in the middle of nowhere and I'm probably headed for trouble. Accurately enough her house is on the right and so after a 2 and a half hour foggy drive, I park my car. 

I ring the bell and no one answers the door, even though the lights are switched on. So I call her up and she doesn't pick up the phone and that's when I start getting panicky. So I find an alternate number of hers and a man picks it up. He is apparently Cara's husband and is returning from Dublin. I wait for about half an hour and he finally pulls up in his Nissan. Now, Cara's husband was old, old enough to be my grandfather, he opens the house with his keys, we enter to find Cara sleeping in front of the TV and yes she was also old enough to be grandmother, even her house smelt like something was baking. She woke up and believe me she was the sweetest lady in the entire world.(she was baking fresh bread for my breakfast!) I was sleeping in her son's bedroom and let's just say the next morning was the most awkward one of my life.

Quitting harmful substances such as tobacco and cocaine.

Generally getting out of my comfort zone socially.

There's one last thing to try and, like having sex, going to work after long unemployment, eating well and working on my body, quitting harmful addictions and taking special Medications - - like all these things it will probably feel nice for a little bit.

But all in all the only difference between now and when I was homeless is I cry less.

I haven't tried therapy but I'm a diagnosed psychotic schizophrenic so I'm sure I'm a psychiatrists worse nightmare and also unfixable, there is no cure for psychosis or, being mental.

So therapy is literally pointless.

Im getting desperate, I'm running out of options. After I try this last thing which will take around 3 months to see if it works I have one last option, it is death.

Naturally someone with illnesses like mine believes strange things and sometimes I feel as if I kill myself in this world I'll wake up.. Somewhere better. Anywhere would be better.

Im sick of voices I don't like. Sick of paranoia and anxiety I'm sick of psychosis.
