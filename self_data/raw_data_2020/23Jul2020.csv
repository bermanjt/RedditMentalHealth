0,"TLDR: No tolerance to caffeine is amazing and you should try it out too if you have a habit.

I had a habit of drinking 5-10 cups a day for over 10 years. The usual routine: 2 cups before Uni/work and then one every hour or so until I got home. 

I didn’t really notice any effects from it beside the usual not feeling groggy anymore in the morning and no faint headaches after the first cup. If I drank in the evening I would still be tired but restless in the night which led to me laying awake for hours before falling asleep.

Due to the current situation and being in Homeoffice over the last couple months I forgot all about my usual routines including drinking coffee. Probably because I didn’t have to be in the office at 8am anymore and the first daily zoom meeting was scheduled for 10:30 and I set my alarm to 10:25.

Anyway I had to finish up a project the other day which turned out to take probably take me the whole night so I drank a couple cups of way weaker coffee than I usually had. 

I hadn’t felt this awake in a long time! Besides the usual restlessness my mind was also as awake as if I had just woken up and the combination made me euphoric about finishing up the project. I could also have a normal next day by keeping on until about 2pm before stopping. 

I am typing this now on the day after to remind myself how great no tolerance to caffeine is so I hopefully don’t develop a habit again in the future and keep my tolerance low for when it’s needed. 

Oh and what I also noticed now is that the last month of no coffee got rid of any groggyness/headaches in the morning, be it with or without setting an alarm.",23Jul2020,2

2,"I keep seeing that phrase pretty much for every situation in which a certain group is to blame for an issue and imo using that as a counter argument is so lazy and weak... It's obvious! That's what generalisations and stereotypes are! You observe a bunch of people, you notice similarities in their behaviour for example, and you categorise them. It's not a bad thing, it's a logical thing! 

I get it, it can be offensive to be told you belong to a group that you don't relate to. But if you ""are not like the rest of them"", then no one is talking about you! It goes without saying that if someone says ""I hate politicians, they are all corrupt"" and you're a politician who is NOT corrupt, then that message is clearly not intended for you!! It is obvious that the person who says that does not actually believe that 100% of politicians are corrupt. That person could even think that 99.999% of politicians are corrupt, and still that message would not be for you because you could potentially be that 00.001% that's not corrupt...

15,"Over the past year and a half I've been on a self-improvement journey that has ushered in the happiest time of my life. For the first time, I alone am capable of making myself happy.

Almost 2 years ago I left a woman I was madly in love with because I knew I was not the man she deserved at the time and I knew I was incomplete. I knew if I stayed I'd resent her and continue to hate myself. I left. I moved to a beautiful new city and started a new life. I reached a level of my career I thought I wouldnt get to unitl I was well into my 40's (I'm 28). I'm in the best shape of my life and have the closest friends I've ever had.

I've been single since and as my feet finally met the ground I couldn't help but think of her. Wondering if she's okay and what would it be like if she met the man I was today. Memories of her torutred me and I realized I wanted to try and reconnect. I told myself ""you're at a spot that whatever the answer you'll be just fine"".

So I reached out. She didn't reply to me directly but proceeded to talk to my friend and patornize my effort to reconnect. In that moment her bubble popped. She fell from the pedestal I put her on and I snapped back to reality. I feel relieved and I finally have closure. Now all my ghosts are free and I'm ready to open myself to the future and the unknown.

I'm ready for a new love and I can't wait till she arrives.

Till then I'll just kick my feet up and enjoy the view.",23Jul2020,87

18,"I don’t want to keep you here for too long, and I don’t want to run the risk of being recognized by friends, hence the throwaway and the lack of details. 
During this quarantine, I have moved in with a family member and almost completely cut off my insane mother. She has threatened to kill me and my siblings, drove drunk, cheated on my stepdad with me in the next room over (the doors weren’t even closed for fucks sake), forced one of my siblings to eat an edible and ended up triggering a Grand Mal seizure in that sibling, during which she hit her head (if you know anything about seizures, head injuries require emergency rooms immediately) all while lying to me and other family members about taking her to the hospital, and that has all happened only in the last year. Being in a calm and stable environment has given me the mental clarity to remember some repressed memories.
When I was little, around 6 or 7, I had a very serious disease impact me. I was in the ICU for a week, almost put on a ventilator, and would have died if I had been taken to the hospital one minute later. I remember my mother telling me that my inability to walk was just so I could get out of chores. Talked to my older sibling about this, and they confirmed that on that day, I was crying because I had been hit by my mother for this reason.
When I was 11-12, my mothers then boyfriend carried me to bed and fingered me while I slept. I didn’t even know what puberty was, but when it happened I knew it was wrong. I told my mother and her response was “he was drunk, that was meant for me”. Thinking on it now, I don’t know how she couldn’t see it. For months leading up to it, her boyfriend would pin me down and “tickle” (read: fondle) me in the floor of our living room. He would tug at my clothes when he did this. He took me to my bed and slept with me for days leading up to it. I only know what happened because I happened to wake up during it. What excuse could she give for a thirty something year old dude spooning a child alone? 

It’s insane to me that she’s been this way my entire life. Part of me is glad because now I know it isn’t my fault, but I wonder how different I would have been if I had a parent who actually gave a shit about me. 

Anyone have any experience with something similar?",23Jul2020,4
19,"I lost my dad 5 years ago to cancer. Then, I was 14, and naive. I didn’t understand the gravity of it until he was gone. Tonight Mom told me she has cancer. 

I was very close with my father, but me and Mom had our problems. Mostly with the shitty way she raised me. I don’t always speak so highly of mom. She was a horrible mother when I was a child, but she has made such a valiant effort to correct in the last 5 years. I moved out from home, last year, and our relationship is much improved.

All I know is that it’s cancer. It’s in her jaw. Surgery may leave her disfigured. That’s it. That, and we don’t know the source yet. I don’t believe mom will make it. 

I keep spinning through my head how I’m going to be the one who has to care for her, why I’m the best option of all my siblings (older and younger ones). I keep thinking about her cat, who’s going to take care of him when moms gone? What if she dies before my sister graduates high school? 

My poor poor baby sister, only seventeen, what if she doesn’t get either parent at her high school graduation? I was always so bothered I JUST had my mom, my shitty mom. 

The tattoo mom had been trying to get me to get with her, for almost a year now...I pushed off originally because I’ve been ‘busy’, then COVID happened and it shut down, now she has cancer and will have to do chemo and radiation. We can’t get that tattoo, can we?

23,"So, long story short, I book a time for haircut because my hair was long (yes I am a guy) and as I arrived for the first time, the hairdresser seemed cool and nice and I told her I needed a a cut that is shorter and showed her couple of pictures, one of them was hair from younger David Beckham.

As she went on with cutting my hair, in the middle of it, she comments something in lines of this: ""I don't think you should expect that I can give you the exact hairstyle you showed me, but I will try, and sadly not everyone is as Godly looking as David Beckham is, so people often have false expectations""

As soon as she finished the last part, I died inside. I smiled and confirmed what she said, but inside I was devastated. I never claimed I was as good looking as young David Beckham, nor did I comment on his face or looks, I just showed her the hairstyle I wanted.

Anyway... I am at home now and this has been haunting me since, did she mean I am ugly or what was she implying? I don't get it that people can be such cruel creatures especially women, and no I am not a sexist or anything, but Ive seen and heard similar stories where women imply so much negative and rude stuff without seeming to care to hurt the other person.

The realtor said that the owner , a man in his mid 40s.   Had to leave to Portugal last week.. like STAT.   He basically just randomly called around and the first realtor  that could meet on short notice would get his business.

The realtor told me that the guy met him at 2pm , then was on the plane to Portugal at 6pm.

He said the guy was in a big hurry.  He left his computers, his tv , electronics... clothes in the dryer.  Food in a pan on the range.     And it was up to the realtor to get rid of it all, then stage and sell the house.   (Realtor estimated it would go for 1.1 - 1.2 mm$)

Since i got home with my new ladder and shelves, ive been really wondering what could be so urgent... that someone just up and leave clothes in the dryer.    I googled... and i did discover one possible reason... theres these programs called Golden Visas... maybe the guy bought some property in portugal and had to be there within 24 hours to take ownership or lose his investment/and citzenship.     Or... maybe he was a criminal , but why have a paper trail then??

Or maybe something tragic happend...but even if your whole family died... that could explain the clothes in the dryer...but why would you have to call around and find any ol realtor to sell your house?",23Jul2020,1
42,"*scroll down for TL;DR* 

RANT: I feel like I should live for myself and just enjoy my life, but I can’t help but feel rushed. I feel like I need to be constantly building my skills, and it makes me so anxious. After school ended and quarantine started, I’ve been finding myself letting go. I barely did anything “productive” from the months of May to basically now. I’ve been trynna pick up new hobbies because I found them interesting like coding, digital art, and messing with circuit boards. But it’s not something I do EVERYDAY if that makes sense? Some days are just so tiring, and I feel unmotivated. Those days are the days I regret the most. ***I somehow end up turning these fun things I try into “I HAVE to succeed in these hobbies, so I can reach success and make my parents happy.”*** I really, really wish I could rewire my brain into thinking they are fun little things I do just like watching movies and shows instead of work. I know I would enjoy them! I just wish I didn’t feel like a timer is ticking, and I was running out of time to explore things. All I can think about is how my parents made sacrifices to please their family (I won’t go into details, but I basically feel like they are faking being happy when they hate their marriage and their work hours). Sometimes I feel like it’s my fault. I’ve caught my mom trying to kill her self when I was like 6, and my dad asked if I wanted to kill myself with him when I was in middle/high during one of their fights. They seem like a happy couple right now, but I don’t trust it. There’s more, but you get the gist of what’s going on with my family and why I feel like I have to make up for their sadness by doing everything in my life for them. To become successful. It actually ***SUCKS***. Another thing is that my parents wanted me in the med field, and I’ve recently told them I never really had interest in that. I’m more interested in things like math, engineering, computer science... This made me feel like I HAVE to be successful, or I feel like they’ll think I did everything for nothing. 

TL;DR: I feel like my parents are unhappy with their life, and I feel like I have to make up for their unhappiness by doing everything “right” to be successful in life for them. It sucks to think like this, and I wish I could stop beating myself up for not doing anything productive these last couple of months. Every time I try a new hobby, my brain somehow turns it into a job that I’m obliged to complete in order to convince myself that I’m enough to make my parents happy in the future.",23Jul2020,1

I just graduated and I’m going off to college next month. While I believe I’m going to a good school, fairly small and private, I’m still scared of some of the people I might meet. The school is majority white at 82%, the second majority race being black at only 8%. I’m asian, and scared I might face targeted hate without much support.

Hes having negative symptoms seriously enough hes about to go back to the hospital for a blood draw and potentially be re admitted but I probably cant risk staying with him again since I've had contact with the public today. I feel so shitty that hes going through this at all and that I cant do anything real to help. Hes so young to have stage 2 cancer even though ""its be best cancer to have"". That's such a fucked up thing for anyone to say and I'm so sick if hearing it. All of his diagnoses have been the worst case scenario. First that the cyst was even cancerous to begin with then it had spread to at least some lymph nodes so the entire organ and surrounding fatty tissue had to be removed instead of just one half. It's so hard to not have negative thoughts and stay positive for him. I'm so worried I feel sick now

I'm writing this just to be able to get it out. Hes a private person and didnt make any sort of announcement or really tell anyone outside of his family. It's not my news to share so I literally haven't told or talk to anyone about it, I've just been carrying it and trying hard as fuck to be positive for him because his super power is over thinking and anxiety and his mom is even worse. So i have to be the positive not anxious not openly worried one but I'm so sad and so scared for him and that it's just going to keep being the worst case scenarios. Hes such an amazing man with a genuinely real good heart he doesn't deserve any of this but cancer doesn't give a fuck what kind of person you are. Honestly I wish I could take it away. Out of the 2 of us im the terrible person and I'd deserve it for the person i used to be. I would take this from him in a heart beat without a second thought but I cant.

55,"What's  up, J.

You meet P when you're 25 and she tells you to write a letter to your younger self as an exercise in learning to be compassionate and less full-of-hatred toward yourself. What follows is said letter.

You always wanted to know what happens to you when you're older. Then, it was in order to gauge whether or not it was worth continuing, but seeing as how you ended up surviving the things that have happened, I guess there's no risk in telling everything to you straight. I don't think it's accurate to say that things get worse: ""worse"" is relative. More things might happen, perhaps more objectively difficult events or problems, but maybe you have more words or outlets to process them. Not declaring anything either way, just giving you food for thought. I'll say that things remain challenging for you, but they're just different. I have no other sustained, positive outcomes to compare my experience thus far to, so, it seems as though that's kind of the way life rolls. You're also still severely clinically depressed at the time this letter is being written, so who knows what's really the untainted truth.

Rob dies. Yeah, at 26. It's fucking crazy, dude. You're guessing it's an overdose based on public record, which is literally the last conclusion you'd ever come to, but it could make sense. He was isolated from his family and in the deep south grinding through his Master's. Brittany dies, too. Overdose, but that's less shocking. Still, it's something you need to process because... well, that could've been you. Alzheimer's inevitably takes Grammy. Dude, Uncle Brian fucking kills himself. Dad and L break up, they get married months later and he moves to Hawaii to be with her. He can't ever find the same work, they divorce mere months later, and he moves to Fargo. A short couple years later he marries for the third time after moving to Tallahassee and you only find out, again, through public record. You do this because you no longer exist to him after discovering your half-brother he feigned ignorance about through a DNA test. Ironically enough, AJ and you are talking again, lol. For the most part, through... a lot... of help, you forgive him and bond over this insane family drama. 

Mom's still in the cult. You move across the country to a big city because of your boyfriend, but you end up loving it more than back home. No, really, it's true. Being out here quickly made you realize how toxic the south was in literally every facet from environmental policies to racism and religion. You took some time off from college as a result but you finish undergrad here. You don't become a doctor, and in all ways you're better off, but you don't know what the fuck you want to be, nor what you're doing, and that's really taking its toll on you in a... very destructive way. You're in a long-term relationship built on growing up together, solving the same problems during critical years of your life, and learning from each other, but the path hasn't been nor currently is without stark problems. Some have torn you up slowly over time, while others end up striking you far more acutely. The future is uncertain but you end up embracing this because for the first time in your life, you learn that you can't neglect yourself just because everyone else has forgotten about you; you need to start actively taking care of yourself or you will not survive. And that revelation, that for the first time in your life someone is going to start paying attention to you and... care? There's so much freedom there. That's why it's at least some degree of ""okay"".

All that and you literally never learn any other behavior besides cruelty and unforgiveness toward yourself. Thankfully, there are actually times where you're able to laugh at how fucking absurd that fact is.

I've given you a lot of objective facts; courtroom records of what actually happens to you because that's what you want right now. But what you need to know, what I need you to take away from this, is the bits of wisdom interspersed throughout this letter. You need to take that away from this. The sum of your pain never lessens, and I don't know that it ever will. You sure as fuck (thankfully?) never become one to give a second, or even first thought to silver linings, but you do learn that instead of grasping at hollow positives to desperately distract yourself from shitty events and situations, you need to find the lessons. You need to extract what the horrible event tells you you need to do in order to survive the next time it happens. It's not the best hand to play, but it's yours: the only way you survive is by perpetually picking yourself back up again, but it's *a* way to survive. How long it remains a viable strategy remains to be seen, but it's what gets you at least this far. 

Sure, there are stronger hands and rosier outcomes in life, but at the very least this gets you another cat, your first (!) dog, a bachelor's degree, and some cool adventures. You learn to dive and it shakes up your life in a very radical way. You still have your deep relationship with art, and although she still seems to be the only one who has ever known you best, this also means that you're never as alone as you could be. You aren't yet convinced that these offset the pain enough to persist, but these are the things that do bring you joy and... there's at least some value in that.

I won't tell you to ""keep your head up"" or any of that other trite bullshit you hate to hear, but I have this playlist I made, filled with what is essentially ""[state you grew up in] music"". The playlist is all music that defined YOU when you lived there: the most vital songs to your identity and those that brought you great comfort at various times in your life ranging from loss and abandonment to early-morning windows-down rides to the beach to catch the sunrise. I was organizing shit in my closet and I decided to put it on for the first time in recent memory, when I got to the point where I needed to sit down and write this letter immediately. You can thank good ol' Jack Johnson for that.

Everything might feel like utter shit now, especially after explaining that nothing gets better (and arguably worse in some ways), but thinking of your first love shared with W, your summer with S, every. single. morning. that began with a mug of scalding coffee sipped from atop the lifeguard tower at Neptune, later tracking mountains of sand into your truck and prodding at fresh tan lines in the mirror, of 1am bike rides and spotting shooting stars with B, of sushi at G, the sister you find in B; there's a lot of really... really sweet joy you experience here. And those are the memories you end up falling back on when you're 26 and trying to remember the last time you were happy. Things are shit, but ask yourself how much of that you can actually attribute to your own hand. Understand that you're already apparently the type of person to automatically never forget the bad, so try to worry less about clinging onto those things and instead on intentionally cataloging the good. Savor those sweet, fleeting moments. The collection of them become really important in the end.

And remember that I love you. No one else might, but I do.",23Jul2020,3

58,"Hello, my names Darryl. I’m 15, going into 10th grade. When I was elementary, I was in love and played lots of different single player titles, like cod advanced warfare, cod ghosts, halo, watch dogs, all the assassins creed games before black flag (ac3 personal fav) etc. i also only had an Xbox 360, so multiplayer wasn’t available.I was so happy entering middle school and had lots of hope. I made myself a crappy pc from old parts, excited to see all the different kind of games I could explore. Then the alpha for a game called rocket league was released in 2015, it immediately caught my attention. I thought, let’s try it out, seems kinda cool, it was the only game I could run ok. So I proceed to play this game really enjoyed, and had fun. For about 4 months. Then, my addiction started. For my entirety of middle school to 8th grade, I was obsessed. I played 15 hours a day, rarely slept, lights off, didn’t shower, ate too much, didn’t brush, didn’t go outside, didn’t do schoolwork, it was terrible. During that time, I convinced myself that rocket league wasn’t the problem, that it was school, maybe it was my friends, family, myself. Nope, none of the above, it was this addiction. I wanted to stop, but I couldn’t I was already hooked. I have all ads, made a lot of friends that I didn’t even like, pushed my family out, depressed, gained weight. The summer before 9th grade, I got some upgrades to my pc, finally giving me no excuses to force myself to do this. I finally quit the game, and removed it from my account. I was relieved, or more so, just happy. I felt like something that was pulling me down a well, finally let me go. During 9th grade, i bettered my hygiene, started getting good grades, lost a lot of friends and made real friends, did track and wrestling, and feel amazing. Now, during quarantine, I have gained a little weight, but I’m not too worried about that. I wanted to finally make the adjustment of enjoying single player games again. During 9th grade, I tried to get into lots of different single player game, like Witcher 3, Star Wars, botw, bl3, but I just couldn’t get hooked to any. They just give me the same kind of experience. I now consistently play other multiplayer games, like csgo, valorant, apex, overwatch, but still not too hooked, rl kinda ruined competitive gaming in general for me. How can I get back into  the love of single players games like I used too? I’m not depressed or anything, I just want to explore my reasoning for why I started gaming.",23Jul2020,1
59,"So some kinda #artschool discourse is going around Twitter again. On the off-chance I can reach anyone before they make their mistake: **Art schools aren't necessary for a career in the arts.** If you go to one, you'll probably start hearing this right around your senior year (that's when I first heard it).

I'm not saying there aren't good schools out there. By most accounts, mine was a very good one (even if they are at the center of the current kerfuffle), and I think I'm one of the only people from my class and major that hasn't spent at least a little time working in the industry yet, so that's something of an endorsement.

But I'm saying you don't *need* to go to one. Where your degree comes from, or even having a degree at all, will have far less impact on your career than being able to demonstrate skills and having a network of people who can convince people to take a chance on you.

No one tells you this until you're already there and committed to the massive debt.

A cynical part of me blames it on greed and business and such. Student loan servicers need you to be in debt; art schools need your tuition money; your high school needs you to go on to college to make them look good. But I think more of it is probably that it's just not something your teachers, guidance counselors, college admission staff etc. are thinking about. By default, it's just not something they would consider.

But it's something you *should* be thinking about and aggressively looking for answers to. College is expensive, and art school is especially expensive. It may end up being worth that cost; or it may be a ball and chain that follows you around for the rest of your life. For me, it was the latter.

When I look back at my decision to go to art school, it always strikes me just how naive I was, how little research I did, how screwed up my priorities were, but also how little help the people around me were (not that naive past-me would have known he needed the help and sought it out). Past-me genuinely believed that you just went to college for a thing that you wanted to be your job, and somehow, you learned everything you needed to get that job: How to apply, all the skills you needed etc. and no one knew I thought this, so no one could set me straight.

It's obvious to me now, but it never occurred to past-me that there's nothing stopping you from looking up your dream job, seeing what companies are hiring people to do that thing, and what qualifications they're looking for. (Actually, I tried this *once* in, like, junior high, in like, the worst possible way, and when it failed, I just decided that meant I would learn all of that in college. Again, don't be like past-me. He was an idiot.)

There's nothing stopping you from finding people with that job and asking them how they got the job and what advice they have for someone who wants to do that job when they grow up. (Pros scoff at that, but I think that's mainly because it's a common piece of art school homework that has a reputation as something the school is making the kids do in lieu of teaching it to them themselves. I suspect they'd be happy for an independent learner to ask.)

Also, take your time. Past-me hated high school and just wanted to be done and never have to go to school ever again. This isn't a great way to learn anything in a scholarly environment, and it's not a great attitude to bring into a very very expensive school. Many of the people I went to art school with who seemed to enjoy the most success right off the bat were people who were older when they went to art school. These people had had jobs or studied other things before jumping into our program, and I believe those experiences helped them to work and study in ways that those of us fresh out of high school, living on our own for the first time in our lives, just weren't familiar with.

I can't give this advice to past-me, but maybe somehow it can find its way to someone similar enough to past-me that they can avoid a whole lot of hurt and a whole lot of debt. I know from experience, no one else is liable to give that person this advice, so if you know someone like past-me, please, give them my advice, or if past-me sounds an awful lot like present-you, maybe consider this advice for yourself:

1. If you have a dream job, research the hell out of it. Find out the qualifications you need, the skills you need. Learn about other people doing that job because they're your best information about that job, and also your competition for similar jobs, and possibly even your network to help you get that job.

2. Don't rush into expensive decisions. Art school can wait, and if you make it wait a bit, you might just be much better suited to make it work for you. Or you might learn enough on your own that you don't need it.

3. Don't make your first taste of freedom an expensive one. There's a lot to learn about living on your own. It may be far better to get a job and your first apartment and learn all about eating cereal for every meal and figuring out how to do laundry and going to parties in a setting where it *won't* cost you tens of thousands of dollars per semester to do so.

4. An apartment, a decent computer, a bunch of tutorials, and tickets to industry networking events are way cheaper than art school. It's not the route for everyone, but even if they don't work for you on their own, they're all things that will help you succeed at art school.

5. Student loans are a goddamn nightmare, and they're not getting fixed anytime soon. They're a big part of why I might seem to be cautioning you away from college period. They're not as bad as you've heard: they're worse. Fight for every non-loan dollar that you can get. And if you can't get scholarships and grants, consider cutting your losses and resuming school at a later date when you can get those non-loan dollars.",23Jul2020,1
60,"It’s something I’ve always struggled with and something I’ll never stop struggling with. I wish I could apologize to everyone who’s life I made harder due to my insecurities. For im truly sorry 

I always feel horrible every time I over think and the anxiety gets too hard to handle at times. The anxiousness and overthinking just cause more problems and it’s like a never ending line of dominoes 

I have never been a very sociable person, I’m consider more of an introvert and I have never been popular or had too many friends. For the friends I have had there’s always been a point or more where I messed it up at one point due to my self-esteem. I’m sorry and I’m grateful to those who have the patience to be my friend and still talk to me today. 

I’m sorry to my loved one who I burden with complaints about myself or needs. I’m so sorry. I love you so much and you’re so dear and good  to me and I’m so afraid of ruining us. My mind makes me think that my love for you is greater than your love for me and that may be true but that’s okay. I’m sorry for getting emotional all the time, i was cursed with sensitive emotions. 

I want to apologize to everyone, I truly am sorry. I promise to you all I’m trying to get better. I hate feeling helpless and I want to gain more confidence and while I may never gain it fully I want to have some. So I leave with this: I’m sorry.

62,"It’s lengthy but I think others can relate greatly and would love to hear from others to kinda help each other out you know.

I, 22 male, graduated college this past May. What feels and sounds like a major accomplishment has felt shrouded by so many negativities.

Spring break was just me sitting playing games with my hometown friends online. Sure it’s always a blast but never been one to get invited to party/travel much. I don’t mind all to much being techy and what not... but COVID closures just side swiped me so incredibly hard...
I had to commit to a month or 2 of online classes; very easy and achievable. But nonstop I thought of how I lost my in person senior year experiences.... more importantly i lost some of the closest people I ever came in contact with. You’ll make college friends of course, but a select few will be your forevers. I’ll call them K, E, H, and L.
They ment so much to me and I ment so much to them, as we still do even when Me and E are lecturing K, or E and K are saying how crappy my dad jokes are; or when H and L and I go to get our first tattoos, and soon to be more! We got drunk, we gave our life stories, we met everyday, we shared everything, and it was fucking Awsome...... then it’s just all gone from closure. I’m forced out early cuz I stayed in campus and I haven’t seen them since.

We communicate still, but the hole is still there. No closure is needed, but I just wanted to hug them by and tell em how much they ment to me in person... I wanted to walk the line for them and my family as the first ever college student.... I wanted to follow my career I setup, only to get terminated by cancellations over COVID. EVERYTHING WENT FROM 100 TO -100 IT FEELS LIKE.

Can’t deny do feel alone since having a huge relationship fallout that’s caused some problems towards my mentality and self esteem. Though I’m a person who thrives off affection, and being held and what not. Though that’s a small baggage I carry from the other problems.

A lot of the stress from these things hitting me will diminish from time however. For instance, I recently saw L and H and had a blast with them; and a bit of sadness from other things that kinda directed me towards here. Though the big problem is Career.

Months, days, hours, to minutes, to refreshing pages every second to find a career to make a suitable life for myself and still nothing. Only a serving/bartending job to keep some income rolling in to buy a new car and what not. I JUST WANT A CAREER THAT I WORKED SO HARD FOR, YET IM SO IMPATIENT. I’m in a sense of “I know with time it’ll come and my hard work will pay off” but that lingering stress of being denied jobs just kills me.

In a sense, time has also felt so slow cuz of so many negativities, yet I’m always one to try and stay so positive. Yet going through all this and rethinking it has slowly felt like my battery is draining.

I’ll keep going and if you’ve read this far, you should do the same. As drained and sad I kinda am now... things will get better. I hope whatever’s wrong with you turns around.. and I sincerely wish you the best. Whoever you are, can at least know someone loves ya and really wants you to thrive.

Typing this kinda felt nice to just let it out. COVID-19 took some specialties from me sadly, and I wish it went very differently. Though I can’t change that and it really fucking sucks. I can however share the experience and feelings for others to possible do the same.",23Jul2020,2

71,"My brother (30M) is my (27F) abuser.

It has taken years to come to terms with this, but I have a list of his actions:

\- Getting angry at the drop of the hat, kicking down doors, breaking furniture, etc.  
\- Calling me useless/ugly/worthless and then saying that I was oversensitive and had a victim complex, that it was my fault for choosing an inferior life path  
\- Telling me that nothing is a secret and that he was always watching what I was doing (on social media etc)

He is active on internet groups and catfishes women to prove that they're all worthless and superficial. He goes on tirades about how women are whores and repeatedly tells me not to be a whore.

Three years ago, he was so angry that he beat me and broke my laptop. I ran away.

Recently, he disowned the family (my parents) as he thought that we were ruining his mental health by not agreeing to his tirades. My parents are distraught that they lost their son. For me, it's bringing back terrible flashbacks of his actions. Every time I try to speak to them about it, they say ""stop thinking so much, let it go"".

Right now, my head is replaying the scene where his fists rained down on me. The hatred in his face. The words ""you're pathetic"" thrown at me. A wave of nausea comes over me. I feel like my head is going to cave in... I'm scared that I'll never move past this...",23Jul2020,2

78,"Hello! So i just think about this a lot but like I don't know who in my real life i would tell this to so I'm telling reddit. 

So basically, all of my past relationships were.. bad? And i know that I'm the common denominator and I've been doing my best to improve myself. But starting from age 10, I was groomed by an older man. This started a viscous cycle of me meeting older men, them using me, and it ending because they found a gf their own age or got sick of me. This cycle ended when I was about 15, and I entered a relationship with someone who was 17 and it did not go well. 

I dated this person for a little under two years, so it ended when I was 17 and he was 19. He went to a different school that was in a town about 1-2 hours by bus from mine. In the beginning there were red flags that I ignored. He told me how he got kicked out of his theatre play because he threatened to rape a girl that was there. The first time we met he sexually assaulted me multiple times and mocked me for getting scared. However, at this time I was excited that an older boy from another school was paying attention to me so i kinda.. let it slide. 

Anyway, as those 2 years went on it got worse. He would slip things into my drinks, make fun of my appearance, and intentionally make me cry because it turned him on. He would tell me my friends were horrible. I would tell my friends some of the things he'd do and he would get mad at me for telling them. He took me into a gun store the same day I had attended a friend's funeral who had taken his life by shooting himself. He also berated me and hit me when I refused to go into a motel with him. He would also police what I could and couldn't wear (I wasn't allowed to wear things like leggings and high-waisted jeans). It was a dark couple years. It ended up ending because I got to a point where I had a very hard time reciprocating any physical affection, and he got sick of forcing me around basically. 

After that ended I was single for a few weeks. A friend I had from childhood and I had become close throughout that school year because we took a lot of the same classes and were in the same clubs and we also had lunch at the same time so we'd get food and eat together. However I never had seen him as like a viable dating option. A few weeks into my ""singlehood"" he texted me and asked if I wanted to go get froyo with him, and I did but saw it as nothing more. Later that night he confessed his feelings for me, and I rejected him. I think I rejected him a few times across a few days because I didn't want to date again after my previous relationship. I felt really beat down and worthless. 

I started seeing him as an option, and then I said yes when he asked me again. We started dating from then on and it was really sweet and wholesome. I had never had a relationship like this before - where it felt sweet and I would see the family and it didn't revolve around what I could offer, it was just hanging out. 

Anyway, I'm 20 now and still with this person. Its been the best 3 years of my life. I never would have thought someone could love me the way he does. He has never put me down, he supports me unconditionally, he understands me and is so so kind. His family even likes me - even though I feel like I'm a gross little goblin of a woman. Its insane and I never thought I would have a stable, happy, loving relationship. Words cannot describe how grateful I am for this man. I've learned so much and he's encouraged me to grow as a person - and I hope I've done the same for him. 

Anyway, thanks if you read this much!",23Jul2020,1
79,"I dunno how it started. At first I didn’t know she was married. She kept that part from me for about a year. We first started talking when I was still with my ex girlfriend so around 24-25.. I’m 26 now. She’s 37. Has a couple kids. A happy marriage, etc. but she asked if we could hangout, I said ‘sure’ why not. I didn’t push anything. She wanted to do the same stuff I’m interested in, photography, hiking, whatever. 

Basically when we were on the trail it went great at first, it really did. Then she pulled over &amp; chilled for a second asked “come look at this tree” I can’t believe I fell for it. She pulled me close, made out with me, then kept walking. I was shocked. I was sure this woman just wanted a friend. I kinda stopped dating at this point. I don’t really even care about life anymore, honestly. 

We ended up getting a hotel room that night because she was “too tired to go home” &amp; said “maybe it’s a good idea if we get a hotel room, I’ll tell  john were too tired to drive” I was like “okay I know what she’s trying to do now.” I decided “eh whatever, let’s get a room” I told her I could sleep on the floor &amp; she was like “don’t be silly, I don’t bite unless you want me too ;)” &amp; then proceeded to seduce me and go down on me. Let me tell you - it was the best sex I’ve ever had. I didn’t know pussy/ass could be that good i was almost wondering if I were gay or something. The girls I’ve been with have been trash. No offense. 

Needless to say, we’ve been basically having an affair since. We hangout on the weekends or during the day while her kids / husband are at work / school. I’m off like 3 days a week from work (I do contracting stuff, not important but I’m away for work most of the time. Is the point) she lets me come in her home, have sec with her, make food for me, everything. Literally I can do what I want to this woman. She’s fine as hell &amp; knows exactly what she’s doing. It’s almost like a relationship, but she’s married??? It’s so bizarre. I barely started to feel like an adult &amp; all the sudden I’m like “woaaaah” all I wanted to do was go hiking &amp; she cane with me. I can’t control her actions. It’s not my fault she sucked my dick that night. 

Here’s the other thing; her husband is bi &amp; gets sex from dudes when he’s on the road with his band so I’m like .... what’s the harm here? They’re apparently in a open marriage from my standpoint. I didn’t know this going into it. Should I feel bad? She literally talks to me all the time, like a girlfriend would, motivates me to live this life, let’s me do sexy stuff to her whenever/whatever I please. What’s so wrong? If her husband is having sex with dudes then why should I feel bad? I’m starting to really care for this woman &amp; she’s becoming a part of my life. 

She’s older than me &amp; has her life together. Younger girls my age 20-29 are fuckin retards it seems like &amp; it’s hard to be this age, I feel. Ever since turning about 17 I’ve felt like life is just hella weird. I never had much faith in living or anything and suffer from ‘depression’ so for me to just not feel like shit 24-7 from a terrible childhood &amp; just the way life is , I’m really trying to hang on to whatever this is. Am I the bad guy here? Should I stop seeing her? She tells me she loves me &amp; I say it back, Ive never said I love you to someone and meant it. But she’s married :/ but it’s basically ‘open’ relationship. So I’m confused as shit. I don’t know how I feel about being an “adult” all the sudden either, I mean, I work &amp; have my life together. This is too grown up of a situation for me compared to all the children I’ve been around for some time now. If that makes sense. I always felt pretty mature I suppose.. but this feels over my head in a way. I don’t wanna get murdered by some crazy boyfriend/husband thing, Whatever it is.",23Jul2020,1

It’s not that I’m mad or angry at the world, I just don’t give a fuck. I figure I’m just waiting this life out &amp; doing what I want in the spare time till it ends, like a video game almost. It all just comes off as menial bullshit to me. I don’t struggle financially, I make enough to support myself, I hate working &amp; money. I live for very few things in life. I know I’m not ‘old’ @ 26. Still kind of a kid “technically” from what I’m told by elders. I just think, was all my struggling in life really worth this mediocrity from life itself? How do I cope with this feeling? I make like 90k a year now, can do everything I want, still fucking hate money &amp; working, but at least things aren’t bad. But certainly not worth my suffering for this bullshit. I’m constantly worried about time &amp; how little of it I have here. How do you guys cope? Also people seem very ignorant &amp; oblivious to life, I feel like everything around me is ‘fake’ &amp; uninteresting most of the time. I’m perfectly fine with just wasting my life away. The only things I’m interested in are photography &amp; art. I make enough money now &amp; have enough time to do both but still feel like my existence/life isn’t worth it for this bullshit of what life appears to actually be.",23Jul2020,1
86," I’m one of those people who is complex and confusing. Human nature itself is confusing and extensive; however to some extent everyone can be categorized. You have those geeks, the introverts, the social butterflies, the creative and artsy ones and the badasses.

I don't fit into any of these categories and I know to some extent no one does but I want to describe my aura, my personality and what defines me.

This sounds cliche but I often feel like the popular ‘bitch’ in every chick flick, as in I’m very intellectual, very popular, pretty, skinny, the teachers love me and I’m confident. I’m very extroverted and I thrive in social environments- I'm the ‘mom’ of my friendship groups and I do so much better emotionally and psychologically when i'm around people but I also love my own company. Sitting down on the couch with tea and a good book appeases me as much as an evening on the town with the girls. Being busy with a project with many people and lots of interaction and pressure interests me as much as sitting in the library all day pouring over textbooks, notes with a freshly brewed coffee. Doing a full day adventurous outing with feats and friends excites me as much as spending a day lying on the porch in the sun listening to music, alone. 

I’m fiercely independent; I travel alone, go shopping alone, live alone and people view me as a bit of a tough badass but I get so cripplingly depressed and lonely at times. To my friends it seems nothing can affect me and I’m mature and bold but to myself I feel like a failure and way too sad to be functional. I’m very open about my emotions and my past, if I’m angry at an event or hurt I will tell people and I know I'm in touch with what I'm feeling but because of my tough personality I brush off the intense feelings I just shared so my social circles are like ‘ she's strong and she can get through anything so she must be okay’. Although I’m open and I share, I never break down in front of my friends as I do when I'm alone. I stuff any foreboding panic attacks deep down until I’m alone as I cannot be seen as weak or else they won’t look up to me.

Although I am strong and tough and outspoken I also have such a soft side. I love so deeply and intensely and I care about the people I love so freaking much. I will do anything for my friends and family and they know that. I love babies and I can hold a baby and stare at their face for days without getting bored. Their smell and soft skin makes me so happy. 

Surprisingly, my love language is touch. This is something I’ll never understand and it's probably because of my lack of physical comfort and hugs as a child and this really doesn't match my personality but I love hugs. I give such comforting hugs even acquaintances have asked me for hugs before in hard times because they feel how warm and caring I am. I touch my friends' hands to show them I’m here and those who are comfortable with it, I walk down the street arm in arm with them. 

I’m very adventurous. I love touring new cities and going to new places and trying new things. Activity and adventure are so exciting and make me feel like I'm living again. I am not afraid of stepping outside my comfort zone and being the spontaneous, unpredictable (not emotionally) friend. Yet I'm the biggest geek I know. I'm obsessed with science and maths and literature and I love studying and writing notes and learning new things. I can discuss astronomy, algebra, classic books for hours on end. These two opposite traits seem like the antithesis of each other yet they mold together in my personality somehow.

My social support network consists of the most social, extroverted bubbly characters and also those who would be too shy to speak in front of strangers but when it is just me around they blossom and we have the most interesting conversations. I have those friends who hate academia and studying and I also have those who I argue about harry potter with on a regular basis. Those who are light and fluffy yet many who are dark, damaged and deep. 

So overall I kinda place myself in the geeky, introverted, social butterfly, creative and artsy and badass categories. Or maybe I’m just broken.",23Jul2020,1

91,"It's early in the morning. 6:33 but I'm awake since 4am. I can't sleep, my stomach hurts. I suppose the heat woke me up.

Anyway, I'm not writing this for anyone, just for myself. I should really make a blog instead of here on Reddit but... Idk. Sometimes I wish someone could read it, other times I wish it could get lost between other posts here, other times I wish I could stop myself from writing, all of them at the same time right now.

I can't stop thinking of how everything is going to go to shit no matter what I do. At the same time how everything is going to be much better. Maybe both are true. I'm sure they are but right now they are making me not fall asleep again and have the rest I so need. Is anxiety I guess.

I'm listening to some music. Chillwave. I used to listen some music before sleep when I wash a child so I could calm myself and go to sleep and to avoid nightmares. I don't think they are going to work now because is difficult for me to just listen and imagine. 

I wish I wasn't human. I wish I could declare myself officially insane so I just could do whatever I wanted. I wish I didn't had the need to eat or sleep or worry about anything. I know is the wish of many normal ass humans in the planet, that's part of what makes them human I suppose. To be aware of it and desire... Fucking humanity thought. 

Then again, what do I know. I've been alone for so long that I can only imagine how the good version of it is. And at the same time I've also had good relationships with the people I could interact with. Well, not really as good, maybe just mixed. It's hard when they ultimately reject you or abandon you to your luck, or abuse you while also giving you their time, care and attention. It's so confusing. Nothing is stable or sure, everything is black and white and gray , dark, bright, dim, all at the same time.

Why can't I accept one or the other? It's all fluctuating and I fluctuate too. 

...I feel as if I've lived so many lives. And I haven't done anything with the one I currently have. I'm paralyzed.

I wish I could have enough confidence to go out alone dressed up in a weird costume and not worry about anything because I just want to. I actually envy to some degree those fucking cat people, the so called nekos, that just do it and people call them mental, and yeah it probably is mental, but they are living their desires regardless. I wish I could be one of those ppl, the zentai suit guys, hahaha! I just love to play pretend, I have so much imagination and is nothing mother fucking sexual or crazy, at least I consider myself pretty sane and logical, considering. Then again, how can I know, I'm pretty mental for the average standards but how can others know too if crazy people don't know they are crazy, they believe they are sane. 

You mother fucking hetero cis allos, you normal people, you extroverts.... you fucking chauvinists and feminists. You people in general, some more than others. I can't say anyone is free from responsibility. I myself too, because I'm just fucking damaged, I could probably just conform and that's it, stop whining that is not really easy for anyone and no one actually knows what they are doing or where they are going, what they are supposed to do, and that is true. Just do whatever you need to do and take responsibility, just do it! And they are right but at the same time that's just fucking stupid. I'm in the wrong for being too mother fucking nice, thinking that there was an actual truth, an actual way to live. But there's no actual rules. Fuck good people for trying to make me think there's good, fuck bad people for being too fucking narcissistic. Fuck both for being too blind or too enlightened. Fuck myself for not being able to look past me because there's no one else, just like everyone.

Everyone is on their own, no one has actually responsibility over anyone. Life is uncaring. Life is cruel. Why do ppl revere it so much then? It only has two directives: don't die and reproduce. It does care how it just needs those two things to happen at whatever cost. That's it. Why? For what purpose?... EeEeehh~~ who knows. We are used to think that death and the nothing is the villain because it robes you from keep on living, but like... The rule is actually for things to be dead. The entire universe is dead. The exception to this rule is life. Like a disruptor, that by sheer force is trying to take over and convince you that death is not what you want. And I'm not sure but to me it sounds like a desease or a cult of it were personified. Life is the one that causes pain to become afraid of dying, it convinced you that you must not return to nothing. It doesn't care about you as a conscious being, which is most probably just an unfortunate accident of the same processes evolution does to ensure life. On one hand you ask it to let you have tools to defend yourself against the other (let's say sexually or survival) and reluctantly says ""fine! Geez! Just stop whining"" but under the table it says to the other ""hey, have this to counter act what I gave that guy, I know it's a fucked up alternative but you know whatever goes right? just don't tell anyone it's our secret, wink wink"", because it doesn't care, it only cares about their directives. It's cruel. 

I'm not religious. I don't know what to believe because I understand things differently.

I wish there was someone to make me actuall presential company, not through the mother fucking internet, and helped me to either be functional or leave it all behind and accept I won't be. 

... 

Whatever. I can't continue writing. It's 7:46 and my cat wants attention. A d I have to start the day, trying to find ways to earn that fucking money. Or loose myself thinking I could probably stop altogether and just play videogames, dress up in costumes and then kill myself to assure I die happy and free.

97,"The way my father handled the situation had terrible consequences in his life, my mother's, my siblings', their mother's and my own. And here I am, trying to heal this generational trauma by spitting it out to strangers. Sorry if this is a huge clusterfuck and also I'd really appreciate it if someone took the time to read it. 

Both my parents have always told me they were the love of each other's lives. When I was born my mother was 30 and my father 47. By then my mother had an 11yo son from a previous relationship and my father had 3 daughters and 2 sons (11-21yo) from his ex-wife.

I know that my parents got together when my brother (from mom) was around 2yo which is the same age as my father's youngest. My parents stayed together from then until I was 2yo (so, for about 10 years) and then my father left. 

My siblings on dad's side hated me until I was around 17yo (the eldest hating me the most - until this day), but it took me many years before I understood why. I don't have many memories from childhood as most have been erased but I remember being told by one of my brothers when I was about 7yo that my birth had destroyed the family. My other brother has alopecia and since I was little that I was told he lost his hair due to the stress of his parents breaking up. 

As I grew older I learned about some details of my parents relationship and my dad's with his ""original"" family:

1. My father didn't tell my siblings about me until I was 1yo.

2. When my father split with his wife he promised to his kids that he wouldn't have any more children. (I found out about this at a family lunch, very pleasant)

3. At this same lunch my father said he wished he had had one less kid. He didn't say which, but it was implied. I got up and left the table at this point. 

4. My mother had at least 5 abortions bc my dad  requested, before deciding to keep the baby (me), and she believes I'm the reason their relationship was ruined - she told me this. 

5. My mother was never invited to family gatherings while, to this day, my siblings' mother still attends some. 


And so, long before I understood why, I felt like a stranger in my family. No real connections. They're all very close to each other but not me. There's nobody in my family that I speak to regularly. 

My relationship with my mother was terrible and I did hate her at one point. But now as I face the loneliness that comes with adulthood (and having had 1 abortion) I realized that A) five abortions is no fucking joke. I can only imagine the pressure that was put on my mother B) deciding to keep a baby after going through all that only to have your relationship end 2 years later (they'd been together for 9 when I was born) must have really felt like a mistake C) not being included nor acknowledged by baby dad's family must have brought a lot of pain and loneliness. 

My father was pretty rich and always supported my mother financially (and well after I was 18), but emotionally? Not so much. This and their split-up also resulted in my father being an absent figure throughout my life. 

I also learned to sympathize with my siblings' situation. They had a ""perfect"" family and watched it get destroyed by a 21yo woman. That must have been so hard and plus, I know their mother influenced them a lot and put a lot of shit in their heads which lead them to hate me about 9 years later. 

Weirdly enough, despite all this, me and my siblings love my father a LOT. It's hard to explain but it doesn't even feel like he's responsible for this shitstorm even when quite clearly he is. 

Since all of this happened I've had a sister go into rehab and a shitload of pills for 5 years because of alcohol and cocaine abuse, and depression. And my two brothers (which are my father's youngest before me) also have a tendency towards substance abuse, and the youngest (imo) is falling into depression as well. 

And me? I feel structurally ruined. I feel like a genuine mistake. It feels like I fuck up every life I touch. 
And I also feel like I don't belong anywhere in the world, a strange feeling. I left my hometown when I was 18 and now at 24 it doesn't feel like I could ever go ""back"" there as i wasnt really there... But I also don't feel like my home is where I've been living for the past 6 years. I've been wanting more and more to just cut all ties and travel to a distant land...

100,"I need help and advice to stop being a “Jerry” from Rick and Morty.

So I realized that I’m a Jerry to the T. Which is pretty fucking horrible. I’m a complete spineless doormat who has a terrible dependency disorder which also causes anxiety, depression and feelings of low self worth.

Just like Jerry who worships his wife and has a bit of an inferiority complex because she’s so successful while his life and hobbies are lame and he’s always screwing up. 

It really struck me when he’s awkwardly talking to his wife about their relationship and looking for validation and she responds that loving him “is work”. Its a conversation that I’ve had too. 

He’s constantly worried his wife will cheat on him because of his low self worth and they’re (probably) only together because of the unplanned pregnancy of Summer.

His life is my life. To .the. T. And I don’t want to be a Jerry anymore. Now I’m here looking for advice. 

I’ve looked up Dependent Personality Disorder which seems to be a disorder with very little study behind it, so I can’t find any self help books, case studies or medication evidence. 

The only thing I can find is that they find Schema therapy to be effective but it’s one-on-one psychoanalysis therapy which I’ll look into when I have the time, but I’m looking for something I can start today, baby steps.

102,"I think I've posted elsewhere about her, but my mum has been suffering from cancer for the past 4 years, and it's gone into a form of remission, then come back again, multiple times. 

I saw my parents for about an hour on my birthday in March before we had to leave (risk of covid), then lockdown happened and I didn't see her again until Sunday gone. She has lost a ton of weight, keeps coughing and choking, and has absolutely no energy. We thought it was fluid in her lungs from her medication and her oesophageal/tracheal stent.

Today she was fitted with a tube to drain her lungs, but last night they found out that the cancer has metastatized and spread to her lungs.

This has gone from my parents planning a holiday (they were supposed to go away with us last week) to my dad calling up the Macmillan Cancer nurses and thinking about a hospice.

It's not fair. My mum was a GP all her life, spent every day looking after people and making them better. Then when she's ill, they almost kill her with a mis-aimed radiotherapy treatment, which turns into scar tissue that chokes her, then they put in a stent so she can eat/drink, but negligently left it in for a YEAR (instead of 6 weeks), so it cuts through her trachea and causes loads of fisula, which get infected and mask the symptoms of cancer coming back. She was on a feeding tube for 6 months and it could have been avoided. These past 6 months was her final chance to enjoy life before the cancer came back. And she's been barely able to leave the house.

I'm just so sad. I have my boyfriend, job, house, faith, friends, family. I know I'm going to be ok. I'm 32 - I know people die, and I've already lost friends and family members. But I don't think I'll ever be ready for my mum to die :( I am glad I got these extra 4 years, but it sucks she's going out like this.

I'm hoping my work will let me go back to my parent's house for a while and I can work from there. It just sucks I haven't been able to see them during lockdown.

103,"The title says it all. I’ve never been super skinny- but during quarantine I put on 10 pounds and it made me really self conscious. I started counting calories and I know it’s not healthy but My goal was to eat less than 900 cal a day. (For the last month I’ve only gone over this once and that was because I decided to treat myself to a glass of wine after dinner) Everything that I’ve been eating has been really healthy and I’m making sure I get lots of vitamins and vary what I eat, I’m also taking a multivitamin in case I’m not getting enough of something. I’m also working out 5-6 days a week. I’ll go on a 5 mile bike ride then do a 20 minute workout video later on in the day. I try to vary the videos as well so i workout everything during the week.

106,"I had a boyfriend for 2 months but I’ve known this guy since 4 years ago. I have never realized that this guy was a racist until we got in a relationship. That was the moment I saw his true colors. He hasn’t shown his racist side in those 4 years of friendship.

He was making racist comments towards black people in secret, not in front of them. At first I tried to ignore it but I felt really shitty. Yesterday was the point where I couldn’t be quiet anymore after a sad thing he said about a black kid. I’m not going to say it here, but it was just sad and it made me upset. I texted him that we need to talk about his racist views when we see each other that evening. So the evening came and I talked about it that I was totally not okay with it and that I couldn’t understand his way of thinking. He said that I’ll understand him when I will be older. I said in these 20 years I have never looked down on a person because he is from a different race, than you do.

I was hoping I could change his mindset but no. He kept on saying that he thinks about it in a different way and that I shouldn’t take him so serious and that he was ‘joking’ mostly. I said I don’t accept those things as a joke. I said that we are also a minority in the country we are living. We may be caucasoid but we will never be like western europeans. Our nationality may be ‘x’ but at home we speak our own language and have our own cultural things. So to be a racist as a minority in a white country is even more ridiculous. This counts for all people not only people like us, but also the white people.

The vibe was really weird the whole evening and we sat down in a restaurant. We talked about other things but everything felt off. I was very upset to realize I was dealing with a racist. Someone with totally other mindset than me. He was also not like he used to be. We both were distant.

So I got home and I got tears. Tears because of how someone can look down on other people like that. Tears because the person I like is a racist. I made a topic on reddit and asked for advice what to do. People told me that me being with a racist, also makes me a racist and that it’s best to end it. If I have known before that he was a racist, I would never be in a relationship with him at all!

I talked with my BFF that evening and she was in shock as well. I didn’t text my bf and neither did he. I tried to sleep but my thoughts kept me awake. I’m a person who can sleep within one minute but this whole situation made me so upset. He texted me at 1 am with an emoji that sticks his tongue out. I didn’t open it and tried to sleep.

Today we texted each other after my shift. We ended the relationship. I was hoping I could change him again, but he said that I can’t change him and that he will be like this. I said that his heart isn’t at the right place.

I’m feeling upset but also relieved. I could never be with a person who looks down on people like that. Who would see a black kid thinking cruel things about that kid. While I’m a person who would wave at that kid and try to make that kid smile",23Jul2020,3

I called up the court and they said first you have to mail the ticket you got with deciding if you are guilty or not. The lady i talked to said you can also reach out to us on email and if you chose that you are not guilty you still don't have to come to the court hearing. 

Can anyone help me what should I do? I mean wouldn't I still need a lawyer to represent me in court. 

Or should I just plead guilty and pay off the charges? 

This is my first ticket, i used to live in Texas before and usually the points wont go onto your drivers license there as you could do a defensive driving course and get rid of it. I don't know if that works in New York.

118,"Even in the summer, storms and showers are taking place around the world. Is it raining in your area? Are you experiencing frequent urination due to BPH? 

BPH is short for benign prostatic hyperplasia. This is the medical term for prostate enlargement, a common condition in older men. It is usually accompanied by frequent urination especially at night, slow urinary flow, struggle to start and stop urinating, urges, sensation of post voiding residual urine. These symptoms may affect a man's daily life in various ways: less sleep, less energy during the day from lack of sleep, stress, frustration, feeling tied to the nearest bathroom, unable to live in the moment, limitations on trips like long flights and work or social activities, etc.

As the rain flows frequently, so too do men with large prostates feel frequent urinary urges. July is Parks and Recreation Month, and not many people go out to parks in the rain. The benches and park equipment are wet, the ground may be slippery, and being caught in the rain and getting your clothes wet would be a problem. 

But just as the rain gives way for a clear sky with rainbows, so to do men with BPH have hope for managing their symptoms and improving their quality of life. Go to the park when the weather is suitable, practice social distancing and wear a face covering so that you can get your walk in the park. Walking can be beneficial alongside a nutritious diet so that you can prevent aggravating the bladder and BPH symptoms. 

Consider natural, safe, plant based treatment that has been clinically tested like UMOOZE. 

While you're staying home away from the rain, read and share our BPH blog to the public to spread awareness of this men's health condition. Stay safe and strive for better prostate health! ",23Jul2020,1

121,"Hey guys, 

I love my parents and I'm so grateful for them, and the fact that they have always been there. but they can get tad bit annoying at times. My mom, for no reason, gets suspicious of everything I do. Like, I was standing on a rug in the corner of the room, drinking water and she asked me why I was standing there? I love her so, so much but just wanted to check whether its normal? Like is it just a parent thing or what? Have any of you gone through anything similar?",23Jul2020,3
123,"My wife (29) and I (31) have a five year old son. When he was born, my wife needed a C-section. During the section, they found out that my wife has severe endometriosis, of which my wife had no idea. She had had painful periods and some constant, mild pain, but she hadn't paid much attention to it.

Now, after we had our son, for a long time we told ourselves that we don't want more kids. However, about a year ago, we discussed that after all, we'd like another child. My wife was on a pill since it keeps the endometriosis at bay. She stopped the pill in last November because she had read that it might take multiple periods until the cycle gets back to normal (her cycle normalized immediately).

Now, the pains got bad, and kept getting worse during the winter. In May, we decided to start trying. The first cycle didn't work out, but my wife got an appointment at a fertility clinic at our university hospital - something which usually takes months or even a year, but since she had been in so much pain, they decided to help us get pregnant quicker.

We visited the hospital and got quite scared about the treatment methods. My wife decided that she doesn't really want to go through the procedures. Luckily, right before her next appointment, she got pregnant. We were of course immensely happy, and because we had heard that pregnancy is good for endometriosis.

Well, after a few days after the positive result, she started getting the worst pain ever. She couldn't sleep and just cried all night. She went to the doctor and they gave her sleeping pills that she can take while pregnant, but there's no useful painkillers that she could take. When she was on the pill, she was taking painkillers that worked for her, but those are no-no when your pregnant.

The pains got so bad that we decided that we have to abort. The abortion starts tomorrow, and this is just... awful. At least we can talk about the situation and support each other, and my wife has good friends and family to support her.

Now, me... I have no one besides my wife to talk to. My mom is a person who means good, but as I told her our situation, she got so emotional about it that she wasn't able to comfort me - it got the other way around. It's immensely stressful to have this burden on you while you can't even talk to your own mom about it.

I have a therapist appointment in two weeks, which is more than welcome.

The worst thing is that I'm in kind of a blocked mode right now. I know this is it. We won't have a kid, ever, at least one that is biologically ours. I just can't properly take that in yet. After so much trouble, we finally got pregnant, only to cancel it immediately.",23Jul2020,4
124,"Are you God?

No.

So then, who is God?

God is the love you share with others, and that others share with you. God is the forgiveness given when that love is not returned. God is the mercy shown when a person does something bad, apologizes greatly, and promises that if they're given *one more chance*, they'll do better. God is the justice when that same person continually does bad things purposefully. God is the force of will in a mentally ill person's success story. God is the harmony which musicians and scientists both seek to uncover. God is the beauty in an artist's brush, the laughter and joy shared between two friends. God is the innocence of a child's smile.

God is an innocent man, writhing in pain, tortured to death, nailed to wood - who still forgives His tormentors out of love.

Are you God?

No.

So then, turn back to Him.",23Jul2020,0
125,"So I am 19 years old and I have been struggling to find my path for a long time. I have tried becoming an athlete or a coach, but I am still missing a piece there. I don't know what it is, but I just know I will find that in the marines. 

My parents have always been very socialistic very much against war and killing ( I also think people shouldn't kill eachother), but I just know there is something in the marines I cannot get anywhere else and I need to go at least try out. I have already made a couple steps in the direction of becoming a marine, but I have not been able to tell my parents. I'm just scared I will lose my family over this, but I know if I don't try out I will be regretting not going for years to come.

131,"I've always have a good and easy life, ups and downs ofc, but a good one still.

A few weeks ago everything started to change. My mother is not mentally stable and she does not accept any help; that inestability lead to problems with my girlfriend (of 7 years) since my mother does not want ""outside"" people at home (I live with my parents); this problem with my girlfriend lead to problems with her mother and those problems snowballed and made things even worse with her. 

I've also had some health problems (had tests with okeish results but I still have a few more test to rule out some potential problems) which caused a lot of anxiety, adding both anxiety and insonmia to the mix. I'm doing physical therapy because of this since I have a motion-limiting issue too, nothing major but still, another problem in the mix.

I have two free weeks at job after a 6 month of non-stop working (only weekends) and I told my girlfriend I wanted to spend a week chilling, going slowly back to the gym as my physiotherapist advised and trying to get my shit together. And she said no.

She started crying telling me that I had to go to her hometown because her family wanted to see me and I was being selfish. And I said yes, I can't stand seeing her cry.

I've put her before my mother and friends (I didn't stop being friends with them, I just split my life so they didn't have to meet), now we are looking for a place on our own in her city (40min drive from my parents') and I feel that she is no capable of giving just the one thing I asked of her, a f\*\*\*\* week off on my own...

I've told both my mother and her and they just seem to not care. They say they care, but in the end I'm doing exactly what everybody else want, not what I feel like I need, and I feel guilty for feeling that I deserve to do what I want...

I feel like breaking, I've explored the idea of going to another country and don't look back. I know it's selfish, but maybe is my way out of this, of them...

132,"Today I ate 2000 kcal without feeling guilty for the first time, it is incredible how freeing it is to be able to eat without guilt, hell i ate 3 tacos with guac and a lot of shredded chicken and I don't feel that bad about it.

133,"I have a problem with my self esteem. I feel like I need the approval of women so that I can feel I'm enough. It mostly manifests with me sleeping with them. At that point I feel like I'm on top of the world and everyone likes me, or rather, someone likes me. But afterwards, I always feel so shallow and empty. This has continued for a while now. It's a vicious cycle. I don't know how to help it. I don't know if I'm strong enough to feel contented by just being by myself. Sex and attention serve as a great escape to my reality and with social media, it's so much easier to seek and receive that attention. I just wish that this wasn't a problem and that I didn't have to constantly seek for women's attention.",23Jul2020,1

138,"I'm 23, and over a year and a half free of self harm. 


I used to avoid shaving my legs, because it would always lead to at least one cut, which led to blood, which led to crying and bad thoughts. But I sat down and took my time and did an awesome job. Yesterday I shaved my legs without thinking about self harm ONCE. 

I'm really proud of myself and wanted to share. 

For the first time in my life, I can be comfortable with my femininity and enjoy having my legs smooth again. I know that from now on, I'll be more confident in myself, and even if I get a tiny cut, I know I'll be able to forgive myself. 



A few weeks ago I cut open my fingertip on a cat food lid. Blood everywhere. I'm on blood thinners too for my PTSD, so it was crazy. But I survived that and didn't worsen it!!! I feel really strong right now. I am truly not the same person I was. I have grown and I'm so happy!!

140,"I went into a relationship about 4 years ago with someone who was a 3 years older than me. We both came in the relationship very insecure and showed it in different ways. He was cheating on me the entire time and I thought he was my soulmate. 

I waited for a couple years. Constantly leaving and coming back. Finding his friends and getting them to send messages for me. Dreaming every night about him. Trying to diagnose him because I thought there was something wrong with HIM and my 2 years of psych classes prove that I'm in the right (wrong). Sending him threats then sending manic apology letters. Showing up at his work just to look at him.

Throughout the path I was slowly finding exactly how I would treat my next boyfriend, in a way that he would never feel the way I felt and that he would never feel the way my ex felt. I never wanted to allow the idea of a person to have this much control of me again. 

Following therapy, becoming active and spiritual.  One and a half years ago I entered my first secure relationship with someone 3 years younger than me. I see him as how I would want to be treated as at that time in my life. I treat him as my equal.

147,"I have long believed in 2A - the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Proclaimed to be our right - given by God or other - to defend ourselves from tyranny. To hold arms and stand side by each with our fellow man and drive back a government who attempts to hold us under its boot. 

Now it no longer matters. The amendment itself is useless today. Why? Because why try to remove the gun from the holder when it is easier to use misinformation, lies, and propaganda to persuade the gun holder to fight for you instead of against you. 

This is not the same war. The bullet is a thought without an exit wound that is spread through a social feed. How do you defend yourself against a tyrant when the war you’re fighting is a psychological one that many are not equip to battle? Most are just a host that spread the virus. A virus, coded to perform an about face, to point their muskets at the enemy’s of its choosing. The revolution they were waiting for, to stand shoulder to shoulder with his brothers, is not coming.

But the other day I watch watching some.... adult entertainment, and somehow ended up on a video with a woman with a strapon and I thought that that was hot, and then I started thinking (for the first time ever) that I would like to have sex with someone, as long as I was the one on top and there was no penetration on my part. I’m kind of at a loss because every time I try to look it up it takes me to Femdom stuff, but I’m not sure about BDSM, I don’t want to hurt anyone.
