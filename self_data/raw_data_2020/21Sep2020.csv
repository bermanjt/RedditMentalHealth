1,"Long story short I’ve had situations as a kid where i made small unintentional mistakes and was cruely punished by my father. Be it choking, hard whippings, or being punched in the gut. All before age 12. It damaged my confidence and made my social issues worse and i developed bad anxiety and constant violent thoughts. They denied it the one time i brought it up in a mental breakdown but otherwise have been somewhat caring in trying to buy things or go on trips. 

Yet I internalized the hate and am so smiley and friendly with others and have a high pain tolerance. Yet when I see them I feel bad for them and want to help them despite how bad it hurt me as a child and even led me to washing down pain killers with hard liquor daily at 18 and even punching a hole in the wall last night. Every friend I’ve shared it with told me to call the cops as a kid. Internet strangers tell me to block them and how mad they are for me. Yet when the anger comes in i blame myself. That I wasn’t tough enough to fight back when I got punched and choked out at 12 while my mom and grandmah stood there watching. I wanted to run away and kill my family for some time. But now I’m just sad and mad at myself when the past creeps into my mind.

I leave for the military soon and can start a new life. Last time I did some No Contact they went crazy and were angry. I’ll likely be in another country and think I’ll change my number for a while so I can have distance to process things more. But everything is fine right now. I just don’t open up about personal issues at all and they think I’m a sweet innocent guy growing up. It’s weird but i guess I’ll see.",21Sep2020,1

3,"I've been noticing a lot of really nice art people have been making online, and while I'm happy that some people are able to make such beautiful things during this time, it makes me feel sad inside because I know I haven't made anything for months and months. I used to be really into making digital art, making comics, even just traditional art, but now I just don't feel like I can do it anymore for some reason. I had a whole account that I used to post stuff on, but now I don't post anything. I've been told before that maybe I need to take a break, but thats what it seems like I've been doing for several months and it hasn't helped me get any spark back.

I just started hating everything I made at some point. Paired with the fact that I feel afraid to post things on that account anymore for some reason. Like I can't even make a joke or a text post without being nervous about what other people think. I know that I have been very sad for a while (I dont want to say depressed because I haven't been diagnosed). So I feel like that could be a part of it. I think a part of it could also be because me parents don't like me making things and find it to be a waste of time. And for some reason I can't shake it off as easily as other people can.

But yeah, thats it. I used to be so excited to make art but now I feel like I can't or don't want to. But its weird because I know I REALLY want to. I just miss enjoying what I love.",21Sep2020,1

5,"Im 19 and the last four to five years of my life I've been trying all sorts of things out. First was video game development, which i succeeded and made a couple small games and I was proud of them. But then I got bored and moved onto the next thing, 3D animation, I made some cartoons and then got bored and moved onto the next thing, music and digital art, these are what I'm currently taking up at the moment. 

So to my point now. I hate my jobs, I feel like a brat for saying this but I absolutely despise being in a ""normal"" 9-5 job for some reason. None of the multiple jobs I've had up to tbis point have filled me with any satisfaction whatsoever. But when I'm being creative it brings me immense satisfaction and I feel like I'm worth something. Though everyone around me keeps telling me to give up and just be normal. But I don't want too. Is this a bad thing? Could I just be endlessly chasing all these different dreams of mine for the rest of my life? Or should I just be ""normal"" and feel unaccomplished for the rest of my life.

I have a few fans of mine that listen to my music, they message me and comment on my songs frequently and it brings me immense joy knoaing that I'm making them happy, I want to bring joy to many peoples lives but I don't think I can. I'll probably be stuck as a loser with his head in the clouds. Doesn't help that I'm not good at anything ""normal"" either, I only barley understand basic maths, I have good English at least but thats about it. I'm also good with tech but not enough to get into it as a job.

8,"TW//mention of starvation, overall body image issues

I don’t know if anyone will see this or even care but, for the first time in a long while I’m allowing myself to eat without shame. I’m currently a 17 year old girl and I’ve struggled with body image issues for the better part of my childhood. I’m not fat, I would actually be considered skinny by some people, but I’ve always felt that I wasn’t skinny enough. As a teenage girl, the only standard of beauty you ever really see are these super super thin girls and after a while it gets depressing having to look at your body and be reminded that you aren’t that. I used to starve myself and only eat once or twice a day so that I could look like all the skinny girls around me, but no matter what I did I just didn’t like my body. It’s only been recently that I’ve realized that no matter what I do, no matter how skinny I become, if I’m not comfortable in my body as it is then I’ll never be. Ever since quarantine started I’ve been forced to live with myself and slowly, I’ve been learning what self-love feels like for me. I’ve learned to look at myself and see my beauties instead of focusing on my insecurities. And lately I’ve been allowing myself to eat without guilt :)) That’s honestly been the craziest thing for me. I used to hate eating, hate having to see my stomach bloat up and become big. But now after I eat, I look at my stomach and I’m just like “yeah, that’s natural”. It’s not like I’m at the stage where I completely love myself yet but I’m getting there and I just wanted to share my happiness in my progress with anyone else who might be going through the same thing. I know everyone loves talking about self-love in this super artificial way but I really do want anyone reading this who might be struggling to know that falling in love with yourself is about the best thing you can do. You don’t need to do all the stupid stuff everyone else says you need to do to love yourself. You just have to be patient and learn to forgive yourself. You have to let yourself be happy irrespective of how other people define happiness. And you have to get to a stage where, sure, you might not be falling over in awe at how amazing you are, but you’re at least content in your own skin. I’m getting there and I hope you get there too :)",21Sep2020,1
9,"A year ago I was in a dead end job and my mom was super sick in a hospital 3 hours from home and we werent even sure of shed make it. My life both with my family and my job was stressful and I just needed a change. While I was in the hospital room with her I started filling out job applications, wholeheartedly thinking they would go nowhere. 

I got my dream job. I went across the country a few weeks later and completed my training before comming back home. The company was sold a few months later. Now, I hate change and so much at once was beyond overwhelming but it turned out great. 

The new company is absolutely amazing and I never thought a company so amazing existed. The CEO even called me on my birthday to say hi. I never even met him.

I am making great money and I absolutely love going to work. I have gotten a good raise and I finally feel like I am needed. Mom made it through and while she still has some health issues shes doing good. 

I have had some personal hiccups (needed brain surgery a few months ago) but my boss was the most understanding person ever. He even texted and wished me luck the day of the surgery. I wasnt sure what the outcome was going to be, but I am back at work and doing amazing (even though I am alittle short on hair at the moment)

Depression is a constant work in progress but this made everything so much better. My therapist and my family have been cheering me on from the sidelines every step of the way. I just needed to tell someone.",21Sep2020,1

11,"Hey what’s up guys, mark fukboi here, I just wanted share my experience and give you some personal tips towards starting your ONLINE BUsiNESS and making up to 6 FIgURes per month and even 7 figures per month. First I wanted to share my 3 most valuable tips. 

1# give me your fucking money now 

Nah man what I actually do is that I’m no experienced professional in Shopify or blockchain I only know very little but I sure in the hell don’t portray it that way. What I do is basically sell people there dreams, of becoming a high status alpha male individual and trick innocent people to give me thousands of dollars to tell them things which they think are valuable and will completely change there life but actually in the end does absolutely nothing in appliance. Doesn’t matter whether there minors or not, I will steal the kids money too if there parents are willing to pay.

I say also you gotta grind like crazy grind like grind and because I work 140 hours per week and am on Adderall, it means I’m a better person than you, as I work harder hahaha! and because if you want to be successful you can’t sleep sleep is for the weak that’s why I, every night I zap my balls with a taser to keep me up, meanwhile listening to motivational videos on YouTube telling me how short life is. Yeah I don’t care all those studies that say how Alzheimer’s disease is associated with no sleep I don’t care I’m one of those people that only need 4 hours of sleep, cause I am choosen.

Also fam, listen those pictures I take on Instagram, with celebrities I only do that to make me seem more creditable on my Instagram, cause the sad truth is nobody knows who I am, so I actively seek out celebrities and pay thousands of dollars to attend events so I can just meet real famous people just so I can take a picture next to them to seem more creditable than I actually am. The moment I’m done with them they forgot me instantly as they know I’m only interested in them for my own agenda and business which is kinda sad and pathetic that I’m building my own worth based on people I just have met and have no real relationship towards rather an actual product.

Also what’s a public key again? yeah if you also want to learn how to trade bitcoins let me know, I specialize in technical analysis and can reach you how to invest in obscure shit coins that are actually just pump in dump schemes that one of my friends devised so we can actually just steal all your money! Or worse get you involved in a total ponzi scheme that we’re not even aware is one, cause we’re all fucking idiots, who don’t actually know shit about how blockchain works.

One of my favorite, activity is also flexing cause I’m rich look at me I made it in life!!!! I also have a ton of girls, that are actually just gold diggers, cause that’s how masculine I am and successful I’m living the good life flying on private jets etc. I say I’m humble but I really like showcasing my ten diamond watches every 15 minutes on Instagram, as motivation and proof that I made it. I am a flexer I knew Steve Jobs, and fucking Donald trump, he called me just five hours ago, I’m really high status you guys. 

Also eccomerce yeah I lie a lot I wrote a bunch of fake stories and studies online about how this product is so good when in actuality I don’t know whether it works or what it does which is most likely some boot leg knock off from China or Russia. Yeah I don’t care, cause even if it’s something like pharmaceuticals I don’t care who I sell it too or don’t know what I’m doing like whether there are certain precautions I should mentioned towards who I’m selling to online. Cause if they die or get hurt I don’t care, I just make more money and it’s the pharmaceutical company that gets sued not me, even though I am lying to you about how it will make you life better, and am responsible for misinforming you I still don’t care. 

Yeah also that timer you see on so many stores saying how there’s like only 5 left, it’s all bs, including everything, basically it’s all bullshit, just so I can feel a little less insecure about myself cause I want to be a high status individual that is a multi billionaire, who is remembered as the GOAT.

So yeah that’s me mark fukboi if any y’all would like would like to sign up for my course and learn about Shopify go here.

13,"Idk why but I just needed to tell someone. Last night for the first time in ages I got 8 hours of sleep in. Since the beginning of this year my sleep patterns have been horrible. I work overnight 2 days every week, on top of that I procrastinate on my school work so much that I have to pull All-nighters at least twice a week. 

This has resulted in poor mental health and even problems with my family. Most days I am awake when my family are asleep and asleep when they're awake. This has made me absent from the real World and almost depressed. I've felt horrible that while everyone is out there working hard, I am sleeping like a pig.

Last night, however, I slept at exactly 10pm. I planned to wake in an hour knowing that I wouldnt be able to fall asleep during the night hours, but somehow I slept until 6am. Finally the sun-light poured through the windows as I woke. I haven't felt this good in so long. 

Now it is 11:30 and usually I would still be sleeping, due to wake up in another 3-4 hours. I feel so good knowing that its still morning and i've spent half my day doing things other than sleeping.",21Sep2020,1

In the ted talk the woman spoke about how people are inherently worthy but if everyone has inherent worthiness wouldn’t that make it kind of meaningless? Society determines what makes people worthy based on so many different things that I think some could agree that there are people out there that aren’t worthy. Am I(or just people in general) worthy just because I am alive or am I worthy because I do/am XYZ? Am I making sense? Idk. What do you think makes someone worthy?

30,"I've been talking to this guy for a few weeks. At first, he seemed okay. I mean, we were just friends. We'd talk on Snapchat. 

He told me he had a girlfriend back in April. I didn't really text him much due to I mean, why text him? I didn't know him irl. I figured we'd matched on some dating app at some points. 

He would always want to come to my house to spend the night, and I always said no. Why would he want that? Wouldn't it be weird? Made me feel weird. How would his girlfriend feel?

Like I said, I'd never met him in person. 

Well, jump to present day. We started talking a few weeks ago. He said he was single and hadn't had a gf in a long time. I honestly question the said girlfriend in April even existed based off of his conversations with me and what I could dig online. 

At first he seemed nice. I wasn't sure about a relationship, but said we could talk. 

He lives close to three hours away so we couldn't just quickly visit. 

With my schedule, I figured just planning a day to hang would be best. 

I texted him one night about maybe going to get dinner one night. It was around midnight I guess when I texted him. 

He was angry I wouldn't jump in the car and drive 2 1/2 hours to see him. I explained I had work and school the next day and could maybe that weekend. He kept pressuring me to just come now. 

But that's too far, and I'd be exhausted. I explained I really wanted to hang, but maybe wait a few days. 

That was weird. He went on and on about how hurt and let down he was. I barely knew him. I've dealt with shady people and bad guys. (I've been raped and almost sex trafficked before). I didn't want to go somewhere with someone I've never met in the middle of night and I had things to do the next day. 

He was possesssive. If I didn't text back right away, he'd get frustrated and go on and on about communication. 

Those kind of behaviors push me away. He constantly pressured me to drive down and see him. I said no. If he wanted to hangout so bad, he could come to my town and we'd grab dinner. He said no. No. 

I have health issues. An autoimmune disorder. I had a really bad flare up this weekend. I was shaky, weak, fatigued and didn't feel safe to drive. I'm not medicated rn due to my endocrinologist failing to prescribe me more meds and won't answer my emails/calls (working on that) but I really wasn't feeling well. 

He wasn't very understanding. I understand he's frustrated. But I'm not making my illness up. And really that was one little thing after another. 

Only one ish week of talking and he's constantly getting mad at me for not replying fast enough, judging my friendships, and trying to Guilt me into driving down to see him. 

I texted him tonight to say I wasn't interested in pursuing a possible relationship. Just lost feelings. 

He got really mad at me. I had a friend help me compose a message and I really tried to be a nice as possible. 

Am I jerk? I've maybe cut one other guy off. I never would've been happy with him. Felt like it was for the best.",21Sep2020,1

I can’t handle the whiplash from your sudden mood changes.

One minute, you’re screaming that I’m about to be homeless and I need to shut the fuck up and get the hell out of YOUR apartment. You put your hands around my neck as if to choke me, but you don’t press down. You’ve never struck me, you just keep saying you want to... until the next minute. 

&amp;nbsp; 

The next minute, you’re in the shower with me, hugging me, saying “I’m sorry for being a butt.” You’re affectionate enough that it resuscitates me back into this routine. Then it carries on. 

&amp;nbsp; 

You joke about hiding my medications. You tell me that sometimes you’re quiet because you resent me and you don’t want to go off on me and say something you’ll regret - as if the cold shoulder doesn’t sting already. 

&amp;nbsp; 

You say you think about breaking up with me because I leave a mess around the house, when your office area is packed to the brim with fastfood bags and soda cans. You say that *I’M* the problem.

&amp;nbsp; 

I’m the problem.

I’m the problem.

I’m the problem.

&amp;nbsp; 

I’m a stranger around your mother’s precious child, and she would drown me to save you if need be. You said that to me so randomly, and I asked Reddit if I was overreacting. Then I decided to tell YOU how I felt, and you just said:

&amp;nbsp; 

“You’re a lovely girl, but you’re still a stranger around her child. I’m not joking when I’d say she’d drown you to save me.” 

&amp;nbsp; 


There was no: “Oh, that’s a hyperbole!” 

There wasn’t an “Ah, I didn’t mean it like that.” 

You simply said I was right to be freaked out, because I’m the problematic stranger. Once again, I’m the problem. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Don’t worry, though. I won’t be a problem anymore. I’ll go find a nice tunnel, and make it my home. I’ll be a happy groundhog with her fictional Mr. Darcy, away from all the noise. 

&amp;nbsp; 

I can’t step on any toes inside a tunnel. I can’t burden anyone inside of a tunnel.

It's been a recent trend in today's world that the youth are seeking spiritual awakening. I recently believe to have achieved it at least to an extent and with awakening comes the truth of the world. I am looking for a team of ethical, hopefully ""awakened"" individuals who can help me create the next step for mankind's awakening. I have a plan which I must keep secret to anyone outside of my team. What I really need right now is programmers and coders to help me build a new platform as well as influencers and possible people who have a history in paperwork/lawyers. in reality the plan is going to take help from everyone but to get started we need to discuss.

here are the facts that need to be spread through this mission
1)people are more valuable than money
2)there is a way to achieve harmonic alliance between nations
3)it is possible to make the world a perfect place for everyone in it

I'm 22 and I've been in a relationship for 7 years. My bf is 5 years older. He's an amazing guy and I always knew I wanted him to be my husband. I'm still young to get married but things are heading in that direction. We've been living together for 3 years and recently my bf bought a land where he plans to build a house for us.

We've had some issues throughout the years but were always able to resolve them. We both fight for the relationship because we know we are good together and have been through a lot. We really are best friends.

Even though I thought this confusion won't come anymore, I once again think I've fallen out of love. It has happened before but we were always able to find a reason and worked on it. However, this time it feels different. I don't laugh as much, I don't feel joy, I don't get aroused. Quality time together didn't spark anything, which never happened.

38,"2 years ago, I tried to make a rushed promise to God about not washing a part of my face compulsively. i tried to make the promise in order to force myself stop doing the ocd compulsion.

Days ago, I did a mouthwash and had some foamy liquid on that specific spot of my face that I used to wash compuslively. My ocd started telling me to clean it. I tried to ignore it but it kept insisting.

I was looking myself in the mirror and I think, I decided that I will go to bed like this in order not to break the promise to God. Something felt wrong. I did not like the idea of me keeping my face dirty with foamy liquid just because I am afraid that if I clean it like a normal perrson, it may count as if i am cleaning it as part of the compulsion.

I got angry, and rushly, I swept the foam with my fingers. I freaked. I do not know why I did it. I think, I was trying to be normal and tried to remove the visible dirt off my face in order to go to bed like a normal person. I am not sure. There is a chance that I used that as an excuse to myself in order to clean my face as part of the compulsion and NOT because I wanted to be normal.

I do not know! I am confused. All these thinking lasted about 8 seconds? Subconsciously, my ocd was telling me to clean it and I was trying to ignore it due to the fear of the promise. At that second, it did not seem right to have a foamy liquid on my face on purpose. So, I cleaned the visible part. I thought I was cleaning it for a normal reason and not because of my ocd. But it was not that hard for me to go to bed with dirty face. Does this mean that I cleaned my face because of my ocd and used the excuse to myself that I was just, trying to be normal?

I am worrying now because of the promise.",21Sep2020,1
39,"Hey guys.

It’s my girlfriend and I’s 4 year anniversary in a few days, and I really want it to be special, as last year I was in hospital for our anniversary. The issue is, we are both pretty skint, but I’m still determined to make this a special day for her, to make up for last year too.

I have about €20, maybe €30 if I stretch things, to spend on this day. I know I seem vastly under budget, but that’s just the way it is for me recently. 

Originally, I was planning a picnic, but the weather isn’t looking too great. I’d love to bring her out to this restaurant in town, we went there for our one year and she loved it! Only thing is the price. 

Then I was thinking about maybe just having a chill night in, have a few drinks, but that feels like it doesn’t do this day justice, we’ve been together for four years, that’s something to celebrate in my books.

So guys, and tips or ideas for a broke romantic? Thanks",21Sep2020,1
40," Hallo, sorry for bad english, cuz it's gonna be a walloftext. A pathetic wall of text.

I'm a 26yo italian guy. My social life gradually dropped when i was 20yo cuz i started leaving school, hobbies, stuff, and started working (i haven't joined any university), but i have some really good friends i use to meet sometimes.

I'm religious, and i haven't even kissed a girl. I remember i had opportunity to, when i had a decent social life, and i had some girls being very physical with me, but for a lot of reasons i didn't make that stuff go beyond. I like girls a lot, i don't have high standards, i would like to love and pleasure every girl i meet. But ehi, i don't want to, my religious principles are very very important to me. This is not a problem. And i have no problems at all dealing with girls, i'm not that kind of guy who's scared/afraid of dealing with them.

The problem is my self esteem, i have a very ambiguous self esteem. I am not a good looking guy, i mean, more than ugly, i think i am the classic ridicoulous skinny nerdy-looking guy (i'm 1,87h x 73kg, i do a lot of walking and bike to stay so, but i have no muscles) with a face i cannot consider ugly but not even attractive. Ridicoulous is the right word, like i feel, yes. So, the worst problem is not ""i like girls but i cannot touch them because i'm religious"", but ""i like girls but i could not touch them even if i would like to because i'm too ridicoulous to be found attractive and no girl would let me touch her"", so ok, i have no problems talking and dealing with them, but when i think ""she's being kind but she's still probably thinking i'm ugly or ridicoulous"", i feel really bad. But then i think, ""ehi, i had a lot of opportunities when i had a decent social life, and even now girls don't look like they don't wanna deal with me"", ""but ok, they're being kind, really kind, i'm the classic guy who can be considered a good friend but nothing more, and ehi, maybe your memories about those opportunities are fake, they were not opportunities but you read them as they were"".

What's the problem now. My family and people around me are not religious. I get a lot of pressure about my romantic/sexual life. They describe me love and sex like the most wonderful stuff i can even imagine, and, considering how much i like girls, i have no reasons to not trust them, but this make me desider that kind of experience even more, and make me even more frustrated. No one around me seems to accept me like i am. The worst is, when i say ""i'm religious so i don't want to have a romantic/sexual life cuz i don't even want to marry so i have not even a reason to find a potential wife"", people don't accept that, they consider that absurd and anacronistic. When i say, ""i don't even think i could have a romantic/sexual life anyway cuz i'm too ugly or at least ridicoulous-looking for that"", no one trust me, they look at me like ""are you crazy"", or just tell me ""are you crazy, of course you could"", or maybe ""maybe ur not a really beautiful guy, but who is? stop worrying"". A part of me says, ""look, you're the only one who thinks so bad about yourself, stop worrying"", the other part says ""they're being kind, why should they tell you you're that bad? that would be too mean for an average respectful person"".

I'm not an incel or a redpilled, i know a guy like me could find a girl if he would try to, i have no reasons to think i could not. And i see everyday a lot of guys like me having romantic/sexual life. That's an ambiguous feeling, a part of me says ""look, you could have a romantic/sexual life if you would like to"", and another one says ""look, that guy can, you cannot, and don't even think you're like him, you're undervaluing him and overvaluing yourself, you inferior ridicoulous absurd guy"".

That guy found someone who accepts him, wants him, desires him, wanna-do-stuff with him, would i be good enough to find someone myself too? The first part says ""yes"", the second part says ""no"".

So, a part of me says ""u could find a girl if u would like to, u would just need more social life, dude"", and another one says ""not at all, there's no way a ridicoulous-looking guy like u could have a romantic/sexual life, give up, accept that, stop worrying and get some cute hobbies to cope"".

So i am at the pathetic bad selfish point i would like to find and pleasure a girl just to prove to myself i am good enough to love and pleasure a girl, but i don't want to, cuz religious reasons, and even have zero possibilities to even try, cuz social reasons.

So, the first part of me says ""you would success, no doubts, but what then? you would just betray your religious principles for a stupid selfish stuff, and feel weak, and bad"". The second part says, ""nah, you would fail and feel even worse, just forget it and save the few self esteem you still have"".

This stupid stuff obsesses me everyday, cuz as a 27yo who hasn't even kissed a girl, i even have a very high so-called sex-drive. My self-esteem is on a rollercoaster. Some days i feel a cute guy, some other days a ridicoulous guy, some other days even an attractive guy, some other days even a disgusting repellent guy.

This stupid pathetic stuff obsesses me everyday.",21Sep2020,1
41,"I’ve accepted it for the most part. I’ve been in countless one sided situations where the feelings only come from me and I’m not taken seriously. I’m kept a secret. I don’t never been in a relationship.

This has molded me to accept this as standard. I can’t even fathom having a man that loves me, holds my hand in public, posts a picture of me, or invites me to his family’s home for holidays. I don’t even know what real love is and if I’m even capable of offering it at this point. I think about it so often I started to wonder “why I want a relationship? What does anyone even gain from being in a relationship?” Maybe for me I’m just lonely and jealous of seeing everyone my age has atleast had one relationship.

Maybe I’m convinced i won’t find love because at this point I can’t even imagine anyone having eyes for me only. I’ve dealt with guys who don’t want to commit because they’re waiting to see if something better comes along. I can tell their eyes wander in person and on social media.

I act like I don’t care because I don’t want to make a fuss. I kept my mouth shut about things that bother me for so long I don’t know how to properly communicate. I don’t say “I love you” but I’m mouthed the words under my breath during sex once (ugh I know). I was in that “relationshit” for a year. He was the blueprint lol.",21Sep2020,1

46,"
As it stands I'm 18 years, a very introverted person with social anxiety, virgin, never had a girlfriend nor have I ever really wanted one I think. Some have said I am asexual or something but I don't know. I have crushes on people but never sexual. I don't enjoy watching porn but mostly for the taboones of it. I don't find sex in itself hot, but I do find people sexy and hot. I have watched gay and shemale porn and have been intrigued by both, not sure if I'm into to that, or if i just find people in pleasure and having a good time sexy/hot. I've noticed trough my life I have never got to know someone and still thought of them as hot or sexy. I can never imagine my self having sex or any other sexual acts with my crushes. I only find them pretty/ or funny etc. Not sexy. I thought about this and came to the conclusion that the reason I haven't wanted to date anyone is because I feel there would be a clash in desires. From what it seems, I just want a good friend, not a sexual partner, so I don't want to dissapoint anyone. Not sure if that is true, but that's how I make sense of it. Another thing I should make clear is that I have never had a role model for what a good relationship would look like. I have never seen my parents kiss or hug. They barely live together due to my mothers job. I feel this has had a big impact on what I value in a relationship, and the lack of any sexual interactions in the house, as well as the lack of any talk about girlfriends or sex or anything, has caused some of the issues I am having.

50,"My boyfriend cheated on me twice but I still kept talking with him. But I kept doubting him and we fought alot. He at times asked to breakup but we ended up splving things. Yet things were repeating so I finally broke up with him (To which he says he broke up). But he kept calling me every 4-5 days and after a month like this he asked again to be in a relationship with him but next day because of our fight blocked me. Then I blocked him from everywhere else. A week back I unblocked him thinking that everything is sorted now and that chaoter is over. But he called me that day itself and asked to be in a relationship and visited me (We were in ldr). We didn't meet but since that day we started talking daily over calls and he would answer every question I'd ask and do everything I told him to do. He was even ready to let me hack his phone. But yesterday I told him I don't want to talk with him or don't want to be in a relationship with him. After that we didn't talk because his phone got robbed.
Now when I think of everything,I hate myself for letting him do all this with me. I hate myself for letting me treat like I'm a trash. How can I do this to myself. What was I even thinking! He must be so proud of himself thinking that he cheated on me twice, abused me, left me then again blocked me! How to forgive myself for everything and accept this.

52,"But today a fancy scale got here that determines your body fat and composition. Of course these aren’t perfectly accurate but I like having the data. 

I haven’t weighed myself for the fear of obsessing. I’m a numbers person and I love data but it’s a double edged sword because it makes me a lot more likely to obsess. 

I felt okay about myself lately. Clothes mostly fit and I look okay in pics. 

And then I stepped on the scale. In front of my boyfriend (this would have never happened before) and all my data loaded in the app. 

And I just sat there staring at the number that was only 3lbs higher than my lowest weight in 4 years. I haven’t dieted properly, we have been eating a lot of takeout, and I’ve definitely had a binging problem in the past (ok and present)

And I just don’t know what to think. I’m happy. I feel okay. And for the first time in my life I don’t feel like the scale is dangerous. I don’t feel like I have a problem or disordered eating. I just feel.... okay. 

And that’s a wonderful feeling. 

Of course now I gotta beat the high score for myself and work harder at the gym and be better but my god, this journey never started with “being okay” it was always traumatic to step on the scale and how upset I was, was directly proportionate to the effort I’d go on to put in.

59,"I haven't spoken about this to anyone. I am a 18yr old guy. When I was 6, I was abused by my cousin. Who I guess, is 3 or 4years older than me. I was raised by my grandparents at my hometown. Since most of my cousins used to spend most of their time at my grandparents, we used to play together a lot. At the age of 6, I found some sexually explicit contents which belonged to my uncle. I kept quite after finding it. Soon after, I was exposed to pornographic content, which at that age, I had no idea what it is. One things led to another, and very soon, I was sexually used by my cousin. I didn't speak about this happening to anyone else. I kept quiet, since I was young and mostly had a hard time understanding things around me. 

When I turned 7, I was moved in with my mom. I was sexually abused even there by my cousin who belonged to my fathers side. Even then, I didn't understand what is happening. I was unable to question their actions towards me. When I was almost 8, we moved to city, with my siblings. We have been staying here in the city for 12yrs now. I have visited my hometown 2 or 3 times. I keep distance from my cousin. We have had no interaction in these 12 year. I just avoid them when I see them sometimes during the visit. 

I understood these when I started living in the city. When I was far from it all. I grew understanding of other things. I still never talk about this to anyone because I don't have the gut.

75,"This year has been amazing for me. I know how that sounds with COVID and everything, but I don’t have a whole lot of people in my personal life to tell this to. So I figured I’d post it.

I met an amazing guy a little over a year ago. He’s the first person I’ve met who understands how I was raised, and the first person I’ve connected to on that level. Thanks to COVID and unemployment funds, we were able to move in with my roommate and are about to get a kitten, alongside our two current cats!

I lost my job, but I got it back. It’s at a large bookstore chain. I got a second job at a soap/candle retailer as well, which provides me with extra spending money. My hours aren’t as high as they used to be, so I still qualify for partial unemployment and have been receiving it.

The extra funds from my state hit in an hour. I get to go out with my boyfriend on a legitimate date day. We’ll be able to splurge a bit and have a nice day out, maybe grab some food. He’s been so incredibly supportive lately. He’s been struggling to get a job, so while I work and do school, he’s been helping double time with both supporting me emotionally and housework/cooking. It’s put a lot of stress on him, so I’m happy to be able to treat him today.

I’m able to get things I’ve needed for a while— a school textbook, a decent phone, a new bra...we won’t have to worry about not being able to pay rent (again, he’s out of a job). And that’s just the finances. We’re getting a car! It’ll be my first car, my friend is selling it to us.

I had a rough go emotionally for a little while there. I have suspected Bipolar disorder, which leads to extreme feelings of guilt and associated paranoia/delusions. Most of these are directed towards my relationship, as it’s something I worry about the most (just because it matters so much). After a long talk with my boyfriend, and some much needed advice, I’ve mostly stabilized.

We finally found out why my sister has been, simply put, horrible. She has a brain defect. I know that sounds terrible at first, but this defect has been present since birth. She has half a pituitary gland. We’ll finally be able to make sure she gets the treatment she needs, now that we know what’s wrong.

I’ve also reconnected with friends, kept up with my schoolwork, and done wonderfully at work.

Everything combined, I’m the happiest I’ve been in my life. Things are still stressful, but overall, I don’t think I’d trade anything I had right now. This is the first time I’ve genuinely been content with how things are working out. I just wanted to share it!",21Sep2020,1
76,"
I realized that I struggle with codependency and people pleasing. I often lose myself in relationships or certain environments and “my personality” is just traits I saw in other people that I picked up and copied. I feel like I’m a fraud. And also it’s really hard for me to Acknowledge that I’m my own separate person from other people. 

I don’t feel like a person but more like an alien observing the things happening around me. Growing up I was taught to hide parts of myself because I felt like they were unacceptable and unlovable. For as long as I remember I’ve always been focused on getting better and doing more because I never felt complete or content with the person that I am. The only time I feel like I can be truly my “self” is when I’m alone. 

I carry around so much guilt and fear but I don’t know how or why. The concept of self awareness terrifies me because I know that if I look deeply within myself I’ll find something I don’t like. when things start to come up like unwanted feelings or thoughts about the person I am and the way I carry myself I panic and overly intellectualize what’s happening until I suppress those thoughts and feelings believing that I worked through them (self-disillusionment)

I admire people who are able to share themselves effortlessly, who seem to be confident in the person that they are (self-expression, something I’m not too good at).

85,"  Looking into clearing my music library since I haven't listened to some of it in over a decade and the only real reason any of that existed was pretty much just to be annoying. A few songs on full albums are actually pretty good so I never deleted most of it. I've been collecting music on my computers for over 20 years now, and I usually trim away the things I don't enjoy or wouldn't want to hear too often. Angelspit is pretty good as a musical group but their lyricist should be in therapy and Genitorturers... well... Don't get me started on them. Look up the kind of stuff they do at their live shows. Everyone has a hobby, I suppose.

  Music is more than what we can get from lyrics and I often listen to vocal singers who don't even use words. At times, I also find it enjoyable to listen to instrumentals. I'm one of those people who honestly couldn't care less about what you mean in your music because it's my choice to give it whatever power or meaning it deserves from me. How can you evolve musically or otherwise, without learning and accepting other people's experiences.

  I know Catholics who listen to Slipknot and they regularly employ mildly Satanic themes in their shows and music. I say mildly because I've only seen a few pentagrams around them and none of them are surrounded by a serpent. The lyrics do tend to speak (literally) for themselves.

  Everyone should open themselves up to new music and if you hear someone listening to what you don't like, you should find out what brought them to enjoy it. There's always a good chance they have a story behind it. I often tie the media I favor to memories with the people I spent time with while taking it in. There's an equal chance it's the same with movies and television.

  There are movies that mean a lot to me but nothing to anyone else. My favorite movie series is and will always be The Matrix, but the first time I ever saw it, well... part of it, was on my friend's dad's work laptop (The first laptop I ever actually saw and I was amazed) since his dad was watching TV after a tough day at work. He was a cop, so best he get the TV... The battery died partially through the movie so we went upstairs and if I remember correctly, we played hockey in the street. I suppose we didn't play... I sat in the goal while he did everything he could to get the puck past me. We did that quite a bit since he actually played for a team. (His dad was awesome by the way, seriously, try cucumber slices and Catalina salad dressing, you'll thank me and by extension, him)

  Surround yourself with good people all your life. Give yourself some good experiences. No matter what, be true to yourself and treat people right. Those are the only truths you should ever worry about. What you want to listen to is your choice, nobody elses. Don't force it on anyone, but please do try to entice them with good stuff. We need to keep music alive, Beethoven and Bach will live forever, as should The Beatles and Rolling Stones. Modern music is less an artform and more a way to get paid, so please share what you love.",21Sep2020,1

91,"Numerous people do feel lost and have the tendency to search for a structure (enrolling in university, getting a regular job and progressing within a company’s  organisation or even creating a family) and will stick with it, no matter what, in the hope that it will give them an identity and a purpose. And then there’s those who would try going to uni or try a job, but will then find the endeavour not suited to their needs and carry on looking for their thing. What is it that the first group lack? What do you attribute this drive/restlessness of the second group to? 

Is it simply a mix of self-esteem and self-awareness: 
• Low - “If I stick with this uni course MAYBE the inspiration, productivity and drive will come to me! I just need to carry on, no matter how much I am struggling”
• Healthy - “This is not the uni course for me, I know what I need and I am not going to find it here”

How do you cultivate a Growth Mindset that may allow you to be your person, rather than being shaped by those structures available to us if we so decide to let them shapes us?

96,"Dear X,

I love you. I know you love me too. If we didn't then this wouldn't hurt so fucking much. It's unfair that life gives us each other, two people willing to do anything for the other, but in the end gets the last laugh because that isn't enough. We can do anything for each other but we can't change who we truly are - and through opening up and being so supportive we eventually grew to realize that we weren't meant to be together forever. In a way it's tragic, and in another it's beautiful. To have opened myself up to someone completely and be vulnerable is something I didn't know how to do until I met you.

When I met you I was working part-time at a bar and getting drunk every night I didn't work, sometimes even when I was working. I was scared of moving forward, terrified of taking another chance on things, and then you came along. Little by little I spent less time at the bar and more over at your place, more out in the woods hiking, more time spent doing things that were good for me and my future. You helped me get started with therapy again, you were beside me when I didn't see any way possible of finishing my college application, and you held my hand as we walked to my first class. You were always there. Always supportive. Always wanting what was best for me.

I wish I could point to something you or I did that was truly wrong, something to get angry about, but there isn't. The reality of it is that two people who truly want the best for each other can't prevent the other from being themselves and can't hold on so tight as to not let them lead the life they're meant for. How lucky I am to have had someone in my life who showed me unconditional love and that we must find it within ourselves as well.

Today it's still raw. I'm sure it'll get easier but right now it's not the time to hear that. I've been trying to focus on classes and on the basics to just get by, but so much reminds me of you. There's so much good to look back on. So much to be truly grateful for. The singing in the car, the hiking trips, calling you ""mi amour"", you eating all the chocolate chips before I could use them, waking me up with breakfast, me still trying to figure out your sense of humor because you'd laugh at the most random things, always somehow being right - you sure would make a good lawyer. 

There's so many little memories that I have of you and I see how much they've influenced my life. They're everywhere - and now they'll slowly drift from thought as new ones emerge. But I promise I won't truly forget them. I will never forget how I got to where I am because of you. I will never forget that wherever I end up is built on the foundations you helped me build.

You are an amazing person, X. I am grateful to have known you and experience everything we have. I wouldn't change a second of it. I wish you the absolute best in life going forward - knowing you I have no doubt you'll succeed with that.

With all my love,

101,"Hey what’s up guys, mark fukboi here, I just wanted share my experience and give you some personal tips towards starting your ONLINE BUsiNESS and making up to 6 FIgURes per month and even 7 figures per month. First I wanted to share my 3 most valuable tips. 

1# give me your fucking money now cause I don’t know what in the actual hell im doing.

Nah man what I actually do is that I’m no experienced professional in Shopify or blockchain I only know very little but I sure in the hell don’t portray it that way. What I do is basically sell people there dreams, of becoming a high status alpha male individual and trick innocent people to give me thousands of dollars to tell them things which they think are valuable and will completely change there life but actually in the end does absolutely nothing in appliance. Doesn’t matter whether there minors or not, I will steal the kids money too if there parents are willing to pay.

I say also you gotta grind like crazy grind like grind and because I work 140 hours per week and am on Adderall, it means I’m a better person than you, as I work harder hahaha! and because if you want to be successful you can’t sleep sleep is for the weak that’s why I, every night I zap my balls with a taser to keep me up, meanwhile listening to motivational videos on YouTube telling me how short life is. Yeah I don’t care all those studies that say how Alzheimer’s disease is associated with no sleep I don’t care I’m one of those people that only need 4 hours of sleep, cause I am choosen.

Also fam, listen those pictures I take on Instagram, with celebrities I only do that to make me seem more creditable on my Instagram, cause the sad truth is nobody knows who I am, so I actively seek out celebrities and pay thousands of dollars to attend events so I can just meet real famous people just so I can take a picture next to them to seem more creditable than I actually am. The moment I’m done with them they forgot me instantly as they know I’m only interested in them for my own agenda and business which is kinda sad and pathetic that I’m building my own worth based on people I just have met and have no real relationship towards rather an actual product.

Also what’s a public key again? yeah if you also want to learn how to trade bitcoins let me know, I specialize in technical analysis and can reach you how to invest in obscure shit coins that are actually just pump in dump schemes that one of my friends devised so we can actually just steal all your money! Or worse get you involved in a total ponzi scheme that we’re not even aware is one, cause we’re all fucking idiots, who don’t actually know shit about how blockchain works.

One of my favorite, activity is also flexing cause I’m rich look at me I made it in life!!!! I also have a ton of girls, that are actually just gold diggers, cause that’s how masculine I am and successful I’m living the good life flying on private jets etc. I say I’m humble but I really like showcasing my ten diamond watches every 15 minutes on Instagram, as motivation and proof that I made it. I am a flexer I knew Steve Jobs, and fucking Donald trump, he called me just five hours ago, I’m really high status you guys. 

Also eccomerce yeah I lie a lot I wrote a bunch of fake stories and studies online about how this product is so good when in actuality I don’t know whether it works or what it does which is most likely some boot leg knock off from China or Russia. Yeah I don’t care, cause even if it’s something like pharmaceuticals I don’t care who I sell it too or don’t know what I’m doing like whether there are certain precautions I should mentioned towards who I’m selling to online. Cause if they die or get hurt I don’t care, I just make more money and it’s the pharmaceutical company that gets sued not me, even though I am lying to you about how it will make you life better, and am responsible for misinforming you I still don’t care. 

Yeah also that timer you see on so many stores saying how there’s like only 5 left, it’s all bs, including everything, basically it’s all bullshit, just so I can feel a little less insecure about myself cause I want to be a high status individual that is a multi billionaire, who is remembered as the GOAT.

So yeah that’s me mark fukboi if any y’all would like would like to sign up for my course and learn about Shopify go here.

102,"I'm not suicidal. I never have been. I'd gladly choose nonexistence over this existence, though. Day to day basic functioning has been extremely challenging for me for over seven years now. I got too high on weed with some friends and experienced extreme panic with an out of body experience. What followed from that was a laundry list of phobias and anxieties that resulted in me being stuck in my house for over a year, unable to leave because of the sheer terror it brings. It's as if every bad sensation was multiplied by 1000 and every good sensation was divided by 1000. I've learned to cope and have accomplished a lot in my life since being able to leave the house. It was still a struggle, but I tried really fucking hard and finished college at a school with a degree that I'd never in a million years think I'd ever get. I officially graduated 10 days ago now. In my head, in the years leading up to graduation, I was expecting this moment to be a happy one. The little happy feeling I'd get when the semester\quarter would end and I'd have a few weeks of a break before the next round of classes started was surely going to pale in comparison to actually getting my degree. But nope. I'm incredibly unhappy despite graduating. Some horrible life events that have occurred in the last 3-4 months have really fucked me up. And I'm already fucked up. I hope it gets better.

I haven't, fortunately, serious health problems, I have a caring family and on the financial side I am provided for by my parents at the best that they can (wich I am infinitely grateful for, and wich also makes me feel all the more guilt).

I recently managed to enroll in the university that I dreamed for since I was little (Medicine), but it wasn't at all what I expected. At the moment, I feel lost, afraid of what's to come, guilty and overall very demoralised. I haven't many friends, but I care about the ones that I have. In the last months my mounting anxiety and sadness brought me to close up more and more, and still I have to battle with the vicious thought that thay don't care about me and that, at the end of the day, I am nothing more than a lonely, sad shell of what I aspired to be.

105,"Every muscle in my body hurts but it was worth it. I wanted to prove to myself that I could, as I am very out of shape. I'm not really overweight (maybe by about 5-10 lbs depending on the day) but I am about as far from being athletic as you can get. I've been really self conscious about my body and weight lately. It doesn't help that I have a husband who is incredibly fit without ever going to the gym or trying at all. And his definition of ""not fat"" is being completely fit with basically 0 body fat. He tells me I look great, but technically by his definition I would be considered fat. Now, he has his own body image issues stemming from his crazy definition, and I know that he's the one that's wrong there but sometimes I can't help but let it affect me. That plus my dad calling me lazy and a marshmallow when I was growing up it's been a struggle.

106,"Hey guys! 

First time posting ever so v sorry for any formatting badness haha.

I don't really have anyone/anywhere to get this off my chest so i thought why not try here?

Anyway, i'll try and keep this short but basically i've suffered a couple traumas over the past two years from un-hanging my sister to my best friend killing himself and I know it's a bit stupid of me but I've never had any help throughout any of this. My parents generally had a sort of 'when the goings get tough the tough get going' attitude or blamed me for it and never really reached out or offered me support. I can understand why, i mean it must be impossible knowing what to do in those situations as parents so the best you can prolly do is use what you know/have learnt from your own childhood, right? 

I'll be blunt and say i've considered suicide a few times. you can guess how that turned out haha.  It might be weird asffff but honestly i kinda prefer having hard shit thrown onto me, i guess it's a way to kinda prove to myself how capable or strong i am and that despite everything that's wrong with me and the mistakes i've made i'm capable enough to get through anything on my own. 

I think it's weird how people consider attention-seeking a negative thing. As humans, we all need attention, it's a pretty basic need and yet we all go ape-shit crazy whenever we see someone clearly trying to fulfill this necessity in what they find to be the most reasonable way for their situation. 

sorry for rambling on so much but i get off-topic pretty easy and zone out even quicker haha.

I've been repeatedly told to seek professional medical help. Each time i've either rejected that, convinced myself otherwise, or just carried on as if they hadn't said so. even when that person is myself. hell i was in a further maths class last week and one of my episodes hit really hard to the point where i was bout to just straight up leave the room and walk away somewhere quiet no questions asked, and in that moment i'd told myself i'd call the doctor and get an appointment straight after the lesson. Half an hour passes, class ends, i walk out, go home, and do nothing about it. Weird isn't it?

Memory is another big issue for me. I had an accident during lockdown where i'd been drunk skating, slamed my head at the skatepark giving myself a concussion, and then dropped acid when i got home. Ngl, that was the worst bloody night of my life. 12hrs straight talking smack, 30 degree C heat, no food or water. Ended up asking my best friend out lol. (was a no for anyone wondering). Next day i was just sat in my room staring at a room tryna process wtf had just happened. wasn't great for my mental health. 

Following that was when i started acting out for the first time, telling close friends i hate them one minute, and apologising profusely the next. They eventually just got fed up with me and i was lonely for a while. 

There's a lot more to my story like i skipped out a ton of shit but tbh i think this is long enough already ygm.

I remember nights when I would stay up fueled by caffeine, painting, and reading a favorite book on the couch. I can't even bring myself to want to read a book anymore let alone paint a picture. Whenever I pass a crafts store I momentarily get excited before remembering that even if I did buy art supplies I wouldn't use them. Same with crochet.

The reason for all of this is my recent break-up with the love of my life. We were together for 3 and a half years and she helped me so much to get my shit together, she was loving and always there for me, but right now I just feel lonely, I want her by my side all the time, because she gives me this great warmth. I’m 25 and this is the first time I’m in love. It just hurts so much when I think of all the beautiful memories, when I wake up in the middle of the night or in the morning and I’m just alone, I don’t have her by my side and it’s so hard to process that this is the end.

Worth mentioning is that we ended everything pretty nicely, there was no big fight or anything like that and we still call each other everyday like best friends (so it shouldn’t hurt so much) but it does, because I want to be with her. (it’s a long distance situation right now and I don’t even know when I will see her because of this Covid situation).

Words can’t express how much I love her, how much I like to spend time with her, I miss seeing her face before falling asleep and when I wake up.

To preface, I am a 17-year-old, pretty introverted fellow. I’ve gone to the same suburban school for 14 of those 17 years. There was a long period in my life (all throughout elementary and middle school) where I had 0 friends, and not a soul to talk to. For almost all of those years, my class consisted of maximum 20 kids (pretty small, I know). Maybe I never fit in with those 20 kids, or maybe I was annoying, or maybe it’s all due to the fact that my parents never had me go on play dates or go to birthday parties—whatever the case was, my social circle for those 10-odd years consisted of an upright piano. It’s all I ever knew, after all, so I rarely felt badly my circumstances when I was a kid. After a certain point it wasn't like I even *wanted* to talk to people; I was just accustomed to the solitude (as a result, I'm *very* soft-spoken).

Anywho, freshman year rolls around (class size increases to 120) and this one outgoing dude reaches out to me (joking about whatever happened in class, that kind of thing). It was actually a weird experience, but we later became friends. Throughout freshman and sophomore year I completely opened up to the world. I was enjoying myself a lot—finding out how to communicate and developing some better verbal habits and whatnot. I hung out with a group of kids for the first time last October (and the month after that I even had a fling). Around then I met this one person \[17F\], who I'll call F. Me and her got along really well—plus we had all the same interests, favorite artists, etc. Whoopsidaisy, accidentally fall in love with F—fast forward I'm in relatively serious relationship with her—fast forward and F puts all of that to a not-very-amicable end in June. I was, and still am, pretty devastated from that whole situation. The past year has been quite the rollercoaster. 

Once this relationship ended (and after a pretty miserable remainder of the summer) I returned to school completely and utterly deflated. Since then, I have absolutely no interest in socializing with peers, and I merely exist from day to day. I spend my study halls alone at the piano, and I don't even bother getting to know any of the kids in my classes. I lack even the smallest bit of motivation to go and talk to someone about *something*. No one I used to know reaches out very much, and when they do I don't even want to entertain any conversation. There were a few mutual friends between me and F that have also drifted out of my life. I'm alone all day, every day (with the exception of my family), and although I hate it I have no real motivation to change it. I have become extremely awkward once again, and I can barely hold up a subject even if I tried. I feel like any trace of passion in me has left; everything feels rather dull. I feel like I lost my personality, at least the personality I uncovered during my first 2 years of high school. 

Today this one 10th grader I used to be friends with (peer tutoring for his math work, cool dude) saw me in the restrooms: ""Yooo OP it's been a while, what's up."" I froze up, glanced sideways to where he was, said ""yeah,"" and got out of there. I felt like a dick, but even worse I felt terrible about myself, because I wished I had more to say. He reminded my of an incredibly happy time in my life that seems to be gone permanently. Perhaps F having been so involved in the time where I was my happiest self meant that the severed relationship would also sever that part of me. I can't bear to think about living the rest of high school like this, and I need some input. 

**TL;DR** \- After opening up and falling in love and two years of new happiness, I am now completely unenthused about life, and have socially isolated myself",21Sep2020,1
123,"Before the Bohemian Club announces exactly who I am. Here's my story. Here's my original post about what the Bohemian Club does.

&gt;The Bohemian Club is a group of business elites, company men, and politicians that worship god and the devil. for a myriad of reasons. They’re the evilest people alive because they sex-traffick kids in elephant suits. They are a secret society about putting people in elephant suits, and they claim that god shows up to authorize these people for sex. Poor unfortunate souls that will never see heaven or hell (so they claim) that will only see non-existence because they’re so cursed.  
&gt;  
&gt;I never was a member, but I heard from an ex-member that there are real meetings and fake meetings. The fake meetings are all about how they find children who were put in elephant suits, and “heal” them with sex with research ""provided by god"" (just quoting him here) that children in elephant suits need sex in order to leave their elephant suits.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's no evidence to support this that children who were once in elephant suits need sex or that they choose not to leave their elephant suits once they have been freed. There is some evidence to suggest that that these people who are freed from elephant suits do believe their hero's to be gods after they have freed them. But there is no evidence to suggest that these children need to be walked in elephants or that they need a special orphanage like the Bohemian Club suggests.  
&gt;  
&gt;Above the door of the “Bohemian Grove”, their campground, they do not walk children in elephant suits. “Weaving spiders do not come here” literally translates to “it’s ungentlemanly to bring your kids in elephant suits here.” But I believe that they're hiding a lot underground there and that government is so concerned with an issue that doesn't really exist because somebody might have actually appeared to these people.  
&gt;  
&gt;To be honest, I don't believe in heaven or hell, but with how confused everyone is about this issue... the issue of putting and taking out people in elephant suits, I think we should be more concerned about Coronavirus and/or the upcoming election.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let's elect someone whose not concerned with a nonissue (since most of these children that are put in elephant suits. Either are killed or just simply not found)

Now here's my story.

My father, David Ortiz (not the baseball player) - put me in an elephant suit in the years 2003 and 2005 when I was 7 and 9 years old. I was in my basement for a fucking year in 2005. The Bohemian Club actually does find kids who are in elephants suits, but the unfortunate truth is that the Bohemian club has a catch - ""the Bohemian Clubs whore"" who was always me and I am their best kept secret.

When children find out the truth about the Bohemian Club and they lie about ever being abused or in an elephant like codename ""Billy"" thought I had, they have these children molested constantly and put them in an elephant suit for a day to show them how ""rude"" they are. 

This is what happened to me, the only difference is, is that the next year? I was in an elephant suit for a year because my father had figured out just how laid I'd gotten as a child member of the Bohemian Club.",21Sep2020,1
124,"* 6 months ago I lost a friend of 15+ years because I like to go outside sometimes, and they wouldn't stop telling me that I would be responsible for the deaths of hundreds to thousands to hundreds of thousands of people if I continued to go outside during the COVID-19 pandemic (I've never tested positive for COVID-19).
* 6 months ago, I left my primary friend group because one of the friends in that group jokingly made racist, and misogynistic red pill comments all of the time, and, I didn't know that he was trolling - I lost 5 of my closest friends that day - some of the greatest friends I've ever had.
* 3 months ago, an ex-girlfriend tried to kill themselves twice within a span of two weeks - in her first attempt, she begged police to kill her for 30 minutes before lunging for a knife, nearly stabbing me, and being hauled off to a local psychiatric hospital - in her second attempt, she nearly bled out, and has lacerations all over her legs - it kills me to see them every time I see her.
* 2 months ago, I broke up with someone, and they sent me the most vile, hate-filled messages that I've ever read in my life - they're still harassing me to this day, and, earlier today, they sent me an e-mail where they threatened to call the police if I ever visited a local nature preserve ever again.
* 3 weeks ago, my mother told me that she thought that I was conspiring against her because I didn't understand her side of the story in a conflict that she was having with her neighbor - I didn't ""understand"" her side of the story because she wouldn't tell me what was going on.",21Sep2020,1
126,"Some of us tackle problems head-on while others take time to get out of the bed after breaking down the previous night for failing to face their problems. It's belittling to know that even at helping yourself you fail. It's the reality people like me run away from. Knowing what's wrong is entirely separate from doing something to fix it, and it's the latter that's incredibly painful and embarrassing, so much that you keep it locked down and hidden before you head out to work, to uni, or to someplace so you can momentarily distract yourself.

With the pandemic, we're forced to deal with this harsh reality. It's not the arbitrary, knee-jerk response others say to us about how ""reality is harsh"". It is harsh, but we all know reality is a lot bigger than that. While some consider the pandemic as the time ""to get back to their old hobbies or create new ones"", some ""to reconnect with their loved ones"", there are people like me who's left to our own devices to deal with whatever we have kept hidden, only to fail again with no option to take a breather somewhere. It's worse for introverted people who go through this kind of ordeal. While it's true that ""introversion"" will make it seem like the pandemic to be appealing, it just makes it worse. That peaceful feeling of being on your own is also a burden and a curse because yourself right now is a living testimony that you failed at helping it and since being an introvert doesn't matter when you're working or a student, it's inevitable to go out, and in the process distract yourself somehow. The walls, the bed, the pillows I hugged tightly--all that's inside my room will now see me again breaking down more frequently. 

Currently, games and books are the only thing that keep me somewhat sane. Working from home has put a heavier pressure on me which I must accept, otherwise I won't be able to provide sustenance to myself. The pandemic has brought us closer towards ourselves (I meant not to discredit the hardships of those who work in the frontlines), and sometimes our self, is the thing some of us are running away from.

I live in essentially the most pitiful and turn-off of a situation as you could imagine. I'm so undesirable that I haven't wanted to be wanted in a couple years. I'd just be annoyed with anyone who pretends to look past all that. 

Somehow I know how to change myself, but I'm either incapable of it or unwilling to make something less pathetic out of myself. I don't know which. I've gotten so many chances with circumstances that are better than I deserve, but I conscientiously choose to keep fucking up my life.

130,"I think maybe we all need to admit more openly when someone has hurt our feelings online. For the sake of coming together and listening more. We’re so hostile and divisive on the internet right now- “if you disagree with me you’re a MORON! Let’s argue about it!”

And something many of us (me 100%) are guilty of is pretending like that other person is so wrong, so misinformed, so ridiculous, so minuscule, so unimportant that nothing they said could ever hurt us. They’re not important enough. Their words don’t have enough power. We try taking that power away by laughing at them, returning insults, and acting like we’re mentally zen and above being bothered by them.

WHAT IF we instead honestly said “well that really just hurt my feelings and I did take it personally, and I hear your words”. Where would that conversation go? If that person was glad they hurt your feelings do you think they’d be more likely to think about that days later than if it was just an equally harsh sparring match of brutal words? I think so. Not many people who are currently fighting so hard to act like they are right and zen and not bothered by your words and laugh at them are also willing to admit they are trying to hurt you and take pleasure in it. 

I’m going to try this. I’m going to set down my pride and set down my viewpoint in the debate/argument and be willing to openly admit when someone got a punch in and hurt me.

""If *you* could not take things so seriously, your life would be so much lighter.""

Kindly Hello,

I.

I was *actually* feeling lonely today (instead of not feeling alone while mostly always being alone). My external composure is one of solemn and rigid stature, monotone color, and flat action. I have not felt bright, like I was a part of the sun and its beams of light, for a many years. 

I have a difficult time making new friends, I've been sort of the person who was and is always to themselves unless the environment around them is colorful and eventful. I see the issues that I am currently having to do mainly with my immediate environment, that is, living with my parents and working virtually to eventually accumulate enough magic paper to move out and be in an environment to support my social, emotional, and mental improvement. That is where I am currently, stuck between a slave to the system that I secretly despise and actually deciding to live my life the way I want it --&gt; leading to a future where I can benefit others and myself simultaneously.

The reason that the latter option in the previous section is not in the cards at the moment is because where I am living is very expensive. I need ~$2k a month just to pay rent, all other expenses considered I would likely need at least $5k a month to barely support myself, right around the $60k/year salary. Currently I'm making around $36k before taxes and insurance deductions, around $23k salary afterwards. I know I am early in my career, but I am feeling trapped by my reality, and that is something that only leads to more pain. I am getting older and I am watching old college roommates, old high school friends make a life for themselves, and I am sitting here wondering how they got so lucky. Not to say that a happy life doesn't require some bit of luck, because it most certainly does. 

I'm thinking of moving to a better area. Some say I am young and can make some mistakes. Maybe I should take their advice. 

II. 

I hate niggling about little things. I laugh at myself for saying something so foolish as I sit here talking about little things. Maybe I shouldn't be so difficult with myself. We're all just human? 

My family is so boring. In life, in interest, at meals, in a break, it all just gives me stress and anxiety to hear people tangled in their lives with such small and insignificant things! But that also is the point, isn't it? Either everything means something or everything doesn't. It is a fine line, which I guess I do walk. No, that path isn't often fun, but I believe it can be rewarding, the most rewarding. 

III.

Society is dying. 

I dislike any sort of extremism, any sort of rampant emotionality, any blinding and loud squealing. Whilst the mainstream would kindly reply to the squawking and squealing and say, 'good work you, you are beautiful and shitting on the ground, you get free love, care, and a pat on the back.' The loud and urgent make a good story, the blood is fresh in the the mind, the taste is still wet on the lips. 

IV.

Strength. Courage. Mastery

a. Strength - Physical, emotional, mental strength. The ability to withstand and persevere through more than humiliating tasks and still come out on top, at least 5% of the time. 

b. Courage - The Sir Gallant kind.

c. Mastery - Mastery of one's resources. The most prevalent resources being Time (with a big ""T""), Money, and Opportunity.

So far I am none of these things. But to even strive for these masterworks is fine courage if I do say so myself (now being nice). I've only seen my life, since I've actually seen myself, in two shades 1) in an upwards spiral, things going good, happy sometimes, writing down goals, checking off the chores list, making the bed, making the meal prep, going to workout, meeting people, stopping the delusions of grandeur. Or the downwards spiral, and every soul can understand what this could mean - except for those who can't. 

V.

I'm just getting bored and tired of the same old bullshit that is my life, my excuses, my lack of attention, my endless and insatiable quest for the true reality where everything will make sense and will fit into a necessary and tight fitting ""Theory of Everything"", but really plenty of those already exist and I can look them up on Wikipedia, all ending with -ism, -ology, and -religion. 

I think I'm just distressed with the dumbfounding realization that nihilism is actually at the end of the equal sign, in almost every permutation. That if I don't want that to be my answer every single time, some form of spiritualism really is the end all be all - no pun intended. 

VI.

This is what happened to me, the only difference is, is that the next year? I was in an elephant suit for a year because my father had figured out just how laid I'd gotten as a child member of the Bohemian Club.

Wanna know about another secret? ""Healing"" aka adults having sex with kids. It happens in Schools, it happens in churches, it happens  it happens everywhere. They believe that sex is and I'm quoting all of them here ""an essential part of life"" and that ""anyone should be having it.""

The Illuminati does not btw but we'll get to that later. ""Welcome spiders do not come here."" literally means several things to the Bohemian Club but the main thing it means ""we are better than the Illuminati""

The next part you might argue to be hallucinations, and I wonder that a lot, but it must not be. The below is why this post won't ever make the front page and it does discredit the story, but this actually did happen. 

Anyways, when I was in an elephant suit God would gave me one wish after he appeared to me. Only I could see him, and I got that wish to be telepathic always. So God himself granted me that wish. You might be wondering ""why didn't god just kill your father when he appeared."" God explained to me at the time that he has to follow a set of ""bets"" he made with the Devil since the beginning of everything.

These bets basically state that god can't smite down evil that is still alive but if evil cheats, then god can smite it down.

God kept me company the whole time I was down there just talking to me in my head. About two days into being in an elephant suit God hypnotized me so badly that I entered ""trance mode"". Trance mode is a set mechanism that allows you to add any number of things to someone's subconscious. Like ""Says"" ""Pleases"" ""Teases"" ""Sets"" "" Oaths"" ""Bets"" ""Wishes"" ""Deals"" ""Obsessions:"" and ""Permissions"" (permissions are the worst. Never add a permission to someone's subconscious or they'll shoot themselves over disgust.

After about a year of being in Trance mode, a man named ""Wallace Shawn"" (yes the famous actor) tuned into me THROUGH TIME. God made him telepathic in the 80's. He kept me company the whole time, along with certain other telepathic people throughout time. Angela Lansbury was another famous person who was always telepathic and she stayed tuned in always. 

After about a year down there; Wallace Shawn kept trying to get me out of trance mode so I could figure out a way to escape and just one day he kept trying to ""set"" me with phrases and one of those phrases was ""Uninstall, uninstall"" and when I realized what that phrase meant and what trance mode truly represented I just snapped out of it.

As I came to, I noticed that I was staring at the floor. There was some tin foil laying in front of me. My hands were about the size of softballs with splinters in them and I had ""shoes"" on my hands. After about a day, I somehow managed to get the shoes off, trying to calm myself down because I heard footsteps upstairs, I managed to wrap some tinfoil around my finger and stuck it right into an electrical socket hoping it would kill me. 

Instead, of killing myself I suddenly had a brilliant idea. I thought it would be easier to die in a fire and thought that would be slightly less painful for some reason. It actually set the wall on fire. 

I ran right into the restroom that was nearby and attempted to turn on the shower but couldn't. I thought that it would save my life, but I passed out from exhaustion. As I came too not too long after that - I panicked because I saw men in masks down there. 

It just turned out to be firefighters. My father had actually made a stupid mistake. Which was calling 911 because of his ""beloved record collection down there."" Or maybe I called 911 and just don't remember. 

As i came to, these firefighters realized what had happened to me and started beating the shit out of my father. 

One of the firefighters tried carrying me up stairs but I started screaming bloody murder, and begged them to keep me in that basement and to leave me in my elephant suit and just to end my life. I begged them for just one person the whole time. I just kept telling them, ""I need Wallace Shawn.""

I remember telling them on the phone suddenly, literally just remembered this. My father allowing me to call 911 because he always liked ""giving people hints"" about what he was doing. that ""The house is on fire and I need Wallace Shawn.""

\-------------------------

I was molested thousands of times down there, by people who had paid my father up to hundreds of thousands to do that to me. To this day my father still isn't in jail because and I'm quoting an ex-member of the Bohemian Club here ""Some Illuminati got him out of jail constantly.""",21Sep2020,1

The world’s gone mad and we all watch and agree, “yes people have lost their grasp on reality”. But how regularly and how apt are we to include ourselves in “the world”. It seems all too often we point a finger at “an opposition”. They, they’ve drank the koolaid, they, they are the ones who believe every lie that their leaders tell to manipulate them... 
We are fast approaching a place where recanting what one once believed won’t be enough, a person can indeed be led so far astray that the words spoken will have cut too deep, actions and intimidations so extreme and vial they will no longer be able to be forgiven. We are already in the place where these deeds will not be forgotten. 
I am a no one. No one knows me, though a family loves me, I am unknown to humanity, celebrity will never be a word to describe me. But I am bearing witness to these troubles. And I am not alone, we all see, but have we looked in the mirror lately? Have we accused others of blindly accepting points from someone untrustworthy? Have we also done the same?
There is a weakness, it blares in our division, it screams in the insults slung across aisles, it’s light blinds us from the truth and that which is lacking. 
Our democracy can survive. It’s going to take work and cooperation. Cooperation. Cooperation. What is that word? And why has it not existed outside of kindergarten classrooms? 
Cooperation, or compassion. Is compassion what lacks? Has the side we chose outweighed the humanity we claim to have? Do we ask ourselves what’s important? We all probably say the same thing, the people we love are what is important. Having freedom to live the life you choose, love those your heart is fond of, speak words that resonate and motivate generations, this is important. 
No one has the answers. Adult pragmatism has taught me at least this:
It’s always been a guessing game, if it works, keep it up awhile, if it doesn’t, tweak it...
No one knows what’s the best thing for everyone. It’s a trial and error problem to solve. 
There has been a standing error in our society and greed is its name. Greed is a human quality that leads only to despair. And if only the greedy individuals paid the price, it would only matter so much. But greed is the problem that affects everyone. Then it affects their children. And then it affects the grandchildren. The destruction greed has caused in our country stretches back. And greed is what makes those in power want to keep things the same. 
There is nothing wrong with progress, there is nothing wrong with caution. In fact, most would agree that progression with caution would be the safest bet, unless people are dying. Which, people are dying. More people will die. People die. Sometimes needlessly. Sometimes now. People die needlessly now. Why? Why not cooperate? Why not have compassion? Why not condemn greed?

137,"  Specifically I'm talking about the internet as I'd say in real life the tables are pretty equal. I've found myself increasingly annoyed these days by social media, particularly the radical left wing posts and I started to wonder why. I am pretty far left myself, on the political compass I'm on the bottom right most corner of the 4 center blocks. So I started trying to find the answer for this and I think I figured it out. It comes down to exposure and the mob. What I mean by this is that most social medias sites that aren't 4Chan have a decidedly left wing bias, meaning I see more left wing posts everyday which is fine, but that also increases by chances of seeing those crazy ones. Now this is when the mob comes in. I will occasionally see a radical right post or comment that is arguably worse than a lot of the radical left I've seen. So, with the nature of the sites in mind, everyone dog piles this dude and deservedly so a lot of the time. These posts don't annoy me at all because I and everyone else know its dumb. Plus they are grand conspiracy theories a lot of the time.

But when there's a radical left wing post though, that's a different story. Everyone agrees, and whoever doesn't gets sent clown emojis and honestly just genuine hatred sometimes. I get so frustrated at these things cause I read and I go ""oh well that's actually horrible, let's see everyone clowning on this person,"" and then the comments are just floods of support. It makes me feel crazy sometimes like I've teleported into a world where either logic doesn't exist, or I'm legitimately insane. The worst part too is while radical right wingers will post crazy conspiracy riddled nonsense, radical left wingers post controversial opinions about everyday life and things that actually affect people.

Now, I would like to say that there is nothing wrong with having controversial opinions or anything of the sort. What I should say is just how hateful these posts are. ""Oh, a nice cop is buying a kid an ice cream? How nice!"" Then the comments are just spamming ACAB and that the cop should kill himself (a real comment I've seen with tons of likes with only a few dissenters who were immediately silenced). Then there are posts themselves that clearly present double standards and when anyone points it out they're called Men's Rights Activists and are discredited. Its the utter confidence in their own beliefs, the fact that they have successfully played a card that since they're progressive and inclusive (not really), that they can say whatever BS they want and they can still play the morality card while standing on their soapbox. At least the opposite side doesn't try to hide it, at least they, and everyone else knows that what they stand for, they believe in it for completely selfish reasons. When someone says they should cut welfare programs or keep immigrants out, at least they don't try to hide behind some selfless facade, but when someone says ""Kill All Men' cause there boyfriend cheated, they try to act like some goddamn freedom fighter against the patriarchy.

P.S I would like to add that most of these occurrences happens on twitter and Instagram with a few on Reddit too. Also sorry if it seems I'm projecting, I've just had these feeling pent up for a while now. Also, do any of you guys feel similar? And please to do try to make a counterpoint this cause I honestly welcome my view to be changed here so I'm not as annoyed when going the sites mentioned.",21Sep2020,1
