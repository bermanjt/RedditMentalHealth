0,"I've recently added a ""Majesty Palm"" what I personally would look at and be like.. 'hey that's a nice fern'. Not knowing actually what a fern or a palm is.

Also a ""money plant"" other wise called a 'pothos' or 'ivy' depending on geographical location and vernacular used in the region.

I've found that over time, having even just these two plants near my work space / desk, casual area has increased my mental feeling as well as my ""health"" feeling, probably a placebo of thinking the 'fresh air' of the plants is helping me.

Everyone should take a moment to look around their current sedentary areas and question a live plant to fit upon the space.

2,"I was intending to post this on relationship\_advice, but I can't post there if I don't have a question. Since I had it written already, I hope it fits here.

Today I figured something out with my partner that I thought would be worth sharing. It is definitely not a standard thing, but it applied to our relationship so it might also apply to others'.

Edit for clarity: we were able to work things out about this issue, and I'm sharing so maybe this helps other couples.

→ The issue:

My (27M) primary love language is physical touch, and that is my partner's (27F) last love language. If you're curious, her primary language is also my last (giving gifts). We are together for 8 years now and we pay a lot of attention and effort into knowing ourselves and improving the way we treat each other.

That love language means that physical affection is the main way for me to express my love and also to feel loved. As a result, I will often be very touchy, caressing and kissing my partner.

When that action happens in bed, my partner often understands that act as me trying to initiate sex. When my partner is not in the mood, her way to communicate that was not reacting to my physical demonstrations. Playing dead until I would stop.

That immediately got me frustrated, sad and thinking there is something wrong with me, because ""she is not interested in me (anymore)"".

That reaction of mine, gives my partner the impression that I believe I'm entitled to sex, like it's something she owes me. She gets mad with me about it, while I'm feeling miserable about myself.

I won't lie, I often am actually trying to initiate sex, but that is because I am absolutely in love with my partner and to me she is smoking hot. There is immediate attraction just from being close to her. And what makes me feel devastated is not the denial of sex, it's the denial of my demonstration of love. In love language, that scene is me saying ""I love you"" and she responding with ""ugh, whatever"".

Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, the only times my partner would not shut me down would be when she was in the mood for sex. That reinforced the image in my brain that, for me to have my love accepted, we need to have sex. That also made it so most of my attempts to demonstrate love were more intimate and sex-related, escalating the problem.

→ The solution

While talking about our relationship today we figured this out. And we agreed that if I am demonstrating physical affection that is interpreted as initiating sex, and she is not in the mood, she will communicate that to me verbally, and I will acknowledge that, but she will accept and respond to my affection, as that is super important for me, and as long as we take the burden of ""sex is owed"" away, she always enjoy a long massage anyway.

If you are going through something similar with your partner, give this a thought. And I know that after reading this it might seem obvious (yeah, communicate with your partner, duh), but in real life and real relationships it's often hard to pinpoint what the actual issue is, and it is easy to think you're doing it all right while a small detail with huge implications is escaping your sight.",13Sep2020,3
7,"I hate my job. I hate people.

I despise people, actually.

I see other teens in my highschool doing all these great things, being happy, but throughout my ENTIRE life i wanted nothing more than to take a knife and slit my fucking throat as my birthday present.

I'm forced to live as a boy. I'm forced to go to school. After my forced years of schooling, I have to go to work and die.

I can't fucking handle this piece of shit life any longer. I'm 17 and I have another year to live (i'm nearing 17, actually.) before moving out, and I can barely handle a week anymore.

How is it so uncommon to be suicidal? It baffles me how people get surprised when i mention how awesome it would be to die in my sleep one day, so I wouldn't have to wake up to a life of pain.

I hate waking up, because it means I have work. It means I have to be a man.

I don't even have the dignity to be myself. My entire life exists to make others happy. I have to work for other people, exist for other people, etc.

I'm just a fucking toy people use to get happiness from.

I have no friends, no support network, nothing. I don't even have a personality or know who I am anymore, because I faked that to avoid other people getting mad at me.

But people still get mad at me. People still shit-talk me, trash on me, make me suffer.

I feel intense crippling jealousy from not only seeing women in general, but seeing normal teenagers in general also, because they got to live normal childhoods, with friends they made from ever since they were born. They get to work part time jobs with great support networks.

But what do I get? I get this. Suicidal thoughts because my entire life was a lie made to make others happy.

What's the point if this is all that's waiting for me? I could shoot myself and nobody would even care, I bet. I could shoot myself and i'd be happy. Actually, well, not happy, but at peace.

Would I never feel happiness again? Would I never feel loved again? Absolutely. But, it's hard to miss what you never had in the first place, since that would just be wanting to experience something, but I have that already, so :P

I bet this post is gonna get buried, and nobody is gonna care. I'm used to that though, and i'm used to feeling ignored. I bet I could grab a megaphone and blare out ""i'm committing suicide tommorrow"" and people would just look annoyed at me and tell me to shut the hell up.",13Sep2020,1

No matter how much I try to rip it from the grasp of this terrible part of myself I just can't let you go. And you are the only person I want to talk to about this. You're the person I want to sit down with and let all of this out to. 

The selfish parts of me wish that you feel the same. That you can't let go. That you still think of me ever when you're with your new love, the same way I still thought of you when I held mine in my arms. I don't think I ever fully loved her, because that last part of my heart was still with you. 

And the worst part of it is, the worst part of all of this, is that we aren't good together. We had our issues. We weren't the perfect partners for each other. Hell, my last love was better for me than you ever were. And when I think back to it, our relationship wasn't that great. But *still*, you just sit there, in the back of my chest, festering. Like the last note of a horribly sad song, that draws itself out into the black. That pulls you down into all of the hurt and all of the longing. The echos of emotions long past. 

When I saw you, I didn't even feel a romantic pull. I know that this person in my head isn't the person you are. And I've tried so hard to get rid of it. But getting over you has been one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, and I'm still not there. Not even years later. It's gotten easier. But you're still there.

I just want a sign. I just want something. Someone to reassure me that I can love someone new. That I can pour my soul into them the way I did you. That I will find someone.

I just want to be over you. I just want this to be gone. I want help.

I’m here to let y’all know I’m pissed. Not only that, I’m terrified. I had a surgery a year or so back and i think I may be having some long term complications arising. I’ve skipped out on going to the emergency room simply because I can’t afford it. 

And I’m mad. I’m mad that I’m sitting here terrified something could be extremely wrong with some of my organs, and yet I’m still debating going in because I will face THOUSANDS in medical debt. I have insurance and I’m still scared. This makes me even more angry, knowing so many Americans don’t have insurance and can face a lifetime or 10 of medical bill debt just for sometimes simple procedures and check ups. 

I have so many friends who have told me they’d rather see how far it gets than to put themselves in that kind of financial position. How. Fucking. Sad. 

People are literally gambling with their lives due to the crippling fear of debt. And look, I get that’s a little backwards.. but until you’ve been in that position, you won’t get it. ESPECIALLY if whatever might be “wrong” is just something silly or natural. Then it’s like “wow, I could’ve just never went and I wouldn’t be in debt right now.”

I rely on my parents to help me financially some, I especially fear putting even more of a financial burden on them.. I know they’d rather their child be healthy, but man.. just so much pressure.

38,"Hi, so as the title says, I (F22) have perforated appendicitis. Three weeks ago (August 22nd), I began experiencing what I believed to be food-poisoning symptoms. Excruciating abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, the whole bit. After a number of hours, my boyfriend decided it was time to take me to the ER because my pain levels were through the roof (8/10) and I was severely dehydrated and couldn’t keep even water down. 

We get to the ER, blood tests are sent off and I’m wheeled away for a CT scan. The doctor comes, and tells me they didn’t find anything unusual on the scan, talks me through my organs but mentions that my appendix wasn’t visualized on the scan. He chalks it up to being Viral Gastroenteritis and sends me home with a nausea medication prescription. 

We return hours later to the ER. The pain has returned, and even stronger (9/10 pain scale). We tell them something isn’t right. They take blood again and call in an ultrasound tech, and he’s told to do an ultrasound of my upper right abdominal quadrant to visualize my gallbladder (which they already saw on the CT looked normal). That gets finished, he tells me “good news, you don’t have a tumor in there but bad news I have no idea what’s wrong with you.” I’m vomiting in the hospital, then given morphine (which I now know I’m allergic to) and was sent home with a stomach cramping pain med. 

The pain had been persistent, not godawful but always in the background. On September 1st, I experienced pain like I’ve never experienced it before. It began with severe abdominal pain, followed by a ringing in my ears, feeling hot all over, hands numb and my eyesight was affected. I felt like I simultaneously had to vomit and have diarrhea because the pain was unreal. 

I was taken to the ER (a different one this time) shortly afterward, where they did the routine blood tests and wheeled me off for another CT. Almost immediately, I was told that I had appendicitis and my appendix actually ruptured, and had a nice abscess (a pus pocket) that had developed. 

A tube was inserted to drain the abscess, but I was told I wouldn’t be operated on for 6-8 weeks after the abscess had subsided. This felt like the worst news to me, because it meant this thing that caused me unimaginable pain was going to remain in my body. 

My drain was removed on Wednesday. That evening, I returned to the ER because that ear-ringing pain came back again, not quite as severe, but my mom didn’t want to take any chances that something bad was happening. Apparently, when the tube is removed your appendix can get inflamed once more (or more than it already is) which results in such pain (combined with the severe constipation I got from the Norco) 

Now... I’m out of the hospital, awaiting my surgery date. My anxiety is through the roof. I constantly worry that the pain will return and because of that, I have almost what seems like a PTSD-like pain that causes ringing in the ears and sweating during the night. I don’t know how to go on like this for possibly two months. 

I’m a senior in college and I feel a lot of pressure to return to school ASAP, but dealing with the emotional side of everything that’s happened to me is proving to be very difficult. I’m scared to eat a lot of things, I’m scared to do anything that might irritate my appendix, and I’ve even developed an irrational fear that I’m going to fall asleep and not wake up. 

I’m writing this at 2am after waking up sweating and in a panic. My life has just been turned completely upside down and I don’t know how to mentally or physically deal with what’s happening and what’s happened. Knowing all of this waiting and agony could’ve been prevented makes me so angry and I feel like I have no power left in my life...

41," In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched lewd stuff (obviously with adults in) for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

I would go from lying on the front of my chest and push into the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching the lewd stuff on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. 

Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to the lewd stuff, and only then did I kneel down again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior stuff. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers I'd been watching. 

As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite, and the image only arrived in May.

I feel selfish, but I gotta vent my issues somewhere before I make an ass out of myself.",13Sep2020,10
51,"In this seminar, held in Sausalito, Alan describes the ways in which we have concealed truth behind a veil of thoughts. He talks about how and why we mistake symbols for reality, argues that civilization may be a misguided experiment, offers observations about the way in which abstractions have become more powerful than the realities they are referencing, and explains how we can become “unbamboozled” from these ways of thinking.

55,"I’m a young guy and went to my job adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview. and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I’m very shy and quiet and look nervous easily) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

Once our lease is up next year, we’re going to move out to Western Massachusetts from the city. I was so scared when he first suggested it. I have my job here, my friends. But he can’t stay in the city much longer for his mental health. I’ve realized I can find a job anywhere, I can make more friends. Also, moving out there will be so much cheaper and we can save money. He can finally build up some savings and maybe even get a car. I’m still kind of scared but I’ve agreed to move and I think it’ll be ok. Worse case scenario we come back a year later if it doesn’t work out and I find another job.

61,"Wednesday last week I notice my right turn signal in my old 98 Taurus was blinking really quick, so I assumed the bulb was ready to go out. By the time I got off work that same day, the blinkers and hazards all stopped working entirely. 

I googled around a bit and saw some people saying easy fix, some people saying it was a weird wiring issue. Figured hey I’ll deal with it for the next few days and Saturday, my day off, I will take it to a nearby mechanic with good reviews. 

I tell the shop what the issue is, and asked if they could also just do a once over to see if anything else needed addressed with the car. I stressed multiple times that the turn signal/hazards were the priority but almost immediately the guy kept deferring to the tune-up as what needed attention. I repeated myself again that the primary reason for me coming in was the turn signal/hazards. The car is old but has very low mileage and is generally in good shape. These turn signals are the main issue. 

My girlfriend and I went for a pleasant walk and killed some time. Came back when they told us it would be ready. They hadn’t even started. Fine, I get that. Its a Saturday and I’m sure people are coming in on their day off last minute too. We walk home. 

I get a call a bit later that the car was all ready and the oil had been changed. I ask about the turn signals and I could tell the guy didn’t know what I was talking about. I repeat myself, the turn signals and hazards were not working and were the main reason I came in. He says “OH we looked at it but everything seemed fine.” I said well, do they work now? And he says no. 

He then says I can pick up the car today if I paid over the phone but they were technically closed now. I ask about my turn signals AGAIN and he says I’d have to come back in Monday. Thing is I work every day except Saturday. 

At this point I can’t exactly have my oil un-changed so I figure fuck it and just pay but I’m still driving around without turn signals until I can get it looked at again. 

Was there something I could have done differently here? Why is visiting a mechanic like pulling teeth? Am I being unreasonable?",13Sep2020,12

66,"A little background: My grandparents lived in a seaside village on the North Sea coast in England. Whenever we visited we'd head to the local beach, which was usually devoid of humans. We'd occasionally see a few seals, crabs and jellyfish, and other sea creatures that has since faded from my memory.
  
One thing that has been seared into my memory for over 20 years is a creature called the weaver fish. They are small fish with venomous spines. They bury themselves in the sand and can sting those that stand on them. Back in 1998ish, there were warnings all over the beach and in local media that they had increased in number, and to not go in to the sea without jelly shoes (a very 90s fad). Thus my fear of walking into the sea was born. In the years since, my fears grew to envelope jellyfish, crabs and even seaweed. Interestingly, I have never been scared of deeper water, and would happily jump off a boat and swim further out.
   
My mum now lives in Spain, within walking distance to the Mediterranean sea. She has lived there for a few years now, and is the opposite to me; she'll swim in the sea at any given opportunity. I decided it was about time I conquered my fear. I wasn't quite ready to to walk in bare foot, so I bought some sea shoes, which my brother and I dubbed water moccasins, from the local Supermercado Chino. That 7 euro spend was the best investment I have made in years.
   
I started out small. I hired a paddle board in Torrevieja, which was a nice gentle introduction into shallow water. I didn't swim that day, but bravely waded into the sea to get out to a sufficient depth to mount my board. The gentle, sheltered bay made standing up on the board easy and falling in unlikely. I enjoyed the experience, but I had hoped for more of an adrenaline rush than I actually had.
   
A couple of days later, a neighbour donated a bodyboard to my mother, as he and his wife were in the process of selling their apartment and returning to Wales permanently. I thought this was the perfect opportunity to go a step further, so we took it to the local beach on my last day. The beach near my mum's apartment was much more open compared to the sheltered bay of Torrevieja; the sand extended far out into the Mediterranean, remaining shallow for 50+ meters, but crystal clear waves rolled into the coast.
   
I had to wade out 20 meters to pass where the waves broke in order to mount the body board. I was shocked, when it sunk underneath me. Where the paddle board was buoyant enough to support my weight and remain entirely on the surface, the body board meant that I was in the water, with only my back exposed to the air. At first, I clung on for dear life, completely unwilling to leave the perceived safety of the board. My thighs clinged the edges of the board tightly, with my feet making a triangle shape over the board, as much out of the water as I could managed. Using my arms, as my sole means of propulsion, I ventured out into the sea.
  
The water still only a couple of feet - three at the most - deep. Children played with toys, lovers shared an intimate moment, and Spanish families chatted about their day, all without a hint of alarm. I, on the other hand, thrashed about wildly, desperate to remain on the foam board that barely supported my weight. As I moved further into deeper water, the waves grew less violent, allowing me to simply float, and I started to enjoy it. I cleared my mind of what may lurk beneath me, and focused on where the endless sea met the pale blue horizon.
  
On my return to the beach, I sat underneath the umbrella and contemplated my victory, but still felt unsatisfied. I wanted to conquer my fear completely. I wanted to swim without the safety of the body board. So I did. I confidently waded out once again beyond the breaking waves, and paused. I felt my heart beating boldly and my nerves tingling as I stood waist deep. I jumped forward, and swam. 
  
I again focused on the horizon, desperately purging any thoughts of the creatures going about their business in their salty abode. The same two lovers I had seen earlier were still lost in each other, and children were playing without a care in the world. I envied them, being able to enjoy the experience without a care in the world. But as I swam further into deeper waters, something changed. The panic and anxiety I usually felt started to ebb, and I too began to enjoy the experience.
  
The waves slowly grew in height and frequency, providing a rollercoaster ride much more exhilarating than you'd find at a local swimming pool with a wave machine. I found that the salt made floating much easier than in a chlorinated pool, so flipped onto my back, allowing myself to drift with the peaks and troughs of the rhythmic Mediterranean. I loved it, much more than I expected, and wanted to stay in forever. Fleeting thoughts of jellyfish still moved through my mind but I was able to push them aside, thinking so what? The fun I was having far outweighed the small risk of a bit of pain. And all to soon, it was time for me to get out of the sea and pack for my flight that night.
  
I will likely always have some level of apprehension about swimming in shallow sea water, but I am happy beyond words that I have conquered, to some extent, my previously crippling fear. I can't wait for the next time I can go swimming, and may even try without the water moccasins, though that will be a much greater challenge! 
 
TL;DR: I'm not scared of swimming on the coast anymore.",13Sep2020,6

I try not to waste my time and try to improve my vocabulary, formulate my sentences well, become more conscientious and fix my attitude towards life. I read books and listen to podcasts that host intellectual people. Of course there are days that I don't feel like it, but those days don't bother me as much because the next day I don't have a problem getting back into it. 

What bothers me is that I find it hard to recollect a lot of the knowledge that I may or may not have grasped. Let's say I listened to a podcast where the participants shed some light on a matter that I didn't know about before. If I were to try and explain this to someone else, I either can't remember few things about what I've learned or it just feels like I never learned it in the first place. It feels like my knowledge is limited to what it is at currently and everything that I try to improve on is temporary and I'm gonna circle back to where I started.

69,"I’ve recently switched majors. A year ago after graduating with my associates of arts in teaching, I realized teaching was not my thing. I took a little break and panicked a lot about not having any direction in my life. I researched and researched career paths, especially those that could be accomplished quickly. By this I mean, what are some trade or two year degrees that I can do that will quickly land me a well paying job? 

I landed on radiology technician. A fine profession don’t get me wrong. The college course I could easily do and I believe the job is something I would be fully capable of doing and doing well. That said, the medical field is not where my heart belongs. It never has been and never will be. 

The degree, though, is a 2-3 year process and the college I’d be going through offers jobs upon graduation. Heck yeah. Solid deal. Has an awesome job outlook for growth, in my state the starting pay is 60k, only years and I’d finally be making salary. 

But again, my heart isn’t in it. I’ve decided to get a bachelors in psychology. Despite being told it’s a useless degree and despite it being a four year degree, it’s something I’m interested in.

\-Hate EVERYONE but white people(again,why else would people want trump for four more years than to hope that he incites a race war/genocide of EVERYONE and ANYONE not white?)  


\-Don't care about the world(again,people want to vote trump again,hate biden enough that they will vote third party,again,that doesn't seem like americans give a shit about the rest of the world,but who am i kidding:**Americans don't give a shit about their own damn country.)**  


\-Have a closet desire for what I call ""Suicide by Government/president""?(to explain,people in this country think that life sucks SO much that they want trump to start WWIII and end the world...a way to commit suicide that they don't have to claim responsibility for. No need to kill yourself when your own damn president can kill you(and your whole damn family) in nuclear fire,right?  


\-REALLY have a self-destructive mentality that they just want the country and the world to be reduced to ashes/be sent into oblivion?  


\-Do Americans...**Just hate everyone and everything:the world,their own country and themselves most of all?**  


I say all of this,because,as a (Black) American,I have pretty much lost ALL faith in both America and Americans. Hell,people in this fucking country want me and my family dead for my fucking skin color.  


And people STILL want trump as president,and god knows given EVERYTHING he's done will only spell disaster for this country...  


And the sad thing is,**I think biden is flat-out fucked. Real talk.**  


I'll vote for him anyway,although it'll be more of a way to tell trump to go fuck himself.

\-I want this country to get better,but there doesn't seem to even be any WANT to get better...in fact this fucking country is getting WORSE(George Floyd and Michael Brown can attest to that,albeit from the grave...not to mention the hundreds of thousands dead from COVID.)  


I mean,America SHOULD be great from the get go,but the only thing great about america is the damn military. We could practically take over the world at this point,but all that would do is turn the whole fucking world into a shithole.  


And by golly,I would LOVE to leave the country(I'm thinking Japan(North Korea or no) or Jamaica(Should trump kick out ALL immigrants out of the country,legal or not..my whole family is from Jamaica.)

You live one mile from work and mom's and bro's. You like all your roommates and like when you tie together your curtain every day to bring in natural light. But you also like being able to untie it and have your room so dark in the middle of the day when you need to. You like laying on the couch in the living room and watching Medium. That's the only show you watch right now. And you also like blasting playlists by some awesome person on Spotify. Hasoyi! 

You still have an eating disorder, surprise surprise. You can still eat around others but at home or if people are around you try to restrict as much as possible. It doesnt really work, because you dont exercise, but you still do it. Right now you want to see bones. And you will. You just gotta keep on. You can still eat, just not much, just enough to get by. Oh and you love tea! And s'mores ice cream! You made an Instagram account and follow 50 pages. I'd say 30 are recovery based, yeah. The irony is not lost there. Hopefully you'll soon be where you want to be physically. Just gotta start moving and not sitting so much!!

Dad's getting married in 6 days. You gotta get shoes today. D came by on Friday and said any of my dresses are fine to wear. So that's super nice. You're happy for him of course. Super nervous about how many people will see you for the first time in years. But they arent there for you, there are there for Dad and D. I wonder if my one bro will be there. Damn, that would be so nice if he was. 

You have two new nephews!! Both boys and both born 2 days a part!! You even went to down to Georgia to see one of them in July. You'll see him again soon at the wedding. They are both doing well. The one nephew did have some complications when he was born but he's all fine now. Not to mention your nieces!! A just turned 10!!! Wow! And J is 4.5 and just started preschool!! You havent seen them in over a month though cuz your bro had the virus. Yeah. That was tough for every one. He's all better now and negative but its been awhile since you've seen him and your nieces in the same room. Soon though, soon! 

You've got a job!!! You're taking over for Mom who just retired on Friday! She's retired! They took applications and interviewed at least 10 people but none of them worked out. One even worked there for 2 days but she didnt work out. Itll be a learning experience for sure but you know every one and Mom is just a phone call away. I'm so glad I've worked there on Friday's since last October so it's not all completely new. You'll do great! I can't wait to see how you decorate the place!

Sam. No, not your brother, your friend. He lives in Georgia! Y'all met through reddit, cuz come on.. you, people, meeting in REAL life?? Lol!! He saw one of your livestreams, when you use to livestream every Friday at work cuz Friday's are so slow! You got to talking, then it went from reddit to kik to WhatsApp. You guys have gotten so close. So many times y'all got deep. His circumstances arent the best for you and its shown in many ways but you're working through it. You both want the best for each other. One of the reasons you're sticking around is so you'll meet one day. In person. You'll be in the same room, in the same bed, itll finally happen. Its complicated in many ways, but if it's meant to be itll work out. 

So there you have it: You moved out, still have an eating disorder, Dad's getting married to D in 6 days, you have not one, but two nephews, addition to your two nieces, you're taking over mom's job that she just retired from, and you met Sam.

82,"Does anyone else get random bursts of anxiety for absolutely no reason??? 

For anyone that doesn't know much about anxiety, its not just a mental health issue, at least not in my case anyway. It can actually be extremely physical and come on suddenly for no reason. 

For example, sat at home with my SO and daughter when for no reason at all, boom. Anxiety. Head, arms and legs all feel kind of tingly, imagine the feeling you get when all the blood rushes to one place in your body, that kind of weird tingly, goosebumpy type feeling all over your body. I literally feel like im in the most excruciatingly terrifying situation of my life, and yet I'm sat watching TV. Have you ever been given some really awful news and you get that horrible sinking feeling in your stomach and chest? Yup, got that too. 

So thats one way my anxoety decides to present itself. Another is through adrenaline rushes. No word of a lie, i can be asleep or just about to fall asleep, then get this random adrenaline rush, like, it feels like I could run 100 laps all whilst screaming at the top of my voice, then do 100 push ups or something.

89,"Hi everyone! This post was originally posted on r/relationship_advice but was taken down bc it's ""unsolicited advice"" . However I still feel like Gaslighting is a very misunderstood form of manipulation and this might be helpful to those struggling with this kind of abuse. Sorry if the format seems a little weird because I copied it over here. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently got out of an emotionally draining relationship and I feel like I should give some advice regarding ""Gaslighting"", a form of emotional abuse that can be kind of confusing to people just learning about it. So I would like to share with you what it is and how to identify this form of manipulation in your relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

**I. What is Gaslighting?**

&amp;#x200B;

Gaslighting gets its name from a 1930s play called ""Gas Light"". In the play, an abusive husband messes with gas lights in his house along with hiding certain objects just to confuse his wife to make her seem crazy. Gaslighting therefore is a form of manipulation that attempts to sow doubt in the victim's own sense of reality. This is officially considered a form of emotional abuse, so it's not something to take lightly. Now what makes this kind of abuse so hard to spot is that it can vary from being outright obvious to extremely subtle. Therefore it is important to identify Gaslighting in your own daily life to prevent it from seriously injuring your mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

**II. Examples of Gaslighting**

&amp;#x200B;

I think the best way to explain Gaslighting is through some examples of dialogue. Below are a few examples, some of which I experienced first hand. Your perspective is ""Y"", the abuser is ""A"":

&amp;#x200B;

A: ""Why cant you trust me? I just want to go to this party with my friends!""

Y: ""Well because I don't feel comfortable about those people. I know them personally and...""

A: ""Ugh you're so paranoid. Is something wrong with you? I'm just going to have some fun! Why dont you trust me???""

Y: ""It's not that I don't trust you, its that those people...""

A: ""Ugh seriously you need to see a therapist. It's not normal to be so paranoid"".

Y: ""Ok but at least let me go with you! It's not a safe environ...""

A: ""Ugh I dont want my bf/gf there all the time! You think I'm going to cheat on you? Is that it?

Y: ""No not at all.""

A: ""Then stop being so paranoid and let me go! My exes never had a problem with me going to parties by myself. You need help.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A: ""Can you stop calling me? Why are you so clingy???""

Y: ""I haven't spoken to you all day and your phone goes straight to voice mail! I was worried!""

A: ""Stop being so anxious! Why cant you just leave me alone? There's bad reception where I'm at! Jesus let me have fun!""

Y: ""Ok I just miss you and...""

A: ""Ok! But stop calling me! It's getting annoying! You're so clingy you really have to stop""

Y: ""I only called you once and it went straight to voice...""

A: ""BECAUSE I AM WITH FAMILY! Ugh leave me alone!""

Y: ""I thought you said there was bad reception?""

A: ""They don't have good service here! I told you this!!! You're so obsessively clingy, it really needs to stop. I got to go. Bye.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A: ""Why wont you have sex with me? That's not normal. I never knew a guy/girl who was like that"".

Y: ""I just don't feel comfortable...""

A: ""I've been talking to my friends and they say this is weird. Why aren't you attracted to me? Everybody does it! You need to get a grip on your anxiety""

Y: ""Wait what friends are these? Who are you talking about?""

A: ""FRIENDS YOU DON'T KNOW! UGHHH why are you so intrusive! I don't have to explain anything to you! Honestly I can't with you. I can't take this neglect! You won't take care of my needs!""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Y: ""Hey, why were you so dry and distant with me while you were on your business trip? I barely got to talk to you""

A: ""I was busy and had little reception. Why do you care?""

Y: ""Well...from my point of view, I'm not saying you were doing anything bad behind my back but it makes me feel like...""

Ok that last one is kind of extreme but actually happened with the case of Dalia Dippolito. See for yourself, it's crazy. Anyway these are just some of many examples. If any of these sound or seem familiar, you may be a victim of Gaslighting.

&amp;#x200B;

**III. Defending yourself**

&amp;#x200B;

So how do you defend yourself in these situations? I'm not going to lie, it is kind of difficult to, especially if you don't know what you're looking for. Firstly, identify with how you feel in certain situations. Look out for any of these feelings:

&amp;#x200B;

1. You find yourself defending yourself after simply asking a question. 2.
2. You feel guilty and begin doubting yourself as a good boyfriend/girlfriend because you said ""no"" or asked for respect.
3. You feel a sense of obligation and dependency on this person even though you may feel like they can dump you easily.
4. You know something is not right about the relationship, but you stay or keep coming back to it feeling like you did something wrong. This is especially true after breakups.
5. The person projects their own insecurities and flaws unto you, as if you are the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Identifying these feelings is the first step to knowing if you are not only a victim of Gaslighting, but a victim of emotional abuse in general. Once you catch yourself feeling any of these 5 points, take a 3rd person perspective and attempt to look at your situation from another angle. In my situation, I experienced these things in my first serious relationship, so I didn't have a precedent to compare to. However, if you do, see how previous partners reacted to how you asked normal questions like ""What were you up to today"" or ""Can you please not do this"". The abuser will usually make you seem like a weirdo or a bad partner for asking you these questions. If no precedent exists, talk to friends and family and ask them if this is normal human behavior. I know it's subtle, but try to catch any feelings of guilt or inferiority after a conversation with this person, remember it, and ask a trusted individual about it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to remember that the abuser sometimes does not even know that they are abusing you. As human beings, we all participate in some minor forms of manipulation. Babies do it as soon as their born in order to get attention and food from their mothers, either by crying, screaming, etc. Usually, Gaslighting is a symptom of emotional immaturity, so I beg each of you this: **DO NOT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE**. If you are being Gaslighted, do not call them out or accuse them of abuse and especially do not Gaslight them back. You need to remain calm, collective, and cool, the three Cs, if you will. If you realize you are being Gaslighted, it's best to simply accept their story for what it is externally, but internally understand what they just tried to do to you. Do not feed the abuser as it will give them more of a reason to hurt you. Simply respond with ""Ok"" or ""I'm sorry you're right"" and begin taking the next steps to remove that person from your life.

I hope this post helps anyone in a situation like this or prepares someone for the inevitable, because whether it is a significant other, family member, or coworker, chances are you are going to be Gaslighted at some point in your life. Remember to stay calm, collective, and cool. Remain mature and understand that these people do not want what's best for you, and a negative reaction from you is exactly what they want. Be the better person and just walk away.

**DISCLAIMER:** I am not a medical or psychological professional in anyway. These are examples I have seen or experienced in my personal life and these are the tactics I used to improve myself. Remember, it's always best to address these things with a trusted therapist, life coach, mentor, or psychologist as they are trained to handle these sorts of issues.",13Sep2020,3

92,"I've been good friends with a couple for a few years now (I'm a guy, 32, by the way), though I've known her longer and consider her my closest friend. She recently ended things with him, and he has moved away out of state now. She and I plan to continue being friends. The thing is, I've recently been doing a lot of thinking, and I've realized that I like her quite a lot and wish that there would be potential for she and I to explore more together somewhere down the line when she's over the breakup.

But, I'll most likely just forever sit on this attraction, because I'd be shocked if she ever felt the same and I'd rather not lose her as a friend by pursuing it. But I just feel really terrible all around. I feel terrible because he considered me a friend, has expressed the interest in staying in touch with me, and now here I am having feelings for ""his"" girl. And I feel terrible because I have these feelings for her, my closest friend, and I know that's so inappropriate and potentially unhealthy for our friendship moving forward. I just feel like a terrible friend to both of them, and I don't really know what to do with myself.",13Sep2020,2
95,"Fuck all these people and their apologists.  They’re scum and trash people.  They don’t deserve tolerance, civility, or sympathy.  Only dumbasses think intolerance should be tolerated.  They need to stop being coddled and get it through their head that their atrocious ideas are not acceptable in this country.

If you’re one of them, you can still redeem yourself by voting for Biden.  Being deplorable is a choice, not an inherent trait.  You can choose to not tolerate such atrocities, or you can continue to be a deplorable Trumptard on the wrong side of history.",13Sep2020,0
97,"So since I’ve left working in the kitchen and am working normal hours at a plant nursery, I’ve been wanting to cook more. And I feel so relaxed and happy when I do it. I know this is probably most kitchens but this one in particular was just unorganized and hostile at times. It constantly drained me mentally and just made me sad. I’d have days where I go cry in the walk-in. And I’ve got thick skin man. Shit just got to me sometimes though. Sometimes you gotta let it out. 

All that said. I ran out my two weeks and my first night off I made Carne Asada to PERFECTION. I was so proud of it. Home made Guacamole and Pico de Gallo. Didn’t even use a recipe for those, just eye balled it!

Couple weeks went by and I made a lovely cheese board on jasmine and rosemary toasted bread. Not too impressive but damn it was tasty. 

But today? Oh today, it happened. It was my sisters-in-laws thirtieth birthday party yesterday. And oh yeah, we got so so effed up. Spectacular time. One of those blasts where you have that killer hangover and say “yup. Worth it.”

I went to go get coffee for everyone around 11:30-12. Then it hit me. I went to the store, got a shit ton of eggs, some pepper, tomato, basil and onion. Brought it all back to the sisters house and we had like 10 people in the house. My brother in laws daughter helped me with prep and made some fried eggs to hold everyone over. 

Then the omelette happened baby. Made em “to order” so to speak. And everyone, despite the nasty hangovers, was so happy. And it just made me feel so good. Seeing everyone happy and eating and praising the fixin’s and seasoning. I went all out man. Made em nice and crispy. And it was my first time cooking omelettes outside of work. First time! And they were a hit!

I don’t know. It woke something up in me. Just seeing the joy that came from that was awesome.  And I feel really good that I could do something like that for family and strangers alike. Just wanted to brag about it. And it just makes me wanna keep cooking. Can’t wait to see what’s next!",13Sep2020,3

102,"I did something terrible today. I had a meet up with my cousins today and it's been a really long time since we even met one another. We've always planned to hangout but it never happens. Apparently my cousins were around my neighborhood today so we thought of hanging out together. Everything was all fine when one of my cousins said he wanted to smoke weed. I have smoked it before but i am not like attracted to it in any ways. I tried it for 2 times a few years back. That was my last time of smoking it. But then again today, i smoked it. With my cousins. I feel extremely guilty as i made a promise to my S/O that i will never do it again. I also made a promise that if I were to ever drink alcohol, i would drink it with my S/O only. I am neither a heavy smoker or an alcoholic. I happen to do this things once in awhile only. Right now, i am debating if i should tell my S/O or not. I don't wanna hurt my S/O which is why part of me is telling me to just pretend like this never happened. But part of me says it's better to be truthful. I honestly don't know if i should tell or just keep it down inside me.",13Sep2020,1
107,"Little backstory: 
I was born with a condition called Fibromyalgia, which basically means I’m in pain all the time, I have a shitty memory, I can’t fall asleep, among so many other things. I’m 18 and just feel so alone in my life. I feel like I’m losing connection to my friends and family, I get ghosted by every girl I talk to, and my whole life I’ve battled with depression. I was extremely suicidal last year to the point where I was going to start making a plan, but I got too scared when I realized that my life was going to end so I reached out and got therapy. Now I’m just floating around in suicidal idealization, wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself. I hate who I am, I hate that my body is what it is, I hate that my mind is what it is, I hate that my life on this planet has been nothing but torture. Recently I’ve found marijuana edibles immensely help my sleep, but I’m out right now so last night I dipped really bad. Early that evening I went out on a date with a girl I had been talking to for around a week. We have a lot in common and I thought she liked me. I hit a screwdriver while driving around and basically it took 2 hours of fucking around with AAA and a friend had to drive us home. She said not to worry about and that’s she would be down to try again, but she hasn’t responded to my message so I don’t know. I felt so alone and sad that night I thought about killing myself again. I feel like I’m not good enough for anyone to love me, I feel like I was put here by mistake. My life is truly a living hell. I’m tormented by my thoughts and body. Every time I see someone happy I feel like killing myself. I haven’t been happy in so long. I’ve forgot what it feels like to be genuinely happy. I don’t want to die, but I don’t know what else to do. How do I stop hating myself?
And I’ve been told “oh you just have to wait, you’ll find that person eventually. Just focus on yourself blah blah blah” but when you hate yourself, when you absolutely despise the thing that you are, and you feel so isolated from every other human around you, how do you that? I don’t know if I’ll make it to that point where I find the right person, I’m terrified I’ll kill myself before that might happen. I just want to stop feeling this way. Please help me",13Sep2020,0

So I want to be an actor but not act for the sake of being famous, I want to act because I enjoy the craft 

I can’t help but have this gut feeling that I’d be extremely good at it (from my perspective) and I’d have loads of fun creating shows and movies, putting hours of my time to create something people would in enjoy and be inspired by it. it wouldn’t have to just be on screen acting I’m also interested in voice acting, motion capture for games etc 

I know this will take time and effort to get to where I want to achieve but I am willing to put it the hard work. 

I’m in my first year of computing games development at university and I don’t despise my studying in fact I want to finish my degree.
and I’d love to up my acting profile before I officially focus 100% of my time.

While there with my fake id( I was a junior in high school) it was one of the only theaters to serve drinks. I was there getting real fucked up and i don’t know why but I had decided to take my glock back then. I had bought it off an of gangster from our area in sure it was burned or something... I got so fucked up that at one point I forgot the gun in my seat to go get another drink.... once I got back I decided to stop. Well all was good and we both enjoyed the movie. On our way back home was our fucking luck. DUI checkpoint. I’m here drunk af with a gun and a fake ID. Luckily I had the balls to show him the fake and it actually passed..... he asked a few questions though. I don’t know if he knew but he let us pass and that was a day that I will never forget.

122," I’m a guy and I was working as a waiter on a quiet midweek day and I was taking finished plates back to the kitchen when I felt a stare and immediately looked to my right and 1 of these 3 girls was smiling/smirking at me and looked me down at my side/arm when I looked at her   (im tall and lanky and my arms looked a little bit big too because I was had a few layers on underneath is that laughable?)  it was for about 3 seconds and then as I walked out of sight I heard a slight noise (couldn’t make it out) a bit later 2 of them were ordering food at the bar and  on their way back I felt a stare while I was standing at the kitchen gantry bored and looked over to one of them girls (the blonde friend of the girl who smiled at the start) on her own walking back to her table looking over at me and when I noticed  she laughed hard and put her hand to her mouth still looking at me then I looked away. I immediately got upset about if and I went to my team leader and assistant manager and refused to take their food to them I wanted them kicked out but my team leader wouldn't coz he said I can't be sure they were making fun of me. later on I had to check the toilets and I walked upstairs to girls toilets and the door open and it was them girls I looked up and the girl that laughed earlier smiled at me, and I overheard the blonde saying whys a boy going in girls toilet and walked past me as normal.
