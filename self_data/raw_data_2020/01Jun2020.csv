1,"During sex I see colours and feel textures. I can think back to memorable sex and remember what it felt like too, for example pale pink and feathers, or red and leather. This was my normal so I didn't really question it but I also didn't really talk about it until I was in my mid-20s. My boyfriend at the time said 'that sounds like synesthesia'. I did some research and was amazed that not everyone experienced sex like that and it was quite special. However as well as seeing the colours and feeling the textures, I often find that I get very 'lost in the moment'. Not like in a theatrical/loud pornstar way, but in I just go to another place in my mind completely, sometimes to the point that afterwards I feel a little embarrassed and feel I should apologise. Again I though this was just a thing that happened to most people during sex. I just found the below article about synesthesia during sex that states; *a sexual trance may be experienced as an extremely intense physical and psychological state of arousal, involving total absorption.* 

My mind is blown, and I feel very luckily I get to have this experience. I also feel alot less weird.

2,"I’m a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 

Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again",01Jun2020,0
3,"The fact that partisans are forcing us to pick one side, either pro police or pro protestors, is absolutely egregious. Same goes for the coronavirus shutdown. People are forced to say they’re either against locking down or they’re for it, there’s no room in the national conversation for saying that we can do a phased/risk based approach so we can preserve the public safety while avoiding bringing our economy to its knees.

For fuck sake I’m laying here in bed and it’s quiet in the room and all I hear everyday all day when it’s quiet is a high pitch ringing noise and it drives me nuts. I’m not the only one like this.

8,"I am sick and tired of the United States of America! A draconian regressive medieval place that ranks the lowest in the developed world by almost every metric. One of the very few countries in the developed world where people are so religious and believe in superstitious fairy tales to the core. A country that claims to separate church and state but that would never elect an atheist into office and that wages war on other countries to fulfill biblical prophecies. (The motherfucker George WC Bush literally said he heard God telling him to invade Iraq. Seriously wtf?). It is the only country in the developed world that still has the death penalty and draconian punishments for almost everything. A country that condones and utilizes torture (see Guantanamo Bay and treatment of prisoners in Abu Ghraib). A police state where an oppressive police force is full of white supremacist motherfuckers who kill black people every now and then. A medieval country that cuts embryonic stem cell research and where anti-abortion movements receive approval from the president. One of only three countries in the world (besides syria and nicaragua to withdraw of the Paris Accord). Literally the only country in the developed world where healthcare is not a right. A country that supposedly champions ""liberty"" but where LGBT rights are actively fought (see the US trans military ban). The young earth creationist movement is also chiefly American.

10,"For context, a user uncovered an [astroturfing](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/g3sw2l/the_user_udr_midnight_uncovers_a_massive/) campaign just a little over a month ago. It garnered some attention but like most everything, slipped our mind as time went by. 



We all know that most people in power are corrupt and usually follow their own agenda. We also know how easy false propaganda can spread. 


When covid hit, we started talking about proper compensation for bussiness, healthcare workers, and essential workers, even spoke about a 2nd round of stimulus checks. Now to my knowledge, nothing has been passed yet, many months later. 



Now we've seen to forget about those issues altogether. We're being completely blinded by all these riots. Now its the people against the people. The people against police, as if they're anything other than us (yes, some are complete dicks). 



All it takes is one big act to shift everybodys gaze. At this point, i wouldn't be surprised if a war broke out. 



Perhaphs the people in power didnt want to pay healthcare workers, essential workers, stimulus checks, and instead just lit an already short fuse. Because watching that video of George floyd, you can't help but think that man did it intentionally. As if to begin this entire charade.",01Jun2020,2

12,"I love my dad and appreciate what he does for me financially &amp; all this, but man I can hate him sometimes. He’s never at fault for anything, ever, and refuses to see his role in ANYTHING.
We were talking in the car today about everything that’s happening in America rn, and I never once raised my voice or used an intense tone and I know this for a fact bc I was super tired and just bleugh today so I didn’t have the energy for it, but still wanted to talk about it.

anyways long story short, he starts getting aggressive in disagreeing with me just having a really rough tone of voice, talking over me, all this stuff and I’d previously expressed distaste at an opinion my grandpa has about it and he goes “you’re as bad as your grandpa now having just as extreme opinions!” and I go “why are you being so aggressive?” again, neutral tone and soft voice bc i wasn’t feeling well, not antagonistic at all but definitely ya know calling him out, “oh so when you’re impassioned it’s fine but when im impassioned it’s aggressive” and I just went “okay whatever I’m not talking about this anymore” 

later he pats me on the back and goes “sorry I was passionate”. Yeah, thanks for the attempt at an apology, but not really an apology. Ik this is a small, isolated incident, it just really got to me bc he’s always like this about much more personal big life things that have happened and his self-righteousness pisses me the fuck off. Doesn’t help that he has this new and improved relationship with his new family post-divorce. He texts with her daughter every day. When I’m away at uni we never talk. We talk for maybe 5 minutes a week, if that. I honestly don’t know bc my life is so much better when I don’t talk to him, and I hate that that’s true but it is.

16,"i’ll keep it short. grew up in a fucked up home (haven’t we all)... enabling father, manic-depressive mother... add in religion and medications and that gives you a little picture. 

i’m grown and have two young kids of my own now. i never thought i would have kids. i was diagnosed with a chronic disease as a child and told id likely never be able to have children due to my medications and faulty immune system. i quietly told myself i wouldn’t have kids because of my upbringing. 

but here i am. it was only 7 years ago when i first realized i wasn’t the cause of my parents’ problems. it was 7 years ago when i first realized my mom was sick. 

i’ve been to a handful of counselors since— some helpful, most not. most recently i went to one where i, for the first time, was honest about my desire to just disappear. it was really hard for me to be open about that because i find an immense amount of value in being a reliable fixture for my kids and spouse. but the admission was sort of brushed off, and i haven’t really heard from the counselor since (it was a free service through my place of worship). i reached out once in March when covid-19 shut everything down but haven’t heard back. granted, the timing is weird and all, but i honestly feel foolish as hell for ever sharing any of that and have zero desire to do so again in a talk-therapy setting.

that being said, i’m determined to be healthy. first for me, but also for my kids. so i have a call set up for this week. with a psychiatrist. to discuss depression.

18,"Firstly, I think that what happened to George Floyd was terrible and should not have happened at all.

I get that everybody is rioting for a good cause. However, violent protests need to stop. They aren't proving anything, just hurting their own reputation. There are already stereotypes that young black males tend to be more violent than their white counterparts, and them violently rioting just makes them seem violent and unpredictable.

We have the right to a peaceful protest, not to riot, burn down buildings, steal. Those are all criminal offenses, but the moment a cop tries to do anything about any of those offenses, they're just gonna get flamed for ""being racist"", when they're just trying to do their job.

Burning down buildings, stealing, beating anybody isn't going to change anything. It's just going to make people get hurt.

I've seen pictures of rioters leaving a building, smiling and laughing with things they've essentially stolen. A lot of them seem to not understand what they're fighting for and are doing it because they can get away with it.

The first amendment of the US Constitution states ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.""

We do have the right to peacefully protest. We do not, however, have the right to commit crimes left and right.

Rioting isn't going to change anything, it's just gonna make things worse in the end.

19,"TL;DR: I’m a (nearly) 15 year old girl and have never had a crush, dated, or kissed anyone. People suggested that I was asexual, but I don’t feel comfortable with the label, it just doesn’t feel right. Recently, I’ve been experiencing feelings in my stomach and chest when looking at people, even people I wouldn’t normally find cute. I also feel this when looking at girls, even though I thought I was straight. I’m. So. Confused. 

I’m really confused. I’m nearly 15 and have never had a crush before nor have I ever dated, kissed, or had feelings for anybody. This has been bothering me for a couple weeks now. I ended up researching, posting, and asking friends to see if this is normal, then I found some people suggesting asexuality. I didn’t really feel comfortable with the label. Honestly I hope(d) that I’m not, because I want to be in a relationship in the future, I just haven’t found anybody that can fit that role yet. But, then again, dating isn’t much of a priority right now 

Very, very rarely have I ever felt anything when looking at someone I think is cute. But, for the last couple days, I’ve gotten this feeling within my body whenever I see someone (in real life and on social media) thats difficult to explain. It’s concentrated in my chest and stomach. I don’t know how to describe it, really. It happens with nearly everyone, even if they aren’t typically considered attractive. I don’t know what it could be. 

Also, this feeling happens when I look at girls. I’ve never really confined myself to one label, but, in my mind, I think/thought I am/was straight (or at least mostly straight, most people aren’t 100% either way). If anyone asks me my sexuality, I’d say that I think I’m straight. I’ve tried to imagine myself dating a girl in the future, but I just can’t see myself with a girl. They’re visually pretty, but I don’t think the same way about girls as I do guys. I can imagine myself with a guy though. Typically, whenever I think of a perfect future partner, I picture a guy. But, often the guys I picture are more “feminine” looking. They lack beards and six packs and instead sport thin bodies and a baby faces. When I think of the woman I want to be, I imagine a tougher, independent person, not the stereotypical “feminine” (I can’t stand gender roles, so I’m putting this in quotes) woman. The women I want to be like are often labeled as butch. I’ve had many people assume that I was LGBTQ+ from the way I act and dress, I always wrote this off as pointless gender roles and stereotypes, but do they have a point? 

A couple months ago, I had a dream where I cuddled and kissed a girl (who I don’t know) and liked it. I’ve never had a dream like this before, and I haven’t had another since. I looked up what this might mean and I found that my dream probably didn’t have much to do with sexuality, but instead lack of affection. I’m not much of a hugger, so this makes sense. But, still, hugging people still seems awkward (if anybody is reading this, could you lend me a tip on how to be more comfortable with this, thanks in advance), and there is a chance that my brain was trying to tell me something I don’t know. This could be the idea of not being straight... or maybe I just secretly want affection... I don’t know.

I am and always have been incredibly supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. So are my family and friends (in fact, many of my friends are LGBTQ+, so they would be very accepting). So the idea of being bi, pan, etc. doesn’t bother me, it’s the idea that I don’t understand myself fully. If I don’t understand something, I feel like I need to find the answer to it immediately, but I can’t do a quick Google search to calm my anxiety. Also, my anxiety makes me worry about the most random things. So, anyways, has anybody been in the same boat? Does anyone know what the feelings I’ve been experiencing mean? Am I absolutely insane?

21,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",01Jun2020,1

She tells me if I want to be my own person and make decisions for myself I should move out and pay for everything by myself. I just graduated high school last year and I have no clue where to even start when it comes to being financially independent. Another very very important thing is that I have a chronic illness that I am as of right now doing okay medically. But stress makes my condition worsen. If I move out I have to pay my own bills which mean try to get my own health insurance, pay for my own doctors appointments and prescriptions all while being a full time college student and working a job that allows me to live on my own. The only thing I have to my name is my car that my grandmother gifted me but she helps me pay for the insurance.

Even fucking internally they wanna fuck the non-white people over. This whole thing started because of murder of black people, but they don't stop.

He said why wont i answer i said im not decent. And then said i got skimmped 6 hours of overtime on my check. He tried messing with me saying we dont get paid overtime which was annoying.

He then says what am i doing and i say im chillin. 

He says “what a life” im thinking to myself why this guy hating on me like that.

44,"The country is in an abominable state. The government can't deal with the idea that it's police force is flawed, and American culture is so hell bent on being perfect that anything that is said against it is un-patriotic.

 But all that said, I am dealing with my own problems; namely, I want to kill myself... again. I thought I had gotten over these feelings 2 years ago since I had learned to manage my depression. But recently I was diagnosed with BPD, and everything has gotten worse and worse. It's comforting knowing that there are people struggling through what I am going through, but in spite of all the facts: I have a warm and loving family, friends who care and love about me, romantic interests that have created marvelous experiences, I attend one of the most prestigious universities in the world, I don't have any financial issues, and a career path that is looking pretty fuckin fine, I'm still considering crawling under my desk and slitting my wrists into my trash bin as not not create a mess. 

I thought I had a good handle on all of this, but apparently I don't. I've lowkey already written a final note, all it takes is for me to go ahead and do it. I've already tried it once before, why not again.

45,"I wanna tell you guys about my school experience.

Posted this in two other subreddits but it got deleted so, here goes

I’m about to graduate in a month from high school so I wanted to tell you all a bit about my High school experience. When I was in eleventh grade I had the worst year of my life. 

I had recently moved to a new school in 10th grade and instantly I was garnering a lot of attention, especially from the girls. I was an honoured student and had one of the top five GPAs in the school. I was tall and athletic and also had a good relationship with the principal. Needless to say, I was having a pretty solid time. Things started to take a turn for the worse all of a sudden, though. One of my best friends started to emotionally manipulate me with their self harm stories (let’s call this friend Bill)- that added a bit of stress to my life. I tried to help them but it just felt like it wasn’t doing anything and they just wanted my attention because they fed off of it only to harm themselves more and disturb me even more. Then, Bill revealed to me that he had tried drugs - which really shocked me because I was always pretty vocal about my sensitivity around drugs - because one of my family members was shot to death in a drug related accident and one of my best friends that I’d known since kindergarten had his family broken apart because of meth. All of these stories were stories I had shared with my friends. 

So anyway, after a while I told another one of my friends (let’s call this friend Jeff)- who shared my shock and concern regarding the drug situation. Meanwhile, a guy at my school revealed that he was suicidal to me and that he was thinking about killing himself on a daily basis - I did the smartest thing I thought I could have done - which was to report it to a teacher that I trusted would help him. The teacher did help him - but he decided to tell his friends and soon enough the whole school started calling me a snitch. People didn’t trust me with anything and used to call me names in class. Anyway I brushed these insults off and usually just laughed at them. 

But then, I also started to hear humours that Jeff was doing drugs too. I was like there’s no way that this guy would do that and I contacted him to make sure. He denied it and laughed it off. I was relieved - or so I thought. I got a screenshot of a text of Jeff casually talking about doing drugs from one of my friends. After confronting him about it - he finally admitted it and he wasn’t just doing drugs - he was dealing them. 

He was dealing them. 

The guy that I trusted for such a long time and thought shared similar values to me had been lying all along. 

I was sick to my stomach and started to distance myself from the mess - all of it - I just needed to be away. I focused on my studies for a bit and things kept going on like this for a while until I started noticing that every time I walked down the hallway I would see more and more heads turn and look at me - I would see people whisper to each other and I would see them and sometimes hear them talk about me. I knew something was up. One day, a guy (call him Asshole) came up to me about a fake account that had been slandering people. He told me that somebody was jealous that I was friends with a girl that he liked and was taking fake screenshots of fake conversations and sending them to people, calling me a snitch. I was really shocked and I thanked him for what he told me. 
I decided to ignore this for a while until one day I saw Asshole talking to two girls telling them that I was a snitch - so I walked up to Asshole and I was like hey Asshole didn’t you tell me that somebody was spreading rumours about me, why are you doing the same thing?. He started panicking for some reason because he saw the serious look on my face. I demanded to know who the fake account holder was and he insisted that he had to keep it a secret. Long story short - Asshole admitted it was him. 

I was so utterly confused.

At this time, a girl (let’s name her Karen) who hated from the very moment I entered the school for one reason or another (later I learned it was jealousy) took advantage of the chaos and used her popularity to spread the message. How wonderful of you, Karen. 

I didn’t know what to believe, who to go to, who to trust, who to turn to for help. That same month I lost my uncle to a failed heart surgery. My mind used to race with all kinds of thoughts and every night and I would struggle to sleep. I would come to school with black circles around my eyes and sometimes I would make my appearance look bad on purpose just so that people would be distracted and I thought they would stop talking about me if they took pity on me.

But no - people still talked and I heard it everyday. I got messages from my friends saying they can’t trust me anymore and it was really getting to me.

It’s hard for me to describe the nights that I had during this time. I had no friends. None. I had my mom and my dad and they supported me and without them I don’t know where the fuck I’d be. I just wanted to not worry and not have nightmares but I genuinely couldn’t. I knew i was smart and intelligent and I thought I was strong but this whole situation was proving me wrong. 

I used to come to school and teachers would pull me aside and ask if something is wrong just by looking at my face and seeing the stress and anxiety that was there. 

It reached a peak point when the principal told the police because he was concerned my parents might be abusing me, which of course they weren’t. But the police called me to the office.

I literally almost had a nervous breakdown. 

Sitting there in front of police officers in a vulnerable situation made me think about all the worst possibilities, especially because all the past situations made me think everyone was malicious in intent. 

They calmed me down - I was shivering uncontrollably - and said they just wanted to help. They let me go after asking some questions because they saw I was scared. They assured me they just wanted to see if everything is okay. 

I used to spend my lunchtimes waking in circles in a secluded area near the washroom where I knew I was alone and away from the chaos ensuing outside. 

Eventually, the principal made Asshole admit what he did to the school and slowly people started to apologize.

Things slowly, very slowly, were starting to seem okay again. I realized that the people who turned their backs on me were never going to be real friends so I wasn’t losing them - they were losing me. 

People started to send me full length apologies on Instagram and many did genuinely seem sorry. But not Karen - she was a different breed. 

Fast forward now and I’m graduating with the highest GPA from the whole school and got into my dream university. My mental health is better than ever and I have real friends around me. But what this situation taught me is just how double sided people can be - how one text or one rumour can cause someone to change their opinion on you and more importantly how someone you trusted can just lie straight to your face and not feel a thing. 

4:00 AM thoughts - just felt like letting them out.

TL/DR: Had a shit time in grade eleven with bullies and rumours that took a huge toll on my mental health

51,"So, I consider that I had a good upbringing and a decent childhood, but I can also take a large inventory of strange and/or awful stuff that happened around me as a kid that would point to the contrary. This is potentially one of those things.

My parents raised me to be a Christian, starting me out as Catholic and then progressively getting more and more Protestant/non-denominational. Bottom line in my faith has always been the Bible, no matter what kind of church we attended.. However, I know for a fact that they were into some hinky stuff, specifically around the time I was 7-8 years old. 

I don't remember them doing anything particularly odd, but I vividly remember these items they had. My mom was super into candles, they were both into incense, and my dad had an ornate, jeweled dagger; a wooden goblet with hand-painted symbols; and a homemade scepter thingy made from a wooden dowel and a wooden egg-shaped head that he also painted (with stripes of primary colors, I think?). I know that I personally handled the dagger (I remember it being dull) and the goblet, but my dad wouldn't let me mess with the scepter/staff. I also know they were into tarot cards.

Now, like I said, I don't remember them doing anything with that stuff, just that they had them and were kinda secretive about it. They stopped messing around with it a short time later. However, I had this kinda embarrassing spell when I was a pre-teen/teen when I thought I was psychic or something. When I mentioned this to my parents semi-casually, it freaked my dad out and he told me not to mess around with that kind of stuff. That led to them telling me stories about me as a toddler knowing things and details I couldn't possibly know and then saying creepy stuff like, ""The grass told me,"" or even better ""The mirror told me.""

I'm not really afraid of whatever it was that they were into. I do believe in the supernatural, but my faith is firm and I have no doubts that Jesus has got me. But, I am super curious just what the heck my parents were up to!  Does any of the above sound familiar enough to any of you to identify what they were doing?",01Jun2020,1

54,"You told me I need attention.

You told me my need for attention was tangible, but we both know what you were really saying: *Your need for attention is a problem.*

I have never felt I needed to be the center of attention.

I have never felt I needed to be someone I wasn't in order to receive attention.

I have never felt a desire to take away attention from someone else.

I have never felt my likeness for attention was something more, something deeper, something more *sinister* than how I saw it then  until you scraped your black light of abhorrence over who you think I am.

My flaws are plentiful to me and up until now they *certainly* had nothing to do with you. I am a self-aware person. As a self-aware person I am also certain of my identity as a strong, confident woman.

Weeks after you raised the curtain on your true feelings of who I am to you, those words tap danced all over every thought that ventured to approach center stage  *Your need for attention is a problem.*

In my swirling, unrelenting preoccupation with who I now say myself as, my Grandma called.

Like a hypnotist with a desperate patient I became undone, despite her nimble tenderness having no motive.

*I like attention I can't help myself, that's who I am,* I worked playfully into the conversation.

Playfully working this into the conversation I had silently placed all my vulnerability at wager for her unconsciously visceral reply: *Well of course, honey, attention is what makes us vibrant.*",01Jun2020,1

57,"if someone actually reads this it would honestly make my day. okay so i don’t know what to do about my height anymore. it makes me so frustrated and confused. i am 160.8cm in exact measurement (5’3) a few months ago i thought i was 167cm (5’5) because I thought i had measured myself but it turned out i never had and it was just a random number i put into my head. when i thought i was 5’5 i was extremely upset and super insecure because it’s pretty tall, at the time i remember i would wish that i was 5’3 i would always say like “if i were 5’3 i would be so much happier it’s the perfect height” I eventually decided to buy a measuring tape because i realised i was actually not sure of my height at all, every time i measured i got 5’3. i measure myself everyday and i am 5’3. this is the height i wanted to be and cried over. but now that i know i’m 5’3 i am still not happy, now i want to be 158cm. (5’2) i am so confused though, i don’t know why i’m still unhappy with my height, i got what i wanted but i’m still insecure. i still feel tall. is there a way to overcome this? has anyone else ever felt like this, or am i just insane? idk i feel like everyone i talk to about this thinks i’m just being stupid. but this is something that i think about everyday, i hate myself for it. it makes me feel horrible. because i know i can’t get any shorter.",01Jun2020,1

What I'm looking for is people all around the world taking a photo of a piece of paper, or a sign with some scenery in the background from your town or city, that says:

""Ethan's love for you Erin, reaches as far as (insert town or city name)"" with the date the photo is taken written on it. I don't mind if its from your house, car, garden, out in the streets, anywhere! Hoping to get as many as possible before June.

70,"We're both 21M but have been friends since kindergarten. 16 years. We have a ton of good memories and 16 years of inside jokes and whatnot but he's really just becoming an asshole.


He has *major* major anger problems. He can just absolutely fly off the handle at any point over nothing and his anger is *dangerously* extreme. He's physically fought people over bullshit so many times. He thinks it makes him seem tough and manly but it's really just fucking barbaric and childish. I'd NEVER physically fight somebody for anything. I guess I'd defend myself if I really had to but my priority would be getting out of the situation however possible as fast as I can and not ""Whooping his ass bro!""


He's gotten SO mad at me for shit multiple times that I didn't even do. He just fully makes up something that I did, yells at me for it and then the burden of proof is on *me* somehow and I have to prove I didn't do it rather than him proving I did it. And once I do he NEVER apologizes. Absolutely never. In 16 years I don't think he's apologized to me once ever




He's also just an asshole sometimes and is subtly homophobic, sexist and racist and doesn't realize it. 




The sexism: He only calls his girlfriend ""my girlfriend"" or ""my girl"" and never her name, always brags about the sex they have, and he never EVER has a job because his girlfriend pays for everything, he uses her car, etc. so he can just smoke weed and play video games 24/7/365. Calling her ""my girlfriend,"" saying she can't talk to other guys, whatever. I know he sees her as his property. She's around for sex, money, a car, and to be an accessory. The literal DAY BEFORE they started dating a year ago ish, they were just about to have sex the the first time and he specifically told me that he didn't want to date her he just wanted to ""pipe"" then fully 180s and says they're a couple because she asked. 



The homophobia: he tries to say he supports the queer community but he says the subtle things that show his true colors. We both really like hip hop music and whenever we listen to Tyler the Creator or Kevin Abstract especially he'll say like ""It really throws me off when they talk about sucking dick or something, I like the music but I don't wanna hear that in rap"" like it's 1992. We got into a fight once because he made a comment that my gay friend was tweeting too often about being gay, gay things etc. He's very clearly the fake ally saying ""being gay is fine but I don't wanna see it""


Racism: we're both white and he *so* obviously tries to emulate black culture. He wants to be black because he thinks it's cool. He dresses like it, talks like it, talks about white people like they're someone else, but when we've been going to these protests lately I can TELL he's just there for the violence and drama. Just today we were at a demonstration and he was saying the most inflammatory shit possible to the police. Black people were yelling at him to stfu because his pointless anger and urge to see violence because he's barbaric was gonna get black people hurt, killed or arrested, not him. Also whole while he was dressed very black but is so obviously white. He wanted the attention on him and he wanted to see some shit go down, those were his only motivations. He also literally says he wants to be black just because he thinks it's cool. 



I try to have empathy. I really really really do. He has mental health problems just like me. And he was raised as the only boy out of 5 kids by a single dad who's a cop and ex-military. He was raised as masculine as you can possibly imagine. I know he's secretly very depressed and I know in a lot of men that only expresses itself as anger. We've been so close for so long that I understand a lot of the reasons for why he's the way he is. 


And he's been truly caring to me in the past. I attempted suicide and got sent to a hospital. It all happened so fast I didn't get the chance to tell him, and after not hearing from me for a few days he went over to my house and my parents said he cried when they told him what happened. He definitely never cries so that was big. 


But he's also old enough now that how he was raised isn't an excuse to be ignorant, violent or anything else. He should be smart enough to realize his faults and humble enough to take the criticism but he doesn't. When I call him out for saying something bigoted or ignorant he loses his mind.




I know he needs therapy. I think he has a lot to work through and really deep down he's not a bad person but goddamn is he intolerable lately. He's tried therapy but only for I think 2 appointments then said it was a waste of time.



I don't know what to do if he doesn't want to change or get help. I can't force him to.

74,"I'm a 27 yo male, and not sure where to start. I'm no bully and never have been, and generally friendly and keep to myself, but if I'm provoked I have tended to take things to the extreme. I've always been big into all kinds of martial arts/ boxing/power lifting I always appreciated the art of it, but I've never sought out a fight on the street. 

I was bullied a tad bit in school. Mostly verbal. This wasn't an unbearable thing but, mostly called lame and things of that sort I guess because I was quiet or whatnot, physically once. One teacher sold candy somedays so I'd buy it from him, and before P.E. started I was in the locker room eating the candy, and two guys asked me if I'd give them some so I'd politely declined and one of them tried to restrain me while the other took the candy and I really lost it, I snapped and bit and eye gouged one of the guys and choked the other. I got expelled for that understandably but I honestly felt like I couldve killed them if I was allowed. I didn't feel bad at all to be honest. The thing is even though I'm not super small ( 5 11 240 pounds, ) because of the way my face looks I dont look intimidating and my face features are kinda soft people truly think that I'm too nice and gentle to fight or hurt someone and that is faaaar from true. I'm more worried about the legal precautions than someones wellbeing if they decide to start a physical confrontation with me. Once I got to the new school I was invisible but no harrasment, made a few friends though.

I've had the anger reactions and the lack of empathy before the bullying it just got worse as I got older. I used to be kinda timid but again as I got older certain fears just went away. There was another incident 3 years ago when I was on public transport train with my sister. It was crowded and me and my sister was standinging at the front part holding onto the rails above us. This guy in front of me was Idk on something or had some mental issue. He started off giggling, them yelling incoherently, and this went on for 8 minutes and all of a sudden he locked eyes with me and held it and I'm trying to avoid eye contact. Felt a little uncomfortable and hoped me looked away, he ended up lunging at me and attacking me I again snapped, began slamming his head against the wall repeatedly and everyone broke it up, since everyone saw that I didn't start the fight they just suggested that I get off at the next stop so I wouldn't get in trouble so I did. My sister was upset telling me she was concerned about how I shoudnt easily become that violent that fast and that fact that I got over it so quick was concerning to her.  I never really stay upset long, once its done I've always been able to relax.  I remember when I took MMA, they'd always talk about descalation, but in my mind I'm thinking why should I descalate if someone is trying to have a go at me ( unless its a girl or someone who I could easily hurt ) I always  believed if someone is looking for violence they should be met with violence. The other day I got that public alert on my phone that stated that 9pm curfew due to the riots and for some reason I immediately thought that meant that things got out of control and looters were running rampant everywhere eventhough I live in the suburbs and not the city, but immediately closed all the blinds in the house and grabbed my gun and kept it on the table upstairs were my tv is next to me. My girlfriend told me it wasnt that kinda bad situation, and I called my mom and sister. I don't know if I'm capable of loving a person idk, because I do feel something for my mom, and sister and father, I know if they died I'd be sad, how much idk but I definitely wouldn't be indifferent about it, I dont feel anything for my grandmother for some reason though. I remember lightly suggesting to my mom to purchase a firearm, since her and my dad are divorced and my grandma, aunt whose on bed rest and the live-in nurse are the only ones who live with her, they'd be screwed of things really hit the fan, she considered it surprisingly. Not that I consider myself a good person but I know how sick and twisted some people can be, especially if they're desperate, and this rioting just has me thinking what if people get some other ideas, idk. I often go one YouTube and watch those disappearing person cases and later there body is found, or seen videos where someones knockedout and robbed, or robbed then shot dead, that probably fuels my hostility if I feel provoked or threatened. Deep down I'd honestly feel like I'd rather take someone out point blank if it really came down to it if they were posing a threat that is.

Outside of those incidences I keep to myself and am friendly and polite because usually I'm around friendy people. I didn't grow up in a bad home or neighborhood.

Another thing is, is that I really have a hard time connecting with people. I can like a person and enjoy speaking with someone but unable to really care about them. Me being friendly and polite is mostly a default  surface  thing eventhough I dont secretly hate them or dislike them, I'm just indifferent, I guess the advantages to that are I'm not judgemental, racist ( I wasn't raised in a racist household btw ) , homophobic or transphobic or anything and I'm not bothered by peoples religious and political views, and its simply because I just don't really care about those things. Although I usually get along with most people, people who are too clingy or too type A personality  I tend to avoid. I have 2 friends from school and a girlfriend that I met while my friend was showing me around his college campus last year. I do feel alone at times, because I just look at people around me and they seem to have something a don't. Its contradicting because again I feel indifferent to others but slightly wish I didn't. When I was in 8th grade I had a friend that I knew since 4th grade die from diabetes, and I really had to pretend to look and act sad at the funeral. But I do feel alone at moments and I am slightly insecure about the fact that while my friends still talk to me ( over PlayStation ) I notice they hangout with eachother and others more. Its ok, but it does make me wonder though at times. I don't lose sleep over it but those thoughts do cross my mind. I sometimes escape by watching tv shows and movies, avatar the last airbender is my favorite, its something I sorta  wish I had, a group of friends going on adventures lol. My current girlfriend, I do like her because she's attractive and nice and enjoyable to be around and shes pretty introverted like me so we often enjoy binge watching movies when I'm not working. She makes me feel less isolated and more connected to humanity. My girlfriend doesn't know about the stuff that I typed here, no one does really.

Other thing that I knew was a problem, I was 21 when this happened. I was driving with my ex girlfriend in the car and we were coming back from her sisters Bday party. I remember this kid ( 12 years old ) darted out into the street playing outside on his skateboard and I slammed the breaks but ended up hitting him and no he didn't make it. I remember his mother running towards him hysterical. It was an accident, I was not speeding, and was completely sober, but as much as I tried I just didn't feel devastated. I was kinda shocked, and was like, is this real, and felt dread because I thought my life was done for, but I didn't feel remorse. In the end I wasn't in trouble because the mom admitted in court that I wasn't speeding and her son did fly out in the road and that I slammed the breaks and tried to swerve around. My girlfriend on the other hand was distraught understandably, the led to her breaking up with me because she saw how unaffected I really was, and called me a psychopath. Idk, I'm not bad to random everyday people and I'm not emotionless and I really just want to live in peace. Her breakingup with me was kinda relieving in a way because I was kinda getting drained by that relationship, maybe different circumstances though..  I did apologize to the mother again though. I'd say on a scale from 1 to 10 for guilt I was at a 3. I realize how serious it was, I know that was her only son, and I do still think about her from time to time, I do hope she was able to find sort of closure or peace, though I know a parent will never get over there kids death.  I never lost sleep but I know what happened was not good, I'm able to empathize and sympathize cognitively but thats it.  My current girlfriend knows this but I didn't tell her that I wasn't remorseful. 

I feel kinda broken compared to others, and I never really felt like I fit in anywhere. I dont do drugs, or drink or smoke, I sleep a healthy amount and I can keep a job and get along with co workers. I try to feel more caring but I just really can't.",01Jun2020,1

77,"Throwaway because I don't feel comfortable with my main. 

I have been struggling with mental health for the past two to three years. Probably even before, but I used to just shrug and tell myself that ""it was nothing"" (I am notorious for a certain lack of self awareness when it comes to feelings). Basically, I have zero self esteem, difficulty in coping with my feelings, along with a sensation of utter discomfort when I consider that, to me, life has no meaning, everything is dull and I have no purpose and no will to do anything, usually for weeks on end, even if with some bright spots.

Recently, my life is getting progressively worse (I am at uni, already late at graduating and I am unable to study. Every time I try to, I get anxious and procrastinate and end up hating myself even more. I made up my mind to go and see a therapist, to sort things out and start feeling less miserable. 

But as soon as I decided to go for it, something switched in my mind and now it seems like whatever I have is not that bad and that I would go to therapy and basically make a fool of myself for wanting to go.

81,"The first time I met her was about 2 weeks ago when we had a lovely conversation about some films she was buying (we also sell DVDs) as well as how we'd been feeling about the whole quarantine situation, and I very quickly felt like we got along well. She recommended that I watch the film Being John Malkovich, and I remember eagerly watching it a few days later and loving it.

Ever since that day I've been hoping she would come in again so I could speak to her, and today she did! I saw her in my store when I returned from my break, and so I went out back to the toilet basically freaking out and telling myself y'know, ""This is it, I have to ask her out,"" basically pumping myself up.

When I returned to the store brimming with as much confidence as I could muster, she was there being served by my boss. While he was sorting our her DVDs I was able to say hi very quickly and tell her that I'd seen Being John Malkovich on her recommendation, but it was quite rushed because my boss was right there. In this moment another customer came up to the counter who I had to serve. Then, just like that, my boss finished his transaction with the lovely girl, and in what felt like the most agonising moment, she smiled goodbye, slowly walking out of the store as I was serving this other customer.

I'm hoping so badly that she comes back soon and that there isn't another situation that gets in the way of me being able to talk to her properly and ask her out, because she honestly seems great.

And I can't say it, because I know exactly how any conversation like this will go down, but I know that one reason George Floyd's death has reverberated so powerfully around the world right now is because everyone is at home and has nothing to do but read the news. Everyone's bored, tired and frustrated. So it's so easy to join the collective feeling of rage and anger against this singular and systemic injustice in the US.

I'm just reminded, though, of how much is going on in the world when you truly think about it. Should I tell these people that they're assholes for not caring about the plight of North Koreans, or Uyghur Muslims detained in China, or the Rohingya, or the people of Yemen and Syria, or all of the victims of domestic abuse in lockdown?

There are so many things to care about in the world - and honestly, I've come to the opinion that ignorance is not just bliss, it's a right. The expectation that you must make yourself aware of every terrible news story (and because it's the news, they're all terrible,) and feel this collective injustice (at least until the news cycle dies down and it's no longer socially appropriate to post about it,) is simply wrong.

I can hold the opinion that what happened was a gross injustice, that of-fucking-course black lives matter, and I can keep that opinion to myself. I have the right to focus on what's important to me right now - staying safe, productive and healthy - and not drain my emotional energy by getting angry about things that are happening in another country.

If I'm silent, it's not because I'm complicit, or because I'm happy to let these injustices go. It's because I refuse to believe that every wrong in the world needs to be decried from the Facebook feed of each individual who reads the news, and because I know that I don't have the power to do anything by writing an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg and all of my Facebook friends.

109,"**TL;DR** : I have Bordeline personality disorder, I'm still in therapy and on medication and it has been like this for the past decade. Two years ago, I was finally able to reduce my med's and I took a new step on that way. It feels right and I'm very glad I took that decision.

\--- 

**For some context** : A decade ago, after an ultimate breakdown, I decided to get myself institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital. At that point, it was either that or death tbh.

I stayed there for a month, got grossly treated (well, at least for my ""major depressive disorder""), medicated (heavily the first week, specifically with lorazepam to which I got addicted to there), was to able to rest and put some things in place and in order. But that was just the tip of the iceberg.

Once out, still under antidepressant and lorazepam, it didn't take me long to see I was nowhere near the end of this chapter of my life and got two choices :

1. The easy way : Put the all thing behind me and forget about it until the next crisis.
2. The the hard way : Take the bull by the horns, confront my demons and try to become, once and for all, a better version of my actual self. For my sake, the sake of my SO and our future together. 

N°1, I already did that in the past and it didn't work so well. So, I chose N°2.

It took me some time to find the right help, a good psychiatrist/psychologist who would be able to see through my very thick and complex facade and finally tell me ""what's f\*cking wrong with me ???"", but I did, after consulting three different therapists, despite the waste of time they were and the disappointments.

Turned out, after a year of very classical analytical therapy with my still actual psychiatrist/therapist and still solely under antidepressant and lorazepam, I have, in fact, Borderline personality disorder (BPD).

From that point out, the puzzle pieces clicked and I knew deep down, I finally was on the right path.

I got the right medication to help me with the symptoms : I switched from the antidepressant I was taking to another one and an antipsychotic was added for my chaotic mood-swings and other emotional consequences of having BPD. Only the lorazepam didn't changed.

Once the medication was well in place, the therapy naturally shifted, step by step, from an analytical one to a behavioral one and I've worked hard during all those years, unraveling what seemed to be impossible to unravel, deconstructing the bad to try and create good (there was/is a lot there).

It's not over yet, I'm still slowly progressing and still need to work on myself, but, for the very first time in that past decade I'm finally able to see how much I progressed and I'm just very glad about it. 

I wouldn't have imagined, two years ago, when I began to cut back my med's, that I would be able to sleep without lorazepam. But here I am. Few months after that, when I felt stable engouh, I decided to start reducing my antipsychotic med's. It wasn't my first try on that road (going from 300mg to 200mg). I wasn't ready at that time and, therefore, wasn't able to push through so I got back to where I started. But last winter, knowing what to expect, I tried that again and this time, it worked. Now, six months later (approximately), seeing that I had few 200mg antipsychotic pills left and will need a refill well, I asked my psychiatrist/therapist to prescribe me 100mg instead of 200mg and see what happens (It's only been a few days but so far, so good).

It didn't felt like a milestone when I got ""lorazepam free"" but, for some unknown reasons, it's exactly how it feels for this little new step I took with my antipsychotic med's :) .

I would love to be able to say that I'm profoundly proud of myself and very happy but it's not computing in my brain so, instead, I'm just gonna say that this decision was the right one, a good one, and I'm very glad I took it :) .

Except for my SO, my mother (a little bit) and obviously my psychiatrist/therapist, people in my entourage, generally speaking, aren't able to begin to grasp all of this as most of them don't care enough or content themselves with my very normal ""mask"" I put on everyday but I wanted to share this tiny victory somewhere and I thought this would be a good place to do so ;).

If you got to this point : English isn't my first language so, sorry if I made some mistakes. Also, thank you very much for reading :) .",01Jun2020,1
110,"First off, let my try to sketch out the scene I've got myself in last night;

There is a train station, quite small (2rails, 4 trains an hour in 2 directions) with a supermarket connected to it which has a fairly large parking area. Within this parking lot there is a gas station connected with the road which goes parallel to the train tracks. There were same shoppers outside of the supermarket waiting in line because of our Corona restrictions.

While I was walking past these people waiting in line coming from the rail crossing at the train station. When I looked over my shoulder to cross the road I saw a woman laying in the ground with a small child I think 4 or 5 years of age next to her. After some consideration and trying too see if anyone else is going towards her or the child. But no-one seems to have any intention to help her, I walk up to her to check how she's doing.

When I get to her, I ask her what is wrong. She tells me that a man punched her. When I ask her where she's hurt she points to her left breast. I ask her if it is her chest and she tells me no it's here, throwing off her sunglasses and continuing to point to her left breast. I don't see any open wounds, only objectively speaking; a woman laying in the ground after being punched, in my assumption, to the chest. 

I try to ask the child's name so I can maybe comfort him in any way because he looked quite shocked. But when I dit this, the woman called me back, said; don't go near him, Corona virus and said something in a foreign language to the little boy which I didn't understand. 

She told me that the man"" really scared her child"" and kept in crying. When I tried to ask the little boy for his name he didn't answer but she shouted at me to ""go away, Corona"" and continues crying.

I ask her if she wants me to call her an ambulance, too which she answers; No I can't because of the Corona virus. I told her she can go to the hospital if she needed to and that I was sure if this because I worked there (as a volunteer). She kept in saying no Corona, no Corona, and continuing crying which she had done the whole time I was there up until now. 

As I was unable and not allowed to touch her I could not see how she was hurt hence she has been laying in the ground facing towards the ground almost laying in her stomach. I asked her if she could get up but the didn't answer me and just told me to go away. 

Persisting and telling her I wanted to help I asked her if she'd want me to call the police. On which she said no again and continues on crying and waving me away now. When I ask her if there is anything I can do for her she tells me ""no, go away, Corona virus"" and waves me off again.

Asking her again if I can do anything for her she starts nearly screaming ""no, go away, Corona, go away"". As I don't know anything to do anymore at this point, if she doesn't want me to do anything and telling me to go away. I felt like I had no other choice then to leave, so I eventually did after talking to her and her kid for about 5 or 6 minutes now. 

I got in with my walk but can't stop thinking that I did pretty much everything wrong. As I said, I volunteer in a hospital near me, I've been a volunteer for event EHBO and used to work for the lifeguards. So I am trained a bit, although I've forgotten most of it I think because this was all 5 to 10 years ago. 

So, eventually I did not decide to call the police or ambulance for this woman who was obviously in distress but made it pretty clear to me that she did not want me there nor did she want me to call anyone. And now I feel horrible about it.

Any thoughts on what could do if I ever stumble upon something like this again or what you would have done?",01Jun2020,1

Back in March I was giving a statement for a work colleague for the police. We go through the whole business as usual stuff, giving a statement etc. until the section where you have to give information on your age/ sex/ ethnic comes up. Each ethnic group is identified as a number from a list.

The officer goes ahead and jots down number 2, bearing in mind he hasn’t asked me. I then ask him what race number 2 says and he goes ‘Asian’. I bluntly say I’m not Asian and then he says ‘I’m terribly sorry, I should have asked - how unprofessional of me’. I tell him I’ve Egyptian heritage but am British. He’s a little lost at this point and think it’s ok to mention that he’s never been to Egypt but would love to go. (As if that’s an alright thing to say?!)

He then shows me the list of ethnic groups and I say I’d normally be classed as Arab and then he says he’s never heard of it (??) because it’s not on the list. I felt so awkward about it all. This is an ex police officer and everything about this interaction was unprofessional. 

There was another time back in December where I was at the doctors and he asked me if I was Egyptian and he somehow thought it was ok to say ‘do you walk like an Egyptian?’ And immediately after he apologised and said that it was unprofessional of him. 

Then there are those times as well where people guess if I’m Indian because I have similar facial features. I get it whenever I go abroad. As if that’s a thing people just assume or ask about you? 

And then there’s those times where I worked in a massive organisation filming board meetings monthly full of white people talking about the need for diversity in the photos up on the wall like it’s a token act? The hypocrisy. 

And you know what my reply was to all those situations? ‘Aha not to worry it’s okay.’ Well, it’s not ok for you to make those jokes, it’s not ok for you to profile me, it’s not ok for you to assume I’m from somewhere.’ 

I should have reported these professional people. I’ve had enough.",01Jun2020,1
113,"**TL;DR/Summary**: I've had a very abnormal life full of various obstacles and events that have strongly interfered with my education, resulting in me being a 25 year old (soon to be 26) agoraphobe/shut-in/hikikomori who is significantly uneducated. Neurological disorders like ADHD and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo, mood disorders like depression and anxiety, and abusive events bordering on trauma; along with truancy, are some things that interfered with my academic life. I know that I am somewhat ambitious, mainly because I want to have a career I enjoy, so I'm not willing to settle for something that doesn't stimulate me. The thing is, my experiences with the world have been so crushing to me, I've indulged in escapism after graduating high school. Now in my mid-20s, I've dug myself in a deep hole. I'm not even sure if there's a career out there that I would emotionally thrive in - something that provides flexibility and freedom, stimulates me mentally, and gives me some social status and high enough salary to sustain a life to enjoy hobbies outside of work. There's even a chance I may not be good enough for such a career. The first thing that comes to mind is something related to business.

I also thought about writing a shorter version of what happened to me in school, but I decided to leave these parts in to give you a sense of how unskilled my writing is, which will further drive the point home that I'm uneducated.

**Long version:** When I was 5, I was diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD. When I entered Kindergarten that year, I started having emotional difficulties. I hated routine and school felt like prison. I was placed in a specialized education program because I would have sudden outbursts, tease other students, and act like a class clown. One teacher scolded me harshly when I didn't feel like eating lunch, and I took it extremely hard. The experience was nearly traumatizing, and I started associating that experience with being corrected by other authority figures. I became afraid of my teacher, and the situation was so extreme, I was taken out of school until the New Year, when I started going to a new school in the district. I had the same emotional outbursts, and they lasted throughout the year.

In first grade, I rapidly matured, drastically even, I became almost an entirely different person, was the stereotypical shy, quiet kid. I was able to function fine in class, even had a couple of female friends, was kind of a clique-ish group. Had some ADHD issues, but I was able to function in an academic setting. However, the school district was rigid in how they treated me. My memory isn't very clear on the events that transpired from this point on, so I'm kind of taking a shot in the dark. They insisted that I needed a paraprofessional to follow me around wherever I went, along with being transferred to another room occasionally. Certain people within the district even said that I didn't need these types of accommodations, referring to my significantly improved behavior, and thought that they were wasting resources on someone who didn't really need them. My mother fought for me, but her attempts to persuade people failed. This continued throughout elementary school into 4th grade, when I started going to another school in the same district because the school had overall significantly higher test scores than the one I was going to prior. My 4th grade homeroom teacher resembled my first Kindergarten teacher, was harsher towards me compared to her other students, gave me lower marks than my actual grades, and even made fun of me in front of students. I still had a paraprofessional following me around, even though I was able to function fine in the classroom, aside from being painfully shy. I was having nightmares about my teacher and became terrified of going into school. My mother had the last straw and decided to look for some private schools in the area, so I could have a fairer shake. Given that I had a documented diagnosis of Asperger's, that was essentially a bonafide ticket for enrollment in an approved private school for people with behavioral and emotional difficulties, and autism spectrum disorders.

I started going there in the middle of the year, at the age of 9. I settled in very smoothly, especially in the next year. However, difficulties persisted, they were different difficulties, though. I had a teacher who was young, coming from a job in the city (around the projects). Looking back, it was apparent that she had some emotional issues of her own that interfered with her job. Ever see that movie School of Rock? Where Jack Black becomes a substitute teacher and decides to say ""screw it"" and lets his students do whatever they want, or things way outside of the standard curriculum? That was essentially my (what was supposed to be fifth grade) teacher. In afternoons, what were supposed to be math, social studies, and science; often we would just play board games or watch movies. On average we spent about 2 days a week doing that. She also had a penchant for acting, and she directed two school plays that starred our homeroom class, so that was also something that took a chunk of time. We probably spent well over 50% of afternoons away from normal academic curriculum. The next year, I had a different homeroom teacher, who wasn't abusive, but far more strict compared to my previous one. Later on that year, we had some communication issues, and I misinterpreted them because of my past experiences. I started become afraid of her, very similar to what happened in 4th grade, and my parents took me out of school until the next year. So, my math levels were still essentially at a fourth grade level, heading into 7th grade. Reading levels were probably impacted somewhat as well, and I had below average understandings of social studies and science. Language arts was the only subject I was competent at.

Heading into 7th grade, I had a teacher I was far more comfortable with. The year was going smoothly, until events outside of school interfered with my education. Long story short, my father developed an addiction to stimulant prescription drugs a few years prior, and it started escalating to the point where he couldn't function anymore. He started losing jobs, which meant that as the breadwinner, he couldn't pay rent. We moved into my grandmothers house, and she kicked us out 2 weeks later. We became homeless, which led my parents to take me and my six year old sister out of school completely. An act of truancy. It was a very bizarre situation, my psychiatrist (who was not the one who diagnosed me with asperger's way earlier in my life) actually let my family live on the top story of his house for five years while my father received no help at all for his drug abuse. There are many more facets to this story, but as they're not relevant, I'll leave it at that. But during a three year span from the age of 12 to 15, I was out of school completely, spending all day on my computer, malnourished; eating nothing but processed junk food, and witnessing domestic violence. I became not only academically stunted, but socially stunted as well.

I returned to school at the age of 15 in the middle of the year. It was the same school I went to, enrolling in the high school program. I saw some of my old friends, who were high functioning/asperger's or neurotypical with emotional difficulties/mood disorders like bipolar. I had trouble interacting with them and their friends. I became incredibly shy and withdrawn. In freshman and sophomore year, since I was still technically homeless, I didn't really have access to a shower, which meant I smelled horrible. All of these factors: being enrolled in an approved private school where some students have some form of autism, having a documented diagnosis of Asperger's, being very socially awkward, being behind my peers socially, having untreated ADHD to the point of developing significant executive function problems which surfaced often during hands-on activities (something I excelled at when I was a child) and not being a part of the 'socially elite' meant that various staff members patronized me and talked to me like I was a lower functioning autistic (or a ""moderate"" functioning person with autism). Condescending, overly friendly tone; nicknames like ""buddy"", ""bud"", and ""pal"", It actually took me until junior year for me to recognize this, and when I did, I was completely shaken to my core. There was a significant difference between the way staff members treated me and how they treated the highest functioning autistics (people with aspergers who were able to ""mask"" as NT) and NT students. I was clearly at a lower respect level. I inquired about why teachers were doing this, and it appeared that many didn't know about my family abuse, but some did and proceeded to treat me as lower functioning. I talked to three staff members about it: my guidance counselor (#1), my woodworking teacher (#2), and my language arts/writing and freshman year homeroom teacher (#3).

When I called out #1 for the way he treated me, he acknowledged what he was doing. (FWIW, he also referred to the school as a dumping ground for students with behavioral issues). He was actually a somewhat nice guy, let me chill in his office when I had social anxiety and didn't feel like participating in activities, but he was somewhat patronizing. He told my mother I had a lot of potential, but he didn't treat me like the person he thought I could be - a recurring theme with other staff members to varying degrees.

When I talked to #2 about how he talked to me and how he referred to me as ""buddy"" , he seemed to show remorse and apologize. A few months later, he talked to me in the same way with the same tone. He went out of his way to get me a gift, though?

I talked with #3, since she was one of the very few staff members that actually talked to me like a relatively normal person. When I let her know what was going on about multiple staff members patronizing me, she acknowledged it and said that she didn't agree with that communication style. I remember breaking down crying, grateful of her respect I felt I didn't deserve.

I started re-evaluating my life, found out what Asperger's was (I was completely ignorant of what autism was prior), asked my mother if I had it, found out I was diagnosed with it, and became terrified of my life and my future. I strongly considered for a while that they were right about me, and still do. I thought I was ""relatively retarded"", or incapable of functioning like a normal person; living independently and being able to communicate with my peers.

The biggest problem is how I functioned academically. High school was a VERY loose ship, so to speak, which meant that academic issues stemming from poor concentration and social anxiety were able to fly under the radar. This is the most critical part of my high school experience. I graduate high school with what I estimate based on public school academic standards, poor grades, along with very low retention, completely uneducated because of the precedent that was set during freshman year; how I fixated and perseverated on why I just couldn't fit in, just withdrew into myself, didn't focus in class at all, just exclusively fixated on my self-consciousness, disassociated from everything very much like with the family abuse. I developed clinical depression and anxiety, which made it hard to grow as a person and figure out what I was really interested in, and what I wanted to do or follow through with.

During this time I was in technical school, studying computer networking, but the combination of education gaps (reading comprehension) and poorly treated ADHD (tried nearly every single stimulant prescribed for it: Adderall, Abilify, Strattera, Concerta - none of them worked well) made it nearly impossible to focus. This was a huge missed opportunity in hindsight. Getting a CCNA at age 18/19 would have let me finance my student loans and possibly pay most of them off by age 25. I didn't want to be in a computer field long-term, but I found the salary enticing since it would have helped me afford college. Due to my lack of focus, I had to drop out of tech school right before graduating.

After senior year I became extremely anxious, depressed, and started considering suicide. I became a hikikomori (not participating in society) that fall, and I haven't resolved my situation since. One of the few times I did leave my house, was when I participated in outpatient partial programs for mental health. I talked about my feelings on what happened in high school, autism, and potential limitations. I got along well with many of the people there, and one person who claimed to be the mother of someone with an ASD said that she didn't believe I was treated fairly based on how I expressed myself. I talked to a therapist about this stuff, and he said something to a similar effect, and also said ""I had a right to be angry about how I was treated by the people in my life"", which was interesting because I didn't directly state that I was mad, I was too busy questioning the validity of it to even notice if I was angry about it. I still am, because I was showing a select side of myself to others, so to speak.

I've developed Sluggish Cognitive Tempo symptoms, which is currently recognized as a ""subtype of ADHD"", it's essentially a more severe version of attention deficit with symptoms similar to maladaptive daydreaming and poor executive dysfunction. I've taken an interest in many things such as sociology, psychology, politics, existential philosophy, but I lack the focus, energy, and knowledge base to grasp concepts which can allow me to learn about these subjects. I have so many holes in my overall understanding of the world, I only rely on a very vague idea spurred by my intuition. My vocabulary is limited and spotty and I frequently mix up definitions of words. My memory recall and processing speed are terrible. I'm completely unskilled and behind in life. When I was younger, I wanted to go to college so I could study meteorology, now I'm not even sure if college is a realistic option, given that I don't think I can juggle that and a social life. But it's still something to consider. However, I have multiple barriers preventing me from even attempting something like that.

Now, I'm assuming that a lot of people would say that I should take advantage of services catered towards people with autism, like getting a case manager, job coach, and/or move into a group home, but 1) I've had severely untreated ADHD which has likely led to executive dysfunction. I am clumsy and forgetful and often make retarded mistakes doing basic things, but I wasn't like this at all when I was 12 or younger. Something caused this, whether it was my untreated disorder, developing coping mechanisms during family abuse (complex PTSD), poor diet and malnourishment. Why should I put myself into a box that may not even fit who I am naturally, if these are problems that can be fixed through therapy, prescription drugs, better diet, exercise, and other things. Also, it's likely that I will receive similar treatment to what I experienced in high school, given that they have training on how to communicate with various people and would probably be assume that I'm significantly different, functionally, and adjust communication. That wouldn't be good for my mental health at all, and reinforce intrusive thoughts and worries that I'm not good enough, that I am intrinsically broken. Doing things generally independently with traditional methods of help will be far better for my confidence and self-esteem.

**The bottom line:**

I'm trying to improve myself by catching up in the subjects I missed in school over a period of essentially 8 years. I'd estimate I'm at a 3rd or 4th grade level in math, 4th or 5th grade in reading, probably below 1st grade in science, with the only efficient area being writing, probably around 11th grade, maybe 12th grade at best, which would probably be somewhat below average at 25 years old. But besides a GED, I'm not entirely sure how to go about this. I've struggled to find any resources that could help me catch up to the point where I'm ready to enroll in college or near college education (online community college courses, to get credits to transfer to university are something I've considered)

1. I'm worried that I may never be able to get a proper education because of the circumstances that interfered with my trajectory. I'm basing this off of something a therapist said to me once, something to the effect of ""it's going to be harder for you catch up at this point"" and suggested that I look into blue collar trades, which is something I could never see myself doing long-term. I wouldn't be happy working with my hands, stuff like that isn't mentally stimulating to me.
2. I'm really not sure what I want to do with my life career wise. I'm very intrigued by sociology, despite knowing barely anything about it. The best idea I can come up with is: ideally, being a part of a team that spearheads something in society. A career focusing on problem solving, related to social sciences, maybe even political issues. It could even be a business endeavor. But also something that provides me enough salary to finance other things in my life. Being autistic could prevent me from succeeding in such a field though, depending on how it affects my social skills, I still don't have a clear enough idea due to being isolated for a long time. Also, I'm not even sure if I'm being realistic about this.",01Jun2020,1
114,"Hi guys, so over the past year or so I have became really involved with self-help. Reading, meditation, eating healthy foods, and exercise.

This is very very frustrating to speak about because I feel like I will write this, get some pep, and then give up again in a week. 

Even though I am well aware I should eat like this, exercise like that, meditate for half an hour, read for an hour etc etc. I still cannot do it. Even with small steps, even with big steps.

Back in 2016 when I lived in Milwaukee there was a riot because a black man, Sylville Smith was shot and killed. This was headline news.

The people rioting right now need to stop. Some are there to protest and fight against social injustice. Some are there to say fuck the police. Some are there to loot and destroy because they're mad or for fun. Some are there to rebel and have a thrill. Some are there to take nice photos of how iconic their signs are to show the world they fought for something and that makes them noble.

The world needs peace. Not chaos. There is no lead here. So what the fuck are you doing? Blacks are acting as bad as the white man hates. White men in blue getting to unleash the way they want to. White women thinking they can be the first line of defensive to protect a crowd of blacks? You seriously think that's going to stop the police/swat from breaking your line?

123,"I come from a country in Asia, where we have some really tight laws about drug usage. Almost every type of drug I know is illegal and is considered a serious crime, including most psychedelic drugs, mushrooms, LSD, you name it. Like, you would get a life sentence for selling pot.

   Since primary school, the school will send in cops for lectures about drug use related topics once in a while, showing us pictures of junkies suffering, coughing blood, crying for help. And that's really fucking traumatizing for a 10'yo. So most kids are stuck in the idea that \*ALL\* drugs will easily mess you up, you instantly get addicted with one hit, and you'll die alone painfully in jail if you ever try it, without knowing is a lot of these ""dangerous "" drugs are used in hospitals as painkillers or stabilizers.

   Well, as for me, of course, that was what I used to believe in. Until I joined something like a study tour to the Uk. We spent 3 weeks in London, then went to some European countries. In some clothing shops downtown, you can find tiny weed stands selling hash oil, bongs, or weed lollipops. In our final stop, it's Amsterdam, the entire street smells like weed, there were people smoking joints on the sidewalk, at least to my high school self is absolutely wild.

I studied in a US curriculum school in Country X(not USA)

Which is till 12th grade



When I came 
To my home Country Y

But there is not many USA curriculum school in here and the ones that exist are very expensive 


So the curriculum I am studying now is till 11th grade not 12th

So I would graduate at 16

I told them to put me down 1 grade so I could graduate at 17yrs oldbut they just brushed me and said why does it matter?



So my parents said that after I graduate here I can go to USA and study 12th grade there 
So I will graduate at 17

I haven’t applied to any universities 
Because I wanted to attend when I was 17


And when I came here I studied with people older than me and it was no fun so I wanted to study in USA with my age group


So I asked embassy what I could do, they said wait things out



Man there is not 12th grade here in my country and I am too late for uni here



I honesty don’t know what to do

For a long time I didn’t know what my calling was , but I knew it was always around people. Thankfully growing up I fell into the software space which allowed me to meet with lots of people from different nationalities and cultures - which I absolutely adored. 

I wasn’t sure what it was about it , but everybody always said I was a natural people person and advised me towards a sales career - which I did. I worked in software sales for about 6 months when graduated , but something was still missing and I couldn’t figure out what. 

To cut a long story short: I somehow fell into a CELTA course and while I only had 2 months of teaching English, it was the best 2 months of work I ever had. Connecting with students , building rapport , encouraging them and seeing the pride on their face when they finally understood second conditional was like nothing I have ever experienced before. 

Since the lockdown happened and every school closed , I have been in a bit of a slump - which after some self reflection I discovered has come directly from my lack of teaching. 

I somehow had a brain wave to start a YouTube channel to get my fix of teaching - and while it’s not the same I absolutely love it. 

It is a work in progress for sure. I am slowly starting to find my style and once I get my camera back from a friend I lent it to, they will be of a higher quality :)",01Jun2020,1

I feel stuck in such a deep hole and i can't seem to get out. I dunno what to do and I feel like at 28 anything I do is to late and that does effect my motivation now to the point I don't even want to try anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S I am on a mental health team but even they don't seem to bothered about helping me.. everything in life seems to suggest I should just end my life.

thanks for any advice or help give-- please also note I'm not fishing for any sympathy just stating my situation and how I feel as context.",01Jun2020,2

- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 
- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 
- [ ] 
- [ ] I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.
- [ ] 
- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bite to me about how much she smells.

Edit: she’s Normally really  nice to me in a friendly way and she seems pleasant etc with me never had a problem with her before",01Jun2020,1

142,"This was for a creative AI module where we had to develop an AI system which produces some kind of art. I chose to make a system which generates visual poetry. Honestly, the whole time I had no idea what I was doing. My program was awful, the code was a mess and it barely worked. I also did barely any research for the report, not saying I didnt do anything, but no where near the amount I should have. Saying that however, I was a lot more comfortable with my report than I was with the project. Unfortunately, I didnt know how the grade would be split between the two. 

I thought I'd have to wait until results day to get all of my grades back. But this morning I got the email saying the grade for this assignment has been posted. My heart sunk, I really thought I'd pass but it wouldn't be a high pass, max 60% but likely a low 50 (assuming the report and project shared equal weights). I checked an I got 89% for the assignment. I was so happy, the rest of my coursework brought the final grade for that module to a 83% but I'm not complaining, like I'm so happy I got what I did. I also got some feedback saying that my project went above expectations and the report could be presented at an entry level conference. It really put me in a good mood. 

I'm still worried for the rest of my grades, especially my dissertation. But now knowing I didnt do as bad for this project gives me a bit more optimism. Sorry if any of this sounded like a humble brag, I just wanted to share with someone.",01Jun2020,1

145,"It was another morning, another morning where I just hate living, existing, I'm tired. My boyfriend was up until an ungodly hour playing Call of Duty. Obviously when this happens I don't get a good sleep, which is every night he's here. It isn't be so bad, except for the nights when he has night terrors and wakes me up in the middle of the night spiraling into a negative mind and then getting upset at me for not being able to react adequately... at 4 am.... when I'm regularly deprived of sleep. Then he gets to sleep all day while I have to be up with the kids. 

Today, my neighbor decided at 7 am that playing classical music full blast with the speaker facing out the window was a great idea. So the kids were up, I got them breakfast and could have slept for another hour, except he wanted to snuggle, and even though I moaned for the opposite, he placed himself in the middle of the bed making it so that my choices were, overheat and be forced to snuggle or roll off the bed. To which I got up and dressed and now I'm just exhausted. But there he is, sleeping. I can't start folding laundry, I can't make the bed, I can't run the vacuum, I can't start the adult shit I need to do, because this 28 year old man is still sleeping at 10:30 am. He may still, be sleeping come 1 pm and then where has my day gone? I feel like such a terrible person. Like I probably am a terrible person let's be real, maybe my Autism is a crutch I use, an excuse. I don't even know if I have the ability to actively use it as a crutch because if I had that much forethought in regards to it I would just behave neurotypical in the first place and avoid the whole situation.

What I am is someone who is better alone. Why I bother trying to be with people is beyond me, I suck at it so much. They don't ever understand who I am or why I feel the way I do so why do I torture myself even bothering. I always end up playing mom to these grown ass men who claim they're not what they are. But they are exactly what I don't want. They want someone to clean up after them, feed them, do their banking, like I'm not your mother stop being a Freudian fucking piece of human trash.

Spent last few months getting to know a girl that I grew to like. We couldn't meet because she lives with her older father. 4 days ago we finally met, it was fun but at the same time, it felt like there was a wall around her. Even though she agreed to a second date, she barely responds to my communication anymore.

I should note that her responding less frequently has been happening for more time even before the met up. We had to plan for 3 days to even have a phone call because she was busy, as she says. Even though it was easy before. 

During last days she sends like one message a day to me, so it's impossible to gave a conversation or plan the next meet. 

Had tot ell her today that it's not working and that it's over because communication like that just makes me depressed, I can't make myself do basic things around house and become lazier than usual because of it.

150,"I grew up in a household where in order to survive I had to make myself as small as possible. I was always the “therapist” figure, the mediator, the peace-keeper. 
In my adult life I’ve learned that those survival skills I had which helped me get by back then, no longer serve me, and can actually be a detriment to me. In being that mediator figure I developed a deeply rooted tendency to please others, and now as I get older I’ve realized that I’ve lived most of my life making decisions based on not disappointing others, and, as I said before, keeping the peace. 
One of my best friends is a very strong personality. They are boisterous, cheery, and outgoing. They had a very different upbringing than me, in which their parents were very overbearing. I’ve noticed that in their family, there are no boundaries. They communicate multiple times a day with their mother and father and answer calls at all hours. Their response to getting no answer is to keep calling. It doesn’t occur to them their child might be busy or not want to talk. That’s just not a possible factor in their family. So I can see how they haven’t learned proper boundaries. 
This brings me to our friendship. I’ve never stood up for myself when it comes to needing space. Ok I did once, and they implemented change briefly and then pretended the convo never happened. (Years ago). This friend is very clingy, and because their personality is bigger than mine, I often feel I disappear next to them. I almost feel this sense that they kind of want to own me. Whenever I have success, I feel them sink their claws in deeper, as if my success is a threat and so they need to make sure I don’t show too much of it in our mutual friend circles. 
There have been several instances, some recent and some years in the past, where this person has mistreated me. Yelled at me on the phone when I was 2 mins late to a restaurant they didn’t know the address of, as if it was my fault, posted insensitive content after the loss of my loved one, entering my space without consent) But I blame myself because you have to teach people how to treat you, and clearly this person thinks a lack of boundaries is a non issue. I have spoken up and let my feelings be known in the moment, but clearly not enough to stick. 
My plan moving forward is to just start standing up for myself. I can’t go back and change the things that happened in the past, but I can act now that I know better. I am afraid for the push back I will get as my friend is used to me tolerating their behaviour. It is really difficult to break a pattern of people-pleasing when it was a survival skill for many traumas I’ve endured. Everything in my body rejects speaking up for my needs and putting myself first, because for so long that was never an option.  On one hand my friend seems to be unaware I have these feelings, but on the other hand I think they know because when I back away, they almost sense it and get even clingier. They can be incredibly tone deaf and say things that blow my mind. If I don’t answer a text they’ll call twice or three times in a row. They will hear me say a joke in private and then present it as their own in a group. 
I feel sick about this because this person has also been an incredible friend. They have been there for me through everything and in some ways they really understand me and value me as a person and friend. They see me as a life long friend. However I feel like there’s this side of me they refuse to respect because it doesn’t serve THEM. Like they will tell me I need to do what’s best for me and put myself first in one breath, and then they will invite themselves over in my time of crisis in the next. I am torn between knowing if they mean well but don’t know any better, or if they do know better but choose not to see it and will continue to walk all over me. 
Does anyone have tips on how to start implementing boundaries in friendships that may already have deep rooted unhealthy habits in place? I am determined to make this friendship work from here on out and I know it’s my responsibility to speak up for myself. I recognize that it doesn’t help my friend for me to not say what I need and stick up for myself, and I know it may even seem selfish on my part.  You have to understand this was a habit that was formed in my early years as a means of survival, and now that I have the resources to know I don’t need that survival skill anymore, I want to change the course of this friendship and put healthy boundaries in place. If you’re going to lecture me and imply I’m asking for the treatment I’ve gotten, please don’t bother commenting, because I already have self-hate issues.

He doesn’t listen. Except when it’s about subjects like babies, sex, and surprisingly even hobbies like sewing and other stereotypical “feminine” pursuits are thing he will listen to me talk about.


Otherwise? I will literally get interrupted or ignored.


Friends of his have hit me, attacked me cause of a drug binger they were on, cursed me out because they misheard me and many more things, but even though he’s sometimes apologetic initially, he reconstructs the event in his mind overtime as that time I was fussy and demanding and yet again trying to drive a wedge between him and his friends.


Issues cannot be discussed. He says that’s beating a dead horse and if something happens we shouldn’t discuss it but instead try to do better.


He never asks me about my personal life. I doubt that he’d be able to tell you how many siblings I have or which languages I speak if you asked him, even though I’m super extroverted and talkative and yeah idk maybe that IS annoying.

I hate myself in all honesty... which I’ve never been able to say for some reason, there isn’t a single thing about myself that I like. I hate that I’m shy. I hate that I’m awkward. I hate that I’m not confident. I hate that I have no friends. I hate that I’m boring. I just hate everything about myself. Everyone I see, whether at work or family it’s always just a fake smile to make sure people don’t ask questions, so I can continue to bottle everything up inside...  deal with it some other time. 

I’m only 19, is this it? Is this what life is like? Or am I just bad at it?

I feel worthless.

Having no one to talk to for 3 years, bottling every little thing up inside just destroys me. It brings me to tears just typing this. 

A couple years ago I was catfished by a guy who I thought was 16M(while I was also 16M) who turned out to be 40odd, ever since I’ve not been able to trust anyone in any capacity. Talking to other guys that I like, I just can’t trust them. I just feel like they’re just playing a game; that they’re not really interested in me.... Because why would they be interested in me.

I just feel like I’m going to be alone forever, without any friends or partner. I feel like I ruin anything and everything that I come into contact with.

My thoughts feel at peace and I am reminded that I am happy, comfortable, and safe. 

Mornings like these... 

Mornings like these create a feeling of intense discomfort. These mornings easily fool me into ignoring the news. They easily fool me into turning away. They fool me into avoiding the inevitable confrontation of how I should be seeing the world and the current events.

I cannot lie and say I wish I could stop turning away. 

Like many others, I am scared and angry. I don't know what's going on and I am feeling a shameful amount of comfort to the blissful feeling of ignorance. I'm not a strong human and I feel that sentiment grow larger as I keep turning away from what is going on. 

I am sorry.

To my black friends and to the black community, I am sorry from the bottom of my heart. The pain of your history and the chaos of your present have inevitably manifested into your desperate, hurt cries for justice. I am repulsed by the selfish people who have taken your narrative and smeared it with their disgusting actions. I am livid at the thought of someone's last words begging be for their life. I am done.

I am done with turning away and I hope many of others will too.

169,"So in light of these recent US events, I thought I’d do some research to see what all is happening. I ended up looking up crime rate by race because I always hear black people are disproportionately killed by police. Well while they’re right, you know who is even more disproportionately killed? Native Americans. When you factor in population %, crime rates, police interactions, etc. Black people are around 2.4x more likely to die by police than whites. But natives are up to 3.1x more likely, and it says its likely higher due to sketchy reporting. 

It got me thinking, when is the last time we had a protest, or even something trending on twitter or Reddit for a Native American who was killed? I looked for stories but could only find small articles. Some of them are brutal, like killing kids brutal. And nothing was ever done. People didn’t care. I’m not here to take away from the shit black people go through, I’m just here to put it in perspective. If we are this angry about the disproportionate killings towards black people, why aren’t we *outraged* by the extreme disproportionate killing towards native Americans? I looked at their crime rates and they commit close to, or exactly the least amount of crimes out of any race. Yet they’re the most likely to die? 

Not to mention history. Black people bring up slavery, which they have every right to. It was fucked up. But people kinda laugh about or forget how we killed nearly 50 million natives? They had it just as bad, if not worse, depending on if you think death is worse than slavery. It’s absurd that nobody talks about this just because they only make up 2% of the US population. They’re oppressed as hell, and I never knew this because **Nobody talks about it**

The moment I wake up, I go straight to my workstation due to tasks that need to be finished in the morning. I end up working until 2 AM due to the voluminous workload, from BAU to projects and process improvement initiatives.

In this quarantine, some people get closer to their family if they are quarantined with them. However, in my case, I rarely get to dine and talk with them.

Every year
Every protest.
They sound right and good

But they show where you stand and how you continue to choose to disengage from the real issues.
They're mistimed, tone deaf, and unHELPful.

What's changed since the last time you commented with these statements?

The buildings were rebuilt, merchandise was replaced, the streets were cleaned up, the fires were put out, you went on about your day

And then...?

Somebody else was murdered. Another officer mishandled the situation and there was (again) a delayed response in reprimanding them and other parties involved.

Marginalized communities made their presence known, and yet again pointed you towards patterns of institutionalized and systemic forms of oppression.
They knelt
They wore shirts
The wrote
They sang 
They marched
Again and again and again
And were ignored
""That's not the way""

The marching continues
The voices are loud
And angry
And hurting
Rubber bullets, batons, cars, gas, used against them.
They are shot, beaten, detained, gassed, choked, charged, run over
You SILENTLY watch the violence you say is wrong

Windows are smashed, merchandise is taken, buildings start to burn
You choose NOT to look into who's causing the damage and inciting it.
You choose NOT to see the non-black faces running off with whatever they can grab.
You choose NOT to hear the protestors' pleas for the groups to stop
You choose NOT to share the articles exposing separate groups who are actively undermining the protests
You choose to glaze past the pictures of officers being protected and debris being cleared- both by protestors

And then you shake your head
Open your mouth
Open your apps
And mourn insured buildings and giant corporations over the murdered and oppressed
And praise the officers
And shame the protestors
Rescind your ""support""
Repeat the same right and good sounding statements
You feel good about what you've ""done""
and go on about your day

You choose to police those who are already being overly and unjustly policed
Turn a blind eye to the violence and riots inflicted against minorities and marginalized groups (and a deaf ear when they risk their lives telling you about it)
And turn your other eye on the temporary and easily fixed issue of property loss and damage

Have you truly helped?
Are there no other issues in desperate need of active solutions you've repeatedly chosen to avoid?

Why continue to find any reason to do and say as little as possible?

Why continue to let bias and laziness  perpetuate the real problem?

""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome""

""A riot is the language of the unheard...""

Un. HEARD.

You want riots to stop, you want the option to ignore protests (or for them not to happen altogether), you want to stop having to talk about race

But at every opportunity you are given to listen and act

You choose otherwise
Pick a phrase
and move on
Believing you aren't part of the problem.
That you've done all you needed to do
Again

180,I turned off my computer and I heard a very strange silence. I like it.,01Jun2020,1
181,"America was never great. It was founded on racism, sexism, and bigotry. There are people alive today who weren’t allowed to drink from the same water fountains as their white classmates or use the same bathroom, not even 60 years ago. And, yet again, these same people who were oppressed while growing up continue to watch as their brothers and sisters are oppressed, silenced, and wrongfully convicted and murdered.

People who are vocal through all of this, I urge you to continue to be this vocal, long after justice for George Floyd is achieved. The black community is very unfairly treated, but there are far more instances of racism and inequality across many other communities that will need to be addressed when all of this is over. Native Americans, Asian Americans, as well as the Hispanic and Arab communities are all treated unfairly on a day to day basis. When COVID was first starting to hit America, Asians were unfairly harassed because of it, and yet barely anyone was talking about that.

The last few years, we’ve been divided, pointing fingers at one another, and that hatred has been festering and growing -- this is the boiling point for it all. But we truly do need to come together after this and see that we’re all one and the same. We’re all Americans and if we put our heads together, instead of butting them, then this country can truly be great. But it has a long way to go before it can get to that point.",01Jun2020,3

185,"To preface, my bf and I have spent almost 2 years together, I love him so much, we are the best of friends, he is shy, sweet and always puts others first.  He has OCD and his main symptom is obsessing over being a good person. He gets obsessively guilty over some really minor things. This however is far from minor and really truly terrible. He confessed to searching for naked images of 12-14 year old girls when he was 13 one evening, before he realised it was illegal and thankfully found nothing. He freaked the fuck out that maybe he looked up below 12 and just blocked it out, like what if he looked for 8 or 9 and was so ashamed and guilty that he repressed the memory? Part of his OCD is making the details of a past mistake way way worse when he is anxious, basically jumping to the worst case scenario. It has happened before where he said ""I think I did X thing when I was 14"" and a few days later in a calmer state he'll say ""X definitely never happened for Y and Z reason, that was just my OCD"". He is 99% sure this didn't happen as he never noticed girls more than a year below him in school and he has no memory of ever doing this. But still I'm so scared of that 1% chance and he is too scared to promise in case it really did happen 7 years ago and he repressed the memory. I feel so lost.",01Jun2020,1
186,"I feel like I (and many of my fellow early Zoomers, born '95-'00) have been stunted by the very recent idea that an office career is 'giving up' and you should follow your passion by going into STEM or turning your art into a income stream.

Like, I get that there was an unhealthy push on literally everybody to work in Business, and it's good that we're encouraging people to work as what they want, but what about those of us that WANT to work in an office? People complain, 'Oh they're draining and soul-sucking. No job could be worse than corporate!' Oh, how droll! How taxing, indeed! Fuck you must be nice to sit down, dick around on a computer, make a living wage.

My legs aren't quite right. Nothing serious, you wouldn't be able to notice, but I was talking with my roommate and my wife about how after work my feet always hurt so bad I sometimes cry even an hour after I get off and spend my days off avoiding walking as much as possible, and apparently that's not normal. Saw a podiatrist a few months ago, they recommended I get a job where I'm not on my feet, a work with your head not your hands situation, otherwise I'd have problems later on. And I actually laughed, like they do in poorly written stories.

I'm almost 23 and I literally have no clue what a 'Cubicle Job' is! What do people do at a desk? What even is their job title? How do I even look that up on Indeed! Type in 'Cubicle Worker'? What is their job description? I don't even have a TINY clue, couldn't even begin to tell ya!

I don't have a family so I couldn't go to school full-time. I'm doing it part-time, at least a couple classes a year, even back right when I aged out and was homeless for a few months. But that shits expensive can't go to school if I can't work to feed myself and pay rent. I'm gonna be 30 before I get my Bachelor's.

I'd fucking ADORE getting a Master's or Doctorate in Ecology or Geopolitics, but that's literally never gonna happen. But that's not what I'm here asking help about. That's a pipe dream.

For me an office job isn't about giving up on my dreams. It IS my dream. My simple little dream involves nothing more than sitting at a desk 40 hours a week, complete with briefcase and monkey suit, for an average of 10 hours of productive work.

(What am I doing at that desk? Like I said, not a frekin clue, but I'm already more successful than I will be in real-life, better than my parent's did, better than anybody that became an assistant Manager at BK or Home Depot and decided 'Yup, I've peaked. This $12/hr. surely is all I'll ever be worth')

Maybe in my wildest fantasies I'll schmooze just right and make it to middle management or invest smartly or start a business or write a book so that I can retire somewhere nice. God knows not a single soul in my entire extended family is gonna be able to retire.

I think the thing that really tipped my scales on all this is that I thought I finally DID get out. Instead of working at Walgreens (I can be a lot more valuable than a cashier, I swear) or any of the dozen food service jobs I've had, ranging from fast food to actual restaurant (I'm just not good at this kind of work, let me do something I can excel at), I got a job working at a hospital. I run trays to patient's rooms. I make fairly okay money, and I thought I'd feel like an actual adult for the first time in my life. But no, it's really no different than any other job I've had and I'm just sick of this, I feel like a kid and I just need a grown-up job, please treat me like a grown-up, this isn't living I'm barely surviving!

TL;DR I'd literally rather kill myself this very second than work entry-level for the rest of my life.",01Jun2020,1
187,"New to Reddit so sorry for any faux-pas

I've been depressed for a pretty big portion of my life and it's only gotten better when I started actually pursuing the things I want, my biggest aspiration is being a singer... and that's not bad in and of itself, but I want to be a swing singer (and if you don't know what that is, it just proves my point), as in 1940s - 1960s jazz singers such as Bobby Darin, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra and so on. Ever since I first saw and heard these people, I knew I wanted to be like them, do what they do and be seen as they are seen. I know I can get to that level, but it seems even if I get good enough, I'll never make it, just because I was born a few decades too late, that realization has brought those old sentiments again. It's hard to put into words quite what I'm feeling but it all just feels hopeless and out of my hands. If it was almost impossible to make it back then as a musician, what's it like in this climate and when you're actively going against the grain. Normally I'd never ask for advice, but I genuinely don't know what to do, so maybe you can just give your thoughts on this. It would be nice to have an outside perspective.",01Jun2020,1

""I can't breath, MAMA""

This is all that is ringing in my head. I'm black, but I'm Kenyan, and with every story, every article, every killing that incites a wave of protests, I empathize the pain and helplessness all the black minority groups world wide must feel.

194,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",01Jun2020,0

197,"(Originally posted in r/questioning: https://www.reddit.com/r/questioning/comments/gubm80/im_a_15_year_old_girl_and_very_very_confused/)

TL;DR: I read the masterdoc about compulsory heterosexuality and said yes to a few things, no to most, but couldn’t answer many of them because I haven’t ever had a relationship or crush. I’m pretty sure I’m into guys, I just don’t know if I’m into girls. The reasons I think I’m into girls is because I had a dream where I cuddled a girl and liked it and felt a sensation in my stomach and chest when looking at everybody and everything a few days ago (this has since disappeared). I also thought I liked girls because I like the more feminine men (no beards or six packs, instead skinny and baby-faced) and role reversed relationships, but the more I thought about it the more I realized there’s many reasons why I feel this way. Not being straight could still be a possibility for this though. I like the idea of being with a man in the future (can’t see myself dating or having sex right now) and can’t see myself with a woman, but haven’t really felt truly attracted to anyone. I’ve researched this and found demisexuality and being demiromamtic. Unlike everything else, this made sense and I felt comfortable with the label. It would also explain how I haven’t had a true crush, because I don’t know any guys well enough (because, where I live.... just stay away from them). The only people I’m close with are my girl friends, who I don’t feel attracted to. But, I can still say if a girl is pretty, and, if I find her pretty, I want to look/be like her, not date her now or I’m the future. But, I don’t know, I might be in denial who knows 

I read the master doc about compulsory heterosexuality and I still don’t know how to feel, but I’m starting to think I’m probably straight again or at least leaning towards being straight. The majority didn’t apply to me, as I haven’t dated, had sex, or crushed on anyone, male or female. I also don’t think anyone’s ever crushed on me, and, if they have, they haven’t shown interest. I also can’t see myself dating or having sex with anyone right now. I can’t view me, a 15 year old, dating or having sex with anyone, but I can conjure up an image of an older me, then I’m fine. So, I had to go off what I want as my future self. 

I’m 99% sure I’m into guys, I just don’t know if I have interest in girls. If I’m a lesbian I’d be extremely surprised. I can easily see myself with a guy in the future and I have dreamt of my future dream boyfriend, but I can’t do the same with women. I’m not disgusted by the idea of being with a woman sexually or romantically, but I’m not enthralled either. In fact, I find comfort in the idea of having a guy in the future who I can lean on, and he can lean on me. I’ve tried to get myself comfortable with the idea of cuddling and kissing and, gasp, sex with a girl but I can’t see myself personally in that place. I don’t know why, because I’ve grown up with a LGBTQ+ safe environment (I am in Bible Belt town but I can’t stand those people so I don’t listen to them and avoid them as much as possible— if they say something’s bad it’s probably good). The only reason I think I might have interest in woman is the dream (look at OG post) and the 2-day long feelings I had for everybody and everything that hasn’t shown up for the past day or two.

Whenever I look at a woman, I compare myself to her. Her personality, her body, etc. I’ve had issues with my body for awhile, so this isn’t surprising (not healthy but what can you do, it helps me). I think, oh, she pretty, I want to look like her. This differs from men, if I see a cute guy I’ll add his features to the future boyfriend list. But this is another thing, But, this could be the normalized hetero lifestyle 

I respect LGBTQ+ relationships, but the couples that I find as “goals” are straight. Many of these relationships have the roles reversed or equal partnerships. I’ve tried to replace the man with a woman, but then I lose interest in the relationship. There’s probably other reasons for liking more feminine men (not like James Charles, more like 2000’s Gerard Way or Billie Joe Armstrong (who I can’t feel attraction to because they’re the same age as my parents and that’s not for me)). The (successful) relationships I’ve grown up with have been more mutual, with tough woman and guys who aren’t afraid to stray away from their masculinity a bit. No, this doesn’t mean I want to date my dad (sweet home Alabama), I’m just used to these relationships. The other relationships I’ve been surrounded with have been the stereotypical relationship that you would see on r/arethestraightsok. For example, I had a friend whose parents fit this role exactly. The woman couldn’t leave the house without the guys permission, she couldn’t look at other men, she couldn’t work or get an education, and more. This guy was the type of person to avoid chocolate, flowers, naps, makeup, believing that woman are people and not just sex objects, bananas, cleanliness, any beverage other than beer, etc. because it’s too “gay” and “beta” like. It’s honestly pathetic. I know this is an extreme example, but this is the only stereotypical straight relationship I’ve seen in real life. So, I find more feminine men attractive because they are unapologetically them (and often treat woman like people).
 
As you can see with the last thing, I do see myself over analyzing all of the traits I have, coming up for other reasons to why I might be feeling this way. This is very typical of me, I tend to elaborate on a subject and find other meanings instead of looking at it face value. But I’m afraid I’m in denial, but why would I be in denial?

I was researching attraction and found demisexuality. Unlike, well, every other label I felt comfort with this one and it fits me well. I don’t have any guy friends, or at least close friends, so it would explain a lack of attraction to them. I’m not attracted to any if my girl friends, the idea of kissing them doesn’t enthrall me but I’m not disgusted by it, I have no interest and really don’t want to right now

I’ve found two guys in my school that fit my “type”, but ones a senior (and now graduated) and the other talks about his girlfriend 24/7 (which is honestly adorable I want that). But I haven’t really gotten to know them well (because they are upperclassmen— classes don’t mix much until sophomore/junior year in my school). I feel like I truly need to get to know someone to feel attracted to them. Right now they’re just cute, but they stick with me unlike other people that I find cute for 5 minutes and then forget about them. Besides that, I’ve met very few decent guys in my grade. Many of them are loud, immature, hateful, etc. I haven’t looked at the girls to date because I didn’t think I was interested, but many of them are the same way. This is another thing, I don’t have a “type” with woman like I do guys. This was on the masterdoc. The other grades and teachers have pointed out how hated our class is for this, I am just unlucky enough to get into this mess. I haven’t had that much contact with grades above and below me, but, from what I’ve seen, they seem a lot better. But, because most of the guys I’m around are intolerable, I haven’t had much of a chance to become attracted to them. I’ve developed a type and that type just doesn’t exist around here (well, two of them do)

A lot of my friends are LGBTQ+. Sadly, from where I’m from (Bible belt area in Indiana (US)), if you’re not part of the community you’re often homophobic. And, if you’re homophobic because you religion tells you so (-_-), you’re also likely to be sexist and racist. I’ve had these friend think I’m LGBTQ+ before. The one I’ve talked to about it (close friend), she thought “well maybe” about my sexuality but wasn’t 100% like most. She said it was mostly from the way I dress (almost all black, skinny often ripped jeans, band t shirt, (faux) leather jacket or plaid shirt, converse). But, she still wasn’t the only person

Honestly, I don’t want to be a lesbian. I don’t know why, I just feel like I’d be missing out on something. Guys are cute I want to be with one some time in my life. When I was younger, I wanted to be Bi (Im just going to cross my fingers that this isn’t problematic). It would be cool to have more people to choose from when picking a partner, but the label still doesn’t really fit. If this is me, I want to be comfortable with it. I’m not disgusted, it just doesn’t fit like Demisexuality does. So, I still don’t know. The main things that make me suspect that I’m not straight is the dream* (look at OG post) and my 2-day long feelings to everyone and everything. I said no to most of the thing on the masterdoc, but I still said yes to a hand full. I don’t know, this is confusing 

*Just now remembering I’ve had two dreams: one with cuddling a girl (OG post) and one with a guy but it was more of a nightmare. I don’t normally criticize people on their looks but he deserves it so... I had a dream where I was sexually assaulted by him and then later raped (in the nightmare), I was disgusted (one, no consent, two, ugly as hell) and terrified. I thankfully woke up before it got too bad, and I’ve erased it from my memory. It hasn’t caused any trauma. 
I know this is because he sexually assaulted a girl in my grade. He was originally suspended for a month but was let back into the school after a week. I was furious the day I saw him in the hallways and it hadn’t left my mind for the entire day. I was afraid it was going to happen again.  So, my dream decided to go over everything I thought about in the day, which it normally does, and caused that. So, the main dream I’ve had with a guy was VERY negative, but I did have another with a guy and I enjoyed that one, but that’s been overshadowed by the nightmare",01Jun2020,1

203,"I feel like I have no purpose or talent. I feel like there’s not 1 job I can do well enough to pay my bills. I’m 24 &amp; live with my parents I’m so enraged at this fact. I’m trying to take an exam for grad school for a supposedly stable &amp; high income job but I already hate it. I’ve been studying for a year &amp; I feel just as confused when I started. 

I made a long list of things I have that I’m grateful for because I was convinced I was just being an ungrateful brat. Especially how my life has practically gone up several levels after leaving the country I’m originally from. But I don’t know at 24 how I’m going to survive on my own. I have no friends because I’m not in school anymore nor am I employed. I’ve never been in a relationship. I feel like if money was tight at least someone being with me would make it just a little better. 

I’ve given up so many of my wants and materialistic wishes but it still seems like I’m asking for the world when I just want to move out, do a job I’m good at and make enough money so I don’t rot in one place. I thank the world that I access to infinite clean water, peace, privacy, safety etc. and I’d be thrilled to return the favor especially to the people in my country but I’m so poor. I got nothing to give. My parents think I’m dumb for wanting to ‘save the world’ when I can barely push myself to study. And they’re right. I don’t know what I’m doing and I don’t know what the wisest move is that I should take. 

I have to go on morbidreality or catch a glimpse of some other gore shitshow to get myself to stop pitying my damn self. At least ‘I wasn’t a baby thrown in a dumpster like this poor girl my god’ but I think even watching stuff like that has taken a weird turn in my head to the point where I can’t sleep because every misfortune I force myself to see to teach myself a lesson just keeps replaying in my head even when I don’t want it to. 

I know I’m not a lazy lifeless scumbag. I watch these videos and I know the fire in me that lights up and I know how much my blood boils wishing I could help. I have passion. I want to be good and meet people and travel and learn. I genuinely do and I want to make money to be on my own yet despite all these noble wishes I’m stuck.

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 

Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again",01Jun2020,1
209,"All the shops are shut including the closest 24/7s cus of lockdown/the virus. None of my friends are answering i'm just completely out of ideas except knocking on random flats and saying her sorry to bother you but do you have a spare can of fanta or pepsi by any chance?

210,"Hey guys so I'm 20 and im starting to get incredibly worried that I'm going to be alone forever. I've never been in a relationship before.

I just don't think it's worth being here if I never get to experience what it's like to be in a relationship. I want to so badly. It's my one dream, and it seems like that dream may never come true.

I know some people have other things that give them purpose, but for me, I just want to have a partner to share happiness with. But if I can't have that, what does this all mean? I don't care about money or anything like that. I just want love.",01Jun2020,1
211,This question is always in my mind? What is the point of life? Is it pointless? Is there more than this? I spend all day wondering what my tiny body is doing on a tiny ball in the middle of nowhere going around a burning ball. Do I need to know this answer to be happy?,01Jun2020,1
213,"**Not sure if this kind of post is allowed (sorry in advance) and may not be a very popular opinion but I'm just writing it to write it, as I don't feel comfortable sharing with my family or friends and being outed. Even if this post is taken down, I am glad to get it out of my system.**

I grew up in a mixed race family, but much of my life I largely identified with my black side. My family history as slaves is well-recorded in books, and it always BLEW my mind what my grandparent's grandparent's had to go through to escape slavery and afford me the life/opportunities I have today. 

Recently I have been inundated with post after post from my family and white friends about how cases like George Floyd PROVE that racism is still mainstream, police are racist, capitalism is meant to keep black people down. These posts seemingly come every time it's trendy and always leads to ""We need leadership that is going to protect black people, take care of them, create equality.

**I know they are trying to help. But what I honestly wish I could ask my friends and family is:**

Why do they only care about the black community when it's trendy? Do they have any clue that the family unit has been completely OBLITERATED since the government implemented welfare incentives for fatherless families? Do they have any clue how much family instability contributes to unemployement and dropping out of school? 

Do they have any clue how exponentially more likely a black man is to kill another black man than any other ethnicity?

Do they have any clue how rampant drug addiction is? How many black boys drop out of school? 

Do any of my friends even CARE to know that when accounting for crime statistics, black men are involved in proportionally LESS officer related shooting?

 **In fact, the black community is at an even larger disadvantage because unlike almost EVERY other racial group such as asians, indians, jewish, etc... Instead of looking inward, we are encouraged to believe that ""systemic racism"" is why we are in shambles. None of my family or friends care, or they're just ignorant.** They turn on their computers, read the latest headines from news organizations that care even less (and in many cases are pushing the narative to gain votes) about how this is indicative of widespread racism and we need to elect leaders that will ""make it right"". 

The black community needs police. They need to STOP being fed this fake story that police widespread hate them and are racist. They need to rebuild the family unit, focus on education, rebuilding their communities, develop businesses, and driving out drugs.

And as much as people hate it, leadership needs to get handle on the **illegal** immigration that is responsible for much of the drugs being funneled into our communities, and taking low-skill jobs/driving down wages that black men disproporionately need.

None of this can happen while my (and your) friends and family push this stupid narrative, then go back to their lives of not giving a shit as soon as the trend dies down.",01Jun2020,1
214,"My friend had a small get together last night (10 people) because he’s moving back to his home state soon. I only knew him and another friend and everyone else I never met before. 

When I was sitting and talking to a friend this girl came up to me and asked me something but I couldn’t hear and I said “What?” because the music was kinda loud. She then slightly bent over and spoke into my ear asking where the bathroom was. When she did this my hand reached out and rested on the side of her butt right below where the hip is located. I think it’s called the gluteus medius or minimus. It rested there for about a second before I realized and took it off. She didn’t say anything so I don’t think she felt harassed or violated. She left to go to the bathroom and I didn’t see her again for the rest of the night. 

But I feel like shit. I have a girlfriend and we’ve been together 3 years and I don’t know why I put my hand out like that. I wasn’t even attracted to her I don’t know why my hand did that. Should I tell my gf? Did I cheat?

Sorry I have really bad anxiety and I can’t tell if what I did would cause my gf to break up with me. I love her so much and wouldn’t do anything to hurt her.",01Jun2020,1
215,"i’ve been going out daily protesting for George Floyd and Black Lives Matter. my strategy is to passionately yell at the lines of officers about having love and compassion which i believe resonates with them. saturday night, i was doing the same thing and i saw that it was working. i noticed a few officers in front of me starting to tear up and i genuinely believe i tapped into their humanity. anyway, the chief officer behind me orders his officers to start arresting people since they cornered us in the street and blocked off both ends of the street with officers. they demanded that we got off the road or face arrest, yet they arrested EVERY single person there regardless of where they were standing. so, i turn around in confusion after i hear the officer when the officer spots me, points at me and orders, “get her first!”. i dont know why but they took 3 officers to arrest my 5’3 ~100lbs frame. while being transported and booked, i couldnt help but laugh and smile in glee. i rode the mini jail bus with this 27-32 year old man and he was telling me that i did amazing out there. we happened to get booked together so when we were standing by each other, i started smiling at him. he smiled back so i started grinning. he started grinning and then i started laughing. next thing it’s me and him hysterically laughing with numerous officers all around us at the station staring. we both nodded and mouthed that we were okay. we got separated but caught glimpses of each other throughout the time we were there. somehow, we wound up getting to leave together. i don’t feel the slightest bit guilty for being arrested and i’m going back tomorrow to keep protesting. also, didn’t guess that i would hold a criminal record by the age of 18. i wanted to share this story because i wanted to remind everyone that it is NEVER wrong to fight for humanity. we must express the unconditional love, compassion, and connection we innately crave as human beings. sending everyone reading this an abundance of love and protection :)",01Jun2020,1
216,It's true. I have no friends. I hate myself so much. I deserve to die. I'm sorry I just don't want to be alone anymore but nobody likes me I don't know what to do,01Jun2020,1
218,"This year has been the most stressful year of my life, and to make it worst it’s impossible to know what’s happening regardless of what decisions are made and if they are actually effective or not.  So much for freedom of press, much like freedom to manipulate.",01Jun2020,1
219,"I’m 26, male. I thought I was straight til I was around 19, then i realized I like crossdresers and trans girls ALOT. Shortly after, I realized i wanted to be one more than I like them, so I became one. I ended up meeting a man 5 years ago, he was indifferent about the cross-dressing but we got along great and the sex was really good. I realized I still like girls but sex with a man was much more exciting and gratifying for me.

Anyways, I’m pretty much gay now. I’m not repulsed by women or anything, and would absolutely take any chance to fuck a girl but I just don’t ever have any real interest in pursuing that. So technically I’m bi or pansexual I guess. That’s not what really matters I’m just venting because I’m kind of confused right now. 

I never saw myself being romantic with a man especially not one this much older than me but he really makes me feel amazing. I feel so cared for and protected with him and I don’t care what that makes me, or if society thinks I’m wrong for wanting to receive that as opposed to providing it (for a woman, or whatever)

I just feel so conflicted because I really do love this guy and I think he might love me back. We’re not “dating”. We see each other once every few months and talk on the phone sometimes in between, once a month or less. But we had a talk recently and agreed we want to see each other at least a few times a month now. ***I’ve tried finding guys my age but just can’t get what I get from him.*** I would do just about anything for him, but like, how the fuck would I introduce him to my family? My family knows I’m bisexual and id happily introduce them to a boyfriend of mine but for it to be someone this much older, I feel it would be extremely awkward and inappropriate to all except myself. I already know without asking him, he wouldn’t meet my family and I’m not expecting him to ever be my boyfriend. (Even though I’d love that) I feel this is objectively inappropriate in some way even if we are just two consenting adults making each other feel good. We are very nurturing to each other, but it feels wrong that I’m in love with someone that I’d be super, super embarrassed to introduce to friends and family. There’s no way 100% of them wouldn’t say “what the actual FUCK” but idk, I don’t care, I love him lol.

Just figured I’d vent and get some thoughts lol. Maybe someone can give insight on what this means from a psychological standpoint because I’m pretty sure this isn’t normal.

No I don’t have daddy issues me and pops are pretty cool. He always did his best and was a good dad. Admittedly, We bicker often, and I think he’s annoying as hell. always on my case as he does resent me a little for being 26 and living at home, his parents gave him nothing and he was on his own at 16. Also I have my parents a super hard time from my ages 16-22 which leads to some hard times now. Normal family shit I guess. But yea, I knew someone would suggest that. I don’t resent him In any way. Idk, he taught me how to drive stick, and some good life lessons. He worked a lot so he couldn’t be there for absolutely everything. He was present in my life but not super present due to his long work hoursX I’m thinking really hard about it and I feel no feelings of resentment towards him, but I’m not sure if something about our relationship subconsciously has impacted me to long for what I’m getting out of a relationship with a man in his 50s. I think an important part that I just realized now is I respect my father for providing a stable life for me but, personality wise, I strive to be nothing like my dad and don’t want to end up like him.

Thanks for reading",01Jun2020,1
