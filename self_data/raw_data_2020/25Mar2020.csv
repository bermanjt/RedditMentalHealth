1,"So this person is actually my neighbor and I’ve known her for about a year now. My son and her daughter used to play all the time throughout the past summer. So once school started up I asked the little girl what school she went to. She is my sons age and should at least be starting first grade. She tells me that her mom didn’t put her in school and she is supposed to be in kindergarten. I started getting worried and went and talked to her mom about starting school. The mom tells me “I don’t believe in school in America. It won’t help at all. My daughter knows English and that’s all she needs”. I was astonished. How can someone actually believe in anything that crazy. So I told my son if he wants to play with his friend she has to come to our house because I don’t trust her mom to look after him. So she starts coming over 7 or 8 o’clock to play and I  I tell her it’s too late and that her mom shouldn’t send her over so late. This goes on for months and finally my son doesn’t want to play with her anymore. Fast forward to today. I’m walking to my door and I politely start small talk with her. We started talking about the car crash my son and I were in recently and for some reason It got to the point of her saying she doesn’t think epidurals work in child birth and they should just eject your spine with lubricant. It was there that I realized I needed to get out of this conversation. I’m nodding politely and tell I need to go rest from walking. She then says one more thing before I head upstairs. “I don’t even think that the things they shoot into kids works, it messes up their blood”. I know now my son will not ever play with his friend again. 



Sorry for the long slightly elaborate post. Also I’m on my phone and didn’t put much thought into the format.",25Mar2020,1
2,"Hi guys. I'm 16 years old. I feel like getting this story out. Back in 6th grade, I did something really bad. That year was the worst. I didn't have any friends in my lunch period or class, so I had to sit at the table with all of the girls in my class for the whole year. No one talked to me. I was on the shy side. My mom gave me advice to try starting a convo to get everyone talking. I decided to try starting a convo, but that failed..

There were 5 girls who I thought were really cool. They seemed very nice. I imagined myself in their clique, so I tried everything to be friends with them. I hated being the only one with no one to talk to at lunch. Our friendship seemed ok. They talked to me in class and hung out with me in Gym class. After a while towards the end of the year (Middle of June), I realized they didn't really care about me and were talking about how weird I was. I was really upset. I felt left out too. Everyone had a friend group instead of me.

After school, I decided to send them a few messages. I created a group chat on Instagram and added them to it. I explained to them how I trusted them, how nice they were and thought we were cool. Then, I sent one threat as well..I didn't even think before I sent the message ""I hope you die slowly in pain."" I was really angry. Then I blocked them all and cried the rest of the afternoon. 

When my Mom came home from work, I did get caught. My heart dropped the biggest. The school counselor called and left a message about what I sent on Instagram to them. I hardly got sleep that night. Just the thought about the whole school finding out was scary to think about. At school, my counselors called me down to the office by myself and sorted the situation out. I explained my side to them. Luckily, no police were involved and the girls said they'd move on. I'm also surprised I didn't have any detention either. I learned a huge lesson that day. 

Even though everyone moved on, I STILL feel bad about it to this day. Everytime I think about this event, I feel like crying. Life is good for me now. By 7th grade, I met a nice group of friends. We are still friends in high school today and hang out in/outside of school. If I could only go back in time, I'd stop myself before I sent the messages. 

 Lesson for everyone, PLEASE don't do what I did. I should've just dropped out of their friend group and asked my Mom for advice.",25Mar2020,1
3,"Since I live in a foreign country, without many close family members I ended up being alone in my apartment during this period. It’s been a few weeks of being alone and... it’s hard to say the least... I feel constantly angry and sad which makes it hard to concentrate on my studies. I just miss having ppl at least pass by me or sth, just sitting in a crowd without talking to anyone ... didn’t realize how much I needed that ;( now I barely even open my mouth.

4,"I come across as a confident person because a while ago I decided it’s easier to not care. I stopped focusing so much on what I don’t like about myself and started to tell myself that I do like the way I look and I’m fine the way I am. 
The one thing I can’t and won’t ever get over is the fact that I’m not funny. 
I can make my family laugh but it’s not like I’m hilarious or anything. I don’t feel comfortable making jokes in front of even my best friends because the rejection and embarrassment I feel when they don’t laugh just doesn’t allow me to anymore. 
I feel like it’s such an important trait to have because everyone wants to be friends with or date someone who’s funny but I’m just not funny!!!",25Mar2020,1
5,"Hey, I'm 15 and im from the UK, I'm just writing this basically as a benchmark, to see if I could improve at all in the future. It's a summary of my feelings, from someone who doesn't talk about their feelings. 

This is basically gonna be one big tangent.

I only have one more year of secondary school left, I don't ry study much, but I get acceptable grades, normally a 6 (b)

Looking back at the chances I could've taken, like joining clubs, making more friends etc I feel like I did something wrong. 

Being an only child, living with only my mum, Im always pretty closed about how I feel, not that it particularly bothers me, I have people around me who encourage me to ask them for help if I need it, but I'll refuse. Over the years I've started talking to people less out of school, hell I haven't gone out with friends since September last year. I'm not particularly unpopular, im ""friends"" with almost everyone. The problem is that when people get to know me they start to dislike me. 
I think it has something to do with my age group being generally unwilling to socialise with people who don't share their exact opinions. But honestly I just shrug it off as I don't care.  


I don't know if it's narcism but I think I'm quite smart, it feels like I get so easily bored of challenges that people say are hard, like murder mysteries etc, I always found logic solving really easy. But people would never acknowledge a kid getting things right when he already got everything right.

I used to act like I didn't know what someone meant when they said something just to make them feel better about them, I find that I get so bored of things that it's actually affecting schoolwork, if Im in the mood, I can finish 20 questions in 5 Minutes but most the time I just completely shut off and go numb and just sit there staring and I really wish I didn't.  


What's this another random subject change in the middle of a sentence.


But honestly this stuff doesn't concern me much, because I've always got that one thing there and that is, video games, more so recently, ive realised that it's all I can imagine doing, that in the future if I can't do it, I don't think I could go on working some average job, maybe it's a power trip but I need people to acknowledge me for something, something great.

I don't know if this steams from the brief period where I played a lot of fortnite and won money, maybe it gave me some sort of power trip idk. But the thing that hurts the most is that I can't even do that, I'll load up a game and play. A match, but halfway through I'll just get so incredibly bored. Like sometimes I'll just straight up quit. I hate it because I know that the one thing I need to do to improve is play but I can't. Maybe it's not meant for me, maybe it's not ""my thing"".

I don't know what the point of this was but peace",25Mar2020,1

8,"Ever since I left high school I never had a ""group"" of friends, I am very reserved and shy and barely talk unless approached and this didn't help me make new friends at university at all.  Last summer I wanted to break away from my shell and meet new people so I applied to volunteer in a prestigious NGO and got in.  Coming from an area of no experience in volunteering; I received no guidance when I got accepted and being very shy didn't really help me either, I watched all the new members form friendships together while I never had my chance and always felt like a small fish in a big pond. 4 months later I barely did any volunteering and I decided to quit. It just breaks my heart knowing I maybe had a chance that I never took for granted, and it makes me feel like less off a decent human being for not being able to have a group of friends. I've gotten used to my loneliness but knowing my incapability and knowing I'm not anyone's first choice of a friend crushes my spirit.",25Mar2020,1

I've been devastated before, but I've always been mature enough to realize when I need to set time aside for myself to process things and relax. Right now I just feel a faint pang of nothingness and meaninglessness. Loneliness too, but that's probably obvious given the whole virus thing or whatever. Not enough where I can understandably put off school work and chores and stuff to deal with this, but enough that when I do these things I find myself less able to focus, less motivated, etc.

Last Wednesday my girlfriend broke up with me. She says she still has mad feelings for me, but needs to work on herself by herself for awhile. We're still texting a lot because we miss each other but we realize this is for the best. I \*know\* its for the best, even for me. I didn't feel fulfilled, I just thought maybe I could get there. But I still miss her, okay? I miss being told everyday that I am romantically loved, especially since I now have to deal with quarantine loneliness. It just really really sucks.

This has gone on for all my life, not being able to express myself as fully as I would have liked.

I regularly and fervently believe the narrative that I am a wage slave, that it doesn't matter what I do for a living , work for this master or that master, it doesn't matter because the outcome is the same and I will just be unhappy until I die. Honest I believe this or feel this most of the time. 

I get angry at posts and comments that remind me of my liberty, to do something different if I don't like it.  There is no gun to my head. There is so much more available in the scope of what I can do. A lot of it would seem risky or uncomfortable. Or I'd stand to lose and sacrifice a lot.  That doesn't mean I am being forced to do work I hate. I am choosing comfort and ease while claiming I am forced to be miserable by the 1%.

I don't know why I keep falling into the narrative of being powerless to the system, the 1%, the gods of capitalism are ruling over me. 

But I can turn off the TV , the internet, quit my job and go find something I enjoy. But I don't and I don't know why I keep getting angry at these imaginary  groups I claim are standing in my way. Furiously tilting at windmills.

I didn't want to wait forever for it to end, I just wanted to start my life. I'd been planning this for almost 6 months.

I lived with my mom, little sister and our animals. Dogs, bunnies, fish, chickens. It was easy to live there.

27,"My mom is almost 60. Due to her heart issues, she’s considered a high risk person for the virus. Most of the people at her work have moved to working at home, and for some reason this convinced her that she should continue to work in her office building and continue with her normal day to day activities. The cases in my state are rising every day and me, my dad, and my brother keep pushing for her to stay home but she won’t under any circumstances. Her reasoning is that since most people in her office went home, that’s a better place for her to be. Wouldn’t this be more reason for her to stay home? 
I told her that there’s still a risk even with the little amount of people in her office. Her response was that “you’d have the same risk going to Walmart.” I reminded her that if she caught it she’d likely pass it unto me (20), my brother (20) and my dad (60) who has diabetes. It could also kill her. Her response: “it won’t happen to me”. Wtf? I love her a lot. She usually has great sense, but this situation has really thrown me for a loop and has me looking at her differently. The lack of awareness is disappointing. I don’t really know what else to say to her to make her snap out of this. She says she won’t move to home working unless the building shuts down. Her place of work has surrounding buildings shut down due to people testing positive, but I don’t think her specific workplace is planning on shutting down unless the governor gives orders to (which isn’t happening), or someone tests positive.

That I'd at least have some memory of my life imprinted. Some kind of meaning. But no. I'm just disposable, invisible, and trash to those around me, it seems. That would be the only positive thing about suicide. People being affected in the slightest. 

That is an illusion. I used to refrain from suicide, because I didn't want to hurt a family member. They have been alternating between abusive and loving behaviors towards me, my whole life. But that's not the point. The point is, I have no obligation to anyone to exist. Even if it meant sparing them this alleged pain. Pain that requires people to care in the first place. Which they don't. In conclusion, I exist out of spite. Out of delusional hope, that things will somehow get better. Out of fear. Out of not being able to go through with it. I'm in deep pain. And all people can do is hate me for reveling in agony, like a pathetic worm. They despise me because of my pain. They look down on me because of it.

And I serve on a Healthcare Coalition comprised of local health departments, long term care facilities, hospitals, and trauma centers.


Nationwide, we are seeing shortages of medical supplies. National stockpiles have been tapped into, but the supply chain management (deciding who gets what, how much they get, and how it gets there) has mired state and local governments in red tape. Everybody wants a piece of the stockpile, and there's not enough to go around at the rate we're burning through the supplies. 


Manufacturers are having difficulty keeping up with the high demand. Truckers are getting things from point A to point B as expeditiously and cautiously as they can, but there are so many supplies moving right now that they too are having difficulty keeping up. This isn't to say that the workers in the manufacturing and shipping industries aren't doing a good enough job. They're clocking in and putting in the hours and effort, many of them working overtime or double shifts, and should be commended.


I'm no sociologist, but I would love to read a sociological take on the current happenings. From my perspective, we, collectively as a society, have established a paradigm of product stocking efficiency that it has become a fault. Under MOST cases: manufacturers make things only as fast as they will be consumed, distribution centers ship things out as soon as they get shipped in, and retailers sell things as fast as they hit the shelves. If you disrupt any links in that supply chain, the whole system is strained. If there's a sudden cessation of shipments between the distribution center and the store, the store simply won't have enough in stock to last more than a few days. Normally, they can withstand a truck breaking down here and there, or delays due to severe weather; but this outbreak has put a strain on our entire supply chain across the country.",25Mar2020,1

I was struggling to eat solid foods before the diagnosis and kind of just dealing with a lot of it getting stuck or coming back up, but I've since learned that doing that has serious health implications for me, and I was forced to suddenly and drastically change my diet. Because of the timing, and how fast covid cases increased here, I understandably haven't been getting a lot of support from my doctors, and I don't know how to eat yet. I already had some strong food aversions and a bunch of allergies that make the whole thing more complicated than what my doctor and I can manage in a quick phone call, and between chronic pain limiting my cooking time and not knowing what else to do, I've fallen into basically just eating a small rotation of the same foods while I process this whole thing and wait for when my doctors can provide me more guidance. I'm reaching out to others for help, so be assured that I'm not just resting on my laurels, but this shit takes time to learn, and even if I'm trying, Im not there yet. 

The big problem here is that between difficulty swallowing certain textures and restrictions from food allergies, I have to eat a large volume of food to maintain a healthy weight, since I can't do most meal replacement/protein shakes. So I'll walk up to the check stand with multiple boxes of oat milk or garbanzo beans or whatever, and I always feel super self conscious about it because I know how it looks. I bought 6 boxes of tomatos and two jars of tomato paste the last time I was out, but I also went through it all in less than a week because of the amount of soup I ate. Tomato soup is one of the few things I can usually get down and I cant pack it with oil or butter. I can puree veggies into it on days when my swallowing is less restrictive. I can do a lot of things with it and incorporate it into a whole weeks worth of meals. But to the guy in line behind me, I look like some asshole buying an unnecessary amount of tomato products. Nearly everything I buy right now has multiple applications for me, and it's also not like I just buy so much or so often that I'm depriving others of food. It's just that the only way I can eat safely and without discomfort is extremely restrictive. I'm maybe a month into finding out I had to make a major dietary change. I'm allowed to keep my focus narrow while I am overwhelmed and I learn to cope with the fact that my life looks very different now. Many others can choose to eat something else if a product is out of stock. There is plenty of food on the shelves in my countries food shops. It's just that most of it is not accessible for me. I know these things, but I'm still afraid I'll encounter misplaced hostility because it looks like I'm being a selfish jerk when really I'm just trying not to lose weight too fast during a pretty miserable period in my life.

That when they would ask me if I wanted to spend the night or go somewhere with them I would be like ,”well I can ask my dad but he’s very strict so he might say no.” But in reality my dad actually wanted me to go hang out with kids my age and wasn’t strict about things like going places with friends. 

  Anyway I would either secretly text my dad when I finally did get a phone that I was coming over to ask to go somewhere but for him to say no that we had plans or that just say no. Or if they lived really close by in my neighborhood when we would start walking to my house I would be like “race you!” Then run off like my life depended on it and run inside my house and shut the door and say very quickly to my dad ,”ok I’m going to ask you something in a few moments and just say no ok?!”. Then quickly run out of the house and shut the door and pretend to be waiting a few steps from the door for my friend. 

    Sometimes he would screw me over on purpose though so that I was forced to hang out finally. Because I would ask and he would just be like ,”sure sounds like fun!” And if I was going somewhere he would even open up his wallet and hand me a 20 or if it was a sleep over he would even say ,”oh don’t forget to pack your toothbrush.” All while I gave him the death stare and shook my head no when my friend wasn’t looking at me. 

    I remember one time at a sleepover I called my dad crying for him to pick me up when I was like 8 or 9 and he was just like no try and have fun. You can do this. And boy did he regret that decision because I waited until every fell asleep in the house, I packed my backpack and walked all the way home like at one in the morning then climbed over my backyard fence. And went through the back door and went into my bedroom without anyone noticing. And was just thinking ,”well what if he gets up to get a drink of water or go to the bathroom or something I don’t want him to see me sleeping in my bed and get mad.” So me being the idiot that I am dragged my big comforter into my closet and slept on my secret bean bag behind my dresser in there.(Yea no my dad had no clue that I had a bean bad in there since it was out of view. I mean he had to know that I had a beanbag since he got it for me but I guess he just never really questioned where it was. And this bean bag in my closet was out of view (I can’t really explain it but you couldn’t see my bean bag by looking into my closet or even by moving some things around you would just have to know that I was in there) and I was a pretty skinny and small short human until so I was like the size of a 6 year old at this point.

   Anyway that morning my friends dad called my dad freaking out saying that they looked everywhere for me and that I wasn’t there and asked if I happened to be home and he looked in my room and couldn’t find me.

...And then I woke up. With my husbands back pressed against my face. My nose completely smooshed and covered. I got out from underneath his shoulder and gasped for air. My husband, must have rolled over on my face in his sleep. I gently massaged and checked my nose as it was hurting. I was glad that I could finally breathe but slowly I came to the terrifying realization that I could have suffocated to death if I didn’t wake up in time.

I took few deep breaths and then woke up my husband to tell him what happened and asked him if we could keep the lights on for a while to ease my anxiety. He felt very guilty and scared about this whole situation. I could hear in his voice he was almost crying... Judging by how good are marriage is I can assume he was crying because he was scared he would lose me, not because his attempt of killing me failed (sorry for the grim joke).

It’s 5 am now and my nose is still a bit sore. I might be getting a headache too. I don’t think I will fall back asleep. I’m thinking of how I can prevent this from happening in the future...

Tl;dr - tonight I could have died suffocated by my own husband as he fell asleep on my face, but I woke up in time.",25Mar2020,1

45,"2017 to say the least was so far the best year of my life. I was 19, I was with a girl I was crazy into, I had role models and family that I looked up to, I had no responsibilities as it was my first summer free of school, senior year too so my classes weren’t serious. I spent the whole year living it up. I went on a cruise with my family. I had my first kiss with said girlfriend, it was the first year I fell in love. First year I experienced sexuality with said girl. First year of me driving with my license. It was my year at a dead end job with my best friends laughing it up and working minimal wage. First summer I had a legit group of friends I saw constantly and we hung out a lot. 

Essentially everyday of that year I was out cruising, listening to the 2017 bops like awaken my love, beerbongs, damn, saturation’s 1-3, it was a great year for music too. If I wasn’t driving I was with my girlfriend, my girlfriends family, my family, my friends, our big group, or working. 

I’m only 21, turning 22, but it was the best year of my life. Most of those thing’s that made it so great are gone. My friends left the job, the girl dumped me at the end of 2018, the group dissolved over drama and college, and now I’m at college in an apartment by myself in quarantine.

I think about death and suicide so often. I’ll put on songs from that year and pretend to relive it. I go through my camera roll and whatever pictures are vaguely left after me deleting all the couples pictures, I try to connect the relation of that year. 

Don’t get me wrong, 2018, 19, and now 20 have distinct memories for me, but none of them compare to my year of 2017. It felt innocent, I feel like I lost my innocence after that year. I went through a bad breakup, I lost a lot of role models, I lost support, my friend group distances through college. I worked my ass off to be here now and still be breathing, but it feels dark now and less vibrant in life.

I have had a girlfriend since, I’ve made new friends and met new people, but most of it feels empty as to what I felt like I experienced then. Am I just reminiscing the past? How do I stop letting this year take over me?",25Mar2020,1

48,"Hello- I am feeling very guilty. I am 22 and live about 4 hours away from my parents in a dorm.

Over my spring break (2 weeks ago), my mom and i took a trip together out of country. by the time we got back, COVID essentially erupted in the US, so my mom, dad, and i have been quarantined at their house. 
i was mad at first since i had initial plans to move in to my boyfriends house (by my uni) and move out of my dorm. they told me not to go, so i stayed. i realize now it was irrational being mad, but i think i didn’t completely grasp the severity at that point of time. 

now, a week and a half later, i am a changed person LOL. i realize it was important for me to stay. i was a bit distant with my parents while i’ve been here, but opened up the last few days. i’ve been anxious (lost my job, kicked out of dorms, school changes, and general paranoia) and depressed, which is normal- but it has definitely escalated.

i need to get my shit out of my dorm by the 31st. i could wait, but then wouldn’t be able to get any of my things until the school allows. i have all my books, clothes, etc in my dorm that i want to get out- as i only packed stuff for our 5 day trip. I then will move to my boyfriends house.

i feel selfish for leaving now. like ive been excited to leave, and now i’m worried i’m leaving them during a bad time. they both work from home and have a lot of friends they chat with- as well as hobbies. i just am the only child and feel like i’m really hurting their feelings. my mom asked me when i would be coming back ( it’s hard to predict because i don’t want to even slightly risk them getting ill) and my dad asked me if i’m excited to go. i said not necessarily. 
ultimately, i want to go. i haven’t seen my partner in a month. i just don’t want to hurt their feelings.
i think i just need some justification- is it selfish of me to go? i feel kinda sad.",25Mar2020,1

Ok so where do I start, um soo I’m dating a girl we have been dating for like an year and couple months. We also had this issue in our relationship. She is very insecure about her body imagine and anything having to do with her appearance. She finds herself very ugly compared to people online, people we go to school with, etc.... 

I just haven’t found how to get her to see her worth and it does suck and does take a toll on any improvement on her side. She isn’t close to being ugly or anything. However she doesn’t see it.

It also gotten to the point where she feel insecure about the things she likes such as Kpop and being that quirky girl I know. When we are alone she is super quirky like singing out loud and being herself but once out in the world she holds back such as telling people her favorite band and being herself. I see like more of a serious person, she holds back a lot of happiness you can kinda see the strain. She had said that’s she doesn’t even try to think about holding back but it’s in her back of head constantly worrying about people’s thoughts on her or giving her validation. 

She has mentioned that she feel insecure about the people I’ve dated before I got with her. She feels that she isn’t as pretty as them. 

I don’t how to help or anything. I just really want her to feel comfortable in her skin.",25Mar2020,1
50,So I was with this guy I guess you can say in an off and on thing and recently he ended things because he wants to focus himself and get rid of the baggage he has from a previous relationship and I’m still hurt because of how he did it and just everything that had happened. I tried to understand why he did it and all and me being me decided to just be friends with him because I truly care about him. I didn’t want him to just stop talking to me like I didn’t exist and I still love him and that’s why I said we can just be friends. I truly want the best for him and so anytime he’s not feeling okay I try to be there and ask and ask if he’s okay if he needs to talk about anything and sometimes he does not always. I try to make him laugh by sending him jokes or pictures. Recently I made the mistake of telling him how I felt like truly felt and I guess it made him feel bad since the reason I’m hurt is because of him. So I told myself I wouldn’t say anything else to him regarding my feelings which is hard since he became my best friend and I would tell him everything. I feel like I am scared that if I say how I feel it would only make him stop texting me completely and I don’t want that. So today isn’t a good day for me I’ve been really sad and I guess he noticed and asked if I would be okay....and I said not to worry and he said...okay and went to sleep. Idk why but this truly hurt a lot and I guess it’s because of how much I still try to be there for him even though I’m hurt but also because before he would of definitely kept asking me if I was okay and made sure I was okay and then gone to sleep. It hurts to much because I feel like I’m way too nice and I shouldn’t be but I care about him and I feel like I have to be there as a friend to point him in the right direction. But yes it hurts because I overthink and rn I’m just thinking he doesn’t care anymore. Idk I am still trying to understand that we’re not together so of course somethings would change.,25Mar2020,1
51,"My uncle told me i should not be reliant that i live with my family and that im a disappointment because i quit my previous job (because i couldnt do graveyard anymore). And after that, i got a job at the theatres which I loved and finally had friends because I just came here to the USA.

I loved my job but eventually got laid off because of the virus thing. Now, i feel really frustrated and confused of what is it really trying to tell me.

One week into quarantine, my mom told me i cant live like this because she told me that I was a heavy burden for the house since I will only function by eating and sleeping for the rest of the days..she told me it was really my fault.

I got really pressured and anxious and sad about what she said. I couldnt look for any other urgent jobs than the GROCERY.

53,"Obviously life's weird for everyone right now with this coronavirus thing happening, sorry if what I'm about to write sounds like I'm whining. Maybe I am a little... Maybe it's just something I gotta get off my chest.

Last two years have been crazy tough for me. In 2018 my wife and I separated after almost 2 decades together thought we were mostly happy, definitely didn't think we were irreparable, apparently she felt different. Lost my job at the same time as that happened. Went from 6 figures myself to like literally zero for far too long. Have been doing consulting work in my industry since then, but was only clearing less than a 1/4 of what I had been making. Thankfully I have a great family and they helped me through it so I didn't turn out homeless or hungry. Paid WAY too much to an attorney just because of our kids didn't even have any assets to split.

After like 18 months of 1st interview after 1st interview with different companies I FINALLY got an offer for a position making what I should be (still only 2/3rds of what I had been but a respectable salary none the less) but and was ready to start the job and get back out on my own again. Was supposed to start this past Monday, March 23rd.. This past Friday got notified that they were pushing the start 2 weeks. Hey, at least I still can expect to be there, but now I'm anxious af to get on with life. 

Great news, though.... Was going crazy looking for a condo to rent, and freaking out because I had planned to take a distribution from my 401 to cover moving expenses until the market started taking last week.. Thankfully heard yesterday that one of my great friends who's a realtor and has been looking for me, too, that a couple he has known for like 30 years is looking for a short term tenant at a super nice house they had to sort of unexpectedly had to move out of.. One person got a new job in another state and moved 3 months ago, their husband left last month to be there permanently now.. And, get this... Nearly a million dollar house, mostly furnished... And I'm only going to be paying like $500/mo..month to month while I look for something more permanent, but they're maybe open to a lease option.

Hopefully this craziness in life right now blows over soon without more interruption to my plans. 


Idk why I felt compelled to share this... But I don't really have anyone else to brag about it to. So, say a prayer for me or meditate some positivity towards me, burn a candle or do a dance...

54,"For context, I'm 18 and throughout my life i have swapped homes between my mother and my father many times and neither seemed to be right for me. For the past few years i have lived with my dad and after i had another ""argument"" with him i decided to vent about it in a letter:

Dad,

&amp;#x200B;

	If you won't let me tell you this to your face, then i guess i'll just have to improvise. I'm writing this mostly to vent but still to tell you why what you are doing is wrong. Let's go back a little bit. When I was born, what went through your mind? Did you anticipate that we would eventually get here? Two people with the only thing that connects them being their blood? You have done so much wrong for me I don't know where to even begin. You never taught me how to grow up. You never made even an attempt to raise me, and don't tell me providing a roof and a full stomach is ""raising"" someone because that's not even close to what a child really needs. From a very young age i was introduced to the concept of depression the hard way, but you probably wouldn't care all that much considering how much you dismissed it when i tried to tell you personally. I honestly don't expect you to even read this far into this or give a shit about it in the first place because that's who you are. You know, i used to wake up every day with the purest of intention and the most motivated attitude i could possibly conjure up and yet after all these years of constant arguing and belittling I now wake up every day thinking how wrong my day will go. Is this what you wanted? Did you want your son to feel this way about you? Did you even want a son in the first place? It's gotten to the point where hearing you cough due to your black smoker's lung, your voice, or a noise you made through the wall fills me with hate because it notifies me of your presence. My happiest moments these days are when you aren't around. You constantly tell me to do all of these things that require the guidance of your parents to achieve, but you don't want to actually guide me yourself. In fact, you NEVER have. I hate to get so heated in the middle of this but seriously, you have been such a fucking shit father man. You would seriously rather smoke fucking weed and watch some shit third party, pirated movie or tv show than make any sort of effort to heal the destroyed bond between you and your son. Seriously i fucking hate you so god damn much for that, it makes me want to punch you sometimes; and i know you are gonna try and come up with some fucking excuse for it like ""i'm sorry i'm a shit father but what do you want me to do about it? I know i'm a shit father."". That's probably what you would say. Acknowledging your mistakes doesn't mend anything, you are just relaying things to me that i already know. You need to be there for your child when they need you. In my most trying times where was my father? Oh right, high off his ass watching fucking south park in our ghetto kitchen. Great fucking father i got set up with. i never had anyone to talk to growing up. I dealt with my issues with no help whatsoever and it turned me into the emotionless shithole i am today. You were supposed to teach me how to be a man. I don't even know how to tie my own god damn shoes. My stepfather taught me more about how to be a man and he's a drunken asshole. I'm starting to see a connection here. Maybe if i wasn't forced by my parents to bottle up my emotions i would be somewhere different today. Don't you remember? Whenever i got angry and tried to let my emotions out in the healthy way, you always told me to ""shut up"" and ""stop acting out"". Well look where that got me. I wish i was more like i was years ago. I used to go out and make friends and think nothing of it, but this horrible, awful attitude i unfortunately adapted from you has squashed any hopes of that happening. I hope you are fucking happy. I feel so bad for my little cousins because they have to endure it from you too. I pray that they don't grow up to be like you because i know for god damn sure i want to be nothing even close to what you are. I can't wait for this quarantine to end so i can shut you out and move on to a brighter future without your shit choices as a father hanging over my head.

55,"I feel like I am going to cry. It's 5am and I haven't slept because I can't stop dwelling on this. I am 16, and my clit is over an inch long and about a cm wide. It's almost like a little penis on top of my vagina. I have a problem with masturbation that I developed very recently and I can't stop, because it's the only way I can feel beautiful for a moment. Half of the time I feel disgusted while doing it. I think I might have a hormonal issue but my doctor won't listen to me. I don't know what to do, I feel so disgusted and revolted by myself, I have looked at vulva galleries and things but no one I saw there had a clit like mine, which makes me feel worse about myself. 

I'm afraid no man will be attracted to me when I take off my clothes, or worse, that he will fetishize it. I have seen the r/bigclit subreddit and it makes me feel like an absolute freak. I am scared to have sex in the future because of it. I have no one to talk to about this so I don't know what to do.

Is it possible to make it smaller without resorting to surgery? I don't want to lose sensation. I just hate it so much and feel like a man. It along with the loss of my period gives me horrible gender dysmorphia. 

I hate reading articles about female health because they always describe the clit as something you can barely see, something guys have a hard time finding, the size of a pea, most of it is inside the body etc. I have never had so much gender dysmorphia before.

And now there are tears....

56,"I live in UK and of course we're on lock-down right now. I'm not an idiot, I'm not going into the city for anything except shops or hospital now. However it happens there's an Asda 2 miles away in one direction . The Asda is reachable on foot but only without groceries; I would need a bus back. The others are 3 miles and require public transport or are an hour's walk. I can't drive. When I had gone into food panic mode this is where I got my groceries from. Local corner shops are constantly out of bread, milk, fruit and so on. 

Well my sister is a recently qualified nurse and is stressing the severity of the situation (like I didn't already know, I'm a hypochondriac ffs, now I hear that I am RIGHT to think that way?!) She went from advising I look for work in the shops to saying to stay home whenever possible. But in addition to this decided that I should not be using public transport. 

Because I am afraid of my mother and sister I basically put them on a pedestal of authority equivalent to the police. So their demand is in my head pretty much equivalent to what Boris has legally imposed. To best of my knowledge it's OK (it is not illegal, I will not be fined) getting a bus provided it's as infrequent as possible, once a week say. I've seen people on the bus. I could be wrong in this and haven't chanced it. I don't even LIVE with my mum and sister but they still think they can set some of the rules in my house. Mum has been known to rearrange my cupboards and then criticise how much stuff I have in them (this was before lockdown and before panic buying.)

The result is a situation like the following: 

I had half a chicken balti can from the cupboard yesterday. Unfortunately something happened online which spiked my anxiety and meant I ate late, and by the time I had finished preparing and eating I had to for a lie down. I passed out on my bed about an hour after eating. Woke up 3-4 hours later to remember my kitchen was a mess and all the lights were on :( the second half of the can was still out there, at room temperature.

I have a choice, either eat the can and risk food poisoning, which I understand the NHS will not thank me for right now [I think I'll throw this one away idk], or throw it away and if this keeps happening (and it's likely to) I'm going to have to go to the shops. As I say my best chances of being able to GET anything are in the big supermarkets like Asda, the big Tescos or Sainsburys. But my mother and sister have forbidden it and I am scared they'll find a bus ticket should I go (I won't be physically punished but their disapproval is painful) 

I can also buy online I suppose but a) they're sold out and b) I'll still have to justify this to them both

57,"I’m a 25 years old female who hasn’t dated anyone for 10 years. Within those years, I’ve experienced multiple sexual harassments/molestation and a few more before that.

Talking about sexual stuff turns me off and I lose interest. I’m a very open-minded person but that’s the only thing that makes me lose interest in a guy. I can’t help it, it happens every time. Is it like a defense mechanism from my previous experiences?

60,"After re-reading what I just wrote down there, let me just preface and say - I have never, ever ranted this hard before. I’ve never been in a physical fight before, I’m a perfectly healthy young guy in his mid 20’s whose never laid a finger on anyone and everything that I say here is just out of rage (not actual threats), to let off my chest. With that said.

I can’t believe a few people are willing to blow over millions of lives getting sick and die all because of his shit incompetence throughout this whole thing. I literally had one small sliver of hope that his briefings these past few days might of brought some sort of humanity in him after everything. I stopped watching his press briefings after the fourth one just for the news to correct his fumbles. I cannot believe a few people’s shitty leadership can affect this many people so fucking easily it’s fucking ridiculous. This is how you get people to fucking riot, cuz I swear to god if I see my parents bedridden in their house without any medical care I’m throwing a god damn chair through that Oval Office along with many others who are on the same boat (-Disclaimer- for my safety, obviously I’m not actually going to do it, but this is how I feel). You have fair ground of speech to say whatever the fuck you wanna say that can be taken extreme by your followers, yet you get away with it on live tv. So let me go spade to spade to how I think of this the way you’re treating me as an individual. You want to know what true anger looks like? Anger that makes people not care about getting sick but rather fix a corrupt system by punching you right in the fucking face just to feel something for once? You want to piss off a nation whose generally pacifistic about things? well here’s your chance. Keep fucking things up old man, or millions of Americans are gonna have you burn with us cuz you have nowhere to run. I will shove that driver head-first up your fucking lardic ass spilt with Covid-19. Fuck this president.

And for anyone who says we should have everyone go back to work very soon because of the economy, go fuck yourself. Seriously, go fuck yourself. Everyone going back to work doesn’t solve this problem, not even fucking close. This is fucking with everyone’s families, livelihoods, mental/physical health. What the fuck is worth living if half of the people you know are getting sick or dying? You don’t shrug it off, you fix that shit one way or another by fixing the system or in rare cases in history, (which I do hope never comes to this point) overthrowing it. This virus is pushing a good amount of people to the edge of fear, anger and loss. It only gets worse each day if we don’t do anything about it, Stay-in-Home orders isn’t enough for some people don’t listen/respect the WHO/CDC or the governers’ requests (the one’s who can work remotely, yet still leave the house). calling everyone back to work in a few weeks is the stupidest most counterproductive thing ever, giving bailouts to major corporations is mind-blowing yet workers living paycheck-to-paycheck won’t be able to afford food in the next few weeks. You push Americans to the point of having nothing to lose, you’re gonna see something uglier than a pandemic happening. 

“The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose.”

You are treading very close to knowing what that means, Trump. 

Money and power won’t save you from Anger.

62,"I've recently started to feel extreme fatigue which I thought was from all nighters \[it's spring break\] then I've developed a small fever with headaches and a dry cough. Which yeah could be COVID-19 but I thought it could also be a cold. In my county there's only been 3 cases and they were out of state \[one from europe.\] The chances should've been low. But all my doubts are gone; I have pneumonia symptoms. It's not hard to breathe but my lungs feel really cold. I don't know what I'm going to do, I've taken measures to avoid spreading it to my family. Though considering incubation periods are two weeks, there's a chance they're already infected. 

&amp;#x200B;

This just sucks. Due to childhood issues, I've always had depression. I attempted to or was tempted to take my life several times. Only recently I decided to rebuild everything, try to live like an actual human being and I started taking steps to build a future. I fought through a lot of social issues I had and tried hard to be more understanding of people. Trying to build a more positive view of the world and then this happens. I want to hope maybe its bronchitis, I've always suffered from bronchitis previously.  Though I highly doubt it at this point.  I might just stay in bed until I eventually die or something, I have no point in living now considering that I've been told that once  COVID-19 gives you respiratory problems, you're a goner regardless of age. My mother has had HUGE respiratory problems and she would 1OO% die from this, I don't want that. I don't know what to do, I'm scared and I feel alone. I feel like life just stabbed me in the back.

72,"A quick background, we are a relatively healthy married couple in the State of Georgia. We have been trying to have a baby (first time) for about 5 months now. My wife missed her period, and in mid March did a test which came positive. Did 2 more tests at home, then went to clinic to get tested and all came positive. We are waiting to share news with family and friends until later (reason for throwaway) until about 8-12 weeks. Obviously we are both very excited and couldn't be happier. 

But with this whole Coronavirus thing going on, it creates a lot of tension for us. Just to be clear, I was always taking this virus seriously and firmly believe in staying home. We stopped going to public places unless it was for groceries and stuff like that like over 3 weeks ago. Both my jobs are in media/broadcasting so I still physically go into work. But I am only going to and from work. If I do have to go to a market, then I would wear mask (my job provided one for me) and gloves. And my main job is doing a relatively good job and keeping things disinfected and only having essential employees come in. Most of the staff is working from home. My wife stopped going to work 2-3 days after she tested and then her business closed shortly after, so she is mostly staying home.  

However, since her clinic visit, the doctor/nurse has told her to not go anywhere outside. She's sort of been freaking out a little, worrying for herself and baby. She has been living at home alone for past few days (her entire family lives overseas) and without a job or anything, it's starting to get to her. Living with my parents/family is an option, but unfortunately my Mom just came back from overseas and my Dad is not taking this seriously at all, running unnecessary errands like everything is fine. So we haven't gone to their house, nor do I plan to for at least 2 weeks. 

We are both generally positive people, but there are times where paranoia takes hold. Like I had a package from Amazon come in, and saw made in China on the box, and just left it outside. It was actually something I got for my wife and after I told her, she said ""yah just leave it outside."" I know what you're thinking, but it doesn't hurt being more cautious right? I don't know...

This whole situation is horrible. A global pandemic which has a potential to get worse before it gets better. Her brother is living in Italy so she realizes the seriousness of it all. At the same time, it gets to us sometimes, as this would normally be a time for celebration, excitement, preparations; yet here we are worried and stressed out about the possible danger out there. 

So I guess I'm posting here to see if anyone else is in a similar situation to see how you are handling it. Or if anyone has any additional information on pregnancy during these challenging times. 

Stay safe and stay home, everyone.",25Mar2020,1
74,"I'm stuck in a cycle of blaming myself for being responsible and not wanting to be a person who blames others for their problems. I'm 18, and going back a ways I can't remember when I wasn't incredibly hard on myself to succeed. As I got older I began to notice that people (my mother specifically) blamed others for their problems and didn't let you be angry at them. I began to recognize my mother always shifting the blame on to me, even as a child, to be better even in her slights, and I think that may be where my inner voice comes from, telling me that I can never be angry at someone else because fundamentally I am at fault too. I never felt I had the right to be angry at her or anyone, because in the end I shouldn't have made the mistake. I don't know if I've just decided to think that and am becoming a worse person for it, but I know I struggle with believing it's not always my fault and expressing when I'm angry for feel slighted by someone. Even typing that felt wrong, but it's what I'm thinking. I think about my dad too, how he says mean, dismissive things to me when I bring up an issue with him or even an idea, and then gets angry if I'm too upset to respond, or if I do respond and tell him I'm upset, he tells me I can't be upset. I tell myself I shouldn't be upset because what right do I have to feel that way towards the people who feed me and clothe me and love me. I can't tell if me never being allowed to be angry at my parents is a result of my own self-critic or if I've been taught this from a young age. I feel like I'm victimizing myself too much, I just don't fucking know.

However, I am realizing I'm miserable and woefully unequipt to deal with others in a respectful way that is sensitive to their feelings. I worry about relationships and have trouble communicating wants and needs. It took going through an assault and completely blaming myself before I started to wonder if it really wasn't my fault at all. I just can't tell. I don't want to be weak like my mother or harsh like my father, and I don't want to blame them for anything, but I know something isn't right and I need to fix it.

""SURROUND YOURSELF WITH LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE""

80,"Long story short, I live in middle Europe and we have around 220 cases here, no one is dead yet. I am 20 years old and I still live with my parents and little brother. I followed news about covid-19 since February. I read everything about it, watched all youtube videos from China and followed how you can do protect yourself. Even when my country was coronavirus-free.  

About three weeks before first case here. My mom is nurse and they had new rules here because of virus. So I asked her everything about it. In China died lot of doctors and nurses who treated patients. I won't lie to you, I was so scared and I still am. And when I am scared, I have to talk about it. So I was trying discuss this with my parents about four days. They mostly ignored me or told me not to worry. Then one night, I talked with my mom about theories about Coronavirus. And then it came. She called dad and they both started yelling at me about me being crazy. They took my computer and wanted take my phone. And I know, that my dad checked everything in my computer that night. And again, I am 20!! They said that it is not normal for young girl to care about illneses and death all time. Then they asked me if I want kill myself, or if I think that they are bad parents or if they spent more time with the my brother than with me. The last is truth but I was okay with it. My brother is momma’s boy and needed them more than me. I always liked to be on my own. Even when I was child. 

Anyway, for you to know my dad’s sister suffer from some kind of schizophrenia. I don’t know exactly what it is but without her pills, she would be complete mess. It started when she was 17 years.  This is partly reason why they acted like this. I told them, I am fine, I like living and was just concerned about deadly virus. Next day, my mother called doctor and brought me pills to calm down. I didn't wanted to take them but she screamed at me again. That she will called doctor here and even locked me in mental institution if I don’t do this. I was taking them for two weeks and I was so tired all the time. Slepted almost all day. Never told it anyone. My mother and dad always screamed at me when they wanted me do something what I didn’t wanted to do. Like my choice of schools or mine friends. They never abused me, like I mean didn’t beat me. Most of time they let me do what I want. I know, they love me but they don’t like me. They don’t my character.

82,"Have you ever had an acquaintance or even a friend that you know said something not-so-nice about you or treated you in some offish, dismissive or offensive manner and expects you to ""be alright"" with it? Let's say this individual does not ***expect*** you to have the intellect, sensitivity or depth to see what they did or said *""for what it really was."" Just for conversation's sake, let's ALSO add that whatever this person did, said or the rudeness they displayed was so messed up that there is absolutely no room to pretend they didn't know their actions were rude, dismissive, disrespectful or hurtful* Now depending on the type of individual you're dealing with, they might do one of two things as follows:

1. He or she will get quiet; play dumb and/or talk around the entire issue to avoid discussing it, explaining themselves and to protect their pride so they don't have to apologize and face up to their own wrongness.
2. He or she might even stop speaking to YOU or calling because they ALREADY know you're probably pissed off so they play the waiting game to let you ***cool off and/or quietly accept*** their *rude, dismissive, disrespectful or hurtful words or actions. O*nce again... the get off without apologizing.
3. I must also add that sometimes people simply outgrow the friendship and it's hard to come out and explain this to the other person so they either act out or ghost on them, but Items #1 and #2 are the main components to this post.

*Meanwhile... neither of you come out and discuss the matter because YOU feel that he or she KNOWS or should already know what they did was wrong... and the other person doesn't seem to value your friendship, acquaintance or feelings enough to bother to* **ask** *""what's wrong"" when you stop calling, texting or even speaking to them. (Let's face it... you know this pisses us off even more.) Now keep in mind what I said in the second paragraph above because* ***this*** *is a situation where whatever this individual di or said to you was so egregious and messed up that there is absolutely* **no** *room to pretend they didn't know their actions were rude, dismissive, disrespectful or hurtful.* You also feel that even if you decide to stand up and come right the fuck out and TELL the offender how you feel, you already believe them to be the type of person who would tell you things like ""you're too sensitive"" or ""I do that to everyone"" or ""that's just the way I am"" etc... as if YOU are suppose to accept their bullshit as some sort of sick-ass norm (and you don't). Some people will take on an offensive/defensive position when confronted about the wrong things they do or say , and they will come right out and TELL you ""well if you don't like it then screw you"" or ""yeah I did it... now what are you going to do about it?""

Let's keep it real good people, and matters of age, gender, race, nationality or sexuality have nothing to do with the matter of one's instincts. Something in our hearts and minds ALREADY knows what type of individual we may be dealing with in these scenarios, and this is why both parties sometimes tend to deal with it by NOT dealing with and/or choose to quietly go their separate ways without conversation or a possible confrontation. They leave the matter as the unspoken understanding that it has become. Maybe the two of you will find a way to communicate your thoughts and feelings in the future, but the mental chemistry, maturity, intellect and sensitivity needed to deal with the situation is just not there right now and the unspoken understanding that it's best to just stop communicating prevails... and sometimes it's actually better this way, and guess what... you don't *need* these type of people in your life anyway.

The type of situations I described are things that many, many people experience but find it awkward and even hard to come out and discuss with the offender or with others because they are afraid of appearing too sensitive or weak... and unfortunately SOME people can make us feel or appear this way because they are so manipulative, conniving and just plain know how to play those games! Now... maybe... just maybe... it's time to stand up to some of these sons-of-bitches with whom we are forced to share the planet... and IF you find yourself in a situation where you have to settle for a non-apology and some sorry-ass unspoken understanding that ""this is the way it is""; ""I don't care how you feel"" or ""you need this friendship but I don't"" ***then leave that person completely alone*** at least until he or she evolves and is willing to take responsibility for their actions and words.",25Mar2020,1

At the end of the interview, he said that he wanted to provide feedback as he does to all(?) the people he interviews in order to help them with later interviews for other companies or maybe even their company. He said I used “like” 40-70 times in the interview (I don’t even remember saying it once but maybe it’s a habit that I’ve never noticed before) and that that’s an issue in making calls to his clientele.

It means I don’t trust myself, in terms of what I feel or think about things. I doubt my life choices, and second guess if they were/are the right ones. Anxiety means I have to convince myself I’m doing ok. That I can get through today, only to have to start the process again tomorrow. Anxiety means I’m not doing the tasks I know need to be done, even the smallest ones. Anxiety means my heart is broken, but I don’t know why. It means I will sit and dread on that thought for too long, instead of being productive. Anxiety means I am trapped inside my head, and for what? It means I am egocentric, because I can’t stop thinking about how fucked up I feel.

My first porno I watched was the Kim Kardashian sex tape, when I watched it I just found it interesting but didn’t feel the urge to wank.

Throughout uni too I would watch the odd porn video but never had a wank.

Earlier this year I did try and have a wank for the first time, I had no clue what to do except rub my penis up and down at different speeds and was told to have a lots of moisturiser by me. I tried by watching porn and rubbing but my dick was hard and it was hurting after a few minutes wanking so I stopped.

I tried again today and I made sure I was ready again with moisturiser and tissues and I was watching porn and it didn’t work, so I decided to have the porn as background noise while I was scrolling through pictures of girls on my insta and I was a lot more turned on (dunno whether this is weird or not) and once again my dick was like a stick and was hurting after a while.

I kept on going and going (cause I think I am very sexual frustrated) and I eventually cummed, I thought I was going to piss myself until I saw a white liquid come out. 

Overall it was a good, a long overdue wait but I still don’t have the urge to wank again and my penis is still hurting a bit.

Laying in the hospital bed and crying because I was relieved to be with the people who loved me.

125,"I live in Washington State, where the first case of COVID-19 in the US was hit. And I work at a grocery store which as of Governor Inslee’s 2 week “stay-indoors” order, will remain open. We have our 6 ft social distancing regulation, but I know that a good majority of customers won’t take too long to forget about that. Not only that, after finding out that I never had any benefits from my position, that I should have. (Medicaid, 401k, etc.) I started part-time, but now I work full-time in the produce department. Been working 2 years now. And learned that our store was lucky enough to not raise our wages unlike the rest of the stores around here. Had to ask to change locations to feel safer. 

But with the county’s cases rising, I especially don’t feel safe. I’m 20 years old, overweight. Had a good amount of anxiety attacks at work already. Been wearing a mask that honestly does nothing to feel a bit safer. 

I already have some things that I could do at home. Such as a few film scripts that I’ve been working on for awhile, a comic/graphic novel that I’ve wanted to turn into reality. And overall my health. My parents are all fortunate enough to be working from home.

We haven’t spoken since our breakup at the end of last October, 5 months ago. I still think about him and wonder if he ever thinks about me. I don’t even know what I was looking for in texting him, but knew I’d have to make my own mistake and just exorcise this thought in order to make it go away.

127,"I am a 19 year old male, from Asia (please avoid prejudice, I am in a crisis)

So the background is - I am born to parents who are unusually, and by that I really cannot stress this enough, ASOCIAL to their very soul. I come from a developing country, where farming is given importance. My father is a lecturer at a college, meaning he is very well educated. And my mother is very well qualified too. Both have their MAs. 

But the problem is very real for me. My mother wanted to become an administrative bureucrat, she did not succeed. As a result, 9 year old me would bid farwell to my childhood. My mother withdrew me from the rest of the world, and my father allowed. What would I do for the next 5-6 years? I would spend entirety of my time at home aside from the one in school, watching whatever-the-hell-that-aired on the TV. Mostly cartoons. And in the later years, I would spend 12 hours a day on my PC doing useless crap. Imagine, at max, I was 14 years old.  

My childhood in school went with little to no friends. As a result of these two things,  I was hallucinating by the time I passed my 10th grade exams, and as a result, I got a psych referral. The psychiatrist prescribed me antipsychotics and tranquilizers. By the time I was 16, I was in a full blown, made up world. It went like -

Doctors would keep watch on me. And while I slept, would do things like removing parts of my brain without leaving any stitches. The police wanted me to die even as they continue to know about my crimes (posted remarks againat my country on Facebook back in 2011-12) so they allowed the torture.

But the meds did their part, and I stopped hallucinating by the 10th month. As I recall, my mental health was very bad even after 10 months of treatment with high doses of God knows what. I would smile at my doctor, ear to ear wide, whenever I would visit his office for treatment, even though I thought he was torturing me every day with team of his colleagues. I withdrew from all the psych meds 7-8 months ago, and I can feel I am MUCH better. I'll get to that, hold on.

And so, I recovered bit by bit. I started to regain my sanity, but my parents never supported me. They still do not. I can make very, very quick progress socially. I am NOT socially awkward. Girls and boys like me to limited extent, alike. That means I do not have developmental disability.

I think around 7 months ago, I thought critically why I was so lonely aside from my parents, who live the most pathethic life I can ever imagine. They do not treat me like I am a responsible adult male. They treat my 10 year old sister better than me (who is a princess, she is going to have a lot of problems ahead) and give her a tomboy treatment. I am still very neglected. All I have is a set of clothes (not very attractive or even not torn) and my mobile phone. And my books on mostly chemistry, physics and biology. 

So, it is not even the start of my problem. Please believe me, I will never ask for a funding. 

Ever since I was a child, I was 'very gifted' as my maternal relatives used to say. I never bent to my father's and mother's extremly anxious behaviour. They are so afraid of the society, we do not get any calls or knocks on the door aside from the bills. I am mentally hurt every time I hear ""just keep your head low, be quiet and come back after your classes are  over"" because, well, it used to happen every day before the Corona pandemic. I think they taught me that from my childhood.

That is the reason I hallucinated years ago, had to undergo the most severe punishment for my parent's mistakes which they will never realize. What is it? Social isolation. I am forced to withdraw from society by my parents, despite the fact I do not have any Disabling medical condition, except for moderately high myopia fully corrected by glasses.

So as I said 7 months ago, I decided I will not let anyone ruin my life. I decided to follow the example of my immediate uncle, who is a detective and formerly a Border Guarding Paramilitary Soldier. You get it, I must be proud very proud of him. And yes I am.

I was weighting 108kg months ago. Now I barely weight 101kg. And guess what? I think I have made some muscles while in the process of losing weight. I decided I will join the Armed Forces of my country. I can run half a mile under 6 minutes, but that is not half my actual ability.

The problem lies very deep inside the minds of my parents. It is driving me insane once again. I am a gifted person whose parents are not nurturing, but rather torturing him best to their ability. My father picks me up and drops me to the college. The little group of frienda I have, all are engages romantically to their respective girlfriends. It is not that they ignore me, but I find it very difficult to talk to them as much as I want. And this killa me.

And the problem is, since the Corona lockdown of our country, it's been 9 days since I got the much needed light of the sun hit my skin. I am breaking apart again. No breath of fresh air.


Did I mention my father makes over 1,000,00₹ a MONTH? And you know, I go to college with ill fitting clothes every day. With glasses. And if I want to join the Army (the only reason I kept myself alive after nearly succeeding suicide after 3 attempts), I must be medically, physically and mentally fill. First I must get my myopia fully corrected. I've been begging my father to make the apppintment with the eye surgeon I was referred to, he does not and I cannot pay for it and nor anyone else will. He is the definition of what you call ""deadbeat'"" He tells me we cannot afford a surgery costing no more than 50,000₹ at worst, with his monthly salary of double the amount. I doubt my medical fitness, because whenever I speak to a cop, I never remember what happens next. We just talk but have no idea why I don't forget the cop but rather what we spoke of. It's always something related to Police Recruitment though, that's the only reason why I approach a cop. 

So, moving beyond that, I am  having trouble understanding basic things -

1) can a person like me improve the condition of my nation. I am atypical to say at least.


2) Do we really care for each other as human beings?

3) Why would my parents do things like this to me, and be blissfully...  Bitter?

4) I love a guy friend of mine and he has no problem with that. Is it normal for my late teen years? To have same sex attraction despiste being I think straight?

5) Due to the trauma of my family who did the unimagnable to me, I have decided to never marry or have children. Is it okay for me to worry to a great extent persistently for the good of humanity? I am only 19.

6) Nobody is helping me leave a meaningful life and this is not the West where law enforcement is done very strictly against abuse. What should I do? I worry more about my Recruitment in the Police (Fedral or State, both are equally good for me) and the Armed Forces. Although of course anything is next to impossible with the mindset of my parents.

7) I've been isolated from the society yet I belive I am a  loveable guy with a major obstacleto get in touch with. I worry about society, and thoughts such as ""Will people even care if they anhillated each other for money? Why should I care"" and ""people only pretend to care for the sake of their partnera and children. I do not belong here in this world"" etc. etc. come to me.

8) again I would have not been so critical of my parenta if they were sane. My father literally acts like a chimpanzee. Even I get scared of this 58 year old man. He must be a psycho. Has an annual salary worth 12,000,000₹ but I have to wear torn sports wear and old dirt cheap shoes. I hears parents never let their kids down. He does not care for my dream of becoming a cop or  soldier to tge slightest  but mostly prohibts me from doing anything other than studying for my exams, brginning from first day of college, each year.

And it seems like no matter how long I hide it, I can't figure out how to solve my problem. When I am myself people are sometimes violent in response. I dont want to be hurt.

I am just such a dick I guess. I try not to be. I am more empathetic than a lot of people around me. I am ashamed of myself. I have no confidence or pride and I have no friends.

She told me that despite having so many unfulfilled dreams, she doesn‘t regret it because all she needs to be happy is her family close by.

I won't go into any details, cause I don't want to deal with any backlash from Ham, but overtime I started to notice the shortcomings with the company, and the leads' inability to look past their own ideas, which led to the state of the company now.

139,"Long post ahead.

Back story: A couple weeks back when coronavirus really started fucking shit up, I asked their thoughts and what their take is on how society and the economy are going to change. Capitalism is trash but Covid-19 has exposed it definitely isn't a sustainable way of living/existing. Along with health complications and death, our entire social constructs, communities and lifestyle are under threat.

This isn't the first pandemic nor is it the first human crisis (most people's privilege is showing tbh) but the entire world as we know it is about to change. Are we capable of rebuilding structure under capitalism or from our living rooms? Or are humans inherently so trash that this is only the beginning of the end and this is the best it's going to get until we are wiped the fuck out?

So my coworkers told me I need to pipe down and jump off the revolution bandwagon. This triggered my feeble emo brain into spiralling down physical and emotional isolation:

The world begins to crumble. Reality slowly stripping away, piece by piece. It almost feels like everyone is packing up, ready to leave the venue. But no one gave me the heads up. Where the fuck is everyone heading? Why are they taking all of this away? Are they going to come back for me? Will they remember I’m standing right here? Can anyone see me? Am I even real? 

24.8 years and I still don’t understand what’s going on. The one who missed the punchline. The one who was late to class. The last one to arrive. The one left behind. Desperate to connect to someone, something, anything. But I’m so lonely. Intoxicated with narcissism and deluded by the idea that the universe should care about my presence. Me me me me me. I hate me. I hate myself. I’m repulsed by the shadow casted by this rotten body. 

“What’s the point?” seems like the long-running joke. Stuck in teenage angst or is this what chronic depression feels like? I wouldn’t know – I dropped out of my psych degree. Can we base a theme around this? Maybe make a mood board or mind map?  

“We’re prescribing you this box of \~*antidepressants\~* which you will take alongside these \~*stimulant meds\~.* Would you also like some sleeping pills? How do you take your psyche cocktail - neat or on the rocks? Remember to take these twice, daily.” *Psychiatric gibberish floats across the room.* I don’t want your fucking medicine! The only unstable emotion I feel deep in my bones is the absurdity of this goddamn reality we’re in. 

Why aren’t you listening? You can hear me, right? Why don’t you feel the same way? Look around you. Take a step back and see the world through the eyes of a spectator. Think about the past, present and future. Think about time. Think about our three-dimensional world then feel the fourth. See the world through your relative’s eyes. See through a stranger’s. Now, an animal. Imagine experiencing consciousness through a mind that isn’t your own. Breathe in the existentialism. What do you feel when you exhale? What do you think of our current reality? Do you not agree this is all bizarre? Someone, someday made up some rules and the rest followed, which we continue to follow. Why the fuck have we allowed capitalism to progress this far?

We have been exposed to a new, highly infectious, deathly virus. People are dying in the most horrific ways. Bodies are piling up. We are probably sick without knowing it, what are the implications of this – aren’t you worried that you might develop some ghastly condition later on in your life? Or your loved ones? We’re stuck in our homes and death is knocking on our doors, waiting to see who's going to answer. Yet here you are still talking about business and marketing strategies. It doesn’t matter! You are lucky enough to self-isolate in your cosy home while there are refugees crammed into camps like chickens in a cage.

Why the fuck haven’t I been doing anything either? Why am I still working on this dumbshit article that doesn’t benefit anyone’s wellbeing? Why do we lack empathy and compassion? Why do we inflict so much violence among each other, other species and our planet? Why have we evolved this way? Is everyone genuinely happy and satisfied with this reality? Am I really crazy? Am I blowing this way out of proportion? I thought leaving the matrix would be empowering and liberating but shit’s just numbing and lonely. Maybe it’s best if I just plug back in and carry on with the rat race while waiting for the apocalypse to swallow us up.",25Mar2020,1

Loneliness

Do you ever just wake up and want a hug? Most times nothing is wrong, and you just want to feel loved and appreciated. Sometimes I just want a hug because I'm trapped in my head. Sometimes I start to think about how much I have been through and I feel like crying. Most times I do. I sit awake for hours some nights just thinking about everything. I wish I could just shut my brain off for ten minutes just to take it all in. 2016 was the most painful and important year of my life. In that one year I lost three close friends, but I gained so much more. I search for greatness to give meaning to my life. Or at least that's what I tell myself to wrap my head around my life. 2016 was the most painful year of my life. 

February 14, 2017 was the most painful day. My grandmother died on that day… and honestly I'm still trying to wrap my head around that statement. I wish I had someone to tell these thoughts to. Don't get me wrong I have wonderful and loving friends and family members, but no one will ever understand what it feels like to deal with so much death all before the age of twenty. I am twenty-one now and this should be the year where I am having the most fun. Instead it is a year where I’m searching for myself daily. I search for reasons to be happy, and to justify being alive. I'm not suicidal, but I contemplate it daily. I wonder if I go through with it would I see my loved ones again? I wish someone understood these thoughts. 

See. But that's my problem. I have a problem opening up to people on a intimate level. I crave attention, but I fear vulnerability. I guess that is because I feel like every time I open up to someone they take my heart, and use me for their own amusement. Then, when I serve them no purpose, I get thrown away. But the crazy thing is I will continuously put myself through this game because I want to be the one person who helps them with their problems. Well 

This process has made me lock myself in a cage of noise which I call my brain. I've been here so long I’m afraid to open up to the people around me. I am growing numb. I am starting to sit and wallow in my grief, alone, because I feel it is better to do that than allow someone else to destroy my heart again. I didn’t want to drag my loved ones down into this pit with me. One day, though, I want to have a wife and kids so I can give them all the love and attention I desire for myself wholeheartedly. I know my loneliness is temporary. All I can do is trust God and keep moving forward.

Is it crazy how I can be surrounded by others, but feel so alone. I struggle with loving myself when times get hard. I allow myself to fall in love with my negativity. I do this because it’s easier to stay in this cage instead of confronting myself. This is my daily battle. When my grandmother died I felt like my emotions were an ocean that I drowned in when this boat called my memories capsized and tossed me overboard. Yesterday, God asked me what I needed from him, and I just asked for the power to love myself. This is honestly my biggest struggle. For so long I felt like my circumstances weighed me down. I hated my situation which made me hate myself. Some people might applaud me for being this open about my pain, or for my accomplishments since my car accident, but I just look at my mistakes and flaws. I think that’s why I’m so cautious of people who say they love me. How can you love me if I’m searching for a reason to love myself?",25Mar2020,1
142,"Just started a new office job and now with an income source, what do I put it towards? 

I’m definitely thinking about a new guitar. I’m a beginner and I want an electric that’s good for a starter. I’m not really sure what that would be but my price range is somewhere within $200 and $300 so if anyone has a suggestion lmk.

Maybe I should change up my style a little bit. I could go for a more indie, down to earth kinda feel. Or maybe I could do something a little more “rockstar” like and boost my confidence a little. 

Idk. Just thinking out loud.",25Mar2020,1
143,"I'm so scared but can't let it show for my child's sake.
I have been off work with a collapsed lung for nearly 4 weeks, at the only appointment they could give me before all the clinics shut down the consultant said I had to stay home because the symptoms of the virus would be worse for me. 
My husband was working until yesterday. He's now in quarantine with symptoms. So neither of us can leave the house and it's highly likely that our son and I will contract it. 
I worry about groceries, we didn't panic buy so we're gonna run low soon. There are no delivery slots for weeks. Our kid is young enough to not understand the seriousness of the situation, which I'm actually thankful for. Our parents are elderly and in lockdown and I can't bring myself to ask anyone to risk themselves to help us. I know we won't be the only ones in this situation. 
I leave the room to cry when I think of all of the people suffering, so many in worse situations than ourselves. We've got it easier than most.
Everyone that's still able and having to work, I cannot express how thankful I am that you keep the lights and heating working, the food on the shelves, caring for the vulnerable, dealing with the waste, maintaining the water, delivering, cleaning, everything... keeping the world running. 
When I recover I promise to do my bit too. I feel so guilty but I am determined to pay it back when I can.",25Mar2020,1

146,"I saw it coming, but I’m super bummed that they decided to cancel it, instead of postponing it. They said we’ll still receive our degrees in the mail, but it still feels like I’m missing out on some rite of passage. I didn’t even get to take graduation pictures either since they were scheduled for April. I know this is probably not as bad as half our country going through lay offs and unemployment right now, but I just needed to rant.",25Mar2020,1
147,"So . this happen not one when i was young . I am 20 ish now . 
Mostly, I forgot the reason but mostly it was over nothing or something that she made up . 

but the only incident i remember was when it was my brother’s birthday . My dad, mom, bro and me were eating at steak place . And my dad just bought me clothing ( it wasn’t me who ask to buy it ) and my mom asked how much and just flipped . thing is it’s not like we have no money . i think it was just one of her crazy day . 
but i remember praying she would stop screaming , and she even threw utensil at me . and scream inwas lucky it didnt hit my eye and be blink . but it was in public and i saw the look of my bro’s face . he wasn’t ever surprise but i could tell he asked himself ‘ why it happen on my bday?’, 
then she proceed to guilt me of ruining my brother’s day . 

I now reach the age of knowing that it wasnt my fault (and confirmation that it is not me just to make sure), and kinda want some people  to know .

148,"I’m currently signed with a team that is really good and has a shot at making the finals, but I don’t have really any friends on that team. Everyone is nice on that team and don’t dislike me. But on another team I’m considering going to a different team (but I’d have to get myself cut from the team I’m on) that I have lots of friends on, but they’re destined to be at the bottom of the league. I want to be on a successful team but I also want to help out and continue to bond with friends, I know if my current team is successful I will have fun, but if I lose on the other team I’ll still have fun because I’ll be with friends. I don’t know which to go with",25Mar2020,1
149,"Immediately after I ended the call with my boss, I broke down into tears. I'm very indecisive, and so it was extremely hard to come to this decision. I feel like it is right given the circumstances, but I feel so sad. I already miss my coworkers. I know that I can still visit them, as it is a grocery store, but it won't be the same as joking around during late-night shifts with them. 

Some of my coworkers were very special to me, to the point that I felt they were like the grandparents and aunts and uncles I never had. I truly cherished my relationship with them, even though I know that to them I was probably just another kid working there. 

I think the worst part is that I won't even have a chance to say goodbye. When I fantasized about quitting, I always planned to give some of my favorite coworkers some gifts that would reflect on the good times we had together (Like this one old guy who always gave me life advice, we'd always trade gum flavors. I planned on writing a card and giving him a bunch of gum. It's stupid.) But I'm self-quarantining with my family right now, so I can't even do that. 

I was thinking about sending a text, but I feel like I'm probably not even that important to them. I don't want to bother anyone. 

I don't know. I feel sad. It feels like a break-up. I know it was right, but it sucks and I don't understand why, because I absolutely despised that place.",25Mar2020,1
151,"Obviously everyone around the world is suffering in some form or another. I keep seeing ridiculous memes about COVID-19 and it’s beginning to hit me like a freight train. My wedding was set to occur in the beginning of May and 2 weeks ago I still thought it would all be okay. Until now. My fiancé and I had to make the final decision to cancel the wedding, the honeymoon, and all the vendors we lined up. It really didn’t affect me until we finished the calls and looked at each other knowing everything has changed. Our lives are entirely different now than a month ago. We’re both stuck at home working, I’m trying to make sales over the phone with people who are in the same boat as I am, and my fiancé is having a hard time being temporarily laid off. 

I don’t know what the future holds for any of us, and I know things will eventually blow over but god dammit I’m just pissed off at everything that’s happened. This year can gargle my nuts.",25Mar2020,1
152," I feel like a break from my routine and a little celebration would take my mind off things. So here's what I'm thinking- my parents have 50 acres a few miles out of town. My husband and I could spend a night camping in the woods, have a few drinks and toast stuff. Call my friends and family, harass my parents and sister from the window. Bring the chess set and have some fun, maybe a few books to read aloud to each other.  Does that sound alright? Anything I'm not thinking about?",25Mar2020,1
153,Why does a bath bomb cost $6? I’m assuming it’s just soap and scent and dissolvable material. Probably costs a penny to press those three things into a sphere. You can buy an entire bar of soap that’ll last you a month of washing for less than $6. What the heck,25Mar2020,1
154,"Student loans make me want to kill myself. I have paid thousands of dollars and am still paying more. Thousands of dollars have gone solely to interest.

Compared to some I'm not even in that much debt!!!!

I don't give a shit that they've suspended interest on federal loans. $1,200 that we may (?) receive from the government will hardly make a dent.

My parents are amazed that my older sister paid off her loans already (she's 27) but her work has paid for her rent over the years and if there was anything extra, she pocketed that money.

My parents make this stupid fucking comparison and it pisses my off. My dad doesn't have any loans because his dad worked at the college. My mom doesn't have any loans because she went to school in the 70's.

Fuck everything, fuck the government. Fuck student loans, fuck everything that keeps me and my peers from making any advances in life.

It's a shitty system. Yes I can be lucky that I have an education and I live in America and not in a third world country.

But I can still be pissed off at the fact that no one gives a shit about the younger generation. We'll be in debt forever.",25Mar2020,1
156,"I got laid off due to all the shit that's happening in the world right now. I think you guys can guess what I mean.

Because it's quarantine, I can't leave my house to do the standard breakup activities: throw myself into hobbies, take long walks, volunteer, hang out with friends, etc. Instead, I'm working from home, eating at home, everything at home.  Alone during the day, alone at night, constantly churning through lonliness and memories.

159,"Last November I realized I was smoking weed way to much.  So I decided to just smoke a rillo when I got the urge.  Well that did help me quit smoking weed so much but now I can't stop smoking rillos and cigarettes.  It's not as easy as I thought it would be to quit, it's like ""hmm I'm bored may as well go smoke real quick to get that little buzz"".  I'm trying to quit and I'm definitely smoking less than I was but damn is it tough.  It's nice going outside and just puffing on something.  I bought a pack of Marlboro NXTs today which are menthol but have a little thing in the filter you can pop which give a nice minty taste.  It's my last pack for good though.

I've definitely changed my view completely on people who smoke.  It's really not as easy as some people assume.  Anyways thanks for coming to my ted talk.",25Mar2020,1

163,"Their mind is gorgeous. Their mannerisms are enticing. The way they talk is captivating, and their voice itself is music to my ears. Even their NAME is the most interesting thing in the world. Not to mention they're completely my type, physically. 

But we're friends. Not only that, but we're in a band together. Our band chemistry is fantastic and I don't want to mess it up. There have already been relationships/hookups within the band, which makes me think... Why not again? But then also, why risk it?

I'm not sure how they feel about me. They don't go out of their way to hang out, but when we do, especially if it's just the two of us, it's magic. We talk for hours and finish each other's sentences. They look at me in a way no one else ever has... It's like they actually see me, they're not just looking at me. And they say the most heartfelt things about me: compliments that are truly unique and thought out. Yet, nothing has happened between us, and I have a feeling they never will.

I know I'm infatuated, but this time feels different. They are the most interesting person I've ever met, and all I want is more of them.",25Mar2020,1

I wish there was an easy way out.",25Mar2020,1
167,"Emmitt and Ryan kicked me out today since I can't hold a job and I keep trying to kill myself. I'm surprised it took so long to be honest. They put up with my worthlessness for longer than they could have been expected to. Certainly longer than I deserved. I still cried about it in private, but I cry all the time regardless. Deborah thinks i just need a break, but my sin follows me wherever I go. You follow me wherever I go. Even in my dreams.

There is a poem I have been thinking about a lot recently as it reminds me of you. It's the opening lines from Dante's ""La Vita Nuova.""

""In the book which is my memory,
On the first page of the chapter
That is the day when I first met you
Appears the words:

'Here begins a new life.'""


I can never express just how much you mean to me, or the beautiful new life that you breathed into me. Even though I ruined it I can never forget for that brief time what it meant to breathe. And though I feel as dead now as I felt alive then, I still love you with all I have.

I hope some day I can be worth of your mercy and your love.
