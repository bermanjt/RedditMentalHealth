1,"My name is Thomas Carney. I'm 25, I'm from Miami, I play drums and watch football. I'd support Aubrey de Grey as dictator of the world. I came to LA to try acting- ridiculous fantasy as it was- and [this is me](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8367211/). As you can see, it's not much, but it was fun! I watched *Entourage* and wanted to be like Vince. 

The thing is, [this is also me...](https://westbocanews.com/2014/09/the-boynton-psycho-alert-followup/6194/) I was investigated for allegedly trying to bomb a hospital in the name of men's rights activism. The article isn't true, I have no FBI file and obviously I never actually tried to do it, but the story has persisted. (The age is also wrong in the article, I was 20, not 21. And that's not a mugshot, that's my DMV photo.). The FBI actually came to house to tell me I *wasn't* under investigation, and they were quite angry at the Boynton Beach police for spreading a false story. I actually think I remember someone getting in trouble over it.

That said, it's affected me ever since. I was kicked out of  drama school, I've had a lot of difficulty getting a job, and it's very difficult building a social circle. I live in LA where people go to ""restart"", and pasts are forgiven and wiped away, but still...it pops up on google. I *know* it's affecting me, I've had many jobs and new friendships and new relationships ""suddenly"" just ""fall through"" for ""no reason""...but I know the reason. They googled my name.

I'm a men's rights activist and I have zero regrets or second thoughts about that. I believe in equality, I think my views are fair, and I'll stick to that no matter the personal repercussions. I [have a youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpWtKTWRba8nSd8nX6h2z7Q/videos) about the men's rights movement, and I consider it very important to me, When I first came to LA to ""be in the film industry"", I bought into the Hollywood facade and did my best to play the game. It felt like living in Entourage, like that was about to be me. It's a twisted, ugly, and hollow world. Everybody lies, everybody pretends, but very few actually are. Everybody has a ""story""...they write *this*, they acted in *that*, they ""produce"", etc. People live in squalor, but go out on the weekends dressed to the nines. People will eat one meal a day, or even skip food for a day, just to save up for Friday/Saturday night. They'll have the one clean pair of shirt and pants. They'll groom themselves to perfection, and become a different person on Friday night starting at 7PM. Their bullshit person. Their alternative self; the self that to them, almost feels more ""real"" than who they really are. I know, I used to do it. I remember scrapping up nickles from under my mattress to buy $.99 eggs from the corner store on Thursday morning;  by Friday night, I was a superstar. A lots changed for me since then. But being an MRA hasn't, and it never will.

I worry about my future. I constantly think about how I both wasted and ruined my past. I worry about women; all of a sudden, I find myself thinking about serious dating and maybe even marriage, but I wonder- will this come up? Will this always be on google? How will I explain it? Will she believe me? I worry about finding work. Will I ever have a house and a car and career? I worry about building a permanent social circle. I worry about building a life. Sometimes, things don't quite seem real. But like it or not, reality is always the only explanation.

2,"I am 17. I am the senior class president. I am a jock, smart, and get along with everyone . I was going on a run when I interrupted my 'friends' hanging out without me. It was so awkward. I said, "" Let me know next time."" Everyday I see on snapchat videos of them hanging out and breaking the rules of quarantine together. Having fun and risking it all for their bond.

I want to break quarantine rules with someone. I guess I am not worth the risk.",20May2020,1
4,"A few weeks back a good friend of mine just turned 19. I wished them a happy birthday on Discord and went on in life thinking nothing of it. The next day I check Discord and I find that they deleted their discord account. I tried looking for other accounts of theirs to message, I can't speak to them IRL since they live in a different country.

I message another account of theirs and there's been no response. No messages back, no sign of life.

Nothing.

And I feel completely lost because of that.

I talked with them for multiple years about anything and everything. These were conversations I don't have with anyone else. Whenever I had something to say I said it to them, and vice versa. Now I don't have that anymore and everything feels like shit.

I've been sleeping awfully, I've stopped eating well and I get random bouts of depressive emotions over me multiple times a day. 

And all I want to know is why they don't respond. I don't feel like my usual self anymore and having no closure is making me feel that way.

Sorry for the weird rambling, this is something I had to write down for my own sake.",20May2020,1

7,"Im a computer science student and a part time baker, been so for almost 3 years. First i worked there full time for a year, then part time for the last 2.5 years, while i am studying.   
Current situation, I'm sick and  tired of my work, lost most of the interest i had for my major( im failling and will have to take a year off due to academic insuccess). Lost all of my interests, no will to do anything, been so for around 1.5 years. I've tried drowning my self in work and it did the trick, was too tired to think about this.  


I'm in serious need to change my life, I've learned everything there was to learn at my current job, as a result, its boring as hell, no motivation or interest to study.   
what can you guys advise me, i dont know what to do, what i want to do for the rest of my life (im 22yo). Tried talking to my father but he doesnt tell me much other then graduate and then think about it, even considering the possibility to drop is foolish, says he. He was never in such a situation, to question everything in one's life. what can i do?  Been grinding on the idea to drop eveything and backpack across europe for a month just to get away and, maybe get some needed answers.

What can you say to me?",20May2020,1
10,"I didnt sleep very well last night, and my last lecture of the day is from 6-8pm. As part of our participation grade it's required to have our camera on to make the remote class seem a little more personal and connected. I also had extemely bad neck and back pain so I was laying in bed while watching the lecture. This was clearly a recipe for disaster, but what else could I have done? I lasted about 40 minutes into the lecture according to my fitbit, and spent the last 1 hour and 20 minutes streaming myself snoring and drooling all over my pillow. I woke up about 20 minutes after the lecture was over and I was so confused what had just taken place. I'm so embarrassed now, this is a class where the professor tries to know everyone and I think I've just given myself a horrible reputation.

The worst part is that I missed most of the lecture and the lecture slides uploaded on the course website don't explain shit.",20May2020,1

13,"I hate working. I hate it with every inch of my being. Part of it stems from some anxiety issues but most stems from pure hatred. Every job I’ve ever had has made me want to claw my eyes out. I don’t have a college degree, so it’s all been entry level jobs, but I’ve had quite a few of them- sales associate, arcade worker, Pizza Hut server, grocery store clerk, amusement park employee, reservationist at a campground. The only job I’ve ever slightly tolerated was a sales job at an amusement park, but even then I didn’t like it. I don’t just dislike these jobs. I LOATHE them. I spend my days hoping I break my arm there so I get worker’s compensation. 

I’m not lazy. I work really hard when it comes to the things I’m passionate about and find valuable. And while I hate working, I still do it and actually do it pretty well. It’s just that the thought of spending SO much time on something I hate and find pointless makes me sick. I understand everyone needs to do things they don’t like. But work takes up SO much time. I don’t want to spend 40 hours a week doing something I hate. I understand that I may not get a “dream job.” But is it that crazy for me to want a job that I at least like. 

The problem is, I don’t know where to find one. My interests just don’t transfer into careers. 

Things I like
- Disney
- Theatre
- Performing
- Creating
- Writing
- Public speaking
- Learning 
- Personal development 
- Giving advice
- Algebra (random, I know haha)
- Watching TV
- Watching movies 
- Documentaries 
- Music
- Reading 
- Advocating for mental health awareness
- Journaling
- Crafting

15,"how do you boost self-confidence/self-esteem? I(19f) have issues with how I view myself. I keep thinking about self-depricating thoughts and it's affecting my relationship with other people and how I live my life. I don't want to rely on others for validation and ""the boost"". I don't think it's fair to them that I make it their responsibility to make me feel good about myself. I understand that they want to help me and care for me but I don't want to burden or bother them with how much I feel sorry about myself, it can also be tiring on their part too. 

A little about myself
I have adhd, I keep having bad dreams from trauma, daddy issues bruh, and I bottle things in a lot. I keep thinking about how ugly I am, how bad I am at my hobbies, how I can't communicate with others well, how pathetic I am and all that kind of stuff.
Some of you might say I have to see a therapist but I can't afford it rn or anytime in the future.

Life's been not so good. But I'm willing to take the chance to be better. I think if I have the confidence in myself, I won't have all these negative thoughts and just *like* myself. I won't have to seek that appreciation from someone else and depend on them for it because it has happened before and it never went well.

Sorry if I have any grammar issues, english is not my first but thanks for taking the time to read.

TLDR; Any tips on boosting one's confidence will be appreciated",20May2020,1

i still have no idea what was in that pill. my suspicion after doing research is that it was a shit ton of lsd, perhaps mixed w DXM. i’m gonna send it to a lab to get it tested.

so here i am. it’s been about 5 days since i took what i thought was ecstasy. the intense, sickening visuals were the worst for the first 2 days. now though, everyday i get up i feel like total shit. the acid-like visuals are gone, but i just feel like i have a fever. i’m weak, my body aches, i have zero energy, and my reactions are delayed. i’m still able to hold conversations/drive, but i feel totally detached from reality. i feel like i’m living in slow motion, and when i look at things, everything just looks... off. people don’t look right. sometimes it feels like things shift/morph out of the corner of my eye. things are very hazy and it feels like everything i look at is alive, in a really strange way. sometimes i start feeling so sick that it’s like the world is spinning and i just need to take a break. i am less talkative and i just feel like an outsider. 

i’ve been eating well and getting plenty of rest. haven’t done any drugs since and i never want to do drugs again after that terrible experience. haven’t even had coffee! 

it’s important to note that i was convinced i would die the night that i took that pill, and i feel lucky to be alive. it was the worst thing i’ve ever experienced and i honestly think i’m scarred for life. 

i also have had anxiety, which i haven’t felt in years. i just always feel like i’m going to die. when i go to bed, i think i’m not going to wake up. i feel like i’m not safe. i’m very emotional. i will cry for absolutely no reason. i am super sensitive to light, sound, and pain. 

for example. yesterday i stubbed my toe. normally, i would’ve said “oh fuck” and kept on going. but in this new state of mind, i cried and dropped to the floor, curled up in the fetal position, and had an uncontrollable panic attack. it’s like my body can’t handle stress. 

i just want it to end. things are good in my life right now. i’m surrounded by love in my family and i am at peace with myself and the world around me. i’m not sad about anything. i just have this shit holding me back from enjoying everything in my life. like when people have conversations with me, i have to try very very hard to stay engaged and my reactions are delayed. 

it’s like i’m living in a shell. a shell of who i used to be. and i can’t even tell anyone. please help. if you read this, thank you so much for your time.",20May2020,1
17,"I recently read about how other cultures think it’s dumb how attached Americans are to there pets like dogs. I understand why it seems dumb, I mean it’s an animal, but I didn’t understand why non-Americans didn’t get it. Then I thought about it while cuddling with my cat and it makes sense. In other cultures kids are allowed to hug each other and friends casually hold hands. We have hyper specialized physical contact to the point where children aren’t even allowed to touch each other at some schools. 

My time at night cuddling with my cat is the only physical contact I get with another living thing some days. I look forward to being able to feel another warm body, even if it’s not human. I’m desperately trying to use my cat as a replacement for human touch, and honestly it kinda works.

19,"She barely puts in any effort at all into maintaining the friendship. If it weren't for me and me texting her first, the friendship wouldn't even exist. Her status is always ""online"" on the platform we talk on, but she can't find 10 seconds to respond to me. When she finally does get around to responding to me, which could be between 12 hours and two weeks, it's so half assed. She puts no effort into conversations. She never asks me about myself. She didn't even wish me a happy birthday even though I wished her one. 

Despite all of this, I kept running back to her. I would say ""that's it, I'm never talking to her again"". And then a week would go by and I would feel lonely and message her. The same shit would happen, where she would ignore all my messages despite being online, and put zero effort into talking to me, and I would feel like a pathetic simp.

I swear to god. The shit ends now. I am so over this friendship, you have no idea. It was really toxic and horrible for my self-esteem. I am never speaking to her again. Today is the day that I stop talking to her entirely and move on with my life.",20May2020,1

27,"I was physically abused by both of my older brothers as a kid, my parents didn't protect me, basically since my classes started developing crushes, I knew I was the weird kid nobody really wanted to be with or know. I've landed a few relationships, all of them ended up savagely abusive, emotionally and physically (and, by the standards of the UK legal system my most recent ex committed ""rape by deception""). Like my life is just shit person after shit person after shit person.

I've been with my current partner for seven years and she's great. But the second we hit a tough patch all my trauma comes back and just obliterates my self worth, and we've been in a hell of a rough patch lately. I have almost no strong platonic bonds with anybody because deep down I can't imagine anyone really wanting to be close to me, not even her anymore. I'm in my mid-30s and I'm pretty sure this is it for me, like it's as good as it gets. I want to be wrong but I've been in therapy for five years and it's done next to nothing.

Like I'm... not terrible looking, I'm active and have fascinating hobbies but I just feel like I can't connect with anybody.

32,"People become wealthy and successful not by hardwork, but genetics.
Genetics determine IQ, looks and what genetics you inherit is by LUCK.

You have no control over your life. Genetic predisposition gives you talents, skills, common sense and decide what job will you do.

Even it comes to dating, attraction is determined by genetics. You end up with a winner/loser woman like you.

Life is fixed. Even in CSGO or any other video game, the hand eye coordination and muscle movement passed down by ancestors describes your fate in winning or losing your game.

See, genes are ultimate. You cannot over come your genetics. Standards are set and life is determined by that.

IQ is supreme in winning and doing anything. People with High IQ are more productive than Low IQ ones. 
People with high IQ are more human, than low IQ ones.

Low IQ commit suicide and are useless, other than cleaning toilets of high IQ people.


Your mental illness, habits, good things and bad things are determined by genetics.

90 percent of how you look and perceive things are determined by genes.

You inherit the sins of ancestors and live miserably with them. 


High IQ people with good environment go to IVY league and live comfortably.

Those with Low IQ work as waiters, if they have any talent they become actors or models.

Life is all about Genetics. People are  born to be great.

34,"Ok, in the near future I may take a chance a try to revitalize &amp; revolutionize the way American citizens Crowdfund.  We have Gofundme, Kickstart, Patreon and many many many other Crowdfunding websites ........the way my Crowdfund App/website will be different is because I wish to establish some sort of VOTING SYSTEM. Example....lets say you log into my website and you are interested in starting a Crowdfund because you love food and you have an idea that YOU think is gonna make you a profitable small business owner. So inside our APP you would go to the area called 100,000 CASH business idea for ONE American..... so the way it works is as follows....you create your spiel/ story/Campaign and write why you should be VOTED to recieve the 100,000 Cash so you can start your small company.  So after you write your idea now you donate 5 dollars to the APP.....the APP gives you 1 VIRTUAL VOTE.....that you must use on another persons idea from the other 19,999 Americans who also put 5 dollar donation......so the Viting would be anonymous until the end.....the American with most votes now recieves the 100,000 Cash and starts their company......everything resets to zero and it can start again. Remember there can be 1 million Americans in this APP i talk about.....however the way it works is with the FIRST 20,000 Americans to donate 5 bucks and all 20,000 have 1 vote and must apply it to another American persons idea. The logic here is that INEVITABLY we would all be using our minds and donating to an idea we see has value.....so basically after the 20,000 Americans all donate 5 bucks and then use their 1 virtual vote on eachother......we would all vote on the most likely idea that should succeed.  So yes the other 19,999 Americans do not recieve NOTHING.....but atleast they belonged to a group that created a small company and actually Empowered an American with a dream.......this is what we need.....we need more small business owners to come from a sharing &amp; caring community......and that is why I think I may create this NEW formula of Crowdfunding.

This man will be called J. He was a very talented artist, but suffered from depression. 3 years ago J comes into the kitchen and started to insult me and I told him"" when I'm your age. I'll be better than you"". That's when he started to psychoanalyze me and told me everything that's wrong with me. I got mad and slapped his drink off his hand and that's when it got physical. J was 6'5 and I never stood a chance. My ankle shattered when he threw me down and left eyes retinal teared when he was punching my face. After that I went to the hospital. Called the cops, but they didn't do anything because they thought I was lying. J was the one that told me that. I was mad. Mad for months. I woke up mad and went to sleep mad. I thought their was no justice for me. At one point in my madness I was talking to myself and sold my soul for J to die. I couldn't walk again for another 6 months. 3 months in a cast and 3 months of physical therapy. 

After that my eyesight on my left eye was getting worst. Was told my retinal had a horseshoe tear and needed surgery. I needed 3 eye surgeries and another cause it got infected.  Vision now is 3/20 and now I use my right eye for everything. 

Today my brother told me J hanged himself 5 days before my birthday. Its felt like he was try guilt trip me, but honestly I felt kinda sad for him. I also regretted picking a fight with him because of what it costed me. J has tried to reach out to me. At first apologizing and wishing me well. I ignored them all. I always had a hate for J that never left. Here I am with a limp on my walk and and blind on one eye.

Every minute I’m awake, I find myself thinking of her. I look through pictures of her, think of all the mundane things we did that now seem so significant. 

We’ve been together for over a year. And it’s been the best year of my entire life. I just want to see her in person and feel her presence. It would be amazing to hear her voice and have her next to me. We FaceTime a lot, but it doesn’t come close to having her in person.

65,"this is just a dumb story of a friend i cut contact with recently. so basically i met this guy in one of my classes and it was clear that he was infatuated with me. i was clear from the start about only wanting friends and not being interested like that. he made it SO believable that he wasn’t like the rest and that he would never ruin a perfectly good friendship for bullshit things that a lot of guys want. he would even try to warn me of other guys with bad intentions! he quickly tried to become my best friend, and made it clear he’d always have my back. and usually, he did. 

however he recently failed the biggest test. this guy was always horny. it was so obnoxious. he started joking (but not joking) about me sucking him off, and us potentially screwing. i flat out told him that it wasn’t gonna happen. this was over the phone. when i told him, it was like i could feel any interest in me totally vanish, and there was an awkward silence. he then awkwardly said “alright well i gotta let you go dude...” almost a week passes, no word from him. me, being a good, genuine friend who NEVER led him on, reaches out to check in and see if we’re good/ if we can chill soon. he shows no interest. i finally told him to be upfront if he doesn’t want to be friends anymore, and he was too cowardly to even offer a response. he ended up being EXACTLY like the “other guys” that he would talk so much shit about. he even said that he would never judge a girl for not wanting to get sexual and that guys who did that were assholes. after seeing the lack of response, i laughed and removed him. he couldn’t even say anything to his “best friend” in the end. luckily, i have other friends. this guy has no friends and it’s clear why. 

so yeah just be aware that people (not just men) will say/do anything if it’s gonna help them get into your pants. also, your gut is never wrong, learn to listen to it. the entire time with this guy i always had a bad gut feeling, but i would ignore it. my gut was right. look around at your friendships and ask yourself how genuine they really are.",20May2020,1

I don't know what I want, like in terms of a partner, do I prefer guys or girls? Do I like both? I'm so painfully socially awkward that I've never had the balls to make myself find out.

71,"At the time I am writing this I am a junior in high school. We moved to a new state when I was entering 4th grade and I had a chance to just be the best self I could. So I did, I was always funny but here I really got to flex it I was known as the trouble maker but a leader from 4th grade until now. Not joking people would literally tell me something of that often. 8th grade I was class president the same year I was class clown. All while being all star game level good at football and lacrosse. This entire time my dad had been an alcoholic, literally since I could remember. Not like a normal alcoholic dad where he goes to the bar and comes home drunk. My dad has a job where he can basically do the work from home. So all this time he’d basically be home with my mom just drinking all day long and only leaving to get checks from city. (My mom isn’t an alcoholic or anything at all but she is weirdly spiritual but her and my sibling are what I mainly care about) At the start of 10th grade (I’m in 11 now) he started falling down. Then one day during the spring of 2019 he fell and hit his head, luckily no brain damage or anything that they could find but he did have a seizure. Since he has gone into a cycle of having a seizure and then stopping drinking for 4-7 days then seizure again and so on. So this 10th grade summer he has 2 during the beginning of summer. At this time I was still my old self, trusting, carefree and just overall content with myself. At the start of the summer I started smoking weed, basically trying subconsciously to not go home but also because some cool people that are my friends smoke. And I love the culture. I’ve only now realized that’s why I enjoyed it as much as I did. It really became a big part of me and my identity. Thanks for reading this far this is where everything sort of changes in my life. At the midpoint of the summer I was at a party. I was taking with a lot of people, drunk, high and planning to get with a girl. I was having the time of my life my guard was completely down I was totally great. I don’t check my phone that often, I looked down to 5 missed calls from my mom in the last few minutes and texts saying “call me now” from 30 seconds prior. I went to a side room where it was quieter thinking my dog had escaped or if she was wondering if me and my sibling were okay because they were at the party too. When I picked up the phone she was almost hysterical, she went on to tell me my dad had collapsed outback of my house and hit his head. It felt like my stomach and hard dropped I’m sure every person knows the feeling. These next 15 mins were the scariest of my life so far. Anyway I literally bolted out as fast as I could, as I was leaving people kept asking what was going on and I just said there was an emergency. I left my younger sibling at the party because I was in such a rush it just slipped my mind. At this time it felt like I was snapped so deep into reality, it was like my drunk and highness just vanished I was too aware. On my sprint home I just kept saying over and over “please don’t die” “please don’t die.” I don’t believe in god or anything I was just like pleading sort of. When I got home finally the ambulance was driving away and my mom was outside. She told me that he had a seizure and collapsed. After that I sort of just felt numb I’m pretty sure it was a sort of shock. He came home about a week later. Promised he wouldn’t drink anymore then was back on it 5 days after. I had a trip for a sport so I was gone for a week later towards the end of summer so I had no choice but to take a break from smoking. When I got back I felt like there was something off about myself. A minor thing like 1/2 of my days weren’t good days, this was strange because I’ve always been the person to let loose and just be okay with things. Then I smoked weed at the start of school and basically had like a panic attack or a bad trip whatever. It was like all my feeling from that night just came right back and writing this now 9 months later I still can’t smoke and enjoy it. I’ve taken up smoking cigarettes and vaping doing both daily. I’m depressed I think and always anxious now. I feel empty and at the same time I’m so scared about what people think of me. 
Basically now I can’t let my guard down and trust people. I also don’t know if I should try to forgive my dad or just let him go. 
Divorce isn’t an option we don’t have money for that, I don’t wanna take meds and I don’t want to off myself so I’m really stuck on what I should do.",20May2020,1
74,"so i’ve always had pretty thick hair. it’s long and healthy, etc. honestly one of the only things i’ve liked about myself. but recently i’ve been falling back into my bulimia and it’s a lot worse than it was in the past. and what i didn’t realize was that a common effect of bulimia is hair thinning and hair loss. my hair is getting super thin and some days fall out in clumps (coupled with my anxiety, this is a bad deal). i know it’s probably silly to be upset over it, but i know i’m sick and the fact that the sickness is taking away one of the only things i like about myself is even more devastating, especially since i’m not really getting better",20May2020,1
75,"I’m a mother to a young daughter and a partner to a lazy jobless selfish piece of work. I get woken up at 5am every day by my daughter. I get up, barely awake, and make her first feed. I deal with her, while her father sleeps through until the afternoon.

What do I do all morning, he always asks, as if I do nothing. I do at least three loads of laundry for DD, I clean the kitchen and bathroom and wash up his dirty dishes, the pots and pans he cooked with but failed to clean up afterwards. I clean the floors, the toilet, the shower. I change stinky nappy after stinky nappy, make endless bottles and bowls of food, try to juggle a screaming child with phone calls to various people like the health visitor and early help services, and my mental health service. I pay bills, keep on top of council tax, wash up the dishes again (we have no dishwasher) change DD’s clothes at least 5 times because she’s pooped/peed/thrown food down them. I change the bins, and I’m also currently preparing the flat because the council is rehoming us in a permanent home. And surprise surprise, I’m doing this alone. 

I have autism and bipolar disorder. I’m doing all of this while trying not to have a sensory overload, or a mental breakdown. I’m juggling so much all at once, and he acts shocked. 

He doesn’t have a job. He complains when I ask him to look after DD. Tells me he needs time to go for a walk but refuses to look after DD if I want to go for a walk alone. Complains if I ask him to wash up his own mess. Refuses to clean up the building mess around his PlayStation. Refuses to take any responsibility for anything, and gets irritated at me when I get upset about it. 

He takes all of my money. He stopped doing this for a few months and I thought we were fine, but it’s started up again and it’s worse than before. He “needs” money for gaming, for smoking, for snacks. Never mind feeding us. If I tell him I need to save money to eat out of our tiny benefits payments, he gets stroppy and says he doesn’t want to eat so it doesn’t matter. DD matters, and I can’t go hungry because I need to be able to care for her.

He always wants a new game, buys it, and then gets bored in a couple of hours. He wants this, he wants that, he’s bored, tired, annoyed. 

You know what? I’m tired. I’m really fucking tired. I’m sick of being treated like a doormat, like I don’t matter. You know what “I” want? Respect. Love. Help. 

Yeah he wants games. You know, I’d love a Nintendo switch but he’s sold every electronic item we had to pay for what he wanted, because he “had no choice”
I would love to play animal crossing, it hurts scrolling through the AC sub seeing all these beautiful homes and funny screenshots and custom designs, knowing that the peanuts I’m living on could never buy me that luxury. 

Out of the monthly payments we get (I’m not going to specify what we get because privacy) I essentially only get about £20 to myself. I don’t even get my weekly child benefit to myself because of him. He spends it before I even get it, buying stuff from people locally and promising them money when it comes in. He’s a hoarder, he buys expensive clothes. DD has hardly any clothes that fit her anymore and every time I say we should buy more he calls it a waste of money.

I’m so done being treated like shit while being told (by him) that of course he cares, of course he shows me love, of course I must be over-exaggerating about everything. 

I’m just so done. I’m in tears in the corner of our bedroom. I can’t do this anymore.",20May2020,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat",20May2020,1

So the interview came and I realized that I am not prepared as to what and R&amp;P would do. I haven’t studied about it because of limited information. And then the last question came and they requested me to be creative on the spot and convince them to let me in the committee. It was a disaster. I blacked out and I felt awkward and I felt like the world ended there. I just don’t know what to do so I did the most awkward tiktok dance and say the most ugliest catch phrase.

Another one: my sister and i had the rule that until 5 in the midday we couldnt touch a tv, ipad , or computer and my brothers already have an ipad an whenever they ask they can play on it
(Btw me and my sister are still limited to the evening if we want to game or watch netflix)
Also very simple things are different like we always had to eat everything on our plate they dont they can go outside and inside whenerver they want we were forced to go outside between 10-5 
Last thing: i also find it weird that if i want something , anything ranges from tv and playstation to trampoline and phone case i have to pay for it myself and my brothers get useless crap like a drinking cup for 30 euros and 2 Quads and 4 bikes all €100 a piece and its not even christmas or their birthday!

My mom and I are usually very close, but since I shared he news with her she has been distant. The few times we have talked, she updates me on conversations she’s had with everyone else in our family and her friends, but she barely actually speaks to me.

She had a baby girl when we were 14 years old, the father of the baby was 19 and didnt stick around after the babys first birthday. I loved this little girl so much and she was a huge part of my life. It broke my heart that ending the unhealthy friendship meant losing this 8 year old little girl that I had been close with since her birth, but I knew this was the only way. TIt was 2011 when we were 23 and stopped being friends. Fast forward to this past weekend: I saw my ex friend in a drug store. I didnt acknledge her at all, rememebering the 23 years of negativity she brought to my life, but she walked past me and said ""you look good [my name]"" this prompted me to be reminded of her little girl who I had been so close with. I looked up my ex friends facebook that evening, for the first time in years, only to discover that her little girl who was a sweet innocent 8 year old the last time I saw her, who was now 16, was a new mother to a baby girl herself and my ex friend was now a 31 year old grandmother. I began to imagine this all unfolding, how it came about, how my ex friend reacted, all the things that would have been said between them.

I compiled a bunch of pictures and videos of her and I since she was born and by the end I was crying because she’s getting so big. It used to annoy me when I was a kid and adults in my family would get emotional as I got older, but now I totally get it. I’ve spent so much time with this bright little soul; I was the only one of her cousins who could get her to eat or sleep when she was a baby. We have a really awesome bond. 

I’m not sure if I want to be a mom. I would need to wait at least 10-15 years when I’m in my mid-30’s because being a parent is such a tough job and a huge responsibility. But I’m so lucky I have these three tiny humans in my life and I really do think I might love them as much as a parent would.

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

97,"this is exactly why I specifically hate a lot of reddit because so many people on this website who are moderators will make very blanket Like rules. it'll cover a bunch of everything and then when they read over a certain things don't act like it's completely okay. They can delete a post or they say you're wrong in some situation because it's how they feel it that day because it was cloudy or because they're mad about something else other taking it out on someone else.

this is one of the biggest reasons why I seriously hate so much of this website because everybody here can make some sort of subreddit and it be completely okay to act the way that they do. people making places where if they don't like what you have to say you can get banned you can get kicked you can get blocked. which honestly says a lot about a person's personality because it really shows the kind of person they really are and all they want is the attention and the power to shove down someone's throat.",20May2020,1

105,"I’m not a very hateful person, and I usually give someone the benefit of the doubt and try to see the best in them. 

I’ve kinda always struggled with being really impressionable(beyond other teens) because of my mindset on people. I can be naive and innocent and hold people’s opinions high. 

I feel like most of the hate that’s inside of me is from other people’s hate. I feel like I’m told to hate things. The best example I can think of is the “hate” I have for my ex (post relationship) manifested from others effectively telling me to hate her and in a way making me feel stupid that I wouldn’t hate her. Granted they were just trying to push me out of an unhealthy situation and hating someone is the easiest way to do that. It’s just that I’m not the type to hate someone and I’ve noticed that’s not how I deal with things. 

I basically mix up what others want for me from what I actually want. I’m trying to learn how to recognize what I want more but maybe It just changes with time as I get older. 

This controls more of my life than feeling like I should be negative. It dictates how I do a lot of things. 

If anyone is similar or has anything to say I would really appreciate it",20May2020,1
106,"She’s always been abusive (most of the times verbally and emotional) but she’s worst than ever this last 2-3 years. I started living with her 4 or 5 years ago, she didn’t want that responsibility and gave me to my grandma. She never really cared about me and never gave me emotional support, however, she always told others how “succesful” i was at school etc. As soon as the others are gone she starts blaming me for everything, even breathing stupid( whatever that means :/). She makes fun of everything about me and tells me i’m never gonna be happy or succesful in life. She always curses at me and if i tell her that she misunderstood me she’d beat me. She often tells me that i drain her energy everytime she’s near me even though i always try to look happy and full of energy because i don’t want her to be sad because of me. She thinks i hate her but i don’t. I should maybe, i don’t know, i just can’t since she gave birth to me and looked after me. She gave me money so i could eat. But she always told me bad stuff and made fun of me. She abuses me everyday and makes me feel bad every time. I try not to tell her anything she’d be angry about even the way i look at her makes her angry. My existence makes her angry. I thought about ending my life so many times but the people i love comes to my mind, especially my caring boyfriend. I don’t want to make anyone sad but i want my mom to be happy. My parents are divorced so i think about living with my dad but he’s in another city and can’t come here until the virus is not a problem anymore.

112,"So when I was younger there was this kid in my town, Dan Fenton. When we were about 14 years old, his parents had made this weird device that was designed to view some strange, new world.  They had spent years working on this thing, but they could never get it to work, so they terminated the project.

Well one day, Dan wanted to show some of the local kids all of the neat gadgets his parents had. Of course, we saw the ""world viewer"" machine his parents had given up on and that was where all of our 14-year-old attention spans went. Dan began showing us all of the knobs and buttons, made different things light up, and our simple young minds were all impressed. Then he stepped inside. 

A flash of light, much brighter than the leds we previously marveled at, filled the room. Since Dan was the only person in the machine, he must received all of the radiation because his hair had instantly turned all white and his eyes had this eerie green glow; doctors later had said that his molecules were all rearranged. 

It wasn't long after his accident before he learned he could walk through walls, disappear, *fly...*He was a considerably unique individual. He soon learned that there were other beings with similar powers, and so, being the admirable person he was, Dan had dedicated his life to stopping the ghouls from taking over our world through the very means by which he gained his powers.

Now im trying to fix my sleep times by sleepping early but i found that i cant sleep ever since moving myself to a new room about 2 days ago 
I understand the **first night syndrome** and i couldnt sleep the first night the secondnight came andi slept early about 10 pm and now i can only sleep normally if i couldnt sleep the next day due to being overall tired from no sleep

119,"I just got an email from my university.  They will resume classes in the fall, but only until Thanksgiving.  After Thanksgiving break, all classes will be remote to prevent students from bringing the illness from other places and spreading it during the winter months.  I'm graduating this month, so it shouldn't really matter to me.  But I want to cry.

As I read the email I felt what I could only describe as a profound sense of surrender.  Finally I was seeing this powerful institution admit - *reckon* with - the fact that this is going to be happening for a long time.  We're locked in.  Time to read the writing on the wall.  Don't make any plans, folks - the time for plans is gone.  We are on Virus Time now.  It was a reckoning I hadn't undertaken yet - but this letter brought that reckoning on me.

I want to cry for my sister whose freshman year of college will be dominated by fear and loss and intermittent periods of isolation.  Whose school will likely cut her year short anyway.

I want to cry for my grandmother who is afraid to visit her grandchildren in some of her last years because she is afraid she could die if she comes close to them, or to anyone.

I want to cry for my brother, whose heart condition makes him incredibly vulnerable.  Who is afraid to hug his family.  Who was afraid to hug me even when we were still comfortable enough to visit.

I want to cry for myself, for the potential loss of people I love, for the fear I am feeling, for the plans I made and now have to let go of.  

I want to cry for all of humanity, and for the massive and devastating human loss that we have experienced, and will continue to experience - most likely the loss of at least one person that *each* of us loves - for such a long time.  The utterly wasteful and destructive and malevolent human loss that we must now come to accept.  There can be no more denying it.  It is time to face reality.  And that is why all the students must go back home after Thanksgiving.

Ok, so for my grade 12 English class we're currently studying a novel called Americana by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

First, I have a question about a part in the story: What is Obinze's job(?) mentioned early on? I couldn't understand despite reading it a couple times, the part where he visits an extremely  wealthy guy at a party alongside his cousin to get a job through his network? What exactly is the work that he is doing? (Chapter 2)

**How can I write effective notes while reading a book?** For those of you who are getting good marks in class(my mark is at low 70s), what do you do that really helps you? For me, I think my problem is that I'm writing too much about every little thing, thinking that it might connect to something, that I'm spending too much time on the notes but lack the sense of direction. There is so much to pay attention to when reading, and I feel like it's all over the place and overwhelming.

I'm working on a social group platform, designed to help users discover people who have similar interests and experiences, and to see what's going on around you. This way they can meet up in real life and coordinate social interactions. You can think of it as similar Meetup but free, more secure, wide demographic, and many other features. Great for travelers, students, communities &amp; groups of all kinds.

**This would be perfect to meet people with in real life doing real activities. Of course after we're in a better situation with our current events!**

Features: live map with events and people, a secure encrypted chat, and a discovery feed to meet new people.

I don’t see myself as a motherly person like some of my friends who have kids already. I recently moved in with a high school friend who had a 2 year old and boy let me tell you, I am not a kid person. Like other people’s kids. But this has helped me realize what I do in certain scenarios, as a parent. This has made me think, you know what I would be a good mother and actually do want a child.
