8,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

💡She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


◾️I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence",20Dec2020,1

I write this hoping to settle down my thoughts and the feelings that come with them, so exactly where might be best to begin is not at all clear.  I guess I’ll start there – with the puzzlement, the feeling deeply disturbed by the media’s messaging this year.  The most troubling thing to me about the shit that has happened this year has been the media’s warped coverage of it all.  Also disturbing has been to witness people, educated people who ought to know better, accept this messaging as certified objective truth.  “How can someone so smart be so bleeping stupid?”

The past year was overloaded, and naturally the media had our attention.  Impeachment-covid-hydroxychloroquine-WHO-BillGates-BigBrother-GeorgeFloyd-riots-lockdowns-masks-stockmarketbubble-smallbizbankruptcies/corporatewindfalls-BidenHarris-SandersGabbard-election-electionfraud-threattoourdemocracy….

What has been particularly unsettling lately is this issue of fraud in the election, and the media coverage has been really really bothering the hell out of me.  From NPR, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, CBS, NBC, etc etc etc, the message has been that all claims that there was fraud in the election are “baseless” - that “there is no evidence to support these claims” - “the lying President’s false claim that the election was stolen”- that “because some of his supporters will of course believe his lies about election fraud, these lies damage confidence in the election and thereby undermine our democracy and threaten the stability of our system.”  When I read or hear these statements, which is constantly, it really bothers the hell out of me.   

It bothers me because it is dishonest.  No, that’s putting it to lightly.  It bothers me because these news people are lying. They are lying over and over and over, bald-faced lying, and clearly in a coordinated fashion.  It is full-court-press gaslighting of Americans on a massive scale.  I know they are lying because I’ve looked at a lot of evidence and at this point there is so much evidence, and it is overwhelming.  This is plain and simple factual truth.   No way can a reasonably intelligent person examine this evidence and honestly dismiss it.  For anyone to declare that there is no evidence to support the claim of election fraud is simply ridiculous.  For all of these major news media outlets to declare it over and over and over again is outrageous – and terrifying.  I have read about this sort of thing happening in authoritarian regimes, but never expected to see it here.   

If these news orgs stay the course, the Americans who believe what the media tells us (half of us?) are likely to not accept any court finding in the evidence that in truth the election was stolen.   And the Americans who believe the election was stolen, whether because of the persuasive evidence (truth) or simple faith in Party, will not yield to the monster scoundrel media which so obviously wholeheartedly supports the corruption.  This set up is bad.  To make bad worse, the Supreme Court waved off the Texas suit….how does this not intensify the problem for these Americans who believe the election was stolen and their government has does not recognize their rights as citizens, as States?  What the hell, SCOTUS?   

Enmeshed and overlayed on this has been a truckload of horsecrap - the pandemic from a nasty virus propagandized out the wazoo into something more, and ever more messaging about a “Great Reset” as pushed by the World Economic Forum of Davos, which is a marxist coup (fantasy?) by – get this – the richest people in the world…say what?...who want us to believe we’ll be living our best lives when we have no possessions.  How is this nonsense meeting so little resistance?  

And what the hell, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter?  Censoring?  Oh man I could go on but I think I’ve said enough.

By the way, I voted for Biden/Harris because Trump’s personality is not acceptable, and now feel like I voted for the wrong team.

Abiding by the old wisdom that, when everyone around you seems crazy, it might be you who is crazy, I ask you readers who got this far: Am I nuts?  Do my words here make sense?  Are any of you having the same thoughts and feelings?  Please comment or indicate with an upvote (or opposite).  Thx..",20Dec2020,1

I have something to say, but this probably ain't it. Feel free to read between the lines, but don't take too much of this literal. It will be a load of nonsense, painful to your intellect. I need not worry about that. But I do need to purge some of it, so here it is, in all it's grammatically incorrect, illogical, un-poetic,  incoherent glory. No editing. This is a stream, and it cannot be stepped in same spot twice...  

I despair, but I am no longer desperate. I see no point to the things I do, but I still do them. Blindly, in the moment, with a reason afterward to justify what I did. Got to at least have that illusion of control.... Don't think I enjoy things as much as before. All things tend to fade, or become less satisfying. I figure only the  pain is real, relief from it, is the lie. Eh, fuck, perhaps the pessimism has finally consumed me. Reality is a hard thing to fight against. A tough pill to swallow....What am I talking about, I don't even know what reality is anymore. All these things just labels to describe the undescribable. Started asking too many questions awhile ago. Answers? They are really hard to come by. ""The more I learn, the more I realize how much I do not know""...A small hint of way too many philosophies, or maybe mental illness. Mostly mental illness. But, they do say variety is the spice of life. But who are they?...Sunk a little too deep into that oh so comforting existential dread. Nihilistic tendencies. Bipolar rollercoasters of emotions that can barely be controlled. All this with an unrealistic glimmer of hope that one day the answer that I seek will come and slap some sense into the universe. But realistically the only truth is that, in the grand scheme, nothing will be gained. It's a farce. All is just a reformation. A retelling. The same, with a different name. Full circle. We are evolving though.... Evolving into what? Not evolving into better, just into something different, for better or for worse. And whoever gets to decide which is which.  Go and rewrite what was already written but in a new way. Attempting to replace the old institutions with new ones, but with so many striking similarities that are somehow unrecognizable because you call it something else. Human nature doesn't change. Always looking for an enemy, a reason why it failed, why it's flawed. People made it, or are acting it out, that's why, it's us. The mirror can give us a good indicator most of the time. I'm surprised it all works as well as it does, with all the complexity we've created over the years. Seems that something might give sooner or later. Pause for applause at the fact that we cannot rewrite humanity in an unrealistic image of what our instincts tell us is fake, not anything lasting anyway. Life, uh, finds a way. Human nature is the way it is, no matter the system put in place to contort it.

 Technological advances, better medicine, accumulated knowledge; has made our lives so much easier, has given the appearance of a world of less suffering but at the same time has made us more susceptible to smaller amounts of suffering. Nothing really gained. We have simply reformed our suffering. Suffering with sprinkles on top. I would assume we do not all suffer equally, but we all suffer. Perhaps some are just better adjusted. Finding the reason to endure suffering in a world that is lacking a true belief in any real purpose beyond turning human beings into something entirely not human is an exercise in futility that I might just have to one day say yes to. Get rid of us crazy creatures already. I kid, I kid. I love humanity...Love. Boy is that becoming the most meaningful word for everyone. Love will conquer all. Love is love. Love is truth. Just as much bad shit is done in the name of love as good, get over it. 

And the quest for a truth that I don' think really exists is a nerve-wracking endeavor of the highest order. But one we still undertake, and always will. What else is there to do? The reasons sometimes are just as hard to come by. Any foundations I try to stand on tend to crumble under the pressure that's put on them. Contradictions and paradoxes. Head first into the abyss. The darkness. Someone tell me where the light switch is. Flip it. I can't see....To be blinded by the light, or to get lost in the dark? hard choice.  A slave to the passions. Desire without drive. Drive without direction. An overcompensation to correct the previous overcorrection. Missed the target. Probably aiming at the wrong one anyway, so I guess it's no big deal. It's not like we know what the purpose is anyway. The target is a fucking opinion based on irrational emotions of propagation and procreation.

 And there you go, there's a glimpse of my head. Nothing was truly said, and nothing truly matters. Hopefully one day I can make these thoughts turned to words turned to sentences turned to something meaningful. Something that can help describe the uniqueness of my own fantasy world that I've come to not have any belief in anyway. But that ain't gonna happen, for I am a walking, talking contradiction, part real, part fiction.....",20Dec2020,1

26,"Living in mental hell.

About a month ago I went to a psychologist to get back on track with my life. She tells me to go see a shrink, who gave me Risperidone to treat paranoia bla bla bla 

At first I didn't want to put any weird stuff in my body (I had just left a pretty long streak of weed-lead-masked-death situation), but I felt like I was going to regret it later if I didn't take it.

So I start taking it, low dosage, just enough to lower the symptoms. Yes, everyone is still thinking about me negatively in some way when I'm in public, but I do find it easier to concentrate on one thing, and spend hours on it, which is amazing, and does help me stay away from nasty irrational thoughts that make me go idle mode.

The thing is, well, here I am back on weed (though I promised myself it'd be just this night at least for a week or two; Let hope I make it) and it's making me think about things more clearly, almost as if I feel more alive high on THC than when lucid on ""life"".

I'm on college (or whatever international equivalent to university) finishing my second semester, which I already abandoned almost completely. I'm out of energy, can't do anything, although I do so many stuff randomly without any apparent pattern: playing the piano (too much perhaps), watching series/movies, researching deeply about topics which I'll forget forever in 1-2 weeks, overthinking myself to death, living in the future/past, wondering around the city on my bike with no purpose or destination, and many other unhealthy stuff.

Now I *have* about a month and a half to choose what to do with my life. I want to feel what the cold metal of a barrel feels on my forehead, just feel the cold metal nothing else. That's what I want to do with my life.

Everybody is watching, all my family. Mother, father, sister, aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. ""What will hayunamoscaenmipieza study?"" And it's not like they tell me I should study this or that, they just ask about my life at family gatherings and that always puts me on my nerves, hate family gatherings.

Anyways, I'm in deep shit. I just got out of a drug addiction that robbed me a year of my life (although it was shit before it too). Month and a half to choose what to study.

Don't like business work, architecture, any kind of medicine, or science. I do like art a lot but who doesn't, that doesn't mean I should study something with arts, no? I mean I like movies but not sure if enough to want to make them myself (what I was studying thus far); I like paintings, can't paint; love drawings, can't draw; love poems, can't write; love dancing, can't dance; love singing, can't sign; love loving, can't love; love playing the piano, can't play; and the list goes on and on and on.

Anybody wants to chip in with some advice or something? .-. xoxo",20Dec2020,1
30,"I’m one of those type-A people who did really well in highschool and college. From a pragmatic point of view, I did everything “right.” I studied well, got a good job, even networked well and can comfortably name a good chunk of people at my medium sized university.

But as a senior, now, I feel empty. I envy people who have crazy fun college stories and are close with their roommates. I never lived with the same person for longer than a year.

I reach out to people successfully to hangout and catch up, but no one reaches out to me. No one invites me to anything. Despite actively being involved in a small number of groups (science club, dance club, most recently business frat) any interaction was initiated by me and stopped as soon as I did.

I’m at a loss and I’m miserable. I feel I can’t express my dissatisfaction to other people because I do well on the surface. People congratulate me on a series of resume bullets and tell me I must be ecstatic - professionally, I am, but mentally, I’m withering away. 

Now that recruiting is done, I spent day in and day out at my parent’s house putting the least amount of effort into classes as I can to preserve time for ...idk what. The things I’m passionate about (dance performance, travel) I can’t do and the people I love (classmates, mentors) don’t seem to feel the same. I could pick up a project, but that feels like piling on even more work to distract from my social problems.

I wasted so much of my life doing nothing, so much, even when I got with people I’d waste my life stuck in their place doing nothing in bad company.

I want so much, I’m so envious but I’m still slightly weird about being round people and I don’t know how to get all the stuff in my life that I really desire. I can’t get a job either.

I just hate it. Being stuck like this. Doing nothing but wasting my life. Even if I did suddenly get the life I desired, I’m so far behind everything would feel like a shock.

I (F,22) have been in a two-year relationship (3years in a month) with my boyfriend (M,22). We've always been in a long-distance relationship. He'd come to my city to study his Bachelors and he lived like 2 hours away. We would meet three or four times (maximum) in a month. I love him to death. We've always had a relationship where we text more than we talk or meet. Our entire relationship is dependent on us texting.

The nature of the guy: He's currently doing an MBA in one among the top 2 colleges in the country. He's always been a laid back, chilled, ""I want to eat, play, fuck, enjoy and sleep"" kinda guy. He is passive in a lot of ways. He doesn't talk about his feelings (only rarely and seems like it is on a need-to basis). He doesn't share much about his family or friends. I don't know anything about his friends or family apart from who they are (if I'm lucky). Only when they something funny- I find out about it. He LOVES his friends and he is a very sociable person. He has a bit of ""teasy"" personality. And takes pride in the fact that he has a lot of ""girl and guy friends"". I don't know the extent of any of his friendships and how much of his feelings he shares. He is extremely sweet, compassionate, thoughtful and kind. He is an emotional person (just doesn't share them). I feel like he loves me a lot (or at least loves the idea of me). He underplays his anger (he said this) because he doesn't want to ""spoil"" what we have and hates confrontation. He is sharp and loves lame jokes. He's been cheated on before so he hates cheating.

My nature: I'm a writer and I'm studying psychology. I am someone who is always this anxious and edgy person. I love being organized. I'm doing so much work-wise and college wise- but I always feel like that it's nothing. I'm very insecure and lack self-confidence. I don't do anything that is not work/deadline related. My resume is filling up like crazy but I still feel like I've done nothing. I love talking about feelings. I'm always someone who seeks validation. I also hate confrontations but I'm all about sharing what I'm feeling. \*I need people to tell me what they are feeling\*. If they don't, then I'm overthinking about things. I've been bullied as a child. So, I never really connected with any friends. And the one friend I am closest to- sometimes I feel like she is only friends with me because she has no one else. I basically overthink a lot. I was diagnosed with depression as a child but recently my new therapist told me that there is a high chance that I was misdiagnosed and that my symptoms align with GAD. I have an extremely supportive family but I feel like that's not enough because I don't have many friends (or am I scared to make friends). My family is supportive, yes but they are also extremely over-protective. So, every time I have to go out- I either have to lie or I have to beg for weeks in advance. (Yes I am a 22 y/o). Very very rarely have I made impromptu plans (one reason why I feel like I don't have many friends-because if I do, they'll definitely want to meet and hang out but I can't do that often). 

Well, now my boyfriend has moved to his home-town like 2000kms away. And is soon going to a city far far away for his Master's offline classes, near his home city. Our worlds don't collide at all. Unless we actually make a plan to work and live in the same city- I may never get to meet him again. So we're doing a proper long-distance relationship. He's never really spoken about the future because he doesn't believe in making plans. There have been very very few instances where he is spoken about our future as a couple. 

He's lately been off. His workload is crazy. He has like college meetings till like 3/4 am in the morning. One of the most competitive schools in the country (so proud of him for getting into that). He's made a lot of friends there. And since their first two semesters are online (because lockdown), he's met a few of his classmates who are in the same city as him and 2 girls even came home to ""cheer him up"" because he wasn't doing that well in college. 

When I asked him why he is being so distant- he said that he has a huge student loan on his head and his workload is crazy and he's barely scraping through because his marks aren't that great. But he almost always is talking to his friends and he has the time to meet his friends to go to a mall with a girl or hang out a cafe with a couple of them. (Am I bad for letting him have some free time and wanting to spend that time with his friends and not me).

And then now, I am in this downward spiral where I am overthinking everything. I recently had a mini argument with him. He went to meet his friends to like a cafe a block away from his house with his new college friends and did not tell me. When I brought up the ""why didn't you tell me"", he got pissed at me, told me I was overthinking and called me insecure and possessive. And I said sorry for bringing it up and I felt so shitty. And later asked him to ignore my insecurity feelings because I was PMSing ?! 

Why do I need him to tell me everything? I don't tell him about the conversations I have most of the time either. But I sure as hell share a lot more than he ever does about his friends. He knows who my friends are and who I am talking to and a gist of what I spoke to them.

Am I not good enough? Am I missing him too much? Is this lack of physical touch (both our love languages are physical touch)? Have I made him to be the only good thing in my life? Is it a lack of proximity? Are we too young for all this? Do I really have only him and have made him the priority of my life? Do I really have nothing better to do? Why doesn't he want to talk to me? Can't he make one voluntary phone/video call? Is he avoiding me? Is he cheating on me? Why won't he initiate anything? Do his friends mean more to him than I do? Is this the beginning of the end of the relationship? Am I being too pushy? Am I asking for more? Is it wrong to ask for a normal conversation wherein he talks about his friends? Why do I always have to ask him what his friend's names are and what happened with them- and even then he'll only say ""I had a lot of fun with them/her/him. I did that and I did this"" and that's all. No emotional connection at all. Why won't he share? I get that that's who he is- but it goes back to ""Why doesn't he want to share things? Is he hiding something?"" But then I just pacify myself saying that ""I'm overthinking, he's busy and let him hang out with his friends. So what if he doesn't share. He's never done that"".

I really want to wait and work on this. I really do. Maybe it's just a phase. Or, maybe he'll finally find a girl better than me and ghost me and hang me out to dry. Maybe he's just getting more validation from his friends than I am giving him. Because he's a different person when he is free. There have been days wherein we've spent entire days watching a show on Netflix party. Maybe he really is busy and wants some immediate human connection and validation and he's getting that from his friends.

If anyone can give me any insight on what I should do or try doing, let me know. If I'm just overthinking and insecure also- let me know. I really want to know how to deal with this. 

TD; DR: I have a passive boyfriend who doesn't share much. I have an overthinking personality. He's been off lately and doesn't put many efforts into the relationship because ""he is busy a lot"". He truly is busy a lot but he also somehow manages to go out with his friends. He's a sweetheart when he's free and that was before he joined the best business school. But the main issue is- I don't feel emotionally connected to him. I'd really love advice or someone to tell me what I could try because talking to him about ""what I'm feeling"" is clearly not helping.",20Dec2020,1

6. You will be asking, ""**how much**"" and proceeding with ""**how much for sex**""
7. Don't be afraid if they turn out to not be a Sexual Massage Parlor, Just simply reply with I'm sorry and hang up. 
8. There are easier ways to realize if they are normal or sexual, start with their window stores. If their store is cover with black film or just propaganda with no way to see inside without entering, you have found one. Another way is by their Maps Description having pictures with ""hot"" half ""naked girls"".
9. Some will respond to ""how much"" with ""$40 or $60"". With ""how much for sex"", they respond with various answers which will make you realize that you have the right place.

* ""You coming""
* ""You coming baby""
* ""Can't talk on phone""
* ""I say here, come""
* ""$100 or $120""
* ""sorry, no speak english, little. you coming""

From here, I had a target. I walked all the way there. Told her I was going, so she could open the door and not have me stand there. If I stand there, I would be making it obvious and suspicious. Basically, I don't want to get arrested. I entered and so far, this is what happened.

She’d hug me when I said I had to go, then she’d walk me out the door, she’d watch as I’d walk to my car, I’d back out of the drive way and every single time she’d be waving good bye as I drove away and I swear there wasn’t one time where she’d walk back in to her house before she was out view. Damn I miss that.",20Dec2020,1

51,"Growing up, I was often made to feel responsible for giving others (like my parents) emotional support, without receiving much of it myself or feeling validated/ok having normal needs. As an adult I've struggled with codependence and self esteem but I'm finally making some progress in understanding these dynamics in therapy. Right before the pandemic this year, I was able to escape from a really abusive LTR which had triggered a lot of trauma and depression issues. I was so relieved and my immediate situation improved so much that I spent the next few months feeling almost euphoric that I had my life back and enjoying the solitude and time for self reflection and just decompressing a lot. I didn't really make an effort to reach out to people unless they contacted me first and it was fine, but it's been like 8 months mostly alone now and it's starting to get to me bad. I can't figure out how I got so isolated or how to change it, the couple of people I still talk to on the phone pretty much just ask for help and that's always just been our deal. I tried reaching out to older friends but after a couple of failures connecting, I kind of fell into an even deeper depression where I feel like there's something just wrong with me, that I don't have an emotional support system. At a really basic level, I don't know how to actually tell someone I need emotional support, ask them for it, or feel (or even fake) like I deserve it. I think there's also an underlying fear that no one is actually invested in me enough to be willing to provide, which I know isn't true but depression is weird and my ex would tell me stuff like this often. I also (irrationally) feel like everyone else has formed their own bubbles &amp; such while I was busy healing and now it's too late. How do I get out of this? I've always been the 'strong' friend but I've been feeling so fragile lately that I'm afraid to even talk to anyone because I feel like I'll just start crying, and I haven't talked to any of them in months anyway, and like, what do you even SAY? :/",20Dec2020,1
53,Hey,20Dec2020,1
56,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

💡She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


◾️I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence",20Dec2020,1

68,"This was in a developing country and a middle class family. I remember being a teenage girl and feeling like I didn’t have support.. or discipline or even structure in my life. My parents never cared about my grades (dad would scream and rage trying to help me with my homework and mom didn’t care). 

I tried to join a ballet class when I was 17 but my parents discouraged me because I was “too old”. 

I was also diagnosed with depression years later (I had to go to an university to get a free consultation for my parents to take me seriously and forward me to a psychiatrist). I didn’t know how to walk around the city but I did it by myself. It’s shocking to me how they could have a depressed kid and not realize that.. or care enough to seek help. 

Remembering my life growing up everything seemed like it was unnecessarily harder.. because my parents for some reason didn’t want to parent. 

I even missed the very first time I was going to vote because my dad didn’t “feel like” taking me there. 

Trying to get a job was like pulling teeth.. dad would find every single inconvenience and point it out. 

Well here I am now. I’ll turn 25 in a month and I feel like a failure. I got my first job six months ago, got my first credit card yesterday. I just keep looking back at my life and wondering where I would be if I had support, or if I somehow stood up for myself.",20Dec2020,1
69,"this story is a few months old, but it still bothers me and i didn’t really know which forum to post it in. 

so i’m a female tradesperson, i work in a dirty environment. at the end of the day my clothes are filled with metal dust and dirt, they’re ripped apart, most have holes, which i really don’t mind. i like my job, i like the work i do. i have certain clothes set aside specifically for my job and everything else is free game for when i’m not working. anyway i went out shopping with one of my friends for some “fall clothes” and i found a super nice outfit. a pair of jeans and a knitted sweater. i was stoked that i only spent $40 on it and was super excited for when i got a chance to wear it. well one day me and my friend were talking, a few weeks after i got the outfit, and naturally i just slightly complained, “i really wish i could wear my outfit to work, since i haven’t gotten to wear it yet”. and she said “well go for it girl!” to which i replied “i can’t, itll get destroyed in 5 minutes, and probably be burnt up when i go to weld (since it’s pure cotton)” to which she replied “who cares, just wear it to work”.

it really upset me that she’d root me on to destroy my brand new outfit, before i even got a chance to wear it outside of work. i kinda ignored her after that since it kinda hurt me, and her comments been bothering me since. ive had lots of people not realize how hard my job is, and how dirty i get (over other things), but to encourage me to wear it and destroy it felt really wrong. she could’ve said something like “well let’s go out this weekend!” or something else, but she insisted i wear it to work to get destroyed. 

anyway, that’s the story. lame story but still one that haunts me when i see the outfit. by the way, i did end up getting to wear it a few times out with my boyfriend, so it’s not totally wasted in my closet. thanks for reading.",20Dec2020,1

During the summer this year I finished the original soundtrack for an indie horror movie titled DECOMPOSITION. It was being released in a couple of weeks from now, but it was revealed in a group chat of those of us involved in the film that the director had been making a series of deeply hateful comments towards Turkish Muslim people.

What ensued was a very dramatic saga, as you can imagine. The director proceeded to aggressively defend their comments, the usual ""freedom of speech"" spiel. So I dropped out, and pulled my permission for the music to be used.

So here is RECOMPOSITION, the estranged horror soundtrack. 100% of the proceeds are being sent to MEND, a charity whose aim is to tackle Islamophobia in the UK by raising awareness and educating the public on the issue.

80,"The holidays are always a conflicting time for me. I've always loved Christmas, but it was always a period of stress in our home. 

Every year for most of my childhood and early teenage years we would travel to spend Christmas and New Years with my father's relatives in another state. My father has something of an obssession with his siblings, which is not reciprocated, my mother never truly liked them and they never made an effort to make us feel included. She also resented these holidays since it meant spending most of december and january in my uncle and aunt's house doing only what they wanted. My mother worked all year and couldn't enjoy her vacation, while my uncle and aunt traveled the world. To my father this was a proper vacation, but not to my mother. This was the only kind of vacation we had anyway, we barely traveled anywhere else. They also made us take quick showers and one year didn't wanted to let my mother wash and change our bed sheets, which resulted in us leaving sooner.

Don't get me wrong, despite his many faults my father is a good father and a good husband, but transforms when he's around his realtives. There were many times through the years where he was nasty and aggressive to us in front of them, while being only smiles and jokes to them. I have so many bad memories of these holidays, but somehow I never stopped loving Christmas. As a kid I had a phase where I used to draw floorplans of huge houses, and I always included several bedrooms for my father's relatives so that maybe one day they could spend Christmas in our home instead. 

One year, I think I was between 14 and 16, my father decided not to travel for Christmas in the last minute after having many arguments with my mother about it. He was nasty and sulked the entire time, he didn't prepared anything for us to eat and we just stayed at home miserably. To him spending Christmas with us, his family, as spending it ""alone"", as if we were not good enough. Back then I keep thinking on how different our celebrations must've been, because my relative's Christmas party didn't stopped because we weren't there yet my father sulked at home and refused to celebrate because he wasn't with them. A few days later we traveled to spend New Years with them, my parents made up some excuse about my mother being too sick to travel before. I will never forget he put no effort into making Christmas memorable or enjoyable for his children, all in the name of this stupid obsession with his siblings. 

After that I think we must've had one or two Christmas with those relatives, since then we have mostly celebrated it at home ""alone"" as my father says or inviting family friends. When it's just us my father still sulks as if he would much rather be with his siblings, and it always hurt. I know I'm not perfect, an entire life of being put down turned me into a very quiet person who can't look people in the eye, so I am aware I'm not the best company. But I participate in other ways, by baking and preparing all of the desserts even if it's just for us. My father and I drifted apart around the time I turned 6 when he stopped to treat me like a little kid and instead became more and more angry, I became terrified of him. My mother in turn blames me, every since I was a kid she tells me she never saw a child who doesn't speak to their father, as if it's my choice. I'm an adult now, but it wasn't so long ago I was the kid in the relationship. How was I supposed to make it right?

I wish our entire lives had been different. I wish I had one of those families were everyone can be who they truly are without the fear of being judged for it. Who chat and laugh merrily on every ocassion, always with new fun stories to share with each other. Maybe now by 25 I wouldn't be an outcast, hiding at home with no friends, no job, no experience in anything in life. 

Today I am arranging what I'll need for this Christmas, and I hope it will be my last.",20Dec2020,1

90,"Women like bad boys.

Now, this may seem contradictory to my previous post:

[Women don’t like Nice Guys. Women like good men.](https://www.menwithmanners.com/dating/women-dont-like-nice-guys-women-like-good-men) (If you haven't read it, please know that I'm referring to the modern definition of 'Nice Guys', not actually nice men).

But hear me out.

Firstly, Just because women like good men, doesn’t mean they dislike bad boys.

Secondly, not all bad boys are assholes.

Thirdly, the attraction a woman has to bad boys or good men is dependant on her romantic intent.

Generally, women like bad boys for short-term relationships and good men for long-term relationships.

But I know plenty of women in long-term relationships with bad boys

There is no denying that many women develop feelings and engage in long-term relationships with bad boys, but we need to consider some factors:

**Some bad boys aren’t as bad as you think you are**

Some men give off a bad boy vibe on the surface but are sensitive and sincere in the company of a woman.

Just because a man has tattoos, a devil-may-care attitude and is popular with the ladies, doesn’t mean he’s a bad person.

There are many misunderstood bad boys, that are fundamentally good men.

You can’t always judge a book by its cover.

**Some bad boys mature into good men.**

Some bad boys become good men with the love of a good woman.

*Disclaimer: While this is a wonderful sentiment, and one that has proven to be true many times before, it can just as easily go the other way. Many bad boys show signs they could evolve into good men. As a result, women can waste years waiting for him to change, yet never watch him make any real progress. Buyer beware.*

**Some women mistake drama for passion.**

Many relationships between women and bad boys develop into ‘long-term’ because neither party understands the difference between drama and passion.

There are many relationships between bad boys and women that are just plain toxic.

I’m talking screaming matches, emotional manipulation and constant petty attempts at inspiring jealousy in one another, followed inevitably by intense make-up sex.

Anyone on the outside would call this a highly dysfunctional relationship.

She, being on the inside, justifies it by saying ‘we’re just passionate.’

**Some women are bad girls.**

Some women are bad girls. As such, they specifically have a preference for bad boys.

*Disclaimer: If you aren’t a bad boy and you’re trying to pursue a bad girl who only likes bad boys, it’s likely time to cut ties. The emotional mind games will exhaust you and send you crazy.*

So why do women like bad boys?

What is it about a bad boy that attracts a woman?

Here are the top eight reasons:

1. Bad boys are cocky

Bad boys are naturally cocky, arrogant individuals.

They ooze self-belief to such a point, it often borders on self-delusion.

**Women find this attractive because…**

Women like a man who is sure of himself. The narcissistic levels of a bad boy’s self-belief are often enough to make a woman believe in him as well.

2. Bad boys offer her the thrill of the chase

Bad boys are usually indifferent and emotionally detached when it comes to women.

This leads a woman to feel like she can never quite tie him down, but rather, she is in constant pursuit of his affection.

**Women find this attractive because…**

It’s a natural human emotion to want what you can’t have.

3. Bad boys intimidate others

Bad boys are notorious for being people that other people don’t fuck with.

They strike fear in their fellow man based on their unpredictability and their ‘I’ve got nothing to lose’ attitude.

**Women find this attractive because…**

Funnily enough, because it ultimately makes them feel safe.

With an intimidating bad boy on her arm, a woman feels protected and looked after.

4. Bad boys are projects that women want to fix

Bad boys are often seen as damaged good.

They’re cold-hearted, they’ve given up on life and they’re seemingly incapable of love.

**Women find this attractive because…**

of their maternal nature, combined with a strong desire for the sense of accomplishment that follows on from fixing him.

Many women view the arduous task of fixing a bad boy as an exciting and rewarding mission.

5. Bad boys won’t pretend to be friends

Bad boys have no issue making their initial intentions with a woman incredibly clear.

They clarify these intentions with natural charm and effortless flirtation.

Though this may seem shallow, there’s a nobility in their honesty.

**Women find this attractive because…**

Women aren’t always looking to become the best friend of a man they bed. Sometimes they just want emotion-free, no-strings-attached sex with a man they’d sooner sneak out in the middle of the night on, rather than have breakfast with.

That’s right gents, sometimes women enjoy effort-free sex also.

Another reason women find this attractive is that they appreciate a bad boy’s sincerity, no matter how one-track-minded.

6. Bad boys are exciting

Bad boys excite women. Between their nonchalance, their ‘fuck the world’ attitude and their natural ability to push the boundaries and risk offending, bad boys are exciting.

**Women find this attractive because…**

Women enjoy the feeling of excitement. This is pretty straight forward.

7. Bad boys allow good girls to be bad girls

Bad boys encourage women to release their inner bad girl.

Inner bad girls sit dormant in a lot of women.

The reason bad boys have a reputation for surfacing a woman’s inner bad girl is that women feel they can reveal her without judgement.

**Women find this attractive because…**

It allows them to be uninhibited and free. When a woman releases her inner bad girl, she has the opportunity to push boundaries and explore a side of herself that had previously, only existed in fantasy.

8. Bad boys say ‘Fuck the system!’

Bad boys are notorious rule-breakers who reject the premise of ‘the system’, uninhibited by the opinions of others.

**Women like this because…**

A bad boy is his own man. Instead of letting the world bring him down, he flips the script and plays by his own rules.

How do these traits compare with those of a good man or a Nice Guy?

Now we’ve considered the traits women find attractive in a bad boy, let’s compare them with the equivalent traits of a good man and a Nice Guy.

1. While bad boys are cocky…

**…Good men are quietly confident**.

Bad boys are loud and proud. Good men are quiet, but still proud.

Good men don’t rely on aggressive proclamations of their self-obsession, but rather, they believe that actions speak louder than words.

A good mans easy-going, effortless approach when engaging with a woman tells her more about his confidence than words ever could.

**…Nice Guys are unsure of themselves**

This is obvious when you consider:

\- Nice Guys are people-pleasers, afraid to stand their ground

\- Nice Guys are constantly apologising to a woman

\- Nice Guys are nervous and unnatural when speaking with a woman

\- Nice Guys have a fake superiority complex and constantly criticise others (women read straight through this, and know his criticisms are compensations for his own insecurities).

**What does it all mean?**

Whether a man possesses confidence, or he possesses confidence’s immature younger sibling: cockiness, both represent self-assuredness. Women like self-assuredness.

What women don’t like are passive, bitter yes-men in the form of Nice Guy’s

2. While bad boys offer the thrill of the chase…

**…Good men offer the thrill of the keep**

A good man makes a woman feel thrilled to know she’s ‘kept’ him.

He does this by making it known to a woman that he isn’t with her because he needs her, but rather because he wants to be with her.

When a woman has a good man, she’s got something better than an unending chase, she’s got a great keep.

**…Nice Guys don’t offer much of a thrill at all**

Nice Guys are predictable and overly dependable.

As a result, no woman being pursued by a Nice Guy ever experiences that fear that she could lose him, nor does she feel any thrill or satisfaction at the notion of being able to lock him down.

**What does it all mean?**

Bad boys make women chase them, good men make women want to keep them, Nice Guys provide a safe, boring back-up option.

3. While bad boys intimidate others…

**...Good men command respect from others**

A good man relies on his sincere charm, a calming presence, respectable demeanour and general self-assuredness to bring other people on-side.

Good men don’t need to strike fear in others, because other people like good men and as such, wish to cause him no harm.

**...Nice Guys are considered annoying, but harmless.**

Nobody is intimidated by a Nice Guy.

Some men view Nice Guy’s as push-overs.

Others view them as creepy and overbearing towards women.

Some consider them to be whiny, annoying losers.

But does anyone fear or respect Nice Guy’s?

No.

**What does it all mean?**

Whether other people view a man as intimidating or respectable, both serve the same purpose in the eye of a woman: they make her feel safe and protected.

Nice Guys have a tendency to be viewed by society as whiny push-overs, which, of course, is the opposite of being viewed as fearless protectors.

4. While bad boys are projects for women to fix...

**…Good men are projects that women want to be involved in**

Good men attract women for both the man they are now and the man they’re on course to become.

Good men strive for self-improvement, no matter how good they are already.

A woman finds this attractive as she wants to be a part of the journey that makes a good man, great.

Where bad boys give women a sense of accomplishment by fixing him, good men give women a sense of accomplishment by joining him.

**…Nice Guys are projects that don’t give her anything**

Women have no desire to fix a Nice Guy because he’s already obsessed with her.

She also doesn’t want to take part in his journey with him, as his cynicism and bitterness suggest he lacks the drive and self-belief to make himself better.

**What does it all mean?**

Though good men and bad boys may differ greatly here, the outcome for a woman is the same.

They assure a woman that by being with him, she’ll be taking part in something that will generate positive results and offer her a sense of accomplishment.

Whereas with Nice Guys, they offer no such potential.

5. While bad boys don’t pretend to be their friend…

**…Good men often initiate with friendship**

Good men often have a far more subtle and measured approach to women.

But not on purpose.

When good men begin a relationship with a woman, they do so under sincere pretences.

Sure, he may find that as his relationship with her develops, so too do romantic feelings. But this doesn’t stop him from getting to know her in a sincere and engaging manner, nor does it make him start acting like a nervous schoolboy in fear of her.

Once he has established his attraction beyond friendship, he will make it known to her in a direct, yet respectful way.

**…Nice Guys end up in the friend-zone**

Oh, the dreaded friend-zone.

A Nice Guy’s limbo.

What Nice Guys often don’t realise is that they end up in this limbo of their own doing.

They like a girl, they act intensely overwhelming towards her, but they never make their intentions known (after all, she could say no and he’d be crushed).

This makes a woman feel uncomfortable, as it’s incredibly obvious he likes her, but his lack of ability to do something about it naturally condemns him to the friend-zone.

**What does it all mean?**

Although bad boys and good men appear to act in the opposite way when it comes to befriending women, their approaches produce the same result. They show themselves to be sincere in their intentions.

Nice Guys, who show all the signs of interest towards a girl, without ever making a definitive move, will only ever come across as insincere, lacking confidence and unattractive.

6. While bad boys are exciting…

**…Good men are interesting**

Good men don’t rely on emotional manipulation to keep a woman interested, because they’re interesting men in general.

A good man’s ability to interest a woman comes down to the fact:

\- He actively listens to her

\- He keeps conversations flowing with confidence and ease

\- He knows how to flirt in a fun and playful way

\- He gauges her reactions before he reveals any semblance of affection towards her

**…Nice Guys are boring**

Nice Guys give a woman nothing to be excited about, as they’re too predictable.

They respond to her text messages immediately and constantly dote over her.

Nice Guys let their whole lives revolve around the women they’re interested in.

As a result, they have nothing else going on in their life to make a woman find them interesting.

**What does it all mean?**

Excitement and interest evoke similar emotions within a woman, thus she finds both qualities of a man to be attractive.

While bad boys often use mind games to keep a woman interested, good men offer a more sustainable approach through their substance, engaging conversational skills and by showing their affection towards her at just the right time.

Nice Guys, being predictable and overbearing are boring to a woman.

7. While bad boys allow a good girl to be a bad girl…

**…Good men allow a good girl to be a bad girl**

Good men can also inspire women to be bad girls. They do this by:

\- Not being afraid to ask her what she likes.

Good men aren’t awkward when it comes to sex. They can have a mature conversation with a woman about sex without getting weird and coming off as inexperienced and unsure of themselves.

\- Passing no judgement on a woman.

Good men don’t judge a woman on her more taboo interests when it comes to sex.

By not passing judgement, a woman will lower her defences and gradually open up to him sexually, exposing the bad girl that lies within.

**…Nice Guys idealise women as innocent and subservient**

Nice Guys have a habit of treating a woman they’re interested in as an innocent, lost, damsels in distress.

They treat women as if all women are good girls, only looking for good guys to have good, vanilla sex with.

**What does it all mean?**

Women’s attraction to bad boys and good men when it comes to their desire to release their inner bad girl comes down to one thing: Their fear of judgement.

Nice Guys idealise women as innocent princesses, and women interpret these views as prone to severe judgement if they reveal their true selves..

8. While bad boys say ‘Fuck the system!’…

**…Good men know how to work the system**

Good men don’t feel the need to rebel against the system, because good men know how to make the system work for them.

A good man is under no illusions that the world is imperfect.

Still, he faces life’s challenges with humour and optimism.

This tells women that he’s in control and he knows how to make the system work for him.

**…Nice Guys are a victim of the system.**

While bad boys are against the system and good men accept the system, Nice Guys are victims to the system.

Nice Guy’s approach life with cynicism and negativity.

They are highly critical of others. Sadly, Nice Guys believe that by being highly critical of others, they’ll appear superior.

Quite the opposite.

When a Nice Guys continuously criticises everyone and everything, all he’s telling a woman is: ‘I am a victim of the system.’

**What does it all mean?**

Whether a man denies the framework in which society exists, or he’s figured out a way to make it work for him — both traits tell a woman the same thing: He is his own man and he’s found a way of living that works for him.

Nice Guys act bitter and beaten down. This tells a woman he is a victim and a loser.

Final thoughts

Though their approaches differ, good men and bad boys attract women for a lot of the same fundamental reasons.

Both bad boys and good men are self-assured, fun, non-judgemental and natural communicators when it comes to women.

A Woman may periodically favour one over the other, based on her age, the company she keeps, her upbringing or her recent experiences with other men.

Though bad boys may fair better at pursuing one-night stands, just as good men fair better at attracting women for long-term relationships, women are attracted to both of them.

Regardless of what you’re looking for from a woman, one thing for sure is clear:

You’ve got a hell of a lot more chance as either a bad boy or a good man than you do as a Nice Guy.

Good men, keep up the good work.

Bad boys, keep up some of the good work.

Nice Guys, start working on yourselves.",20Dec2020,1

I had a little bit of food in the fridge that I was going to use to make a whole meal with some other ingredients and my mom threw it away because she thought it smelled bad when it smells fine! Like, what the hell?! I understand she wasn't malicious but I really hate it when my stuff is messed with, especially since this was going to be a while meal and now it's fucking wasted! But I also hate how stuck on this I am! I don't want to be stuck on this! I can't do anything about it but I'm so frustrated! AAAAAAAAGH!",20Dec2020,1

97,"I found out recently and had a look. You can buy different vaccines for 20-100 kids, you can buy bars of soap for communities in need, you can buy maternity kits, water purification tablets, a box of school equipment etc...

All of these are anywhere from £20 to £200+

It's so easy and I had never heard about it before. Now I hope to tell more people about it

There were hundreds of comments from Bosch dishwasher owners raving about them, and I get the impression I walked into a secret club akin to those people who love their Airstream trailers. I also fielded LOTS of questions from people asking how much I liked it. TBH I'd never given it much thought before last night so here's my very detailed Review of my Bosch dishwasher: 

The Model number of the dishwasher is SHX65T55UC If that means anything to anyone.

https://www.bosch-home.ca/en/productlist/SHX65T55UC

And there is a very beautifully embossed Logo (Like logo and sleekness of a nice car design or if you can appreciate the minimalist industrial design of, say, a high end cell phone) . The model name says ""SilencePlus 44 dBA"" just inside the door. I paid $899 Cdn on sale for it sale a couple years back.

I admit I'd never really given any thought to our dishwasher.  So as I was astounded last night how Bosch fans were just LEAPING at the chance to say how excited they were to see a picture of a Bosch - I started to give some thought about how much I liked it. Did I like it?  Why? 

Appearance:  Very modern, sleek, minimalist.  

Design:  Absolutely no complaints.  It is extremely well designed.  I must say that when we first started using it the wierd part was the lack of cycle options.  Our old dishwasher had so many cycle options where this one has just 4 real options and the delay buttons etc.  We spent the first day thinking 'where are all the other options'.  

Bosch did something impressive design work.  This dishwasher brand has less bells and whistles as options than other brands but it also has a way of quickly telling you 'don't worry I got this just lemme do my thing'.  So we quickly stopped thinking about it.  This is also part of the brilliant 'industrial' design.  


Dishes always come out perfectly clean.  

Using the thing:  WHISPER QUIET.  When it is running you cannot hear it.  Our refrigerator makes significantly more noise.  In fact there are many times we are in the kitchen and it's running but we open it forgetting we have put it on.  There's a red laser dot that shows up on the floor by the kick plate to let you know it's on. It's the only way to actually tell.  (Trust me I'm not complaining that my dishwasher it too quiet!) 

I realized people SHOULDN'T think about their appliances when they're going about their lives, that only means they're irritating them.  So the fact I'd never thought about my dishwasher other than to say periodically to my wife (and she says it back!) 'this dishwasher is awesome' is a testament to how well it's build and also how well it's designed. 
 
**Somehow** Bosch has made a machine so beautiful, well built, and perfect to use that it's actually **Almost Fun** to load and unload.  

Loading and Unloading:  SO simple.  No issues.  Very straighforward and not in any way irritating (if one can call doing the dishes 'not irritating'. )

The trays have plenty of space.  I can put 2-3 pots, plates, frying pans, bowls in the bottom shelf, I can put more full sized pots on the upper shelf with tonnes of glasses and mugs and they all fit easily.  There's enough flexibility in the racks to stack things so many different ways so find a way you like and go with it.  

Now the coolest part is the cutlery shelf at the top you can see it here in this pic: 
https://www.bosch-home.ca/en/productlist/SHX65T55UC


**People who own this dishwasher back me up here**:  The Cutlery tray is an absolute home run.  Hard to explain it and something that must be experienced but it's so simple and effectively designed that it somehow causes even disorganized people to enjoy lining up the cutlery. (it's a wierd experience... agian, it's so damn impressive you can load it up and unload it and it gives you a pleasant feeling - wierd - must experience it to understand) We have a system we try to stick to where we put spoons in one area, forks another etc... so when it comes time to put them away we do a sort of large 'scooping' motion and get all the same cutlery at once.  SO easy and for some reason it's damn satisfying.  

I don't want to jinx it but we have had no problems with it after using it 1-2 times/day (Teenagers at home... those kids can EAT). 

Summary: 

This Dishwasher should be inducted into a design museum hall of fame becasue it's just actually a brilliant machine.  I highly recommend it if you are looking to get a dishwasher.  It might cost $200-$300 more for it than other brands, but we got it on a deep sale at Lowes.  They have higher level models at Bosch too I'm sure they're just as good if not better but this was in our budget range. 

I have never had an appliance that was so impressive.  

Would love to hear from my fellow Boschers!",20Dec2020,1
