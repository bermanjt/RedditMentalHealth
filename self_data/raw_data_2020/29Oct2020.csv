0,"I shave and my skin look normal and lighter and radiant during the shave but when Iv finished my skin looks really browned is this normal? And it looks very dull and my face also goes puffy/rounder idk why. I’m not talking the shave area I’m talking the whole face. Sometimes It feels tight on my cheeks and smarting too sometimes and my lip on one side swellls up too
This happened everytime. During the shave my skin is moist and I look fine but after as I said it looks very dull and bloated looking. I don’t use aftershave will that help?
I use shave gel and new Gillette Mach3 or fusion blades every time. I take my time with it also

2,"
I have this memory of myself as a 4 year old. I’d had a puppy but she only payed attention to my mom. I remember she started following me around one day and I turned around and screamed “no! You didn’t play with me before so you can’t now”. Idk this may sound weird but I had selective mutism as a kid and I feel like I felt guilt immediately after and I always just assumed the dog would hate me forever because of that moment for years.  I feel like this was one of the first times I let out anger. I feel like I blame things on myself for years to the point where I can’t even consider the other persons feelings enough. 

I have memories as a young girl in dressing rooms with my mom being extremely demanding about getting the clothes I wanted and I’d have fits in the dressing room and fume with anger rambling cruel things. I have memories as a teen where I’d go grocery shopping as a kid and be mouthing off my mom cruel words the entire time.


In college I’ve sent my parents dozens of cruel texts demanding for them to send me money- usually just a few bucks. But I can start typing and spamming and demanding and getting cruel with my language. Just rambling cruel thing and my dad apparently said it’s like I have a stream of consciousness. 

I have memories of being 6-10 and standing still, staring straight past my patents and I’d start screaming “AHHHH” with wife eyes and an open mouth but it wasn’t like a controlled thing- it was like I was checked out


I don’t really fight with friends much but with a guy I was talking to I sent him really cruel drunk texts. He was in the wrong but spamming someone with angry texts and name calling is messed up no matter how drunk 

But my parents aren’t great. I have memories of being five years old and having my mom jab me with markers repeatedly, rip up my shirt while I wore it, and tackle me while lightly banging my head into the floor. She’s taken pictures of my stomach and giggled to herself even though I’m slim. She’s made comments about how the dogs think I’m evil and my friends would hate the real me. She thinks humor is mocking and teasing someone and goes way to far. She randomly acts really stupid because she wants people to laugh and giggle at her like she’s cute and she gets really giddy. I also had a controlling friend who treated me like her pet when I was ages 11-14. She wouldn’t let anyone else compliment me and would deny others compliments but wouldn’t let me have other friends and would try to tear me down.

19,"Don’t get me wrong, I couldn’t give the slightest of fucks, but I suppose I do see why they laugh... perhaps it’s because of the stereotype Redditors have surrounding them or something? I don’t know, I feel like most people think that, if I’m an active Reddit user, that must mean I have no life (or something along those lines).

I feel like that’s the most plausible scenario, but honestly, that’s really a shame; if only people knew that it’s actually the opposite; unless all you post is pictures of puppies or memes and whatnot (which, don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against you folks that do, you make my day every time I see your posts), I feel like what makes the things people write here on Reddit (as far as text posts go) as interesting as they are is BECAUSE of the things in life that they experience(d).

And Reddit is the perfect place to come and share those experiences (as well as exchange thoughts) with others, not to mention the advice people give and receive!

Oh well, though. Like I said, I don’t mind that people laugh at me whenever they find out that I like using Reddit, because it not only serves as a tremendous escapist activity/hobby for me (of which I am not ashamed of), but I don’t think those people realize or are even close to realizing just what they’re missing out on and the amount of knowledge they can accumulate as a result of engaging in discussion and/or seeking advice, among the plethora of other things you can do here, let alone just browsing/lurking.

24,"So I'm in my early 20s, and on and off this year I'll get occasional shooting pains in my left breast. At the moment I don't have a full-time job (mostly cause of the pandemic) and since my dad died suddenly this year I no longer have coverage from his health insurance so I have no idea how to afford a mammogram or ultrasound, since I can just barely afford to support myself as is with the job I managed to get recently. The pain is always in the exact same spot, which makes me more concerned because in the past I'd have intermittent pains on either side that were pretty obviously hormone or injury related  and were never in the same spot twice. 

Also, I've had a long history of dysmorphia/dysphoria (in my case the two are entertwined), and I've been vehemently wishing for years that I could just get a double mastectomy so I'd never have to worry about either cancer or dysphoria anymore. While I did question whether I am trans, I've settled on the understanding that I'm just a tomboyish female who would rather have a flat chest, or at least a significantly smaller one. But even if I could get insurance or a job which would give me insurance (can you tell I live in America lol), I'd still be hard pressed to get such a surgery covered whether or not I had breast cancer, since apparently women who don't like their breasts is seen as weird and insurance companies don't like paying for reductions/mastectomies unless the woman is in literal pain or other physical distress from breast size.

Just wanted to rant because there is literally no one I can talk to in real life about this, and I'm dead broke and have no clue what to do. Cancer runs heavily in my mother's family...my grandmother had breast cancer, my grandfather had prostate cancer, and my great-grandmother had bone cancer...also two of my dad's brothers died of cancer. So my pain and my unshakeable intuition that I need to get a checkup even just to make sure is really bothering me.

I grew up with the internet as much as the next average 25yo. We had early AOL, MSN, and Forums. We went through our ceinge years on it too.
All of this is super forgivable when you grow up into an average adult that just so happens to like the internet.

This past week really shook me though. I posted a meme that did really well and I've never gotten that much attention in my life. It was overwhelming. There were possitive responses, negative ones, ones making BOLD accusations, some that were just super sexual and lastly, one person... invasive.

They went into my history and read some dark posts that I'm not ashamed of but if this is going to happen, should I just delete them? They then found every way to contact me, the post, on comments, in my DMs.

They told me over and over how my husband is awful and I'm clearly so beaten by him that I don't know better. That I should listen to her and the subreddit female dating advice (which I think is fucking cancer). All of this to drive the point home that I'm a poor 25yo who's a beaten house wife and I need to leave him. To be better.

I constantly tried to put her down like a knipping dog for my face, I was polite, I was bitchy, I was confused, I asked her outright to stop this assult.

I was scared. It felt like she was everywhere. It may have been more in my head but I have anxiety, it felt big. I was afraid in that moment that she'd hunt me down on other media to attack my marriage.

I am still new to this whole world of online activity but I want you to know that I find you all to be such supportive, beautiful and open people! With that being said, I have found myself attacked by mostly my peers for simple things, I am not the best speller, I don’t know how to use my “there, their, there’re” properly, when I explain why I write the way I do (I’m autistic) I was told “that’s why Reddit has communities for retards” sorry for the language. I shamed for being a feminine gay woman and been told I was asking to be raped because of my femininity, I was mocked for being pro-women’s rights...in mg short time on Reddit I have been called, once again I apologize for the language, “retard, faggot, queer” for existing, “ignorant and bossy” for thinking women have a right to abortion, “lair and whore” for being abused, and “stupid and un-American” for not siding with either the left nor the right...I am not here to say I hate Reddit, I love it here, everyone is welcome and opinionated, I love that! But never have I been called so many different slurs so casually, I’m frustrated, confused and upset but that doesn’t take away the positive I’ve had here. 

The reason I’m posting this is because I’m a gay, autistic, asthmatic, awkward, fem, abuse survivor, lover of all of earth, feminist, BLM ally, human helper and pasta lover who has lived her entire life as a round peg in a square hole world and this post is dedicated to all the round pegs, we may not always be understood or accepted but we are not alone, you all matter, are loved, wanted, needed, important because we all make the world spin so let’s me kinder to one another and embrace our differences!

I’ll start off, all of Reddit, I love you, say what you will about me, I’m happy your here, I care about you and if you need anything, I’m here for here for you regardless, your beautiful and keep doing you, here’s a hug just in case you haven’t had one in a while 🤗

 Can the promise be considered as a product of the ocd? I mean, the guy had control of his thoughts but he just, made a tiny mistake for some seconds.

39,"When I scroll through subredits on making new friends or just finding someone to talk with, I often see people expressing their true feelings and thoughs, which are often considered to be somewhat somber. Then I also see people saying something like ""I won't be your therapist.""  Words like these would make me hesitate more on trying to connect with people on Reddit. But today I realized that when people express those feelings they are often not looking for someone to fix them or to have self-proclaimed therapy sessions with. They are looking for recognition. In the end you can only truly connect with people if you fully understand and accept each other. 

Sure I can say that I am intelligent, pretty, like adventure and to have fun but I would be selling a partial (and probably too idealized)  image of myself, which would be dishonest to me as well as the other people I am meeting.


If I were to voice that I have been going through depression, that I feel lost and often push people away because I am terrified of showing that side of me, I am not asking you to fix me. I am simply looking for someone who would understand me or recognize what I am going through. Do you not recognize this part of me? Then that's totally fine. Do you recognize this part?

4 months ago I came across a 2 documents that was in Java script that was sent to me because I was the back up email address on her mail. On investigating all the IDs went back to sex chat rooms with cams.  I was in shock because she was part of this.  


I then found out that she has been doing this for almost 15 years. She has made her own porn videos and been involved with the sex industry for all this time.  


I have managed to get most of her sex posts and pictures and every day just gets worst. I am ashamed of this Indian granny and the things she has been up to. It's a disgrace that this bitch has got away with such disgusting acts.  


We where a very well off family with every thing of the best because I worked away in Africa earning a substantial amount of money which was all sent to her.

Note : My English is not so well so apology in advance

48,"**Background information:** okay, this might look stupid to others but it's killing me. Earlier I used to leave the house between 7-8 am and returned at 9pm, so this was never really a problem before covid but now it is a  major one. 

So, my schedule is 

8-11am- Basic School

1-1:45 pm- Econ class

1:45- 6:30 pm- Chemistry, Maths and physics class 1.5 hrs each

I spend most of my time in my room, but the thing is that our cleaning lady usually cleans up the house in the morning, somewhere between 8-9:30. I like to prefer working on my desk. It is impossible for me to work on my bed because for some reason, I become extremely sleepy as soon as I climb on my bed.

**Problem**: I feel extremely weird when she cleans my room. She is way older than me and I feel like I am disrespecting her by making her clean my room. I have talked to my mum in this regard several times and asked her if she could tell the cleaning lady to not clean up my area, instead I' could do it myself but she never takes me seriously. She tells me when I move out, I can clean my own place but not in this household. Now the major issue is that, I have to attend my morning session of classes from my bed because whenever she is in my room, I try to avoid her or pretend that I am sleeping. And because of attending the classes from my bed, I fail to concentrate and get really sleepy. I sleep a lot in general and even just sitting on my bed makes me dizzy (this is a real problem I promise). Attending morning classes in bed gives me three major disadvantages:

1. Slow start 
2. Wastage of time and not paying attention in class
3. I sometimes sleep in between or after class (between 11-1)

It's just too much wastage of time that I can't afford, my schedule is jam-packed already. Now, the reasons I prefer bed over studying on my desk in the morning:

1. To avoid direct eye contact with her
2. If I sit on my desk, there is continuous interruption by her as she insists on cleaning the table, flooring under the table, etc.

**What should I do? Working from bed isn't working for me, it would be very helpful if someone could provide me with a solution to this dilemma. Also, is there something fundamentally wrong with me for behaving this way?**

50,"Three years ago I escaped an abusive relationship that lasted three years and caused me to lose all my high school friends. I bounced back and within half a year I became such a boss. I was driven to achieve my goals, my motivation was pure and I had the confidence that allowed me to rationalise any situation. I met my current girlfriend, and despite working a job I disliked and having constant arguments with my father, I knew it was temporary and I was still incredibly happy. I study Psychology, and my aspirations did not even consider money - in fact I would always say “money is just the bonus, I only want to help people” 

Fast forward to present day, I’ve experienced 6 weeks of vertigo, I graduated with a Psychology degree, I’m currently completing and doing quite well in postgraduate studies. Yet, despite over coming so much hardship and achieving these milestones, I feel empty, I feel like I’ve become everything ‘old me’ aimed not to be. 

My aspirations feel unrealistic, I’m motivated by money more than simply helping people. I feel unmotivated to complete any project - I just feel like I’m not good enough. I feel useless and... boring. The biggest thing is my obsession to earn money, rather than aspire to provide a service that will help the most amount of people effectively. That, and my lack of confidence to embark on any sort of journey that deviates from the usual 9-to-5 - which was not the case earlier in my life.

I was this introvert fuck as a kid who was always scared and nervous of people. My family is very strict. All they focused on was my grades. Never cared about what I want. I never got to live my childhood. I was so afraid of people that I literally used to sweat while talking to them. Years passed by, changed a lot, got into a relationship, got cheates on and pushed to the starting line. I became that terrible asshole always shouting on people for not standing up to my expectations. I know that nobody is obliged to do that but yeah, this is who I am. 

Again years passed by, never got into a relationship again. Its been more than 8+ years now. I hate everybody. I feel like people cheat and lie and dump me. I left all my friends and I literally have nobody in my life right now. 


Started talking to people on anonymous websites like reddit and I felt free to express myself. But then there's a price for every treat; I got judged. I've realized that I have two sides - The anonymous one where I feel comfortable in talking to people, happy-go-lucky kinda person and The  real side - Scared, aggressive and what not.

I’m living with someone who is full of hate and anger. And that stuff is contagious. This person is narcissistic, abusive, controlling and more. He demands everyone in this house do what he wants or we are selfish and don’t “care about the family”. 

All he ever wants are more things. He talks about having a bigger house, a better business, nice cars, a pool, and more. But every new thing is at the expense of the rest of us being in trouble for maintenance and making him happy. Hell, he practically expects us to bring these things to him. He says he wants these things for the family. But I know he just wants to look good while controlling those close to him. 

I could live in the tiniest house with what I need. I would be happy. I would be happy if I could struggle without this person in my life. I’m not allowed to pursue anything without him knowing. I can’t leave the house without him knowing. I can’t get a new job without him knowing. If I make the slightest mistake we all get in trouble. I’m “fucked in the head” and “can’t do anything right” if I don’t clean up after his kids. 

There’s so much more to this. It would take forever to talk about. I just don’t understand why some people are so evil. Why are some people so ungrateful and only take from people....only to call those they took from ungrateful.

73,"I've been looking for a job for ten months now. Most of the pandemic success stories Ive been reading has always been about someone who lost their job but immediately got another one after a few months or so. And here I am, someone who's had about 500 applications sent to companies.

As a quick background, im an undergraduate of a design course. Throughout my years as a design student, ive never felt good about myself...not when im surrounded with smart, talented people. Or people who are fast learners. But I was always able to shrug it off by being carefree. 

Now that Im locked inside the house with no source of income and being forced to look for a job, Ive never felt worse about myself. I was forced to face the music and admit that I would probably never land my dream job-- not when there are so many more who are much more talented.

78,"I took a week off from work not too long ago. Being home and having time to cook dinner, do my homework for classes, cleaning the house, and my hobbies was amazing. I felt motivated again, to live, to learn, and to one day work from home. I accepted my fate for now is to work. 

I went back for two days, before I started developing this horrendous cough. I was fatigued, had a headache, etc. I went and got my Covid test, and was condemned from returning to work until the results came in. 

I’m going to be honest here, where I’ve withheld the full truth from everyone in my life. I purposely have been delaying hearing results, as I knew once they came in I’d be snapped back to reality. Today marks one week since I have been tested. The results should have been here days ago, so I knew something was wrong. I waited until today, the absolute latest I can get away with before actively pursuing results. And my heart dropped when I saw the negative result, which I knew it was going to be. 

So here I am. It’s the morning still; I should text my boss and tell him I am free to work. He will ask me to work today, if I do. In which I would have to say yes, in order to pull off this half lie I’m going to tell everyone. I know I can get away with getting so long off; even tho my results came in days ago. I just lie and say the forms they gave me when I left didn’t have all the info (I lost them). The people at the clinic told me I would receive a call with either my positive or negative test result, so I didn’t know to check online.

This post is partly a confession, partly a release, and partly a...plea? I suppose? I am just 19. I was  forced to grow up too fast, I moved out on my own because I can take care of myself better than my mom can take care of me. It sounds conceited when I say that, like a child who thinks everything’s easy. Trust me on this; my mother has always been a mess, and I know life is horrible. 

I just, I want to work from home. I’m the supervisor of my department, where I work. I do sales (along with the generic retail stuff), and I’m getting a degree in marketing, which I’ve learned is essentially what my current job is. 

This post may come off as me being naive. Those of you who have years on me, especially those who work retail, may especially judge this. I know that life isn’t easy; the 9-5 grind is like an endless cycle of wake up, go to work, come home, eat dinner, go to sleep, repeat. 

To break that cycle and find a job that doesn’t make you feel despair at the thought of, takes work and time. It’s naive of someone to my age to think I’ve ‘put in my time’. Maybe the 9-5 grind is just what life is, and I’m too whiney, and I need to suck it up and bury the concoction of sadness and fear and as previously said, despair. 

I like my job. I’ve been there 3 years, I’ve been through several different upper management teams and all have enjoyed my work and treated me well. Currently, my management team is extremely forgiving and ‘lax’, I like that I know that store and everything about it like the back of my own hand. I like how my customers refer to me as an ‘expert’, I like the flow of work. 

I just spend weeks at a time, sometime, hating the face of every person who comes up and asks for assistance at work. I can play nice enough, but I feel like crying when they leave. It takes so much out of me to fake it for a shift. To spend 8 hours a day laughing at jokes I don’t think are funny, asking people about themselves and feigning interest at their response, altering my voice because my natural tone comes off as “aggressive” and not peppy enough. My eyes burn sometimes and my throat has that lump in it, as I apologize to a customer for not being able to do an impossible request, as I apologize for things out of my control. 

I don’t know if I can call another customer and have them hang up on me, snap at me, or grow hostile. I really am not a sleezey salesperson, I genuinely want to help. I cry when I make my calls sometimes, because I can understand why they’re mad, and I feel like a piece of crap even though my intentions are pure. 

I generally care about people on a very detached level. I think my caring about others stems from a desire to be well liked, not necessarily for their sake. I don’t want to sell crap things to people because I want them to trust me so they’ll buy later and so both they and my district manager will like me. I care that the customers are happy with my service; I really don’t care that your dog died yesterday and you’re sad. I’ll feign understanding and pity, so you will tell me how amazing I am and how top notch my work is. 

And with that, I will end this. I have drawn a conclusion, one I have not previously considered. I have realized my selfish desire to be liked by people, especially people I like (ones who provide me with the most happiness, and ones I tolerate the most) is the fueling desire for any action. It’s the reason I can’t keep a friendship. It’s the reason I get sick of partners after a year or two, it’s the reason I am failing to work. I don’t do things for genuine care, only to strengthen the relationships that provide me with a benefit, relationships I’m ‘supposed’ to care about. I give people attention when they tell me I neglecting them, and once they seem okay I revert back. I talk about me, and talk about others because I’m supposed to. I talk about them, because I want them to be happy. Only because if they’re happy, then they’re happy with me, and if they’re sad or mad, they treat me different.  I’m sad my dad died, I think about him often, but now I don’t know if I’m sad that he is dead, or if I’m sad that I will no longer reap the benefits of that relationship with him. 

To some degree, I know that is natural human nature. Of course you’ll care, more often than not, about the people who treat you well. Hell though, I don’t mistreat even ‘enemies’. I’m rather pacifist in most things, avoid conflict at all costs. I guess I’m just not sure how much of this is normal and at what point I can be considered a psychopath. 

I’ve traveled far off path, and I doubt anyone has read this far. What began as an absolute despair at the thought of returning to wrok (still there, we are just potentially stock piling now), to I’m probably a psychopath. I lie in day to day life about my intentions for doing things, and I lie to myself too. Sometimes I start to believe it. Sometimes I do believe it, even though I know it started as a lie. It’s just a ‘better’ motive than what I originally had, and now this one is more justifiable to others.

I tried to talk and discuss with my dad about his problem and come to a solution but he just manipulated my words. And when things got really bad he raised a fist at me. If I didn't try to stop him I think he'd have hit me. I'm scared and worried. We drove to our grandmother's house for the night and on the drive she said she wishes to die.
My brother started crying and I begged her to not say things like that.
Idk what to do man. She doesn't have the courage to file for a divorce. Honestly my dad doesn't earn as much as my mom and he's very insecure about it. He's in pain and he turns it into this vile hatred and fabricates things in his brain and accuses everyone of such atrocities that are too shameful to even say out loud.
Idk why he hates us so much. Why did he stay with my mum for so many years of he is so sure she's cheating on him. He doesn't even have any proof even after doing those things like checking on her. He just doesn't like my uncle and that kinda spiralled into this ugly cheating angle. The worst thing is my uncle doesn't even live with us. He lives in another state. He never even lived with us. He visits occassionally and since my dad is like this he reduced it greatly. He doesn't even call.
I'm worried for my mom. I want to take care of her but I don't know how. She acts like everything is alright. Even to my granny she said my father is doing  night shift so we came here. Grann understood something was wrong but thankfully she didn't ask details. I'm in the hall now and my brother is with my mom. This is all too much. My anxiety is acting up. I'm having panic attacks and my father says I'm ungrateful and everything.
This is a mess. Fucking mess.
I'm a mess.
I'm afraid my brother will end up like me. Jesus fuck some people can't even listen to others.
Like it's me. His daughter. His own blood but he looked at me with such hateful look that I wanted to disappear. And when j say he replies oh I'm the worse guy here . I didn't do anything for you I understand. I'm a waste a bloody waste? And I'm like when did I say that I literally begged him to stop screaming and me and he got all that?
How do I deal with such people what do you do in such times. Is this going to get better. What if my mom really dies. Fuck man. Fuck",29Oct2020,1

86,"I'm 22f, I've always been shy and found it really hard to make friends I'm not really social and need a really long time to trust others and be comfortable to talk freely around them and by the time i do get comfortable they just distance themselves.

I haven't been seeing people much since the pandemic but yesterday i was visiting my relatives and i got reminded of how I'm really around others and it put me down so much.
Like when i go to college i don't want to be all alone like a loser with no friends or something, i want to know people and i want others to know the true me not some shy girl who is mute.

But my biggest problem is that i don't know how to talk, i don't know how to answer or how to keep a conversation going without relying on the other person to keep it going.
I hesitate so much when i try to speak while someone else is talking because i don't want be ignored cuz it happened a lot before or when i try to speak up and it end in awkward silence.
I have no confidence to look people in the eye while talking and I'm self-conscious about my words, like sometimes just to keep someone's attention on me i start talking fast and end up not finishing my words or i stutter and again it end up in awkward silence.

I feel like all this happens because as a teenager i struggled a lot socially, i got interrupted while speaking or got ignored and i keep having to repeat my self to be heard and now it just keep happening and im getting tired of it.

What can possibly help me overcome this, is it even curable.

Hell,  I could be one of the people I can't stand. The anonymity brings out a  side of people and how full of themselves they are. How  psuedo-intelligent they think they are, and often how ironically  ridiculous they sound.

A recent  example: An engineer made a comment on a post about how gases work.  Another person had made a comment stating they want to breathe 02 and  not C02, to which he said that is just a myth made up in a Russian  basement they heard online and are repeating it.

Bruh,  you heard that it was made up in a Russian basement and now you're  repeating it. No proof of that whatsoever, and states it as fact.

He has molested her in the past (when she was 17) and sometimes he’ll come into her room and just sit there in silence, but she’s too afraid of him to say anything to him because he is a violent meth user. Well last night after sitting in her room for x amount of time, he told her “Im going to fucking murder you” and then said “I want to fuck you” and she was very scared. Then he showed her a note on his phone that said “Let’s fuck.” I told her to tell her mom, but supposedly her mom has a big mouth and will most likely confront the guy about it in a way where he’ll became insanely mad and take it out on my girlfriend. And my girlfriend won’t call the police because even if he got arrested (he has a warrant out for his arrest), she’s afraid that once he gets out he’ll come straight to her and harm her. And also they have pot plants and such in their house (doesnt belong to her but her mom and brother) so they dont want to be incriminated as well. Idk what to do. I feel so hopeless and weak.

98,"Rant: 
So we were having dinner, and I didn't hide my annoying side ""too philosophical"" coz.. why would i ? I found myself not holding back. As he was talking and talking.. i comfortably expressed my honest opinions. I could see he didn't like it. In fact it was satisfying to me that he didn't like it coz it made it sweeter. He was a typical male saudi who wanted to dominate the conversation- which i hated. What was more annoying than him was that my friend (his prospective gf) was acting a little bit different in a way (i guess to impress him). A little bit less like herself. Less daring.. and more ""appealing"" to him by being the quiet agreeing shadow of herself. . I didn't like it one bit because she has the most amazing personality... why did she feel she had to tone her beautiful self down to impress him?. Ofc i kept it to myself because obviously she likes him and he likes her back...

And the other friend who just got married comes to us complaining all the time that her husband says no to a lot of stuff. She talks to him like a stranger.. she treats him like a guest in her life.. and he believes he has the final say in her life... including meeting us (her friends).. 

why do these women accept being treated/judged like this? I wish they would appreciate how unique and amazing their personalities are... they don't need to compromise. I wish they had faith that someone worth the wait is gonna cross their paths and s/he would be the best friend they always wanted.

101,"Today I found out that as of last Tuesday, two of my three childhood friends are dead. The first died in Middle School (suicide). And now the other has died at the age of 24 (we're thinking it was an OD). We all went our separate ways a long time ago, but we would still see each other from time to time. 

He went down a dark path, largely thanks to his parents who are both criminals (who seem to know somebody as they keep getting out of hot water) and started pushing illegal substances onto him when he was still just a kid. But one day in high school we started hanging out again when he moved into the neighborhood again. But it wasn't for long, because I decided to get my life on track and walked away from anyone who was doing drugs. 

In my heart, I knew the day would come that I would hear of his death, and I knew it would be sooner rather than later. I knew there wasn't really anything I could do. He was too far gone, too dependent of drugs, and thanks to whatever connections his family had he was in it too deep to ever escape.

I know it isn't my fault. I know that he made his decisions, and that I made mine. And I know that even if somehow, however impossible as it was, I managed to reach him it still wouldn't have made a difference. Because I've reached out to friends who seemed hopeless before, and I had the strength to stay by their side as a friend while they messed up over and over, and eventually got clean and became contributing members of society again. But with him, I knew that truly I couldn't save him, and nor was I in a position to.

But even so, as one of the last two still alive and breathing, I can't help but feel a sense of abstract guilt. Like maybe I could have done something, I just didn't want to bother. I'll never know now, and this is kind of upsetting. I feel numb, and heavy.",29Oct2020,1

106,"Last year, as a huge geek, I was sent by my college debate team to a tournament in another state and put up in a hotel room.

I'm always told that I am so stuffy and prudish and safe. I was talking with my friend Harriet about how I never do anything out of character. She said ""Go streaking."" I laughed and said ""what?!"" She said ""You heard me. It's the last thing you would ever do right? Get that bubble butt moving.""

I laughed it off, but later on at 1 am...I got the itch.

So I stripped down to nothing but my glasses, looked down at my pale, rounded chubby belly, took a deep breath and stepped out into the hallway and took off running.

I had my hands in the air, yelled WOOOO the whole way and back, and felt the freedom, not to mention the breeze on my bare white butt.

And then I came back to a very locked door.

Oh my God.

Suddenly, the hallway felt ice cold. And my formerly confident self was now a butt-naked geek. Feeling the jiggle of that ""bubble butt"" behind me that Harriet would also tease me about. And there I was, meekly hiding my package with my hands, and walking down 6 flights of stairs to poke my head out the stairwell and ask a laughing female front desk worker for a key card.

108,"Im not explicitly anti-meds for mental health problems. Zoloft kept me from committing suicide for sure and Id never deny that... But the side effects were very bothersome, so I weaned myself off slowly. I was fine for awhile but... The creeping feelings have started to come back. I dont know what to do... I know WHY Im struggling. Everyone is! Its fucking covid season worldwide and everything is SHIT. But for me, it feels way worse. Its not just the odd bout of melancholy for me- Its often way worse than that. And lots of things set me off. Like today I woke up and a bathroom tile fell off the wall. Then the faucet just wouldnt stop dribbling. Then I read almost 200 people got covid in my province today, and every day for the past month has felt like record breakers. I managed to deal with all of that even though it bothered me greatly- Ive been doing better weathering the bad feelings. But... Ugh this is so dumb but... I finished my morning ritual (Wake, shower, coffee). I brewed a nice cup with my french press, sat down and poured my coffee... Aaaaaaand the cream had turned. 

Im not proud to say that this is what set me off down a bad path. Like, it wasnt even JUST the coffee being bad. Its that the ritual was derailed. I know its not THAT big a deal but with everything else? Ugh. I got up and threw my cup in the sink, causing it to shatter, and from then on I couldnt stop thinking about how shit everything is. I couldnt stop thinking about my shit apartment. I couldnt stop thinking about how Im about to lose my job AGAIN due to the pandemic. I couldnt stop thinking about how the government assistance Im supposed to get is already SUPER late, and that even contacting the government by phone takes hours and hours. I couldnt stop thinking about the shit leaders in my province who seem intent on making this pandemic as horrible as possible through their terrible decision making. Basically- The world is shit, and without that veneer of normalcy through ritual I could no longer ignore just how bad everything is around me. My dad had slipped me a few Lorazepams just in case and I had to take one to cool myself off. I hate doing that though- Those are not drugs to fuck around with.

Ive tried meditation to lukewarm success. Ive tried CBT therapy. I take CBD oil. I do all the things Im supposed to do, although I could probably do some of them better... And it just doesnt help. Im starting to be convinced that my feelings arent WRONG, just how I deal with them. I dont think meditation can make me feel better about my life, when there is no light at the end of this tunnel. I just need to learn that life is terrible for most people and thats that. But what a fucking way to exist right? Damn.

The meds made me feel better. They evened me out a lot- I stopped having these emotional tail spins, and rage outbursts. But it also took away the laughter. It took away sex. It took away Frisson for fucks sakes. No more grapefruit, no more psychedelics. It just kind of made me placid and grey. The world wasnt shit brown anymore, but it sure wasnt very nice... Just kinda sorta livable. Is that all I can expect for my life? Do I just go back on Zoloft and live a placid life with none of the lows, but also none of the highs? What even then is the point? I want to be around for my partner and my family because I love them so much but I prospect of a colourless existence might actually be worse than the thing its covering up.


And on top of that I tried to talk to my doctor about ADHD. Its something I was diagnosed with when I was a child- I was on ritalin and everything. And looking into it Im pretty sure many of my depressive and anxious symptoms are just symptoms of the ADHD. Maybe if I dealt with THAT, my issues would be more managable. He  didnt have much to say about that, but gave me a referral to a psychologist. But psychologists where I live cost several orders of magnitude more than I can afford so that was fucking useless. So pills it is I guess? Or nothing and slowly push those I love away until I feel comfortable killing myself I guess. Those are my options! Those are the options people who arent wealthy have to deal wit.... Hey see? Im doing it again. Im ruminating on how shit this world is. Fuck.",29Oct2020,1

112,"Imagine yourself sitting in a chair. someone comes into the room and asks you to stand up for some reason, maybe you have to go somewhere, maybe the person wants to sit down, it doesn't matter. You don't want to stand up, you could just stand up but you won't. You consiously make the decision not to stand up and you end up not standing up for the rest of your life, you get moved to a wheelchair and live the rest of your life sitting. Maybe some years later you finally decide to stand up, you can't, your legs are to weak and your mind stops you either consiously or unconsciously.

This is a theory that I have based on the Placebo effect. The Placebo effect is a medical 'treatment' where the doctor gives the patient something like a bunch of pills or an injection, however the pills/injection is not actually medicine but something like sugar pills or a Saline injection. The patient still end up feeling better just because the brain think it is medical and helps the body.

I think that you can 'fake' being sick and still be sick, I mean if you limit your body in some way and suffer from the symptoms of the disease because of your thoughts and you can't do anything to prevent it and you are practically sick. As I said you can't do anything to prevent it just like any other disease. However this theory only works if you think of the brain as an unpredictable thing that you practically doesn't have any control over, eg you don't have control over your thoughts and choices.

 What is a choice? It is your mind choosing the best thing to do in a situation, it uses knowledge from previous experiences to decide what to do in a situation and then uses the new knowledge from that situation to decide more future choices in an ongoing loop. What else does this? AI, deeplearning more exactly is very close to my view of the mind, both AI and the brain learn and makes choices and I think thet we should use the knowledge of our minds to further deelop AI.

115,"Hey guys, fair warning, this post will be a little long, though I'm gonna try to keep it concise.

A little backstory, my parents divorced when I was 7, and I haven't seen my mom since 12 (court-ordered). My mom has mental issues that are unaddressed really, as she refuses to see a doctor for help. She may have been diagnosed schizophrenic or bipolar at one time or another, although we are unsure because she told my father that and it could have been fictitious (she could probably be considered a compulsive liar). 

I grew up in a decent, middle-class home with my dad and step-mom, siblings, and had visitation with my mom. Good life, I didn't have to get a job until 18, so we were decently well off. Played football, got As and Bs in school, was never popular but had my small group of close friends. Had most of anything reasonable that I wanted. Later in high school I did higher-level classes to challenge myself, and I passed them all and got a second diploma to go with my high school one. Pretty neat but mostly useless, but helped me get noticed by bigger universities. 

I was always the 'aim for the moon and if you miss you land amongst the stars' kinda guy, so I really wanted to go to live at a 4 yr university and just get my degree, but the advice I was getting was that the debt would bury me if I did that. So I chose to go to a local university for much cheaper and then try to transfer for my junior/senior years. I lived at home and commuted to save some more money too. I ended up hating school, the classes were actually behind what I had learned in high school, so I was bored. I worked 40+ hours at McDonald's and did 18 (might've been slightly fewer, I don't recall) credit hours at school, so I burnt myself out quick, and my grades and my mental health suffered. My sleeping habits went from an A+ to an F (I used to get up between 6-630AM without fail, almost every weekday, and then afterward it has \~ zero consistency and I cannot hold a sleep schedule for any longer than maybe a few months). Long story short, I changed jobs, dropped out of school, and basically became a live-at-home, work 15 hours a week guy.  Parents wouldn't let me be that, which is totally understandable, so they said I have to get out or do something with myself. So I moved out. Been working entry-level stuff ever since just to make ends meet, really. Luckily it's just me and my cat, no kids, nothing extra.

Anyhow, I don't think I have been okay in the head ever since. I don't know if its just depression that has stayed with me for 6 years, or what. I have suspicions that I may have some sort of combination of bipolar/anxiety/paranoia just like my mom had. From what I can gather, many of these symptoms may not become serious until mid-late twenties. I do tend to have insomnia, to varying degrees (some nights I just don't get tired until far too late, some nights I never get drowsy and don't sleep at all, sometimes these sleepless nights come for 2-3 nights on end), I would say I have pretty crippling anxiety (I wont even go to the bathroom, grocery store, gas station, etc. so that I can avoid interaction with people). Not to mention just general depression (hopelessness, worthlessness, inability to do simple tasks, inability to keep good hygiene, etc). I've come to notice that I cycle, it seems like about every 5-8 months or so... I'll have a week where everything is going great, and by the end of it I suddenly don't need much/any sleep, I'll be up for 1-3 days on end, and then I usually crash, mess up my sleep, mess up my job, and mess up my whole life. Every six months this has been going on, more or less, for the past 5-6 years. I've tried some stuff for these things... Melatonin, breathing meditation, counting sheep, reading, yellow light filters, etc. are examples for sleep stuff I tried. In terms of the mental stuff... I don't really have any way to fight besides by putting my head down and just working again.  I have asked doctors regarding the depression, etc., a couple times but was never given any meds or anything. I called a dozen psychs at one point, only got 1 call back like 2 months later. Ended up seeing a family counselor (solo) instead for about 2 months.

All of that said: 

I just had one of my ""episodes"", so my sleep schedule is fucked, my finances are fucked, my job is fucked. I'm almost at square 1. The good news is that I actually contacted my job and let them know that I am having mental trouble, so I'm technically still employed, despite not earning money. I am in the process of contacting HR to see what the deal is, whether I can come back, etc. We'll see.   

But: 

I know I need to see a psychiatrist about the mental stuff 

I know I need to see a normal MD about sleeping pills 

I know I need to find a way to pay rent / get food 

I know I need to find a way to heat my apartment 

I know I need to find a way to pay for my car  

Those 5 things are basically my priorities, in order. The mental and sleep stuff has me so fucked up that I cant even think about eating and other normal shit, its bad. I did an application for medical insurance through the state so I could see a psych, as well as food supplement, but I don't know if I can even be eligible considering I'm still employed technically. I also don't know what unemployment benefits could look like, for the same reasons. Right now, I have 30 days before I have to get out of my apartment, unless I can come up with money.

I guess I just need some kind words and any words of advice from anyone who has been through something like this. I feel like I've given my absolute all into being a contributing member of society, and I just cant fit the bill. And no matter how many times I've tried so hard, I always fall, and so far... I keep getting back up. I just feel like I cant get up anymore, man. I feel like I barely have control anymore, I'm just watching my life happen to me. It brings helplessness to a whole new level of meaning, ugh. I kinda need a gameplan, but I don't even know where to start.

And I don't want people to be afraid, \*\*I'm not suicidal, I'm not planning on hurting myself or anyone else to any degree\*\*. Not that the promises mean anything really, but I've made promises to my family that I would never let myself get so far gone that self-harm could be a reality, and I intend to keep that promise. I guess I \*am\* really afraid of what waits at the end of the road that I'm on, but for now I'm okay.",29Oct2020,1
116,"I usually tend to focus on things that I do wrong, or that I dislike about myself. I never feel like anything I do is worth being proud of myself, but today I am. I went to college for two years at a school I knew I wanted to transfer from since freshman year. I only went there because I really doubted myself in high school and only applied to colleges I knew I would get into, which all weren’t that great (to me). When I decided to transfer, I only applied to one school, which is really good school that I never thought I would get into in high school, and I got in. This is a big “I told you so” moment to younger me, and I have never been so proud of myself for accomplishing something. I don’t think anyone realizes how much it means to me every time I now get to say that I’m a student at this school :,)",29Oct2020,1

But he is alive. 
He is living, he is laughing, he is loving...
he is happy with someone else. 
He left.
And he chose to leave.

So the grief has no end.",29Oct2020,1

120,"I loaned my friends daughter my antique bassinet (been in my family 3 generations)   she begged me for it, so after I was perfectly clear I have to have it back, and I just found out today that she sold it.  I am heartbroken, and very angry,  what do I do?  Is there any answer to this? besides ""lesson learned"".  Can I take her to court?    She and her mother are known to get items for ""nothing"" , whether it's a gift, a loan,  whatever, and turn around and sell it.",29Oct2020,1
121,"Because of COVID my school had decided the best way to teach kids will be to compress what you learn in a Half a year to a quarter. 1 class would be online and one in class. I got 2 of the hardest classes (Math and Physics) in the same time. 

My cousin who I was very close with just died 1 week into school. And the rest of his family is in intensive care. 

My math teacher isn’t really good with technology 
and I really don’t under stand his lessons. 

I fell behind in physics because of my cousin dying, 
And couldn’t catch up and don’t understand what my teacher is teaching me. 

My home life isn’t that good too, my dad just bought a restaurant, he expects to help him with the technical things, social page and all that. I don’t have a desk to study so I study in the dining table but it’s loud there. 

I wake up at 4 am and try to teach my self maths and try to catch up on physics but I can’t mostly because of how stressed I am. 

I am really scared for my future, I feel like no jobs will accept me and I will keep falling behind. I am really scared.",29Oct2020,1
122,"Okay a bit of backstory , i have been back at university for a month now and I'm enjoying it but I have a problem . 

I've developed a massive crush on my best mate's flatmate over the last month or so  and I already know she doesn't feel the same way as I know for a fact she swiped no on me on tinder (my mate told me )  , I was fine with this until today when my other friend and flatmate came back and told me he's matched with her and even though I've attempted to tell him how I feel , I'm positive he's going to go for it with her (who can blame him ? ) and its making me borderline suicidal . 

I liked this girl last year too but she had a long term boyfriend so I didn't care but she's single now and this one,  it really hurts because I thought I might have a chance.  And we are also very good friends as she sees it so I see her a lot with my mates . 

The other issue is that in general she keeps popping into my head every 15 seconds and it is ruining my productivity . The only time I wasnt thinking about her today was when I was in the gym ,I tried to do some work earlier and did it to a pathetic standard because of what my friend told me, I was too preoccupied and disappointed in myself to do any . It also makes me just stare at my phone all day which is unhealthy and annoying . I probably thought about her in every minute today 

 I'm someone that used to enjoy being alone and doing nothing but relaxing with some music in my room , I currently cannot do this because she is always in my mind . I realise that this is pathetic and creepy and unhealthy behaviour but I needed to get it off my chest. 

TL;DR  I  like my best mate's flatmate , already aware she doesn't see me like that , despite this I cannot stop thinking about her obsessively and its made me go from being a happy productive person to someone who just stares at his phone all day thinking about her.  On top of this my other best friend and flatmate has matched with her on tinder and currently talking to her , and its making me deeply upset and unhappy . I know he can do what he wants but I know it would deeply hurt me if he got with her.  


Thanks for reading and I would really appreciate some responses with advice  to this . Thanks in advance",29Oct2020,1
123,"(I have ADHD so I'm sorry if this explanation is choppy and all over the place.) Ok so a bit of backstory, my parents are living separately right now, my dad having moved out and living an hour away for work and my mom staying at home. Prior to my dad moving out they've been having very nasty arguments for some months now but they're still married. So my mom has this work friend (let's call him Mr. A) who I've been seeing more often around the house lately and they work together so they spend lots of time together. My mom is out of the house almost all day everyday working (I'm guessing) from the morning and coming home at like 1AM sometimes. I thought nothing of it until my 14yr old sister came to me one day and said she saw a love poem on our Mom's phone dedicated to Mr. A... I thought she was trying to be funny and didn't believe her so I just never thought about it again. So jumping to 2 months later and I still see Mr. A around the house from time to time, I've recently went on my mom's phone and saw texts between my mom and Mr. A and he was calling her baby and was complimenting her and they call each other ""love"", keep in mind Mr. A has a wife who is currently in the hospital so that really sucks. I also saw texts about them going to a hotel for a work thing... So yeah I'm like 90% sure there's something going on between my mom and Mr. A and I'm not sure how to feel about it, I kind of feel indifferent towards the situation, I don't know if I should confront my mom or tell my dad or just do nothing.

If there really is something going on between them then my mom and Mr. A are really the scum of the earth because she knows his wife is in the hospital and I don't how you cheat on your significant other when they're hospitalized.",29Oct2020,1

126,I have been overweight for the majority of my life. It started when i was probably 8 or 9 and crying in the limited too dressing rooms because I couldn’t fit into anything and wear clothes like my friends. I remember being younger and giving up junk food for lent because i thought it would help me lose weight. Fast forward and I am 22 now and have only gained more and more weight. During quarantine I was sick with covid and was severely depressed and I gained 15 pounds in about 3 or 4 months and I feel so embarrassed about it. I am now the heaviest i have been in my entire life.  My number one goal every year is to lose weight and I can never achieve it and i just want to give up because it so disappointing to never be able to do it. I really do try my best with eating and working out but it doesnt seem to work. I even got bloodwork done to see if anything was going on (and honestly praying there was something wrong with me) and everything was a okay. I really just feel like what is the point of even trying anymore. I know my main goal in life should not be based on losing weight and making myself smaller but it is always what my mind returns to. I dont let myself enjoy any accomplishments because I always think about how i cant lose weight. If I can do all these things why cant I lose weight? I also know all my problems wont disappear if I ever lost weight. I told myself I would never get a boyfriend being the size I was throughout high school and now I have a boyfriend I love with my entire heart and treats me like I am the most amazing thing in the world so I obviously proved myself wrong thinking I would never get a bf so why do I still myself I need to lose weight to deserve anything? I know this is kinda all over the place but I just hate always thinking about losing weight and thinking that I will somehow magically be worth more as a human being if i had a smaller body.,29Oct2020,1
