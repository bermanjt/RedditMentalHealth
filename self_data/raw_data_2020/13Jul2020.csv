0,"I was drunk and high on multiple drugs because at the time that's all I was doing. I was in my first and only year of college, extremely depressed and suicidal and just spent all my days partying and using substances to shut my mind up. I still do a lot of the time, but it was at its peak here. I remember I got home, scribbled this down then went to bed. The poem:

Living furiously a moth to flickered flame

Darting through a darkened sky

Let sorrow never tame

A clear sky's canvas brings to be

A feeling of ignorant harmony

Before sun's face can come to rise

Leave future sadness no surprise

A wild night

A blacked out year

I really wish I wasn't here",13Jul2020,1
1,"Hey so I don't know if this qualifies as some kind of social anxiety disorder and it's better dealt with by a professional but I feel like I struggle way more in social interaction than someone my age (21M) reasonably should. It's this weird thing where I'm just so good at and dedicated to psyching myself out into thinking I'm this weirdo and everyone knows it. Obviously this tends to tank my ability to handle talking to people, in the moment I kinda freak out and don't trust my ability to come up with something 'normal' to say (One on one conversations tend to go better for me, this happens more often in groups). Whenever I get out of my own head enough to confidently engage in conversation I can kill it like the social skills are there I have plenty of friends I've murdered interviews and dates and social interactions where there is real and legitimate pressure and consequences but for whatever reason a solid 80% of the time I just go into self sabotage mode. I was a really funny and social kid too (I was a bit of an asshole to other people, and I'm starting to think the asshole never really went away he's just pointed inward). I was bullied a little bit in high school and never really stood up for myself (this really bad habit continues today) on top of playing a lot of video games so that's probably a bad combo and related. I also avoid conflict like the plague which probably plays a role. 

I have this trial by fire mentality of fixing things. I went to a big university, picked up a job at a big sports bar, force myself to go to parties and social events even if I don't want to. I've made some progress but when any kind of depression kicks in it definitely starts to feel like one step forward two steps back. I'm heavily considering doing the marine reserves just to get my ass kicked a little bit I'm thinking the extra pride and maturity is gonna help (on top of other reasons), end of the day though I know any kinda change has to be internal. I get the general solution is pushing my attention outwards in conversation and paying attention to other people/being a better listener but that can easier said than done when I'm playing these mind games with myself (I tend to zone out a lot in general, including in conversation). I've done plenty of YT research and watched plenty of Jordan Peterson, the guys putting the solutions I'm looking for at my feet and idk they just don't register as well in action. The core problem has gotta be super low confidence and self esteem, I just really don't believe in myself like I used to in more ways than just the social interaction aspect of my life. Like a female coworker will approach me and in my own head I'm just like 'wow only a complete weirdo could fuck this up......... uh oh' and proceed to fuck it up.

Anyway I feel like putting thoughts like these into words by itself can help a lot and input/other viewpoints can also make a big difference, so if you've experienced anything similar or think you have an insight that could help let a dude know. Tough love is definitely welcome and I feel like tends to be more helpful. Feel free to tell me to just quit being such a bitch lol. Thanks

Rereading this makes me feel like a relatively articulate person but my ability to bottleneck myself is just out of this world.

**TLDR** I have an extremely powerful escapist mentality and I'm trying to get better (more consistent) in social environments.",13Jul2020,1
2,"It's a long story that I don't wanna tell but I was at a small gathering a couple years ago and two other guys I didn't know came over. One of them had a pistol and started showing it off. He was extremely drunk so I knew this was a horrible idea. I was on the couch and he was right in front of me standing maybe 3 ft away. While he was waving it around he pulled the trigger and the gun fired. I went into panic, pulled my knees up over my face, plugged my ears and just felt like an eternity went by. I didn't wanna open my eyes because I knew someone might be dead.


MIRACULOUSLY nobody was hit, but it was only by inches. It went right in between my friend's legs, missed her knee by a few inches and went into the couch/floor.



I don't know if this is severe enough to be considered a traumatic event since nobody got hurt, but I still think about it consistently every single day",13Jul2020,1

4,"3 weeks ago my Dad was arrested for domestic violence. He has been abusive to me(M18), as well as the rest of my siblings and mother for as long as I can remember. And I mean physically, verbally and emotionally. When the police arrived on our doorstep because my neighbour had called them after she‚Äôd heard noise of screaming kids coming from our house, I thought this would be the end. That I would no longer have to spend my life in fear that I would be beaten up for the tiniest mistake I dared to make, verbally abused and threatened and witnessing my mum being hit and crying all the time. However, this feeling only lasted a while. It turns out that even after all the evidence, proof and statement we had given to the police against my father, he has been released and no longer on bail and can now return home. When I heard the news, I almost felt like fainting. He came around today and sat us all down and started yelling about how we snitched on him and how the police showed him videos from their body cams on all the things we had said about him and how scared we were. ( I didn‚Äôt even know this was legal for the police to do??? This was the most vulnerable we‚Äôd ever been and I thought the body cams was only there for them see or some sort of protection. The fact that they showed it to him completely pisses me off because I told them not to tell him about anything we had said, only for them to do the exact opposite.) He said he was really disappointed in us all, especially me for reasons I don‚Äôt understand and I suddenly feel this heavy guilt on top of me. He walked out and said he‚Äôd be back tomorrow. Right now I don‚Äôt know how to feel about any of it and I am quite scared. I‚Äôve been crying a lot for the past hours and it‚Äôs only now I‚Äôve decided to write this. Comforting words would be really helpful. Thank you for taking your time to read this.",13Jul2020,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt üëî and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Graham‚Äô I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

6,"Sorry mate, I put the random dead cat on your car.

It was years ago now but I know it still confuses you. You loved cats, well not really but you didn‚Äôt like the dead one with half a face I left on the roof of your car. It all started when a friend and I wanted to freak out the locals

My friend (lawyer) and I(accountant) were doing quite well at the time, we assumed no one would suspect us in our low populated town. We thought we were above everyone else and we‚Äôd never get caught.

It started when we found a dead fox on the side of the road and we discussed how ‚Äúweird it would be, if we put it in a bin bag, tied it to my leg, then swam out 100m to a boat and placed it on the boat then return with the bin bag. Everyone would be like ‚Äúhow‚Äù. ‚ÄúHow the fuck did this fox get in my boat, no one would do this.‚Äù 

I loved animals. But once they‚Äôre dead I saw them as nothing more than a prop. This spiralled out of control quickly. Next it was a badger in the children play park strapped into the swing. Then it was the pigeon in an old pair of baby shoes with a lollipop in its mouth glued to the towns welcome sign. So that‚Äôs why we did it. We NEVER got into the paper. Not once, never got any attention from it, nothing hears through word of mouth ever. Nothing.

WE WANTED TO SEE REACTIONS. We didn‚Äôt know the people we were doing this too, they weren‚Äôt writing furiously on FB groups or contacting the local paper, no rumours were going around town. 

Then we hit the mother load...

A dead cat. 

We couldn‚Äôt let this go to waste we had to see a reaction or at least hear about it. You being a very close friend of ours, (who didn‚Äôt know we were doing this kinda thing) you would give us your reaction. 

So we found the cat about 5 minutes from your house. At first I  thought it was a badger from looking at it, it was quite dark, was always dark when we did this. When I picked it up it was still warm. I could feel the warmth of it. I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a badger, too small to be a ferret... I think it‚Äôs a cat mate‚Äù in my ‚Äòwhat the fuck, should I put it back?‚Äô voice. But we threw it in the back of the pick up truck. We don‚Äôt know why but we thought the roof of your Nissan Micra would confuse you the most. Within 10 minutes of us driving away. You called us. 

‚ÄúGuys, I don‚Äôt know what to do, there‚Äôs a dead baby on my car... I don‚Äôt know what the fuck I‚Äôm going to do, I can see it from the lounge.‚Äù

I‚Äôm so sorry mate, we couldn‚Äôt tell you it was a cat. If we did you‚Äôd know it was us, I mean you are a massive twonk for thinking the baby probably had a fur coat on but still. I‚Äôm sorry. You panicked. You googled what to do, obviously not many results. You were terrified. You didn‚Äôt want to call the police, you weren‚Äôt the smartest of people so you assumed they‚Äôd think it was you. You eventually found the courage to go to your car. When you saw it was a cat, you were relieved, yet more tearful. I remember driving back up to comfort you. You were so confused, who would do this?

I remember the smell, and how you wretched while hurling the dead cat into a neighbours garden, (still don‚Äôt know why you did that) then you thanked us. Every now and then you talk about that night and ask yourself ‚Äúwhy me, why did these psycho‚Äôs pick me.‚Äù

Because we needed a reaction we didn‚Äôt get from strangers.",13Jul2020,1
7,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, forgive me if it's not. I (18M) have been struggling to understand myself over the last 2 years. I live a normal life, with a little pushy parents. If it's important,  i was verbally bullied a lot during my primary school years, but other than that there was nothing wrong happening from the outside. 

On my 16th birthday, none of my friends came to the party i organised. Since then, i started to have this tight feeling in my chest that at the time i thought it was just a little heartbreak. 

My best friend, who didn't come to the party and openly said to me that she had to choose another friend's birthday party, used to send me literally 1000 messages in our first month of friendship - promising that we would make best friends doing crazy stuff together for a long time. Well, not much of it came true and shortly after she wouldn't call or send a message unless i do so first. The last time we saw each other was when she came to my house a year ago and all she did during our hangout was texting her boyfriend while talking to me. The night after she left i felt the tight feeling in my chest again as usual, but this time it was worse.

Everytime i made friends with anyone it felt forced, as if i bothered them. I could've talked to them about it but their body language always proved my suspicion. Except for the people who used me for money and lending my camera, of course.

I became tired of chasing people for friendships and stopped at once. I couldn't be bothered anymore so my laptop became my closest friend while my parents stated how unable i am in making friends.
I became so disappointed in everybody that i minimised socializing to the lowest - i went for walks alone, hung out by myself, visited bars alone... you get the idea. 

Lockdown started this year throughout the world and i've never felt lonelier. Obviously i want to preserve my family's health so I respect all of the government rules and regulations. However, it doesn't help my situation. I want to give new people chances to meet me, but i always have these negative predictions that it wouldnt work and would do something else instead as if im hating myself. I have no self-hatred issues, though. But the tightness in my chest continues.",13Jul2020,1
8,"I feel like a fraud. My nan came back after a night out black out drunk (she's an alcoholic). She was stumbling up the stairs and we (me, my 2 cousins, F 10, F 14 and my uncles gf) helped her up the stairs and into bed. After we got her settled my uncles gf left and I decided I was going to sleep in the front room next to her bedroom just incase my nan needed me in the night. A couple minutes later I hear a bang and my nan falls out of bed, smashes her face, her mouth pouring with blood and she fractured a rib. We got her settled again in bed but then she started passing out, she stopped breathing so we were all screaming and I gave her cpr and mouth to mouth that I'd learned at army camp a couple years ago. I'm not even sure I did it right but she started breathing again. She did this twice and I ended up sleeping in the bed next to her that night, I didn't get any sleep and was up watching her breathing all night. Everyone keeps saying I saved her and that I'm a hero but I really don't feel like one. I don't even think I did it right but I'm just glad she's okay now. She's still drinking and we all want her to stop but ik it's bad to quit cold turkey but she won't go to the doctors about it. She kept saying she's only got 6-8months to live when she was drunk. She doesn't remember the night. 

She won't go to the hospital but she phoned the doctors and had pain meds dropped off (codiene phosphate I think) for her ribs since she can't make her way to the hospital or pharmacy herself.

22,"   I live and work in Norman, Oklahoma at a fast food restaurant.  Last night (7/11) and intense storm swept across Oklahoma.  To the point that, basically, the majority of Norman's power was out. 

   I clocked-in at 8:20am to a store without power.  Helpless, we cleaned and waited.  Power turned on around 11am.  We continued with opening operations and I was able to unlock the doors at Noon. 

   In the city of Norman an Ordinance was put in place where it is required to where masks in enclosed public spaces.  So, as a fast food place with a Drive-Thru and Lobby, we are able to turn down patrons without masks and offer Drive-Thru service or Curbside over the phone, but those in our lobby must have a mask or face-shield.  One of our first customer's entered without a mask.  As trained, one of my employees asked him if he had a mask.  He responded with ""The CDC does not require masks.""  I then jumped in (at which he was at the counter looking at our menu) and explained that the ordinance requires us to only serve those with masks in the lobby, but we offer DT and CS service and that I will not serve him without a mask.  He then storms out with a, ""I'll be back shit-head!""  He then went to his car to retrieve his mask.

   Other issues occurred in the store that made my day worse, such as, more power surges, my system resetting, Kitchen Monitors crashing, card-processor crashing, other customers complaining to ME about the CITY Ordinance.  At a point I just had enough.  In the middle of the clusterfuck that my store was going through, I went into my office and had a panic attack.  I wanted to walk out.  I cried a lot and called my boss.  She talked me down and I finished my shift.  Fixed all issues.  And realized that people suck.

   I don't know why I'm posting this.  I just want attention to be brought to us ""essential"" workers.  I've been with this job for 7 years and it took enough attitude and bullying from customers for me to call it quits.

I've never been able to figure out what I was supposed and not supposed to do, because everything good would be met with a negative reaction the next time I did it.

I've always been scared of pissing people off, so I was never mean to people, but then I was punished for being an asskisser, so I broke my emotional ties with everyone, and decided that it would be better if nobody was close to me, because then nobody would hurt me, and I wouldn't hurt anyone.

I had done this for so long that now I have no standard of how a relationship should be, and it's incredibly difficult for me to feel anything towards someone, which makes a relationship a chore to maintain most of the time.

Today's epiphany came when I got into an argument and nearly a fight with my sister (27), who I'm living with, because I was apparently pissing her off and being disrespectful, but I couldn't tell, because I've blocked out the emotional part of my brain, and with it went my social awareness.

27," Today, I felt depressed again, I was listening to a local podcast about loneliness online, to improve my mental health, when suddenly one of the speakers mentioned she was currently living abroad. And it just struck me like a lightning out of nowhere. I suddenly felt depressed again, because I felt jealous of the speaker, she get to live abroad while I do not. The main purpose of listening to the podcast to lift my moods has now condemned me into a much deeper, darker place.

I can hear the critics bashing my ungratefulness. Every single time when I see someone else having a better life than me I get depressed. Just yesterday, I was scrolling through Instagram, and I came across a post showing a couple being happily together, I get cast into the same deep, dark place. I feel my own inadequacies, never having a relationship in my entire life, being rejected by multiple girls. Is it because of my looks or my shyness or my lack of relationship experience? I immediately deactivated my social media to try to regain any sense of happiness.

But happiness was never meant to be found, for I can never fully escape the triggers of depression, escaping one just to find another. After graduation, I can never hold down a job. I was either too slow to complete my work or too unsociable.

My life is a mess, for wherever I go I meet a trigger for my depression, for whatever I do it has been deemed not good enough whether it was in terms of relationship or my job. For my life really is a mess because I live through it everyday.

29,"I suffered for 3 years thinking everyday I was dying. My hypochondriasis crippled me into a form of a person I couldn‚Äôt recognize. I was a shell of the man I was before. I thought nobody could save me. I was a few days away from taking my life, before I made my one last decision to just give a part time job a chance...

You hired me. Neither one of us knew each other at the time. My first day I started I realized the manager was a total dick, but you were so kind to me. I decided to stay and give it a chance. I worked my ass off, and you noticed. Everyday you would thank me for working so hard, along with the other coworkers, and that meant more to me than you‚Äôll ever know. I finally felt like I had purpose. I finally felt appreciated. And as the days and weeks turned into months I slowly conquered my disorder. I no longer feared illness anymore. I was empowered. 

Later on you became like an older brother to me. I looked up to you more than any other man in my life. We grew so close. I remember the day you told me you loved me, like a brother. That day changed me. I now knew that it was possible to have a coworker that you loved like family. I loved you too

You were the one that got me my promotion in the company. You saw how hard I worked and how much I cared about the team, even when the manager didn‚Äôt. You wanted to make sure that I felt like my efforts were noticed. And when you noticed how much the added responsibility of the new position stressed me out, you asked me everyday if I was ok. You always asked me if there was anyway you could help. You helped teach me how to respect people and how to make people happy. I grew under your wing like a protege and we both knew it. I was happy to have a mentor and you were happy to have someone to teach.

Everything seemed so perfect. I was happy. I had found my place. I had conquered my disorder. And I was working towards my future.

Then the pandemic happened.

I was laid off. It came as a shock at first, but I should‚Äôve seen it coming. I was the youngest and newest in the position, and I couldn‚Äôt perform like the elites.

I cried for hours that night. I wonder if you did too. I sent you a text to thank you for everything you did, but words will never be able to express how truly grateful I am.

I am sad to have lost you as a mentor. I am disappointed in myself for relapsing in my disorder, and letting it control my life again. I wish I still had you to lead me, to give me guidance. To be my older brother that I need so badly at this time.

But I know I will recover eventually. I have to. I will get back to where I was, or even better. I will make you, myself, and everyone else around me proud. I just wish I still had you to guide me every step of the way.

Thank you for everything you did.",13Jul2020,1

As a disclaimer, I only watched Shane's recent videos that didn't include any racy or pedo jokes. I didn't know about those until the scandal came out.

38,"We both dance lindy hop, a very social dance where switching dancepartners every 2nd dance or so is common.

Of course, due to the pandemic dancing has stopped - but he and I were hanging out all the time anyway, so we decided to keep dancing for the two of us... well, he was far more motivated than I was (I'm having a stressfull time with my studies this semester, and he as a leader was very motivated to get down new tricks while I cant give that muc input as follower)

So, in my country, the situation with corona seems to be calming down, there are less and less regulations, so people from the swing community asked us to meet up for dancing - I had been dancing before my boyfriend and kind of belong to the ""core"" of the swing group, while he might still belong to the ""newcomers"" - thats why they asked me, not him, but it was implied I could bring him.

I felt he was uneasy about it (thinking they didn't invite him, just didn't decline), but I was quite keen to see my friends again and to dance in a social gathering, although smaller than before, and I had fun and thought I was also taking care of him by offering dances and coming by to give him a little kiss...

Afterwards, he was completely devasted, as I had ""at least three times as much fun"" and he is just sad why I'm always reluctant to go dance with him just we two but have no problem to find the energy with others.  
(I'm not always reluctant and after talking about how he seems to have to carry the whole motivation was trying to be more active about initializing dancing)  


After a bit of digging I told him, that I can express my joy during dancing better with the others because they send me emotions to respond to- if I give him a wide grin during dancing, I'll get a small, kind of relucant smile while I'm used to dancepartners getting excited with me together.

In that moment, I saw his world collapse- appaerently his biggest concern is that he comes off as cold and not-readable and what I said was the worst I could have said. He lost all his motivation for dance, eventhough it was one of the things that gave him so much before that and now I all destroyed that within 24h.

I feel terrible and have been feeling empty ever since.  
I wish I could somehow rewind time - I thought, it would be a manageble problem to solve -him expressing more feelings during swing, but he has zero hope

He told me if there was any way he could turn it for himself emotionally, he'd try and we kind of agreed he could still dance for me, but he said he'll lost all motivation of dancing for himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas what I could do? Is there any way to fix that? I don't know if I should just wait it out and see if there will be a whole new perspective as soon as I'm through with my final exams (I have a study plan that requires at least 8h per day, I don't know how to bring it all under one time frame). But he's a person who get's caught by his thoughts and will obsess over his worries, so it might be better to take initiative now before it's too late and dancing for him is purely associated with his worries?

39,"I don‚Äôt know where to post this but I wanted to tell somebody about it. It was upsetting for me and still kind of is, maybe that‚Äôs dumb, I don‚Äôt care. I just hope she‚Äôs okay. Let‚Äôs call her Lola. 

I work at this place. I don‚Äôt want to be specific at all. I had this regular who I got to know for a couple years, a girl named Lola. She‚Äôs a little younger than me. I always thought she was beautiful and looked forward to every time I saw her. We became friends. We would always talk a lot when she came by my work, we had this little routine. Every time she walked in, she would walk up to me and I‚Äôd give her a high-five. Even if I was busy I would stop to high-five Lola.

We friended each other on Facebook and we‚Äôd message each other often, sometimes call. We got to know each other and became good friends, we‚Äôd talk about our lives, I opened up to her a little bit. I have a history of past drug use and somehow this subject came up. She seemed to be interested in drugs and partying and I was kind of trying to be like a good role model in a way, trying to encourage her to make better choices and just be there if she needed to talk. I stopped seeing Lola so much. She stopped coming around my work. 

She messaged me randomly once at 3am telling me she was scared because she used cocaine, had been up for 3 days, and needed to stay up but was paranoid and didn‚Äôt know if she could stay awake any longer. I didn‚Äôt know exactly why she talked to me about this but I kept trying to make sure she was okay, I told her she really should stay away from drugs like that, that she should sleep if she can. She said she didn‚Äôt know where to go. 

I felt like it was weird but I did have a crush on her and I was worried, I offered to pick her up from wherever she was and said she could stay at my house if she wanted to or needed to. Yeah I had a crush but that time I didn‚Äôt have any sexual intentions, she was on drugs and distressed, I cared about her and wanted to make sure she was safe. But she said no, no, I‚Äôm fine, I‚Äôll be fine, I can‚Äôt stay with you, then randomly said she doesn‚Äôt think we should talk again and blocked me. Wow. It was upsetting but I got over it and just hoped she was okay.

Flash forward to recently, over a year later. I still work at the same place. Never saw Lola til that late night coke convo...until one night recently. I saw her. She walked into my work. A blast from the past. A ghost. She walked right up to the bar and said hi to me. I was actually about to leave for the night, so I walked around to talk to her. I asked how she has been, if she‚Äôs doing better. She was beautiful before but now...she looked STUNNING. She asked what I‚Äôm doing, I told her I was about to leave. 

I asked what she‚Äôs doing, what‚Äôs up, if she was there alone or what. She said very clearly, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not busy, how bout we make some plans?‚Äù I told her that since it was so late I wasn‚Äôt sure what we could do, she suggested going to my place. I was very surprised. This was out of nowhere. Hadn‚Äôt seen her in a year, now she wants to go to my place. 

She said she came there specifically to see me, that she thought of me. She said she was ‚Äúdown for whatever‚Äù and that she wanted to spend time with me. So I invited her over, and she drove herself to my place. I kept telling her how surprised I was...that I never expected this. That I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see her again. I called her an angel. 

We got into my bed, turned on a TV show. We were talking and cuddling and things were getting hot. I was still in disbelief that this was happening. It all happened so fast. I told her that, I told her how fast and out of nowhere it seemed, asked if she was okay. She said she was okay, that she just really wanted to see me. We didn‚Äôt have sex, but we almost got there. I kept asking if everything was okay, because we got pretty into it, she said it was. I kept saying there is no pressure and we can lay here all night and watch whatever she wants, we don‚Äôt have to do anything, but she said she wanted to.

But them she suddenly stood up, put her clothes back on. She said she needed to go home. I asked if she was okay. It‚Äôs not like I was mad at her, I was just surprised. She said the weirdest thing - ‚ÄúEverything is okay, it‚Äôs not your fault. I need to leave now, but don‚Äôt take it personally. I‚Äôm sorry but this is the last time you‚Äôll ever see me.‚Äù I was shocked. Then she laughed and added, ‚ÄúI know I said that like I‚Äôm going to die, but don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt die. I‚Äôm just never coming back. Thank you for having me over.‚Äù She picked up her stuff and walked out. I didn‚Äôt even have her information to ask if she got home okay.

50,"TLDR: I have a lot on my mind. Ranting.

Hi everyone. I (18 M) just feel like ranting and getting shit out of my chest. I feel like a have a lot wrong with me mentally and expressing it may help ease some pain.

I live a perfectly normal life. Not to strict parents, I have friends, a loving girlfriend, I have goals that I want to achieve. But a lot of it doesn't feel real.

Something I noticed I recently started dealing with was this inexplicable urge to think about a lot of philosophical things. This may have stemmed from a challenging acid trip all the way back in February. 

Every single day, at least once an hour, I get this wave of like. ""Why should I be alive right now? My life doesn't matter in the scheme of the universe."" And no matter what explanation or rhetoric you throw at me, it doesn't seem to work. I've tried it on myself. Actually, something I've always done is explain shit to myself as if I didn't understand it in the first place.

It's as if I'm reasoning the way I do even mundane tasks to myself. Why I wash my body in the order I do, or even trying to explain my political beliefs to myself as if I need to understand why I think the way I think.

I have this terrible obsession with my own thoughts. I can't stop thinking. I probably should practice meditation. Or start working out again. I hate to blame all my problems on something out of my control but corona really fucked up my mental health.

As I type this I'm reminded of another one of my recent issues, and that is Cardiophobia. I developed a fear of having a heart attack of some other heart problem. My chest starts to hurt and I feel like I might have a heart attack. Whenever I get nervous or anxious I tend to focus on my heartbeat and it makes me even more nervous. I'm scared to start exercising because I'm afraid my heart can't take the 180 bpm I was able to take not even 6 months ago. 

I also have low motivation and how much I want to see my goals come to fruition doesn't seem to be enough to actually work towards those goals. Good for me though, I recently completed my English assessment essay for the college I was accepted to. So progress is being made.

I feel really beat down. I need to gather back my inner locus of control. (interesting way to maintain motivation, I suggest you read up on it.) I don't wanna regret my life choices now because I felt a little down.

But yeah, that's about it. Feel free to give guidance or tips. I'd love all the support I could get.",13Jul2020,1

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‚Äòcould look more enthusiastic about it like‚Äô in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that:

54,"I seem to have this problem that I describe as ""yoyo brain"", it's a recurring problem where one day I just don't care about anything, there's no trigger, there's no event, no challenge, my worldview and mood just drops down to 0, and then another day at some point in the future I'm back to a 100% functional life of the party face any challenge human being.

I've seen therapists before, but after a few months I kind of give up on them as I just seem to get out of my rut on my own and move on with my life (not always due to the therapist, but the ""down"" cycle is finished), or in one instance they hit me with something like ""you give up when there challenges in life, you need to overcome this"", and I just sit there in my rut and stubborn mood and think well that's it then, I can't overcome those challenges because I feel like shit, and I can't stop feeling like shit, so why bother coming back and paying 300 bucks a pop for this. It's this kind of give up attitude that I'm stuck with for weeks/months at a time, and I can't get anything done in my life.

When I'm not in these random ruts I have confidence, perseverance, can-do attitude, and passion for things and I invest time and energy into starting something anyway despite my previous failures, but inevitebily find myself not caring about it anymore after 3-4 months (or less) and having it slowly fall apart on me.

My job in sales is a great example of this, I worked in IT for 5 years, was miserable, so in one of my ""up"" phases I decided I wasn't going to live my life like a miserable bastard anymore and made a change, I moved to sales due to my up-beat ""face the challenge"" personality when I'm ""up"" and the financial reward associated with this kind of work. 

My first 4 months or so in sales I loved it, I would barge down every door, call everyone on the planet, work late and do everything I can to succeed. Then one of my ruts came in, and slowly but surely, I just stopped caring and did the bare minimum to stay in the job, I wouldn't follow up with potential business opportunities if it required effort (in fact, anything that required effort I would avoid), I became bitter, tired, negative, cynical, making up excuses for my failures and blaming others as opposed to my usual ""work the problem"" attitude.

This is basically all other areas of my life, I start something when I feel great because I feel confident that ""this time it will be OK"" and if I just keep working at whatever it is I'm doing and not give up, I'll be fine, but then this happy-go-lucky ""keep at it"" attitude disappears without warning, and I watch whatever I've built slowly go to shit and I just don't care enough about it to fix it, when I get into this place, I feel like a bus may as well hit me because what's the point, I'm back here again and I don't want to even try fixing it because I've tried so many other things and I just end up back here.

The only solution I've found is having to wait it out. Sadly, the way of the world isn't built for people like me, so it can't wait until I'm feeling better. I get really anxious about my life and future because for me to build anything successful that will yield a life and a future, I feel like I need to be consistantly feeling good (which naturally leads to me being selfish and self-serving when I'm in one of my ruts, that's not good for anything except a quick fix for me to feel better short-term). I want to have kids and a house, but I'm so afraid to do it because of my ""yoyo brain"", and that my kids will end up just like me.

Does anyone else feel like this? Can it be fixed or am I doomed to a life of misery and mediocracy?",13Jul2020,1

64,"Before this virus shit happened,
I was working full time and had a great home life. 
I had booked my tickets to Japan for a holiday and was looking forward to my year, I had a lot of things planned. 

Then the world ended, the lock down happened and I worked halfway through then all the flights were cancelled after that so work dried up for me. I had to cancel my trip and lost a fair amount of money doing so.

The first month was great. I got to spend so much time with my boyfriend and I got to relax. I could sleep as much as I wanted and smoke as much weed as I wanted to. Then the lock down ended and my country successfully eliminated the covid. 

But now it's been 4 months without work since I work in aviation, and surprisingly I'm not handling it very well. I'm a very lucky person and I'm very aware of that yet somehow I feel similar to depressed. 
All of this news and seeing how selfish the world is and how complete fucking idiots like Trump can have so much power is really depressing. The world isn't what I grew up thinking it was. 

I thought that in the face of a crisis, mankind would set aside their squabbles and protect one another, and fight for the best solution. But all I've seen is people using COVID for their own personal or political gain, and people fighting over shit. 

I find it hard to feel excited over anything anymore and It feels like crap. It feels like I'm just existing. 

I'm supposed to be close to my boyfriend and be able to tell him shit like this but in the end he's going to assume I don't love him anymore, will make it about him and I'm going to have to comfort him and make him feel better when I feel shit myself. 

If I could erase everyone's memories of me, I would happily do so in order to die peacefully knowing I haven't caused anyone pain in my actions. 

And the worst part of feeling shit is knowing I'm not *allowed* to feel shit. I'm in a very lucky and fortunate position right now and I have no right to feel empty and sad. Yet I do. 

Sorry, just had to write it somewhere. I have a couple of close friends but I haven't had a good meaningful talk with them in a long time. Cheers reddit.

65,"I debated giving a full, descriptive context to this, but I felt the fucked up drama currently involved in my life would take away from discussion, so I am going to leave it out, at least for the most part. May make another post for that. Anyways,

I have recently been thinking about two topics related to relationships that often seem to contradict each other, especially depending on who you ask.

Let me start with a simple hypothetical: your partner cheats on you.

How would this make you feel? I feel as though most people would obviously be hurt. Someone you cared about just betrayed you.

So what happens after the initial emotions seems to vary from person to person. Some people are hurt, and maybe they breakup with their partner. Other people are hurt, but they don't. Why is this? Perhaps forgiveness, they eventually forgave their partner. Perhaps they feel like they can't leave, or want to but feel conflicted. Some people take a ""break"" and come back. Some people get revenge and consider the slate cleaned. There's a plethora of options.

But what is *truly* the right thing to do? Maybe it depends on context? Maybe they emotionally cheated, and the partner didn't even realize they were crossing a line? Would you forgive this?

I feel as though there is a lot of disagreement on what one should do when cheated on. Let's make the example a bit more specific: your partner has sex with someone else.

What would you do? Most people (mainly those not married) would say that they would leave that partner, and they would say that you should never let someone walk all over you like that. The thought of letting someone do that to them and forgiving them would sicken those who hold this opinion. These people are generally thought of as having a strong head on their shoulders, taking no shit from others, being ""tough"", and striving to not be ""weak"". Then, there are others who would forgive that partner. They would argue that it is unhealthy to hold a grudge, to have to carry around the burden of hatred, letting every random thought of that partner bother them throughout their lives. This is somewhat related to the general philosophy of the stoic, one who believes in not letting the events of their lives that are out of their control bother them.

I see both of these views as making sense. On the one hand, I see value in not letting others walk all over you. On the other, it seems that one who can let go of hate and be forgiving has a very healthy conscious. This is where I am torn. If my partner were to cheat on me, I feel staying with them would be allowing them to walk all over me. I would feel like I couldn't forgive them, because to do so would have me feeling belittled, emasculated especially (I know this may not be healthy). But then when I try to think maturely, I feel like letting go of that and forgiving the partner would be the actions of one who is free of hatred and truly in touch with his/herself, a ""Christlike"" person (I know that's dramatic).

So then I guess the simple answer is, ""it depends"". It depends on context, and it depends on the person who has been cheated on. But the thing is, those on opposite sides of that spectrum would certainly view each other as being wrong. Those who think you should leave the partner would see those who stay and forgive as perhaps pathetic, weak, sad, etc. And those who would forgive (whether or not they stay with the partner) would say that they are free from the shackles of such strong emotional burden.

This is where I would feel conflicted, because I would feel so paranoid on either side. Forgiving my partner is hard because I don't ever want to feel ""played"", even though I know forgiveness is a path to self control and happiness. Not forgiving my partner would allow me to feel more in control but perhaps less free from letting the actions of someone else dictate my emotions or happiness. And most people would say, ""just do what feels right"", but even just doing what feels right at that time would be followed by emotions and fears about having possibly made the wrong choice that may never go away and maybe even be realized later on down the line.

What do I look back on my mom's three suicide attempts, my suicide attempt, never having been let out socially by a father who hates society himself. My father breaking my phone coz he doesn't want me to talk to people. My depression which makes me cry 5 hours a day. My complete lack of friends or loved ones. No support from my family for my dreams and ambitions but me somehow making it but then used by them as a boasting chip. Having abusive paternal grandparents and dumb maternal grandparents who put my mother in this pain and lead to me being born just to suffer. My inability to study anymore coz I'm depressed as hell. My inability to get a hobby coz my dad doesn't like those. I no longer even say I have a father I only have a biological father with whom I share half my DNA and who gives me Money he's nothing more. My mom left her job coz of this fucker. She cries all day she lost her friends because of him and is lonely. The asshole fucked enough that he didn't attend his parents funerals. They were assholes to me but he said he loved them or something. The world is pain, but I don't have the power to end my suffering. I wish I'd just go to sleep and never wake up. I don't want to be in pain. I don't want to give others pain. I can't share this coz this is my burden to bear. I'll feel sorry if I put this on others.

79,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I‚Äôm naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It‚Äôs difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that‚Äôs the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I‚Äôd say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? When i do eat i are fried eggs and bacon on toast is that bad?

I drank a lot of water today and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal? I‚Äôm down to 11.3 now  and my face looks wayyyy larger than ever at all I was thinner when I was last that weight :/",13Jul2020,1

83,"I need to say this to someone, even if it‚Äôs random people on the internet. 

A few months ago, my best friend (16F) and I were at a party. A lot of vodka in to the party, we were all super drunk and eventually got kicked out of the house for being too loud. My friend had posted something on snapchat, being ‚Äúdrunk-hyper‚Äù. She posted something on snapchat along the lines of ‚Äúparty is on, people come over‚Äù. Anyway, a guy from her past that she hooked up with before asked her to come to his house as his parents were out of town. She was more drunk than me at this point. 

I don‚Äôt really remember this part of the night, I don‚Äôt remember if she wanted to go alone and if I didn‚Äôt let her go alone, or if she asked me to go with her. Bottom line is we went to the guys house and she told him she was coming with me so he got a friend for me. Also to note, these two guys were close with a guy that I had recently broken up with. 

We got the bus to his house, and she threw up at the bus stop. I‚Äôd say I was drunk to the point where things were blurry and my stance was unsteady. We met up with the guys and according to them they were sipping rum but they were no where near as drunk as us, they‚Äôre behaviour didn‚Äôt scream anything out of the ordinary, and I believe our behaviour screamed FUCKING INTOXICATED. 

We get back to the house and my friend and the guy that invited her immediately go upstairs to his bedroom. I‚Äôm sitting on the couch with his friend and I was never planning to do anything and I wanted to go home. His friend, I‚Äôll call him S, starts getting super handsy and before I know it I‚Äôm sitting on his lap kissing him and he‚Äôs pulling down my jeans and complimenting my ass. I start to feel uncomfortable so I ran upstairs to my friend to check on her and to get out of that awkward twosome. I walk in to the guys bedroom, let‚Äôs call him A. I walk in to his bedroom and I see him having sex with her, she is unconscious or asleep, she is laying on the bed on her front fully naked and her eyes as closed. S also walks in, and as me and S look at them, I was looking in shock, S may have been looking in approval, A looks up at S and says something like ‚Äú You like what you see man ?‚Äù with a grin that I will continue to see in my nightmares. My friend was just on the bed like a dead fish. 

I didn‚Äôt want to leave the bedroom, I woke her up and we went downstairs. The boys came too. They proceeded to touch us and we would eventually switch partners. Then we made our way upstairs and started to have sex. This was the first time I had sex. Penetrative sex. At one point A was lying down on the bed, I was laying on top of him, and S was on top of me. A finished twice, S didn‚Äôt. S left. 

Then, A invited another one of his friends(18M) over, let‚Äôs call him D, because duddeeee there‚Äôs two drunk girls at my house come and have your pick right? 

D proceeded to have sex with my friend, and then he tried with me but I didn‚Äôt want to do anything else. S left eventually, and my friend, A and I were in A‚Äôs bed trying to sleep, A starting having sex with my friend again and he asked me if I want ‚Äúdick‚Äù, I said no. I just witnessed my friend and A having sex maybe one inch away from me. My back was turned to the wall. I wanted rest. 

Anyway we left the next morning and did the walk of shame. I didn‚Äôt know who I was at this point. I‚Äôm not sure if I do at THIS point. 

A kept texting me the next day asking me to come over, I said no the first time. Then I said yes the next time, fully sober. I had sex with him. I don‚Äôt know why I went. I wasn‚Äôt attracted to him in any way and he smelled bad and has very ugly feet. I don‚Äôt know if I went to reclaim my power, or because that‚Äôs just who i thought I was at that point, a whore. I thought i was worthless and deserved nothing better. He tried to take videos but I slapped the phone out of his hand. 
When the sex ended, I knew he wanted me to gtfo. 

Anyway, fast forward two days later, my ex texts me and says that S has been blabbing everywhere telling everyone he knows that he had a threesome with me and my friend. S took a video but the only data in the video is the sound of a girl moaning and my favourite song in the background, which my ex used against me. I didn‚Äôt even choose the soundtrack for the worst night of my life. 

My ex was accusing me but I didn‚Äôt care about him I just cared that word was getting spread and people would think of me what I already think about myself. 

This sticks with me. I either feel like a victim or a whore. I don‚Äôt want to be a victim and I don‚Äôt want to be a whore. I want them to pay for what they have done. I don‚Äôt trust men anymore because of what I described here and also a recent heartbreak. I want to heal but I need to tell someone in my life. What happened to me?",13Jul2020,1

My understanding is if you say someone is self-righteous you‚Äôre saying they think they are morally above other people. But I don‚Äôt see how that ties in with hypocrisy.

Wikipedia says ‚ÄúThe term ""self-righteous"" is often considered derogatory particularly because self-righteous individuals are often thought to exhibit hypocrisy due to the belief that humans are imperfect and can therefore never be infallible, an idea similar to that of the Freudian defense mechanism of reaction formation.‚Äù

To me this presents two different unrelated things. Is it saying that self righteous people are hypocritical because humans will always err? That doesn‚Äôt seem like it.

It started somewhat normal..showing me what masturbation was, how to masturbate and watching porn together. It eventually escalated to something else entirely. I vividly remember one occasion when they told me ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt gay if it‚Äôs with cousins‚Äù and to ‚Äújust try it‚Äù. So I gave the oldest one oral for a moment and disliked it, they attempted to to have me continue but i was getting upset so they told me its ok to stop and not tell anyone. 

The main one that would do things to me was the 3-4 years older one and attempted to penetrate me a few times, one occasion during a sleep over when i said stop he said ‚Äúshutup you know you like it‚Äù but eventually stopped. There were other things that have happened but I can‚Äôt remember them too well anymore. Those are the biggest standouts to me, however that cousin would frequently make me touch him and stuff..even convinced one of my friends to do stuff to him. I thought it was normal stuff I guess since it was my big cousin and I looked up to him. We always had sleepovers and my folks had no idea what was going on. 

I also had a pretty unstable household, moving around constantly and seeing my parents go at it like cats and dogs. A lot of nasty fights. 

I‚Äôve brought this up to my family and while they sympathize, they always say that ‚Äúyou were all kids, at least it wasn‚Äôt an adult and you should stop thinking on it and move on‚Äù.

Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‚Äòoh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?‚Äô Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‚Äòooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don‚Äôt think my fella would like that, don‚Äôt think my fella would like that‚Äô   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she‚Äôs always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I‚Äôm ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that‚Äôs delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn‚Äôt say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she‚Äôs in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bits to me about how much she smells.

Edit: she‚Äôs Normally nice to me in a friendly way and she seems pleasant etc with me never had a problem with her before",13Jul2020,1

101,"My ex girlfriend and I were romantically involved on-and-off for about 6 or 7 years. This was when we were in middle and high school. We cared for each other deeply but our relationship was very toxic and unhealthy for both of us. Both of our mental health were bad, hers much worse than mine. We have a very long history, we officially dated for a year and a half in high school, then we broke up and had a few more on-and-offs. Years later, I realized how emotionally abusive we both were to each other with how we acted when our mental health was bad and that a handful of times I had coerced her into doing certain things with me when she didn't want to (twice when we weren't dating). I know she understands that I was emotionally abusive to her, but I don't know if she understands that I sexually assaulted her.

I understand how wrong everything I did was and how awful the relationship was for both of us. I believe myself to be a much better and more aware person today. I'm in a very healthy relationship now and I've disclosed this to my partner too. I feel awful and I take full responsibility for everything, regardless of how our relationship was I should have known better.

I don't know how to move forward. No charges were ever filed, but we aren't allowed to speak to each other anymore. Everyday I ask myself if I truly deserve forgiveness from myself. I can't stop thinking about how I feel like a monster or how inhumane I am. I feel like I don't deserve the life I have. I've been to counseling a few times about this and thought I moved forward but I still think about it often.",13Jul2020,1
103,"**TL;DR:** My mental health has never been worse so my doctor recommended I‚Äôd hang out with a group of friends. Loved the idea and decided to get together a group of seven. The more I think about it, the more I worry (I live in the states where corona is crazy). They said that they‚Äôre okay with staying outside but then I realized that we need to stay distanced. I talked to a close friend and she said they‚Äôve been hanging out with others a lot (no masks, no distancing). I don‚Äôt know what to do.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

My mental health has never been worse. I‚Äôve been overly anxious and have developed a depressive mood within the last couple months. I live in the United States so corona has been absolutely insane since mid March. I also haven‚Äôt seen friend or left the house (besides to see close family) since then. I had a checkup a couple weeks ago and they made me take a depression test (every teen has to). Let‚Äôs just say I didn‚Äôt score well and then broke down. She told me that a lot of people have been feeling like this and the best thing to do is to get some normality back into life. She suggested getting a group of friends together. We had been trying to get together before she suggested this but we could never find a date. Now that my birthdays coming up, I thought it would be a great idea.

I ended up asking and they all seemed pretty excited. We got the date, time, and place down pretty quickly. I was really excited but then I started to think more about it. Never once did I mention the guidelines. The next day I told them that we‚Äôd have to stay outside because of corona. They all seemed chill with this. The more I read about gatherings the more I realized that so much more needed to happen besides that. Most articles suggested social distancing (which I don‚Äôt think would be too hard) and wearing a mask. Telling people to wear a mask for many hours probably wouldn‚Äôt end well. Like, I‚Äôd be okay with doing it but that‚Äôs not going to work sadly. I texted a friend and she told me that they‚Äôve (the group‚Äî not her) been with loads of other people while not wearing masks or social distancing and that they probably wouldn‚Äôt respect the six feet distance rule. Now I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I really want to see people and they seemed so excited about it. I don‚Äôt want to let them down by canceling. I don‚Äôt want to cancel either because I‚Äôve really been wanting to see friends. Also, I‚Äôve always been known as this super serious person who doesn‚Äôt know how to have fun (or at least I think I am). I‚Äôm not excitable, I don‚Äôt show much emotion, and have serious RBF. I‚Äôm go with the flow (most of them time) but I‚Äôm not a huge party animal or anything (yay social anxiety). I‚Äôve been trying to escape that and thought that this would be a good time to do so. But now I‚Äôm going to viewed as this super serious, boring person once again. But I‚Äôm trying to do this to protect my family. Besides my parents, my family is high risk. They are all older and some have diabetes. If they get it, it‚Äôs basically a death sentence. I can‚Äôt imagine living without any one of them but, on top of that, I could never live with myself if I was the one who killed them. Same with friends, if anything were to happen and somebody gets coronavirus (whether it‚Äôs from this get together or not) I‚Äôll never be able to forgive myself. I‚Äôll find a way to blame it on myself. I really don‚Äôt know what to do.",13Jul2020,1

107,"  Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‚Äòcould look more enthusiastic about it like‚Äô in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I‚Äôm thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‚Äòawwwww ok......and well done‚Äô as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‚Äòlet me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc‚Äô often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",13Jul2020,1
108,"How was your weekend? July is Parks and Recreation Month, and Monday is designated as Maintenance Monday, to recognize the efforts of park staff to maintain our public park facilities. That got us thinking about men with BPH (prostate enlargement). Just as parks need maintenance, so too do men need to maintain their prostate health (and overall health for that matter). BPH is a common condition in older men where the prostate grows in size as a man ages. It can sometimes interfere with urinary function (frequent urination, poor/slow urinary flow, etc.).¬†  


It starts with awareness. How can you know to watch out for BPH if you've never even heard of it? BPH symptom maintenance, especially mild symptoms, may involve healthy lifestyle modifications and voiding techniques to alleviate frequent urinary symptoms as well as timing of fluid intake. Another recommendation is increasing physical activity, and what better way than to go to the park? Due to the pandemic, it is important to practice social distancing and the recommendations of local authorities if you are able to visit a park near you. Maintaining a distance between yourself and other park goers, as well as maintaining hygiene when going out is important. Please note some facilities like restrooms may be closed to the public to avoid the spread of COVID-19, so it is best to go to a close by park for if and when you may experience urges or incontinence.¬†

Maintaining health is important for everyone, but men are statistically going to their doctor less often and experiencing a higher incidence rate of disease states. We want men to live longer, happier lives by getting the support they need for their BPH and overall health! This Maintenance Monday, we ask men to work on maintaining their health the same way park staff maintain the parks you enjoy visiting!¬†",13Jul2020,1

However, I've been doubting therapy again. I didn't go to my one this morning because the thought of it fills me with so much dread. I also haven't been taking my medication, but I've been telling my mum I have.

So many of the commenters, most of them professors, talk about how coddled students are these days and how they have been so overprotected by their parents and society that they cannot function in college. They talk about the burden of these students on campus and it makes me feel so embarrassed. For most of my life I have cared so much about the approval of my professors and my teachers. I have always admired and wanted to impress and emulate them. I know it‚Äôs pathetic that it still matters to me but it weighs on my mind constantly ‚Äî what do my favorite profs think about me, really? I worry they see me as my mom sees me. And I‚Äôm worried that they are right. 

I have been a horrible student the past couple of semesters, sometimes at the top of my class doing amazing work but most of the time not turning things in and even failing. I struggled with mental heath, and was diagnosed my freshman year with bipolar disorder and later a psychotic disorder. I was hospitalized during the middle of one semester and I‚Äôm still afraid my professors think I was faking it. I am now on my second leave of absence. I try to never be a burden or expect extra support from my school but I‚Äôm always given it anyways. I try not to be a burden or to ask for exemptions but I still seem to get it. I worry so much about what my professors think of me and if I will be able to redeem myself when I return eventually. I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself. I care a lot about what my professors think of me and it makes me feel awful to read these articles and hear what they all, unanimously, seem to think. And the worst part is that they are not wrong. I agree that it is insane to expect universities to be hospitals for students with severe challenges. 

I love learning and being in college and am so grateful for my professors but I am embarrassed that I am a perfect example of one of these needy, underprepared, anxious millennials that is a burden on the school.",13Jul2020,2

123,"I find myself to be extremely selfless and would do literally anything for my friends. 
During times of lockdown, I've done groceries for my friends because they had no easy access to their stores, I've walked 2km to my friends place just get something from their apartment, I've helped another friend vacate their apartment when they weren't in town, and the list goes on. They're all extremely grateful for all that I've done. And I would never use those instances as a way to guilt someone to help me in a situation, but is it wrong to expect as little as a phone call from someone? 

I've been living alone at my place for almost 4 months now. All my friends know that. I only wish a few of them would care a bit more.

One of them lives quite nearby (not walkable, but a 2min cab ride away). I didn't find it fair to ask her to visit when the lockdown was in place. It was relaxed a bit later, and I asked if she could come visit. (My apartment doesn't have entry restrictions unlike hers, else I would be the one visiting). She said she would and she'd call when the weekend was approaching. Not only did she forget to call, but she ended up visiting some other friends of hers.   I felt extremely sad and disappointed when I got to know about this. I've been living alone and I that's the worst thing someone could've pulled off on me. She didn't even feel sorry then. I did her grocery shopping when she had no way out just a few weeks prior to that. 

I always used to wonder, when people say ""I might be busy, but if you ever need me, I'm there for you.""
Will there ever be a time when you need someone that badly? I've led a simple life and never thought I'd be in a situation like that. This pandemic showed me things in a different light. This instance taught me that I'm there for people when they need me and I'd do it over and again if I had to. And I'll never forget that she wasn't there for me when it mattered. 

I don't know. I find happiness in the smallest things someone does for me. It literally makes my day if I saw myself in someone's profile picture or story, or even if I just a phone call to see how I'm doing.

124,"Hi. First post no clue whether this is the right place but it should work. I want to get someone's opinion on this. I am not that comfortable sharing with friends or family like this because I kinda feel stupid sometimes. So there's this girl I met 4 years ago on omegle. Back then we skyped alot, got really close and texted a lot. She made me really happy but it hurt me so much that I wasn't able to actually be with her because of the distance and some stuff like my family/parents not even allowing me a girlfriend at the moment (I am 18 now) so definitely not back then. Well I broke off the contact with her because of that and maybe it was a good thing I don't know. Now she wrote me like 2 3 months ago and we've been in contact again. She has a boyfriend now and to be honest it doesnt make that much sense to me why she wrote me. Now again, she really makes me happy when skyping or texting but I am getting the feeling she may kinda use me for closure even though her love is very contested. She's generally a phone person and is kinda often on the phone when we skype. Whenever she has time for me (she doesn't that often) I leave everything (except work) just to go and be with her even if its just in front of my pc to skype with her. Honestly, when I am at friends I tell them: Guys, I gotta go home. She knows I do that and she just kinda got me wrapped around her finger. I most surely fell in love with her and I even went 14 hours by bus just to visit her once for not even a full day. We got close to each other but no stuff over the line, she is just a person that needs this closure she tells me. Like cuddling and stuff. In the end I really just want her to be happy and would never come between her happiness. Am I stupid for this? Am I wasting my resources? Sometimes I think I will wait and if I'll have to wait for a long time I will do so. On the other hand I just feel like an idiot sometimes.",13Jul2020,1
126,"Does it make sense to be afraid of something unknown? Whether you‚Äôre questioning who you are as a result of what you‚Äôve known, or seeing yourself freshly for the first time‚Ä¶ There is little doubt we have ourselves to blame for who we become. If we accept what we have been taught, instead of choosing a path we shape ourselves, there are boundaries and limits to our hopes, and the unwritten steps we take to reach them.

Letting our hearts guide us is the momentary pause within each choice that we make, pushing boundaries and forming the very foundation of our lives. That is of course, when we‚Äôre offered the freedom to choose.

Power is a defiantly harmful characteristic. It can warp our perception of life. Our lives, and those we choose to lead, choose to nourish, and cherish. Kind minds can become great leaders, and ruthless ones, great rulers. There are however, differences in leaders and rulers; Strategy, or love, threat or compassion. There are such choices made by man as to press the boundaries of those under our guidance. One will instill fear, the other, inspiration. A leader chooses to inspire.
Inspiration can be found within us all. The will to inspire is less common. Creating that passion, and power of will can be a difficult task. One which few have the gift to find and fewer a life to be followed. There is of course, the force of will that can perform the greatest of deeds.

The tasks we decide to carry out through daily life, those we choose to complete in passing, can hold nothing to these deeds. One can press forward and choose to teach. Choose to learn not from their own experience, but that of each person before them, shaping their path to fit the will of their students. When guidance is a virtue, told to help in time of need. That time is now, as it is always.

I am proud to know teachers. I am proud to have known them my entire life, creating bonds outside of the classroom and shaping what I believe may not have been friendships, but at the very least, a break from something that can become so arduous and dull. Now, more than ever, their efforts go unnoticed and it fills my heart with a sadness that ought not to need be felt. It‚Äôs time we appreciate our teachers, and our guides. They are the hearts that make this life worthwhile.
They bring us to realize our potential, and our dreams. It would be arguable they are as much a part of our creation as those who brought us life.

When we ask of what we do not know, we request the guidance of our teachers. Without them, we would know nothing.",13Jul2020,1

I feel so bad, I was just fooling myself all the quarantine. I don't love myself and I really don't know how to. I just feel so bad by looking at how much more attractive, social he is comparing to me I really want to ignore him from all social media and keep on with my life. Why am I like this, how can I love myself constantly how do people love themselves and don't feel like losers?",13Jul2020,1
132,"Now I don‚Äôt go around wishing ill on people but in this case you got what you deserved. How long have the WORLD‚Äôs too doctors and scientists been telling you to wear a mask and practice social distancing? That this virus is very contagious? That it can kill you?

I‚Äôm sorry but ya‚Äôll played with fire and got burned. Pure and simple. But what really pisses me off is that their selfishness now puts other people at risk. And now they are in the hospital taking up bed space. I almost feel like they don‚Äôt deserve it. They cut off their noses to spite their faces. They said this virus was a HOAX. Now they expect to be waited on hand and foot by the hospital staff and have made no apology, no back-track, just wallowing in their own self-pity and saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know it would happen to us.‚Äù

Fuck. You. And. Everyone. With. Your. Dumbass. Mentality.

And yes, we are from Florida.",13Jul2020,1
133,"I know that this is unreasonable and just ridiculous, but I'm starting to convince myself that I'm just supposed to fail and kinda need to vent my frustrations. Everything I try just seems to blow back in my face and I think it's made me resent the idea of even trying anymore. Work wise, I'm incredibly incompetent. I haven't had a job that I've been able to hold on to (I'm very easily stressed) and it kinda makes me feel like a hypocrite as I personally believe in the values of hard work. I'm just an awful worker. 

Socially, I've literally been asked if I have autism before. No, I'm just incredibly dense when it comes to basic social skills. So romance and a social circle may as well be works of fiction as far as my life goes. I've been ghosted by numerous girls (I mean a ridiculous number) after a few conversations and have the nagging sensation that people tend to avoid me at work. I've tried incredibly hard to be the easy going funny guy, but I also seem to be the only guy at work with no one to talk to during lunch. 

Education wise, it's non-existent. My family didn't believe in schooling, but also neglected to educate me themselves. Anything you see here that may alude to any kind of education is all self-taught from the age of 11. I don't bring up maths as a topic as I'm embarrassed to admit I'm less knowledgeable on the subject than the average 12 year old. I also believe my lack of schooling severely handicapped me socially. 

I have factors that I like about myself, but I can never seem to make those work for me. I think I had a lot of potential academically that has been completely wasted. I mean I don't consider myself unintelligent as it is (then again, who does?) so who knows what I could've achieved with a little education? I'd also consider myself pretty eloquently spoken and careful with my words in person which I'm quite proud of. Lastly, genetically I don't think I got a bad deal. I'm pretty well built and not a disaster to look at. 

Honestly though, I'm starting to feel like it doesn't matter. It seems to be the worse scenario I can think of in my head is always the outcome. Nothing ever works out, I never improve at the things I'm incompetent at, it all just feels like a huge circle of never ending failure with no improvement. It's almost like some deity has it out for me, as honestly I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I try hard but it's just never good enough. Sorry for being a whiny bitch, but I don't have anyone on my life who'll listen to stuff like this.",13Jul2020,2
134,"I haven‚Äôt seen this guy in 3+ years or spoken to him. All of a sudden I have an extremely vivid dream about him (somewhat sexual and he was trying to woo me and I did not give in) and I wake up thinking that‚Äôs weird and wondering if I should contact him like as if that‚Äôs what I was told to do. Anyway, minutes later he messages me. It‚Äôs so bizarre and I was so freaked out this morning. Is this a coincidence? Voodoo? Lol üòÇ I feel like he legit entered my dream. Anyone ever had this happen?  Also, he messaged me from his email address like to an iPhone. It just said his first name and a few numbers but I automatically knew that was him without him telling me. He just said ‚ÄúDamn.‚Äù I asked who it was and what that meant and he said his name and he said nothing he just wanted to check on me.... ??? Someone? Help? So freaked out",13Jul2020,1
135,"The same goes for disabled women, but I‚Äôm talking specifically about disabled men since I am one.

I know many disabled people and from what I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs even harder for disabled straight men to find a partner than disabled straight women. I think this is because most women want a guy who can ‚Äúdo the heavy lifting‚Äù and act as ‚Äúprotector‚Äù etc. Also, women are understandably worried they may have to act as caregiver, which usually isn‚Äôt the case as many disabled people are fiercely independent.

I (32m) am a happy, successful, confident guy who‚Äôs asked out loads of girls but always been turned down. It‚Äôs really taking a toll on my mental health. And yet I have no problem finding Friends-With-Benefits!

Many disabled guys aren‚Äôt as lucky as me. They go 10, 15, 20 years or more without experiencing any form of physical or emotional intimacy - except MAYBE with an escort or a camgirl.

So next time a disabled guy asks you out, or you see one you like the look of, at least think about it.",13Jul2020,1
136,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I‚Äôm naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It‚Äôs difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that‚Äôs the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I‚Äôd say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? When i do eat i are fried eggs and bacon on toast is that bad?

I drank a lot of water today and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal? I‚Äôm down to 11.3 now  and my face looks wayyyy larger than ever at all I was thinner when I was last that weight :/",13Jul2020,1
137,"There is too much of a backstory to go from. But the gist of it is, I had it a bit tough growing up. Being the only Asian family in a white community in rural Australia was quite tough. And with family issues that stemmed far back from childhood that evolved more as I got older, I have recently started therapy.

I am a sensitive person and have always been that way since childhood. And what with the bullying, racism and everything in between, it has stuck with me well into adulthood. I have bad habits of mentally beating myself up and holding in my emotions to the point of an explosion much later on down the road. I have a lot of traumas with how I grew up and my mum always saying ""don't let your enemies see you cry. You need to be emotionally strong!"".

Now that I am much older and had yet another failed relationship being cheat on and family issues arising once again, I took the leap into therapy. I have been going for a few months now and have been doing a lot better. I am finally addressing traumas that I was taught to sweep under the rug and finally packing my mind away neatly and accepting the bad things.

But, just last night I ended up calling my mum, just for a simple phone call and made the mistake of telling her I am in therapy. Now while she understood why and admits to our current family dynamic and the bullying I faced growing up.... SHE STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I NEED THERAPY.

It was always the same stuff she would spew growing up whenever I would go to her crying as a kid ""You need to be stronger!"" or ""Wow, I guess I am just so emotionally strong. I wish you could be like that"".

To be fair, yes, she grew up poor in the Philippines and she did have it tougher than me. But I wish she could be more empathetic. I just ended up crying quietly on the phone listening to her berate me for being in therapy and going on about her own experiences while downplaying mine.

I don't even know why I am writing this out, but I seriously needed to vent and just wish someone understood. I know I am not the only one who grew up with a parent like this, and I also don't feel she is insane enough for me to write in r/insaneparents \- but my god!

How do I move forward from this? How do I keep from resent my own mother for this? And should I just give up on trying to make her understand? How do you have a relationship with a parent like this?",13Jul2020,1
140,"Me, in my paranoia world. I am at home, and I am making food, I hear a voice, and its my neighbor, and probably it's gossiping with someone about what do I do, and what I don't do here in my home. So I try to be silent, to make as little noise as possible, and I close the windows, so they know less of what I am doing, so I don't disrupt them and what they do. 

So I have to work, so many people in the street, some of them look inside the car to see me, to see how weird I am, so I just either brake or accelerate so they are not to my side, so they can't see me.

I parked my car, so now I am walking to my work, and some people are around, and some of them are probably looking at me as I pass them. Some of them are alone, so they are just looking and thinking about me, about how I look, about how I am, about how scared and weird I might be, and some other are in groups, probably looking at me, talking between them about what they see in me. Some of them laugh, and its obviously because of me. So I walk, try to walk fast, and try to not look at them, cause if I do, I am afraid they will notice I looked, so they might be scared, and its even worse because now I am all of what they talked about me, and also are scared of me, which will make them to think even more about me. 

So I am afraid.

People only look at someone walking fast, sometimes with fear, what looks like very unconfident, but for me, I am afraid. I am afraid of people, afraid of what they say, afraid of what they do, because people mostly care about them, about what they feel, about what they do, and what they think, so for them, its fun, fun that causes damage, and damage that every time becomes worse. 

Each day, I feel a little more broken.

So, why to have friends, if at the end, they will only talk about me, about my wrongs, about my imperfections, about my fears? At the end, after they know me, completely,  they will do me harm. They will talk about me with other people, and some of them, will just have fun with it, and will have fun when telling others.

So I am afraid.

I am afraid of people, I am afraid of friends, I am afraid of getting too close to people, because at the end I think they will only do me harm.",13Jul2020,1
