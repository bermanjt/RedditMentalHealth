3,"I never wanted to brand myself as ""depressed"" because I was mostly doing relatively good and didn't have the confirmation from a professional either. Lately I feel like my mental health has taken a dip though. I basically lost all motivation to do stuff other than watching YouTube, masturbating, and distracting me by getting drunk with friends or alone. 

Can't even bring myself to watch anime or watch video games because it seems like too much effort and it just doesn't seem interesting enough right now. 

So far I'm still keeping up with my college work, but i wonder how that'll go once exams draw closer and stuff gets more stressful. At least studying is able to distract me from other stuff. Tbh distracting myself (no idea from what though) seems to be the only thing I'm actually interested in at the moment.

I just want to feel better again.",30Dec2020,1

6,"I took a month of Newborn leave and I don’t feel like working after this long gap. I’m in tech industry. Not reading emails, just responding to critical ones. I’m behind lots of emails.

I still cannot figure out if they were indeed toxic people, I am the toxic one or we have simply outgrown our friendship. It is hard. This year, with quarantines and what not, I haven't meet new people and I have been relying on my old friends.

13,"I am afraid that I will get bullied by people that are physically (but obviously not mentally) stronger. I want to start picking up martial arts again (I practiced karate before, but got horribly messed with which made me quit, I also did not learn that much and stopped while having a yellow belt and won 2 prizes). 

I am small (about 5'4 which is really small, not muscular and also don't have the genes to be muscular), I don't want to be a pussy and a doormat and I'm pretty sure I have to stick up for myself but the problem is that I don't know how to shut the haters up and even if I could, they could beat me up badly during the sparring matches. I know sparring is not meant for that, but you have people that take advantage of the opportunity.

Does anybody know how I can deal with this? It's really important to me.",30Dec2020,1
14,"A sigh of relief that the holidays are over

So I always write about how it's the way you look at things, there are two ways to look at things. One is poor me and the other is to look for the lessons, learn them and move on.
As bad as this year has been for me besides not being able to be with all of my family and friends and losing more than half my income, trust me, it was worse two years ago.

I know that over and over this year so many people I've talked to have said it's been a really rough year, a year like no one has seen before. No one seemed to be in the holiday spirit.
I myself know that this is a fact as this has been a hell of a year for me as well but again I realize that it could have been worse, it could have been two years ago.

So what happened two years ago? Well, I lost four people in my life, back to back. It was also one of the hardest financially for me in years. I had issues with my kids, with my so-called friends and I battled with depression.
That was the hardest thing for me as I am never depressed. I am one of the most positive people you will ever meet, but that year, threw me for a loop.

It started off with issues with my daughter, and making the decision to throw her out. It went on to losing one of my biggest clients, mishaps with my car and electronics and just shit coming at me in all directions, all year long.

I have to be honest the holidays came too fast, I was just not ready nor did I feel festive or in the holiday mood.
When my girls told me that they were going to Europe over Thanksgiving, that threw me right over the edge.
I didn't even do my annual open house for people that had nowhere to go, I honestly just didn't have it in me.

By the time Christmas rolled around I have to tell you it was no better. And when my girls told me that they were spending Christmas Eve with their Jewish father, well that about did it for me. Whatever little festive I had in me went straight out the window.
All of this holiday stuff came in the middle of a break up with a man I truly was in love with but realized that this wasn't going anywhere because he wanted kids and I don't.

I have to tell you, if it wasn't for the people that I knew didn't have family to be for the holiday,  I would have pulled the plug on it all.
But as that old Showbiz saying goes ""The Show Must Go On"" so I pulled it together and made a holiday dinner special for those who would have had none otherwise. See things could always be worse and it was for me that year.

Sometimes as bad as you're hurting, you need to put that aside and put others needs in front of your own needs. As my pastor says all the time, you need to be a blessing to others and so I try to do that.
Now I am not complaining, don't get it twisted as I know I am blessed beyond belief but sometimes.... sometimes I would like to catch a break, so for me to complain about not being able to go out or a loss of income would be ungrateful, besides from the fact that this year has nothing on two years ago for me. Don't get me wrong I know people are dying, our country is in a crisis and it's hard for many people, I am just saying that we have all been through harder times or maybe this is your hardest, whatever the case may be, I'm here to tell you it will pass, the sun will shine again for all of us.

I know I have a lot to be grateful for, I am grateful for my girls, for my friends, who are the family I choose for myself. I know God has and will continue to take care of me and I know as my mom used to say all the time, ""This too shall pass"" and so I hold on to that tiny bit of faith and hope to get me through this year and past years.

So today my friends, I am telling you this to let you know it can always get worse, but to also say this too will pass. Whatever you are going through now will be a distant memory a year from now and we will all breathe a sigh of relief knowing we made it through the holidays and the bad times. Everytime hard times come at me I think of all the hard times I have already faced and it gives me the strength to go on.
And look, the new year is right around the corner with better days to come, we have to hold on and be grateful we got through the holidays.

Wishing you and yours a wonderful Christmas and a Happy New Year. Thank you all for following me, cheering me on and always being there for me, I so appreciate each and everyone of you. God bless.

**I know this is a touch of year so I will be putting this number out there for all that needs it...I been there and I know how dark it may seem especially during the Holiday season, there is help, it will get better...I am living proof of
""This too shall pass""**

15,"I normally don’t really invest a lot of thought into these types of issues. I don’t really have friends. I have one best best friend who lives on the other side of the country, but outside of that I have maybe 10 online friends total, with only 2 that I communicate with daily. 

Anyway, one of them is an old online friend that I’ve known for well over ten years. We used to play a few online games together and I had once subscribed to their gaming opinions. I once recommended they become a video game critic because they were very insightful. 

Well, I reached out to them recently and reminded them of who I was and that I was looking at my friends list and near forgot they were on my list. I asked how they were and such and was responded with a very short greeting and left it at that. I followed up with how they were holding up and what new video games they played and that’s it... I was left on read.

Normally, it’s just a matter of waiting for a response, right? Well, that response never came. 

It’s fine, really, but it had definitely bothered me enough to want to write about it. I guess it was stupid of me to break my own baseline and *reach out* to someone only to be disappointed. Ah well, live and learn, I suppose.",30Dec2020,1

The thing is I make certain exceptions here and there when it comes to bi women that I find attractive and dating/hu. Part of the time I wasn’t even aware of the fact that they were bi until after we had already hit it off and fell in lust/love. They also were aware of my views on lgbtq stuff and it didn’t seem to bother them or change much. At the end of the day it’s still straight sex and I started having more than one girl at the same time ever since I allowed my girl to do stuff with (strictly) other girls which was the best decision I ever made because it quickly turned into US doing stuff with other girls.

I'm proud of you. I'm so proud of you for moving out AND getting a full time job this year, and both so close together. 

Here are a few lessons you learned this year:

You can do so much more than your depression convinces you. You are so strong and brave and smart. You are capable of doing so many great things!!

You know your worth. Don't you ever forget it again. And don't ever settle for less. Don't ever talk to someone that you always have to message first. If that's the case, they aren't interested!! Stop going after someone who is not interested!! Whoever is out there is worth the wait. And I shouldn't have to write this but I am.. Never ever ever talk again talk to someone who is married!!! Never ever be someone's secret again!!! Be with someone local, someone who wants to show you off, someone who is happy to tell everyone about you, someone who can cuddle and hold you, and tell you what a special and amazing person that you are.

You have to take care of your teeth. Right now its 2 days before 2021 and you have idk, 3-5 cavities. 2 are starting to hurt today and you've already taken 3 pills. Please. Floss and brush your teeth. I know it's not easy when you come home late or your mental health is kicking your ass but find, a, way!! You want to keep all your teeth dont you!! Cavities hurt!! And are expensive to fix, and that's the least expensive thing to fix, so please, floss and brush your teeth TWICE. A. DAY!!!
 
Your hair doesn't define you. The size of your body doesn't define you. Your outward appearance doesn't define you. How you treat others matters. And to be honest you could do so much better. Stop taking your pain out on others, especially those closest to you. Be nice to people, especially your family, appreciate them and love them.

I know what I just wrote. I do, but know when to take a break from Mom, seriously. She's negative and narcissistic and bad for your mental health. She is. Take a break from her when you need to, you'll feel better. 

I'll write more when I think of it, but RR, please please let's leave our Eating Disorder in the past. Let's not bring it into the future.",30Dec2020,1

What if she’s banging another guy and her comments about liking me were superficial? Well that is possible but she could be busy doing something else? 😅

28,"Now please stop motivating me by telling how lucky I am and bla bla. I have always been unlucky throughout my life.

I had epilepsy for 18-19 years of my life and had to medicate for it. Due to that, I didn't get any opportunity to get out of house and learn. My friends used to like me in the beginning years and always used to ask me to meet them. But I had to medicate at 6 AM and 6 PM twice a day. And you know epilepsy patients are restricted from doing a lot of things.

Then I was a good student till college. But college, the most important education in your life. I fucked up many semesters and too much of time. I regret it honestly. My average percentage in 10,11,12 is 87-88%. And do you know my percentage in college? Not even 75%. And I never focused, had I focused and worked hard I would have got good marks.

I missed my potential in college. I could have easily topped 1 of the semesters. I loved each and every subject, but sth happened, I made myself overwhelmed, didn't study properly. Didn't make study a priority, and here I am. Struggling with gpa.

32,"Hey, so, as the title says, I managed to give myself food poisoning Saturday, and I'm still paying for it today, Wednesday. Dunno if the NSFW flair is necessary, but using it just in case.

It's 4 in the morning in Denmark as I type this. 

So Saturday, I got the usual with food poisoning; also broke a near 20-year streak without vomiting. I've been paranoid about vomiting again since, because emetophobe.

Starting Sunday, I became constipated and barely able to take in foods of any kind. I've pretty much been subsisting on toasted white bread and soup.

Went to the doctor yesterday, and was prescribed anti-emetics and laxatives, but the anti-emetics don't seem to work as I'm still dry heaving from time to time. At least the laxatives seem to be working at least a little.

I'm so tired. I go from being too cold to too hot to too cold to too hot. Being able to eat, then getting nauseated from eating. Being able to drink water, then being nauseated from drinking water. I've been lying on the couch in the living room all day and I'm so horrendously bored and lonely and upset, I just want my mother to give me a cuddle, but I also don't want to bother her.

I want my boyfriend here, but he lives in Germany, and all unnecessary travel between Denmark and Germany is heavily discouraged because of the pandemic.

I wish I could turn back time to Saturday and just eat my mother's chili instead of cooking dinner for myself.

I just want to be better already. I'm so tired of being sick, it's affecting me psychologically that I just can't do anything.

I can't shit, can't puke, can't sleep, can barely eat and drink, I feel like nobody gives a shit and that I'm just a burden and annoying to deal with.

38,"I’ve had this problem for most of my life. It started in the form of not asking the teachers for help with things because I didn’t want to be vulnerable. I never stood up to people who bullied me, because I didn’t want the situation to get worse on my end and risk getting in trouble. If I don’t want to be involved with someone or something, I ghost them/it. That’s a very toxic trait and I know it is, but confrontation is not my wya of doing things. Anxiety will take over and open the door to an emotional panic attack.
I tried that tactic with someone who is sexually coercing me but they called me out on it, asking if I was ghosting them. I quickly responded saying that I wasn’t, because I suddenly felt very guilty that I was backing out on a friendship (even though that is definitely not what it is anymore). That’s my other toxic trait: I give people way more chances than they deserve. 
I feel so horrible now because I had a perfect chance to get out and I didn’t take it because I can’t stand my ground. If I can’t learn how to stand up for myself against this person, the damage will be even harder to reverse.

39,"Just realized something the other day when talking to a neighbor who is in college. 

I was venting to her about how difficult high school life is, especially online and during covid and how there’s always a little voice in my head that tells me you’re not doing enough and you’re going to be a “failure”. 

She said the all or nothing mentality of many high school students these days is seriously damaging because it makes you think anytime that you don’t spend on school makes you feel like a failure. I related to this because one school year I shut out everything that was enjoyable for me to do and I just studied and worked all the time. I didn’t take breaks, I didn’t do the hobbies I enjoyed (gaming, crocheting, drawing, etc). Nevertheless it didn’t go so well, was pretty traumatic and I probably have some sort of anxiety disorder now. She just told me it was okay to take breaks from school and stop working, because people weren’t made for working all the time, and we were made to live our lives the way we want to. 

The concept of smart and dumb is also very illogical in some sense, she explained. For example, Someone can be “smart” in socialization and negotiation but is “dumb” in general academics.The scale of measuring someone as smart or dumb using one aspect of their lives (school) just doesn’t make sense, because what if someone is good at something other than studying and doing homework? No one is truly dumb. 

The message that school sends by ranking you on a A-F scale and hyping up college all the time really makes students feel extremely pressured/anxious to work all the time. Sometimes it feels like you get punished both ways because if you don’t do the extracurriculars and work, you feel like a failure. But if you do do it you are extremely burned out and tired. Nothing ever works out and you can’t ever seem to find a balance. Many students end up with major depressive/anxiety disorders/a huge fear of failure, which is just really sad.",30Dec2020,1

43,"A prayer for my uncle.

Apologies for the way I word? I dunno. This is one of my first longer posts and I don’t think my wording will be very good? So I apologize in advance.

I’ve only talked to three people about this: another uncle and my mother (introduced me to this info &amp; who I overheard) and my friend (felt I needed to tell). I don’t know all of the information and I believe a lot will be held back from me. I’ll try my best

4 years ago, I met my uncle who I’ll call Steve. Steve came to my county and it seemed like he was here for a visit. Almost my whole family lives here, including Steve’s mom (my grandma) and his daughter. Upon the first week he was here, I overheard a conversation between my mom and him. I wasn’t paying too much attention because I was watching TV, but one word I remember was “addiction”. I didn’t pay much attention to it at the time, I just assumed he meant he was addicted to cigarettes. Now this visit turned into a month, and then into 3 years. I didn’t know until now, that he would be considered a “moocher” ( I could be wrong with the word? Feel free to correct, I might just be making it up).

Steve lived in my grandma’s house for about a year and a half, and then moved into his daughter’s for the remainder of the time. Steve didn’t have a job for the first year, I believe, and found work at a hotel. He had a car that was in real bad shape which broke down in about year, so he ended up taking my grandma’s car which also broke down a couple months later resulting in my Grandmother purchasing a new car, which Steve took advantage of. I’m unsure of why Steve moved from my grandmother’s to his daughter’s. Steve’s daughter was married at the time of Steve moving in. Steve’s Daughter’s husband didn’t like him, so at the end of his stay he moved down to a new location with his son. During his stay at both houses, he was helpful: fixing windows &amp; building new things, but I was oblivious to how Steve took advantage of them. Making them buy him groceries and laundering money.

So fast forward to two weeks ago. My mother comes into my room and reports that Steve has gone missing. I didn’t know how to react. Someone who’s been apart of my life for a while just vanishes. I went through the whole day just questioning how I felt, and I felt bad about it. Mid-day, I’m tagged in a Facebook post about how Steve’s been missing for 5 days and to spread awareness about it. At this point, I felt a tightness in my body (like the ones I get when getting yelled at or when I’m about to cry). I was super stressed. 

Fast forward to the next day, I’m working on emails when my mom gets a call. Another family member is crying about how he’d been found and how of a bad condition he was in (yellow skin, failed liver?). My other uncle comes to my house to join in on the call and give advice, to which my family members didn’t follow. To get out of any talk about the situation, I went to bed early but I was called down about 30 minutes later. My mother and uncle know I was listening in and they tell me about Steve’s meth problem. At this point, the “addiction” comes to mind. He struggled with it before moving to my town and had found access to it in his new location. He had 3 phones and we assumed he had problems with not paying up for a last purchase. 

At this point, I haven’t been told much more. I just want to get this load off of my back. I’ve left out a lot of information, but I feel like it wasn’t important (I could be wrong of course). I’m taking this as a lesson as to never use drugs and not take advantage of people. I don’t want to rely on someone for everything just to give back little in return. Of course I’d love help, but I can push myself into succeeding. As with any sort of drug &amp; even alcohol, stay away. Don’t get involved. Not only are you bringing yourself to rock bottom, but your family and friends.

If you read this, thank you. And, if your religious, please keep my uncle in your prayers. My whole family would appreciate it. Please don’t look anything up, I don’t want anyone to be found or contacted (I don’t know if anything else is online about it).",30Dec2020,1
44,"A few years ago I was doing my doctorate and had two supervisors. One professor would sexually harass me by groping me several times and the other would bully me by trying to fail me and making racist remarks. Around the same time that I had intended to report the professor who groped me, I was accused of stealing assignments from the university (which I did not do) by the professor who bullied me. After both of these incidents failed to have any outcome following my report, I dropped out and was left with no career prospects, no job, and no education. 

I grew up in a strict Asian household and had many successful friends who at the time were all graduating and becoming doctors, dentists, and lawyers etc. During this time, I became severely depressed, gained over 20kg from the antidepressants, had incredibly low self esteem, and started working an entry level administration job. 

It was at this point that I knew I had to pick myself up and turn my life around. I enrolled in university again and studied harder than I ever had before with the goal of getting into dental school, which at the time, was the most competitive degree to enter at this university. I pulled many all nighters, woke up early, erased all distractions and just worked my butt off. 

Fast forward a few years, and I have been accepted into dental school, lost over 20kg, and have newfound hope and optimism for my future.

I know there are hundreds of posts a day on here talking about the same thing, and I’m not a special one. I didn’t have a crazy special story or anything. I’m just not satisfied with life. I had a strong faith and a belief in god and the after life. That didn’t help. I got married and tried to fulfill myself through family. That didn’t help. I tried working away my pain and that didn’t help. I’ve been doped up with prescriptions, they just make me worse or more angry, they don’t help. I’m scared of medication. Therapy makes me feel like a little kid and I hate it, it doesn’t help. 

Im miserable all the time. I’m so anxious and angry that I can’t enjoy working or being off work. I can’t sleep, I can’t relax. I constantly pace and my brain won’t shut off. Even typing is hard, I’m a million places at once. I think about ending my life multiple times a day, even when I’m happy. Because it feels like it’s the only thing I can control. 

The way I was raised affects me greatly, an ultra conservative Christian household mixes with my mental problems. I used to see anything sexual and I wanted to blow my brains out. A penis joke would make me suicidal because it’s just how I was raised. I’m a little better now but I can’t handle a lot of society nowadays. I feel like I either need locked away in a institution or killed sometimes lol.",30Dec2020,1

48,"My year has been absolutely trash, as an addition to normal 2020 trash.

So each month of this year has been absolutely terrible for me ever since January. Now I know this may sound preachy because everyone else is also having terrible years, though mine got shit on in a personal way that only added to the horrible year. So let me start from the start.


January: This is the start of a kid threatening to murder me and acts of violence are being taunted towards me. Later in the month this kid and a friend of theirs (these people are like miniature Hitler’s, but even Hitler had a reason for his violence) come to my house and vandalize it with an old fashioned egging, which is just quite awful as it won’t wash out.


February: shit really hits the fan here, so that kid who was giving me death threats finds me with a group of my friends and starts choking me, not only that but also punching and tackling. My friends try to get them off of me as I’m about to faint from loss of air, then a person comes out from a nearby school and chases them off. The rest of my year up until now has been spent in fear of them. Then I get a “girlfriend” probably my worst decision this year because I can’t do relationships all to well I learnt, especially when their over-obsessive friend is trying make sure I don’t talk to or get near the girl.


March: everything starts out normal, then we have to go into quarantine and that’s the last time I will ever see my “girlfriend” ever again. I try my best to keep in touch with them but they reject any of my attempts at conversation &amp; don’t show any interest towards me.


April: my “girlfriend” moves away and I get upset for a week after their over obsessive friend tells me that, “she doesn’t have feelings for you anymore, but she couldn’t tell you” and I felt beyond hurt &amp; angry. Then these two people get together and I’m sexually harassed by the over obsessive friend saying things like, “send me nudes or my parents will abuse me” and “send me nudes or I will send you nudes” I have to respond with no multiple times and then get sent a picture of somebody’s ass. Worst part was that I couldn’t slap them in their faces or scream at them, I was so emotionally distraught, and they tried playing it off as a joke and told me I couldn’t take comedy when they literally tried to solicit me for nudes. In a couple weeks I break up with the girl when it should have been them but I had to be the responsible one.


May: I finally expose the over obsessive friend for their disgusting behavior, then another person opens up about how the person was being transphobic to them when the person themself was acting like they are the only person allowed to be trans. Me and my friends get back to happiness without having to deal with this person.


June: everything is easy going and my friends get back to living life like normal, probably the only month where things where normal.


July: so the BLM stuff was definitely getting shoved down my throat and noticed people stopped fighting for the actual rights of people and started getting mad over nothing. Then I had to fight my friends about how “opinion isn’t fact” which is really stupid that I had to do that.


August: I’d been living with taking the shit of this overtly radical-feminist who had said serious things like, “all men are racist, rapist, sexist, and abuse women” and “I’m ok with boys 5 and under, but I’m scarred that if they’re 6 or older they might rape me”... she said that 6 year olds could rape somebody. Then they told me I could have no knowledge about culture around the world because I was from America, completely ignoring the fact that I’m a history/culture buff who knows so many useless facts about the world. We kicked her from the group and still wonders why.


September: you remember that ex-“girlfriend” I had a while back this year? Well one of my friends decides to bring them to a private Discord server and I get into a panic attack and start screaming at her to get out &amp; how she is utterly worthless for still being friends with the same creep from a long time ago, my hypothesis was correct as they went to that person and told them about how we got angry at them. Then I have to get on a call with this person acting as they are the victim from the starts, crying and use emotion to manipulate the situation so that they’d be the person who was hurt in the past that lead to these events; I just kept repeating, “I had this person put in front of me without a choice and had an emotional over-reaction” because I really had nothing else to say. Oh yeah, now I can’t speak about them but let’s ignore that because freedom of speech and anonymity. Also that sexist person said that doing science in school isn’t real science, just thought that was kind of funny.


October: so I made a stupid joke/insult between a group of friends after losing a game with my friends where I said, “Well, umm, your birth is a failure” to this person, it was a half-assed response and it was all meant in good spirits; this person gets super offended by it well we’re all laughing it off, telling me that they’ve never heard something so offensive before. So I explain to this person it was a joke. That was how I would lose 4 friends.


November: Later I get into a fight with this person after criticizing their character; this person was thinking like an egotistical child and hypocritical lots of the time, then I stop talking to them for about a couple of weeks. One of my friends says they aren’t taking sides when they obviously took the side of the person acting childish person. Then these two hypocrites call me an asshole who is over controlling when I have trauma from being in abusive relationships and this was all happening in a private Discord server where I had control, then these people acted like they where above people for no reason at all. So I completely cut these people off from my life after sending the “professional retard” meme to them all in a “fuck you” act as they said, “go out with a bang”.


December: I’m tired of all this bullshit dealing with every radical that I could this year and now I get thrown an SJW after those people from the last month. I can’t take this person because of how little they advocate for freedom of speech, and tried to force such radical believes onto my friends &amp; I. Now I’m left here doing so much political things and realize how fucked the whole world is.


So if you where able to read this whole thing out I thank you, this was very therapeutic for me. I just ask for some advice for next year in hopes of having a life with some more peace in it.",30Dec2020,1

I wouldn't have believed it myself if they didn't look the exact same. When I first met him years ago I was curious about Donald Sutherland and apparently he has a reputation for having ""illegitimate"" children and being a shitty father, which made the whole idea that he had a son living in crappy trailer park in a moderately shitty northern city make more sense.

51,"I have a big family and a somewhat decent friend pool. I find it brain wrackingly difficult at times keeping in contact with them on a regular basis. Many times iv gotten messages from friends and family who are unhappy with me for not contacting them or seeing them in so long. When I hear that, I genuinely feel astonished, I'm surprised. It slowly starts to stress me out and depress me. I still wish them happy bday and merry xmas; all that jazz, it dosnt feel like it's enough for them. It makes me wish I had no ties to begin with, or I wish they would leave me alone. Just because I've been absent for however long dosnt mean I'm suddenly evil or horrible. This gets sickening to me. Maybe I have needy friends/family.",30Dec2020,1
52,"A few years ago I was doing my doctorate and had two supervisors. One professor would sexually harass me by groping me several times and the other would bully me by trying to fail me and making racist remarks. Around the same time that I had intended to report the professor who groped me, I was accused of stealing assignments from the university (which I did not do) by the professor who bullied me. After both of these incidents failed to have any outcome following my report, I dropped out and was left with no career prospects, no job, and no education. 

I grew up in a strict Asian household and had many successful friends who at the time were all graduating and becoming doctors, dentists, and lawyers etc. During this time, I became severely depressed, gained over 20kg from the antidepressants, had incredibly low self esteem, and started working an entry level administration job. 

It was at this point that I knew I had to pick myself up and turn my life around. I enrolled in university again and studied harder than I ever had before with the goal of getting into dental school, which at the time, was the most competitive degree to enter at this university. I pulled many all nighters, woke up early, erased all distractions and just worked my butt off. 

Fast forward a few years, and I have been accepted into dental school, lost over 20kg, and have newfound hope and optimism for my future.

56,"2.5 years ago, ocd was telling me to return home to get napkins. I did not want to do it so I tried to make a deal with Christian God about not returning home to get paper napkin and a'curse was asked in case breaking the deal. I was trying to use the fear of the curse to force myself not do the compulsion. I tried to validate the deal but in the last moment, I canceled it. What if other Gods accepted the promise.

Yesterday, I wanted to send a message to my brother in order to be specific about something because my ocd was telling me. At that moment, some unwanted thoughts popped up telling that if I send the message, it will break the napkin deal, even though they have no relation.

I got worried and decided not to send the message.

ocd1: send the message

ocd2: do not send the message. by having these thoughts and deciding not to send the message, maybe you accepted the new deal that if you send the message it will break the napkin deal.

ocd 1: send the message.

I knew that I never made any deal, so I was thinking to send the message and ignore what ocd2 says. Some random, unwanted thoughts popped up that were saying that I do not care if I break it or something like that. So, I send the message.

I started worrying because of the random thoughts that popped up before sending it. What if it looked like as if I was choosing to break the napkin deal by sending the message? I know everything was ocd and my uncontrolled thoughts wanted to say that I do not care if I break the compulsion that tells me NOT to send it, because I knew that I WILL NOT be breaking the napkin deal. Instead of that some rushed, words popped up that were telling that I do not care if I break the napkin deal or something like that.

I did not want to think that. it was just, a misunderstanding. And I worry because I do not know if these were just random thoughts to myself or if it were fast prayers to Gods.

What if it looked like as if I have decided to break the napkin deal by sending the message to my brother? what if it looked like as if I accepted what my ocd was saying?",30Dec2020,1

60,"Life can be so exhausting, and i'm on my last leg to be honest. I'll go into these episodes where i'll just think and wonder - what is the meaning behind everything? Why is our society shaped the way it is? Everything nowadays seems to be in the form of likes, and fame/fortune. Why does a person who put so much work/time/money into a profession get paid so little (ex. doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc) but yet we have people like the Paul brothers or the nine-year-old who opens toys Ryan get paid 10x more? Everyone is just after notoriety, and i'm sick and tired of everything. Jeff Bezos will soon become a trillionaire, a TRILLIONAIRE! Like what the actual fuck.

What's the point in having all these nice things if one day we're going to pass away and it'll all just stay on this planet? We as humans go through so much work, and spend so much energy to have our perfect life. A nice family, cars, homes, luxury, but what is it all for? What's the point of me waking up every day for work if i'm just another number in their equation that they can easily replace within a week or less.. this world is really built on the lust and greed of money and fame and it's sickening.

I'm trying to become a better human being, make friends, overall be as happy as I can be but sometimes these things get to me. Our justice system is so fucked up, and so is the rest of society as a whole. We're so busy in our virtual lives that we don't realize all the harm that is happening.

I’m making music, I’m writing, I’m learning the piano and doing photography, I’m learning how to create 3d worlds and videogames, I’m learning how to graphic design, I just want to keep getting better at all those things, but I also want to be better physically, financially and morally. I want to know that while I had my youth, I really gave it the best try. I don’t want to be middle aged filled with regret. That doesn’t mean notoriety or fame or even becoming a billionaire, I just don’t want to have wasted this time instead of pursuing things I love and living life passionately. Its actually fun when I do what I love to do. I like doing things that give me profound joy and happiness. I don’t want to do things that don’t have that effect. That's just where I am with it in life. This hellish year is coming to a close, rest in peace to everyone we lost, I hope everyone who is sick is on the road to recovery. We’ll go down in history based on this year only. Its guaranteed. If we’re going down in history anyway, why don’t we set a precedent for future generations. A precedent of human unity, progress, advancement and achievement. We don’t have time to be bringing each other down over asinine things that plague our monkey minds. Race, religion, ethnicity, we’re past most of those concepts. How long can those fights keep going on, honestly? Most of you know black people, whitebpeople, asian people, brown people, most of the time people are cool, so whats the hold up? The hold up is a lack of objective. I think human boredom and classism are to blame. First off capitalism makes our paper chase an emotional concept. So if you’re relatively “broke” by western standards, you feel bad, personally. Its a strange concept, you could have all your needs met but being in relative poverty in comparison to the television can feel bad. That bad feeling makes us want to be better that someone. Insert inferior races, or ideologies. Thats how it seems to me at least. If everyone just had a goal. Maybe my problem is I think people want to solve their problems. People don’t care. Not only do they not care, they want to make things worse. I don’t. And I want to meet more people who don’t. I want to create something thats focused on people who care and want to better things within our lifetimes. I mean REAL progress. That means aiming for better art, music, film, literature, technologies, just up the ante and make the dopest things, not the things that make the most money, even though that could be a prospect, that should not be the aim. Your aim should not be to make the thing that will make the most money, that should be a bonus to a job well done. Your aim should be to make the greatest thing possibly, if this didn’t exist in the ecosystem, the world would be worse. That should be the aim. Fuck all this other shit. We don’t care how much money you have made. Is your thing irreplaceable? Is your thing of infinite value? By your own definition, would you consume that shit because without it the world would be a lesser place? There are things like that, I’ve felt them. Yeah say whats in your heart and be honest, but also try being good. Like really good. Like hone your craft, develop endurance, go past what you thought you were capable of. Keep practicing and become a samurai about what your craft is. Because why else are we doing this? I do this because I love it. Because I want to give something to the world that tries to attempt at achieving something I’ve felt. Maybe its impossible but I’m gonna try.",30Dec2020,1

Usually when I isolate myself socially I find that it’s because I’m in a depressive or anxious episode, and to some extent maybe I am. I do have bad days in lockdown, but don’t we all? And to begin with I don’t think it was healthy; I wanted to isolate from my friends for no reason other than social interaction was too much for me, was making me anxious and I just wanted to wallow and be by myself all day. But generally I’ve actually been pretty good all things considered; I’ve been learning a new language, writing every now and then, reading, and just kind of chilling out and going at my own pace. While I do miss my friends at times a little, it’s not overwhelming and I could honestly live this way forever I think. I’ve always valued my own space highly while I think a lot of my friends are extroverted and need that interaction, so this is a lot tougher on them. 

The weird thing is it’s really made me question my relationship with my friends. And again, I can identify this as a depressive symptom for me, always wanting to see the bad in people. We’re a big group, and some of them I adore and have an amazing time with, but a lot of them that are largely friends of friends just straight up bad people. They’re racist, or sexist, or hold backwards views, or talk badly about women, or are too into drugs and the party scene (I dabble a bit so I have nothing against that, but these guys are going down a bad path with booze and drugs) and honestly being away from that at a distance and seeing them more clearly has made me realise how much I truly hate it. It’s alienated me. A lot of the time it’s in the form of ‘jokes’, and some just say shit for the edgy dark humour value, which I was guilty of in high school too, but we’re older now and I can see that some of them truly believe the horrible shit they’re saying, and it really makes me angry and not want to be around them. One of them is a guy I’ve been friends with since we were small, and realising he actually holds these views has been a massive eye opener and hurts bad.

More generally than that though I find I just don’t want to socialise. Even my good friends go on Xbox everyday and chat shit; I’ve not been on in months. I say it’s because I don’t have anything to play, but the truth is I do; I just don’t want to socialise. I’ve actually been playing a lot and just appearing offline. They ask me to come on, ask what the fuck I’ve been doing with myself, and whenever they suggested going out and doing something when restrictions were a little lighter it just made me feel anxious. How do you explain to people who care about you that you just don’t want to talk to anyone? I think on one hand it’s unhealthy; I know I’m isolating myself from people who care about me and the thought of interacting with them makes me anxious, and it’s definitely based in the kind of depressive behaviour I’ve been guilty of in the past, but on the other hand it feels okay because it’s really gave me a new viewpoint on who I care about and who I don’t. 

I didn’t make a conscious decision to isolate myself for moral reasons, I was already doing it for reasons I can’t quite figure out apart from that I felt the urge to isolate myself and interacting with people was making me anxious, but once I had and I realised all this shit it made it a whole lot easier. These guys are my only friends, but in a lot of ways it feels like I’m outgrowing them; I have things I want to do, I have different values, while they’re content to stay in the same town, get drunk, get high, and not question their morals by and large. I love some of them to death, and the few times I’ve seen them through all this it’s almost made me cry because deep down I do miss them, but another part of me really wants to isolate from them and while it might be my history of anxiety and depression that’s causing it, I feel like it’s made me realise so much. I’ll still be on good terms with them all, but I know which ones I want to create distance from and I know that I value a life beyond what they value now.",30Dec2020,1

Whenever these people are unavailable I have no one else to talk to and I become sad and assume they're just not talking to me because they hate me and need a break. Especially with my girlfriend, it's kind of gone to the point where she can't even make a small joke directed at me without me getting really hurt
I avoid talking to people whenever I can because I have this fear that I'm forcing them to talk to me when there's so many more interesting and better people they could be spending their time with. Therefore I've decided to gradually reduce the amount I talk to them in order to give them some room to breathe. Is this a good idea?",30Dec2020,1
77,"No doubt 2020 has sucked and they say that this year is the year that would make or break some people. While I've watched relationships and lives fall apart and people hit their lowest points I cant help but feel a bitter sweet with this year.

This year I got engaged, became pregnant and just got preapproved for a house loan amount that I never thought possible. Tomorrow we find out the gender of our addition to the family and this weekend we start looking at houses. 

Of course not everything will be rainbows and butterflies from here on out but I'm so thankful for the support from my family, my hard working fiance and the strength that my family was given to make it to this point in my life.

79,"(I think I just need to write all this out to get my head around it and hopefully work out how to finish my immediate task. Thanks for reading.) TLDR at bottom.

My father died suddenly on the 2nd of December. (Tiny back story: my parents lost their house after the 2008 financial crisis when their small business was forced to liquidate and the bank reclaimed their house so they have been renting since and finding it quite difficult to get by). They are on the council waiting list for social housing (fingers crossed my dad's death doesn't affect my mums position on this list as they were getting near the top).

Bit more backstory just to let you know why this hurts so much: My dad was retired but worked as a gardener to make ends meet. He died suddenly in the garden of one of his clients earlier this month. My mum works as a housekeeper for the house opposite, though now is signed off for a couple of months due to the bereavement.

Mum had received the government bereavement payment of £2400 ish pounds last week, and we are awaiting for her Universal Credit to be calculated. She will get £400 ish pounds of dads outstanding state pension paid to her too. This is all the money she has currently and I've been helping coach her using Excel to do her cashflow, and find some cheaper rental options as she cannot afford to stay here now. This is obviously a lot to deal with when you are recently and suddenly bereaved. She's on the verge of a nervous breakdown but she's coping, we'll get through this. She has enough cash to pay for rent for about 2 months. She's frightened, but I'm reassuring her we'll work it out.

My brother has addiction issues and he often spends all his PIP/salary as soon as he receives it. My dad used to keep his salary for him (modest minimum wage salary) and drip feed him cash daily to buy food. Obviously this was going to go wrong this month and I expected him to spunk his salary on gambling/alcohol/drugs. I offered to help him manage his finances and to let me know if he needs help. I'm trying to finish an essay when he calls yesterday saying he is bored and wants to come over, I said it's a bit late notice I could come get you tomorrow, I'm so behind on this essay (I'm retraining to be a teacher so my family could have a steady income from at least one of us).

But last night I hear my mum screaming and crying and I go downstairs. She's tried to log into her internet banking and realises she doesn't have her debit card. Turns out, my brother took it home with him after Christmas (was just the three of us, he is in a support bubble with us) and he's gone and withdrawn 2 lots of cash, spent money in shops, tried to get deliveroo and gotten cashback. Altogether almost £400. She's shouting I can't believe you've stolen from me. He's gone on a bender and just not thought what he's doing.

Then:

I'm coming over to get my card now she wails down the phone ""Can you bring over my washing?"" he says.

This is what he's like, just takes all the time. Can you bring my washing over?! Are you f\*\*king kidding me?! THAT'S what you choose to say?!

I call him to check the facts make sure I know what's happened and then I just lose my rag with him. He tried to deny it was his fault, I said I know you're ill I know you're addicted but even in a split second you made a choice to steal from your mother, in THIS moment.

My mum was/is devastated, naturally.

We go and get the debit card, he's remorseful as anything but tbh I'm not having any of it at this point. He just so casually announced it in the first place, I think he's only remorseful cus we both got angry, I don't think he realises the effect he's having.

I logged in to my mums banking and totted up the money and have told him what he owes and given him a deadline. I've told him he is loved and to please ask for specific ways he can be helped, but that I'm also still speechless and angry.

The problem I think is is that he was never really made responsible for his mistakes, he keeps saying it's not his choice, but I've been addicted before and when you realise you are making a choice (one that FEELS impossible to do otherwise) is when you realise you can make better choices.

To make this all the more exhausting, I was only down at my parents because I was recovering from urgent surgery, of which I'm still awaiting if I need more, if I have to go back into hospital I think my mum will collapse.

Anyway, today he calls all remorseful and wants to come over. Mum was in the middle of sorting things with the bank and I know he's guilt tipping her making him sound lonely. He's worried about his comfort while I'm literally trying to make sure mum's rent is getting paid, and not only is he not helping, HE'S STEALING THE ONLY MONEY WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. She now has to go and drive when really she shouldn't be, because she's worried for his life. I know that he just feels uncomfortable and wants to come here to eat.

On the plus side, all the bereavement departments at BT and EE etc have been lovely as mum cancels things in his name or moves them to her name. We'll get through this.

God I don't actually know why I started writing this post for now.

Oh yeah that's it. My essay is due, but now I'm super stressed he'll be here. I don't want to have a family discussion yet, I don't want to be near him, I just need to get my essay done so I can get my qualification, graduate, become a teacher, and make sure mum is housed/safe/happy.

How can I focus and get my essay done?

Merry Christmas - I hope you're year is ending better than mine! :D :D

81,"Hello, my sister (27) and I (31M) both experienced (non-sexual) abuse at the hands of our father, and our mother left us when we were very young.  


As an adult, she has not been able to cope with her trauma in a healthy way, and has struggled with depression, drug abuse, and promiscuity (and has had 4 abortions). She has also told me about getting raped and sucking dick for coke (the context was a conversation about her needing to go to rehab for coke; she did not.) She also regularly posts photos of herself in lingerie.  


We're not close, I have seen her in person maybe once or twice a year for nearly a decade, but when she's approaching suicide or experiencing extreme emotional difficulty, she would call or message me in the middle of the night to get emotional support. This has never really been a problem because it didn't happen often, but she's 'cried wolf' and 'attempted suicide' four times in the last few months or so, and I had to tell her that I can't be responsible for her emotional well-being in this way, because it's traumatizing and damaging to have my sister call me in the middle of the night and tell me she just swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills.

95,"I've finally done it. I've given my resignation notice, and after 2 weeks I'll never have to come back to this place. I've known for a few years this was a dead end job led by subpar management, but I was never quite brave enough to cut the umbilical cord. Still, I put forth my best effort and worked hard at my job and succeeded (with whatever inane measures they used to measure success). As years passed, I became more and more a shell of my former self. I started living for the weekends and dreading the Monday blues. I became entrenched with other unhappy employees and we were stuck in this loop of unhappiness with no end in sight. I questioned what normalcy at a job even was, and if this was it, we were SOL. 

It wasn't all a waste land of horribleness. In the beginning it was new and shiny, and possibilities seemed abundant. After a short while, I began to  resent the false promises and the ""we're like family"" culture aka overworked and underpaid / underappreciated. I consulted with many people before making the decision to leave, but I've known the answer deep inside for a long time. And for a long time I ignored it. Some called my decision an error in judgment; that it was simply idiocy to leave during a pandemic. Others saw the value of honoring myself and beginning a new chapter. The past year, my health started going downhill as I started experiencing chronic anxiety at work. I started to feel a sense of doom while in meetings talking about x amount of hours saved, or stupid excel sheets, or working together as a team to solve never ending problems. Twice I checked in with doctors to make sure the symptoms weren't part of something else going on.

As I handed in my resignation my manager seemed very blasé about the conversation. They didn't inquire about pay, my unhappiness, or really show any curiosity about why a long term employee decided to quit during a pandemic. Not even a half - assed speech thanking me for my time there. I've poured so many hours into this place that I begrudgingly felt, over time, part of my identity was tied to this team and company. And to top it off, I hear they'll hire multiple people to fill my position. I think that just solidified for me that I made the right decision, and how I should have left sooner.

When the time came, I thought I'd feel elated and finally free. In retrospect, I feel older. It's true. I feel like I'm playing catch up as my skills were left to stagnate. But I don't regret my decision one bit. Those around me could see how much of a toll this job took on me. For me, it is the right decision to leave. A different type of anxiety has set in, one I didnt anticipate, as the course of my sails have changed and the lay of the land looks very different. It is simultaneously new and scary and promising.

99,"All around, I'm a pretty average guy. I'm 23M, 5'8, 175lbs, decent looking, kinda funny. Recently just beat depression's ass after 4-5 years of drug abuse and social isolation. Just this year, I purchased my first home and met a woman who understands and loves me to death, as I her. 

My biggest struggle through all of this has to be my complete lack of self confidence. Speaking in groups? Constant fear of saying something dumb and being judged, even around those who wouldn't. Girlfriend hanging out with friends, some of which happen to be guys? I mentally fall to pieces as my brain convinces itself that she's cheating on me, even though I know she wouldn't. 

I constantly take things too personally. Small inconveniences that I caused will have me apologizing repeatedly, expecting the other person to be furious at what I did. And then the realization afterwards that I overreacted and feel even more uncomfortable.

I feel like I've done so well for myself over the last year but every time something like this happens it makes me feel like I haven't changed at all.

From about age 8-12, I would ask my mom repetitive questions about the sky. Every morning when we’d wake up, I’d make her guess what the sky would be like today (I even had my own 4 categories of the weather- “beautiful” was clear blue with no clouds, “nice” was sunny with some clouds, “ok” was mostly cloudy with some blue, and “ugly” was completely cloudy and/or raining). Once she’d guess, we’d go outside and look, and I’d ask her what it actually was, then if she was surprised. I did this multiple times a day as the weather changed or each time we went outside. I had the same sky routine for a good 4-ish years. I even remember doing it in middle school!!! 


The weirdest part is, I remember getting extremely angry when my mom didn’t respond the way I wanted her to. Obviously my constant questions were annoying af and sometimes she’d yell at me to stop or just refuse to answer, and I’d instantly get really mad. Mostly at myself because I knew how weird and annoying I was being, but for some reason I couldn’t stop. Mom assumed I asked these questions to get on her nerves and test the limits, and while I don’t know exactly why I was so obsessed with the sky, I know for a fact I didn’t do it to purposely piss her off.

* Do not have another set of responsibilities such as a family. Avoid at all cost.
* Find a house/apartment/unit small enough for myself and large enough to fit a laboratory.
* Have some hobbies to break up work.
* If possible, get promoted, get moar salary, or get a better job just to increase the fund of the main goal cuz I will need many resources. I also found that there is diminishing returns to this.
* Continue working until 60. (or at least before I get crazy)
* Enjoy life until 70-80 (depends on how healthy)
* Kill myself expiration date to avoid further suffering. How? Spectacularly, Silently, Painlessly. idk.
* If the goal is incomplete at age 60, find someone who will continue.
* If the goal has been completed, copy consciousness and memories into the AI and it will start the SECOND main goal, while I will continue to maintain the AI for glitches and bugs. Have fun for the rest of my life.
* If I died from unforeseen events, a mechanism will distribute my work throughout the world so it wont be wasted.

When I confronted him about seeing him on Parler, asking him if he thinks that it is odd that no opposing views or anything are even allowed on that site, he simply replied, ""That's because everything else is lying to you. This is where you find the truth."" I pushed further on that ridiculous answer, saying that he was never once on social media before this, and that I find it odd that all of a sudden he joins.   


I cannot make this up.  


""I joined to check myself, to confirm that what I believe is true.""  

""Everyone on there thinks like I do!""

""All of my friends think the same way I do""

I told him, political views aside, (and I made sure to note that I am hesitant to praise Biden, most likely he is just another politician who will just be more private about slimy stuff than Trump. Otherwise, he would probably call me a democrat or that I am ""brainwashed"") that to surround yourself only with people, biased sources, and media that agree with what you believe is ridiculous, and you cannot expect me to take your word for anything more than something regurgitated from an incredibly biased source. That is not responsible at all.   


This conversation went on much like how you would expect talking to an inanimate object would go, nothing I said to him registered at all, in fact, he would just start talking over me and start spewing conspiracies about the election and the deep state and everything that you all have probably also seen on the internet somewhere as well.  That's when I realized, I cannot talk to you. I genuinely am unable to provide this person with a viewpoint that deviates in any way from his own. This also provided me with another realization. It seems like Patriotism is ungodly easy to hijack, from visiting the sub r/ParlerWatch, I noticed that all you gotta do is slap the word patriot in whatever you're saying, and you'll find a solid following. There is no self-awareness at all. It legitimately makes my stomach drop to know that my dad is on that site mingling with the bat-shit craziness that goes on there. Be careful taking a peek for yourself, it is some terrible anti-semantic, racist, violent stuff that is proudly said there. It feels unreal. It consumes me, every day, knowing he is apart of that.   


Now, he is driving out to DC, because this election was rigged, big time. And he is bringing plate carriers, guns, some high tech shit he has been buying recently with all the talk of civil war. When asked why every single court case was thrown out due to a critical lack of any sort of evidence, and how even his beloved Newsmax made a public statement saying they do not actually believe the election was rigged, he just said they were forced to say that, and reverted back to slamming Biden, saying that van bombing was a drone strike to destroy ""dominion"", ballot dumps... you know the rest. No self-reflection of the side that he is seemingly willing to kill for. I'm just afraid he might not make it back home.   


I've posted about my struggles with my dad's seeming radicalization before, and deleted those posts out of shame of going on the internet and slamming him. I feel shame because aside from his cemented and vastly misled political views, my dad is a god damn saint. He looks out for his family, he just payed his moms taxes in full for the year because she was struggling. He looks out for his friends, and our neighbors. He has been working his fucking ass off for decades to give my family and I a comfortable life style. He has compassion, he is loving, he would do anything for my family and I. And what hurts the most about all of this, is I think that all of that good in him is being manipulated to make my dad bow down to Donald Trump.  


That's why I am here, writing again. I have to have somewhere to get this feeling out of my chest. The disbelief, sadness, anger, and frustration that fills me every single day, when I'm unable to be around my dad without him talking about pro-trump conspiracies, and just having to sit in silence during it because it's impossible to say anything that might contradict it. I guess I am just coming here to ask, what the fuck is going on. I know my dad is not the only one that this is happening to, there is a wide adoption of fringe media and denying factual evidence. It's insanity. What can I do? is there even anything we can do? You can't talk to him, you legitimately can't, I cannot make him see that he see's the world as he does, because he is constantly drowning himself in his phone on sites that tell him there's god damn civil war coming.

I was in my room, before it was 12:00 AM, before the fireworks began- I was hit with the most triggering feeling and depressive state i have ever felt. After the fireworks began booming- I received an empty text message from my dad. ""Happy new years"". 

Trigger warning ahead. 

And then, my emotion, increased drastically- while the fireworks continued on outside, I cried to myself in my dark room as i had a panic attack that turned into an episode of self-harming &amp; suicidal thoughts.

I don't need another horrible New Years. I don't want to spend celebrating inside that fucking house with those fucking men. My two bullies- two narcissist's that tormented me for years- the only daughter &amp; the only sister. 

I just... deserve this.

116,"I got my license last year at 21 years old (already really late compared to the people around me) and haven’t done much driving. The only place I’d really want to go is to the gym, which is literally 2 minutes away from my house down a very busy road. 

I’ve of course drove multiple times totally fine, but I think I have some form of mild ptsd after reversing into a pole and denting my mom’s truck (while I was learning 2 years ago). She was totally cool with it and no one was hurt thankfully, but I always tense up at the thought of driving since then.

I know the only way to get over this is by just doing it, but I still feel really stupid for being scared of something everyone else does so casually. And thanks for reading.",30Dec2020,1

The new Ferrari/Bugatti.

The family owned southern restaurants I absolutely love. 

The watches I love.

The shoes I love.

The technology that seems futuristic currently

All these things that seem so modern/futuristic in their design and functionality will be considered “old” and “classic” when I’m 70. It’s weird to sit there and think about. It’s crazy to think about. It makes me ask questions like “what will the new sports car look like when I’m elderly” and “what will technology that seems so advanced and futuristic be like when I’m elderly”.",30Dec2020,1
118,"How do you deal with an overbearing friend that humble brags a lot, and wont stop boasting about his wealth, large home, family etc, but often in quite subtle ways.

This guy will send pics and vids of his kids 2-3 times daily, which are usually the same dull repetitive pics, but will seemingly want endless compliments about how ""intellectually sharp"" ""physically powerful"" and entertaining his kids are.  This is usually followed by how ""relaxed"" he is as a parent, and how everyone else is riddled with ""anxiety"".

This guy will never ask in return about anyone else kids, or if someone else posts a rare pic of their kids, this is usually met with silence, or a subject change. 

This guy also is challenging to be around as conversations are mainly led by him endlessly discussing how good he is at a particular sport, with minute dull details of matches and technicalities being droned on about.  Other conversations will usually focus on bringing attention to his wealth and status with humblebrags, and attacking people who disagree with him or call him out on his arrogance (of which there are vast numbers). 

He also in 1:1 situations will invariably start to point out the other persons insecurities, and even body shame them by taking photos of their stomachs, or prod them in the stomach and begin to proceed vigorously laughing. To add insult to injury, he often claims he himself is fat and needs to lose weight, when he is almost stick thin and fairly athletic.

He also will hound people to meet up several times week, and despite a multitude of excuses never gets the hint. When you eventually meet up to get it over with, within seconds you are internally dying. If say he is at your house he will end up going through all cupboards, helping himself to snacks, putting his feet up and then requesting if you have certain items.  If he notices you are annoyed or uncomfortable he will pounce on this by asking why you are ""unwilling"" or ""nervous"" and demean you.

This meeting will then be followed up by even more hounding to continue meeting up.   Just seeing a missed call from him or WhatsApp messages, will produce surges of anxiety, and can ruin an entire day.

In group situations with friends he will usually assert that he is ""alpha"" and try and take total control of the night. When it comes to food, he also will ask each person for a bite of their dish and like a caveman grab say their burger and take a huge bite out of it, before returning it half eaten. 

Most would say run a mile, but its complicated with mutual friends and business arrangements in place. 

I often wonder if this guy has a serious mental illness.

121,"I'm feeling scared... I just turned 30 and I'm at the crossroads here...

Ive been doing music production full time in my country for several years and prior to that, i made music passionately as a hobby..

However, i feel I've totally lost my interest in it and it's scary! It's been this way for a year i'd say. Right now I dont look forward going to work, i dont feel inspired listening to music, my accomplishments dont feel like much and even though i'm pretty succesful, i'm also a bit indifferent.

I get small bouts now and then when i feel ""man i miss making music, what was i thinking?"" but then that goes away.

I have no idea whether it's because i dont genuinely enjoy doing music production / songwriting at all anymore (or at least working full time), whether it's me being depressed or stressed out / anxious about something, maybe im going in the wrong direction within my field, or maybe i just want to do something else entirely.

All i know is, i want to be on vacation as long as i can at the moment to avoid going back to work..

I've looked into alternative fields like Programming or Game Developing. It seems moderately interesting, the demand for it is huge at least in my country and i have some ideas i could actualise if only i could program stuff properly.

Plus, I can always produce music in my spare time or combine music production with game developing ex. making game music.

&amp;#x200B;

So right now the 3 things i question are:

1. Am i depressed in general? Should i resume my SSRI meds &amp; therapy?
2. Am i anxious about something thus my brain is shutting down? Maybe i've been at the verge of a burnout?
3. Am i in the right field after all? Should i re-educate myself to become something else ex. Programmer?

&amp;#x200B;

What are your initial thoughts? I'm afraid i will make the wrong choice and it's now or never i have to choose whether i want to continue or change fields.

Any advice is appreciated. THX!!",30Dec2020,1

126,"The one thing that I learned throughout this is that I need to stop comparing myself to others. When I was little I was overlooked and overshadowed because I was quiet and socially awkward. I grew out of the awkwardness, but I kept my cold and quiet demanor.(I'm 19 at the moment) I started to make a good amount of friends in high school. Even then I felt like nobody ""saw"" or cared about me and I did sports and clubs. I knew that after high school, that shit doesn't matter anymore. All of these thoughts completely broke whatever ego that I had. I started to think that I had to look cool in front of people. So I lied, a lot. So many half truths and bullshit. I couldn't take a no and hated to lose because I thought that made me less of a man. I NEEDED to be successful because if I wasn't, l'll just be a loser again. This all caught up with me last year. I lost my bestfriend/ kinda girlfriend. I see all of these celebs/friends on social media enjoing their lives. All happy and flourishing. I didn't know what I was doing wrong. Then I realized, if I continue to worry about other people I'll never be successful. This is MY life! Not theirs! My journey WILL be different than theirs. Who knows? It might have a cooler Wikipedia page than them. I'm doing everything right, I think lol. With comparing myself to them, I'm not being authentic. I have to be my OWN celebrity/hero/inspiration. Now I'm working my ass off on everything that I want to do. So I can say, ""I did it!"" Also, I'm gonna start enjoying my life/grind. I have to find accomplishments throughout the process.  Because when I finally get there, I'm gonna want to move to the other step. I can do whatever the hell I want. I've proved that to myself already.

128,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

One instance she said she booked me in for a practice interview and I just looked down and nodded and she said annoyed ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ when I didn’t mean it like that 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 


And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by sending her an email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

💡She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign? Like when it was damp and combed flat etc it juts messy 


◾️I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence. And she seemed very moody about it at the time tbh",30Dec2020,1

134,"I didnt want this to be some review or anything, I know theres a book series and I havent read it, so I didnt want stans to argue nuances.

So I binged this show, not because it was all that great, but because it was a dumpster fire of relationship drama. At first you think its just going to be some fluttery regency-period show with quirky characters, but half way through the series it turns into some weird drama about people who dont know how to have sex, and ultimately using it as a weapon.


What it boils down to, is the two main characters have differing values. He wants to be child-free, she wants children. But they love each other, so they HAVE to be together, right? He deflowers her in the most unsexy way possible. They have rampant sex all the while she has no idea hes nutting outside of her. She asks someone what that is all about and suddenly shes raging that he is avoiding having children, even though hes mentioned his choice several times at this point. She basically rapes him (reproductive coercion).

138,"(No, this isn't Clickbait. Yes, it's fucking long, if you just want to skip through it, I did a conclusion and what would be good to take away from this at the end.)

This text is both a confession and a story to maybe inspire others to reflect upon their behaviours. While I use gender-neutral language, it is no secret that men, especially under the age of 30 by my estimate, especially those that spend a lot of their time on the internet, are much more in danger when it comes to certain bad consequences of internet usage. So if you belong into that group, this may be a good opportunity to reflect on what you consume and how much.

I try to make it as short as possible, but a few facts have to be known about me to put some things into context:

I have psychological disorders that lead to depression and other symptoms which make it impossible for me to work until this day, quite possibly my entire life. Which is why I had to develop or construct defense mechanisms to get out of certain situations I had the need to protect myself of. One of the best tools I found was reason and arguing, specifically used with eloquent rhetoric - as a teenager I was the definition of the ""debate me""-guy, logical reasons for behaviours are everything, feelings aren't arguments and so on. It worked well in certain areas (being able to calmly explain what the exact problem is with my illnesses and what does or doesn't make sense); in others not so well.

Overall, reason and logic are very dear to me - the beauty of arguments, proofs or just the fact that it saved me so many times in my life are why I hold them in such high regard. There were of course many situations during my life in which it was proven to me that I wasn't above emotional decisions, behaviours or even fears I couldn't suppress with my willpower alone to act rationally. 

But in this recent year, a couple of revelations presented themselves together that made it completely clear to my rather narcissistic, childish subconscious, that I was never the thorough, reasonable guy impervious to emotional seductions - I just didn't notice my own. They were hidden both from society, where someone could have called me out for my bullshit and from myself. It's easy to convince yourself when you're good at convincing others. And so those activities could grow.

Of course I was always aware that I'm not perfect - but there's a big difference between agreeing with a statement that really can't be denied (I'm a human, so of course I'm not perfect) and getting hit in the face with the humiliation of this reality like cold water.

While there are other addictions I developed and are harming me, what I want to focus on is porn and extreme, shocking content in general. This isn’t limited to sexual arousing stuff – spending hours on 4chan, reading about what actual Nazis say, watching videos of suicides, gorevideos, people fucking animals … I’ve seen everything. And I mean everything.

The difference between a harmless fascination for the morbid and shocking and what happened to me, or rather, what I did, is the pattern and the escalation. 

Things out of the norm have always attracted me, whether it be in politics, fiction or in reality. What better place to come across such things as the internet? But even earlier began, it seems, my love for escapism into art. Videogames, books or movies were always my favorite hobbies, I never went out and played football. Well nothing really wrong with that per se of course, I'm far from demonizing those things. That being said, the internet opened up a new world for me. Endless worlds, to be exact - not just is it perfect for escaping real life in many more ways than with other mediums but I also found friends for the first time in my life (I was bullied a lot.) 

But if you're decent at using a PC, have a lot of free time, are curious and all that, it doesn't take long until you discover porn and subsequently the darker side of the internet. I think I might have been 12 or 13 the first time I watched porn and hentai and it soon became a normal part of my daily life.

Flash forward to years later. After years and years of trying to get a normal life together before my twentieth birthday and finally just being a NEET (not in education, employment or training) it became clear that I was not fit to do anything productive in society. Why is it relevant? The problem that came with that was time. A lot of free time. Mostly bedridden for a time due to crippling depression, with a laptop and a smartphone.

Not to say I am not to blame but the preconditions for my consume of porn and other things to escalate couldn't have been more perfect. More porn, more extreme or exotic porn and hentai - I tried out almost every genre. Spending so much time on 4chan and the more infamous boards, reading extreme horror literature ... I wanted to see everything. The most fucked up shit imaginable. Why? It fascinated me, such was my reasoning at the time. I wanted to experience it all, everything human beings have done, the curiosity was insatiable. The shock, the high when I found something new are probably the only thing close to joy I felt many, many times. I saw videos, pictures or clips of things that a normal person would never get in contact with. I heard of the Darknet and learned how to access it. And with it, how to watch child pornography.

Now, not everyone who is curious as to what this actually looks like is a pedophile in the making, just like not everyone that wants to read ""Mein Kampf"", the book of Adolf Hitler, is gonna be corrupted by it. That's human nature, many people are curious about these sorts of things, especially about things that are seen as the ultimate evil. Again, the problem was that the combination of my life, my escapism which had given me so much over the course of my life and protected me from many things, the search for new highs of shock and the desensitization due to normal porn and of course the ability to apply cold logic to why this isn't someting immoral created a pattern of behaviour. This pattern had its first bad ending when I masturbated to child porn. When I downloaded it first I was just curious - but there came a time where I found the thought of it arousing. Why? Well it's new, shocking and exciting. And I acted upon that arousal. Why? I just did. No real thinking occurred.

It damaged me. This is nothing compared to what happened to those poor children, don't misunderstand me. I am not the victim here, overall. But due to the fact that this text is about what I've done wrong, I also have to tell people who might be on a similiar path how it affected me.

Those instances in where I did this are years behind and it still affects me, because of three reasons:

\-I will never be able to change this. I am someone who masturbated to child porn. Knowing what people might think of me when they would know and what I myself think of me is a mixture of pain and fear that gets lesser with time but it doesn't go away.

\-The fear of getting caught and exposed to the people I know is only comparable to the fear I expierenced when I was scared that I had contracted HIV. The icy terror and feeling sick to your stomach is able to destroy you in moments.

\-The uneasiness around children because of the horror that some sick desire in me might awaken. What would go beyond just what porn addiction led to.  This is heartbreaking for me, because I've always liked kids, way before all of that  I found them cool, rebellious, adorable, even before I turned into a teenager, if there was a baby around, I'd play with it for way longer than other kids because they were so cute. This relationship is irreparably damaged. I can of course spend time with kids without ever something happening at all, no weird thought entering my mind, like a normal person. But sometimes, out of the blue, I see a kid, maybe outside in a bus, and suddenly pornographic imaginations of that kid start to flood my mind. It's horrifying and happens in the same way other intrusive thoughts happen (I could just hack my hand off with this knife right now).

I stopped watching the child porn - why I don't really remember, but was it a good and ethical reason? Probably not. Fear of getting caught was surely the most important factors. In the years to follow there were only instances in where I looked for videos of underage teenagers, with immense guilt following. Same with trying to visit a sexworker, drunk, despite being morally against it (because many women being victims of abuse in those brothels) and waking up with guilt the next day. It was too late, they were all closed or I didn't have money - but I wanted to.

It turned out being sexually aroused had become something that could override my brain, especially when I was drunk. At around roughly the same time I started to notice the usual signs of consuming too much porn, nothing being able to arouse me anymore. I spent hours of trying to find a video I could get off to. This was present way earlier and of course it was what lead to the consumption of child porn in the first place. But I didn't really make the connection consciously, as far as I remember. That's when I realized I had become addicted and I had to change something - this was way too much time I was spending with this bullshit and I stayed up way too late.

And then came lolicon hentai. (For those who don't know the term, that's anime porn with children or child-like women.) Having watched Hentai since like 13/14 I guess this ... fetish came unusually late, especially considering I had gone through practically everything else in real life porn. Shotacon (if it's a small boy doing it with an adult woman) I watched regularly but mostly because it reminded me of the desires I had as a young male towards grown up women. But the attraction to lolis, as they are called, came and I was starting to watch it and read it in doujins, to jack off.

Suddenly, when I wanted to visit my favorite site to read doujins (that's the comics) I was greeted with a substitute page of the government - that read, that the access to that site is blocked, because it hosts child pornography. ""What the fuck?"", I thought.

Well, turns out that stuff is illegal to possess where I live. Doesn't matter if it's a drawing or not, it's child porn. The legal reasoning for this is supposedly that it may lead to developing desires to harm real children. And the targeted consumption of it (if it can be proven you accessed the material over and over again, so not accidentally) is illegal too.

So of course I felt fear again of being caught but it also felt pretty fucking shit to have something taken away from me that gave me pleasure. I had a choice to make, continuing to read and watch it, despite it being illegal or stopping? I remember going to an alternative site, clicking on a lolicon comic and thinking ""i find this shit hot, sorry. But what's wrong with that?"". I researched about VPNs, the law and constantly debated in my head whether what was the right course of action to take.

This is where the love for reason comes in. It did of course play a role much sooner, but this is the perfect example. When one is good at arguing and making logical deductions, one is able to convince themselves of almost anything. People who suffer from addictions, even people who might be on a diet know how this feels. There are suddenly many veeeery good reasons for why it's actually okay to do this thing and why it's not even immoral or bad, or it's not your fault. And if there's an emotional need for this argument to succeed one can be damn sure your brain is gonna use everything it has in its disposal to convince you. And those arguments won't be as easy to recognize as ""it's just fucking hot"" / ""i want it though, fuck it"". It may be thinking about victimless crimes, how they are treated in society, when the treshold should be to make it illegal and so on. Pretty interesting topic, politically, philosophically ... Everything to convince myself that I could continue doing this. 

So I installed a VPN so I could continue to read lolicon doujinshis. Oh and it's not even a problem or immoral, it's just a drawing. While if it is immoral or not is subjective, the problem was that I was hellbent on justifying my behaviour to myself. The point isn't if consuming lolicon hentai is morally wrong or not, the point is the abnormal reaction to suddenly not being able to do this anymore. Fueling this addiction. I don't know the exact point at which I realized what I was doing and recognized that I had a fucking problem and was doing the exact same thing I've accused so many people of doing in the past and that it needed to stop. Even now I catch myself thinking about how it might be okay to just once in a while ... No.

This had to stop. It was time to fucking follow my own advice and not just fight against an external danger where it's very clear what I have to protect myself from. It's time to do a maybe even harder thing, to overcome an addiction and not listen to superficial arguments I construct in an eerily fast way that try to seduce me into continuing to fuel my addiction.

But even when I cut out those things of my life - pornography, hentai, other harming behaviours - I will always be a person who masturbated to child porn. I won't come back from this, it's a part of my identity and my past. This is something that's almost impossible to face head on - I have to do the best not to see myself as some sad, tragic anti-hero that's redeeming himself, to make it a bit more bearable, to construct an identity I find more comforting ... I'm not someone like that. This isn't some pseudohonourable, edgy bullshit. It's the fucking worst. I'm gonna have to live with that.

But why am I writing this confession? Selfish reasons, of course. I won't lie to you, the idea came to talk this off my chest to maybe feel better afterwards. I stopped halfway through but continued, telling me, if this gets someone to reflect on what they're doing, it's worth it. Was that the true reason? I don't fucking know. Maybe it doesn't matter that much.

&amp;#x200B;

CONCLUSION:

What I urge someone who actually read this (and everyone else) is to reflect honestly on their behaviour. Please don't draw some simplistic, superficial bullshit conclusions from this, like ""porn is always bad"", ""don't go to 4chan ever, it makes you the devil"", ""people who watch lolicons are pedohpiles"", ""escapism should be discouraged"" and so on. This whole topic is a tad bit more complicated than that. In this pandemic, consumption of child porn went way up - most of the consumers aren't pedophiles according to experts, though - just to give an example on how many people seem to be driven to do unethical things to make themselves feel a bit better when they have a shit life. 

No, what I wish for, is that someone who might recognize a bit of themselves in some of what I wrote to hold in and reflect. Yeah, here comes the cliche, but bear with me - if you think you're above this, you are like me. You're not that special, you're not some superhuman, you are vulnerable to making mistakes and developing addictions or behaviours that harm you, too. Don't think yourself impervious - that smart brain of yours might be better than eeeeveryone elses and you kick all their stupid asses in debates, but it can outsmart you just the same. I bet you like science, don't you? And facts. They're calming, everything is either right or wrong, knowing and mastering them makes you better than the others. Well here's some facts for you: you're primarily controlled by your emotions and hormones. You don't have to notice that for it to happen. So get the fuck off your high horse and do the reasonable thing - recognize that you're not as reasonable as you think.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're worried, maybe talk to a friend, or if it's too embarassing, to a stranger about if there's maybe something problematic about the things they do in the internet. But most importantly, ask yourself questions and don't brush them off.

Are you perhaps trying to avoid reality a bit? 

Are you constantly searching for fucked up stuff to look at?

Why?

Has it increased?

Can you truly say that you're comfortable with everything you've done in the internet?

Yes?

Would you be comfortable telling it to someone though?

And when you're asking yourself these questions - do many arguments to support the easy answer come to your mind, suspiciously fast? Almost as if you're feeling a bit guilty and trying to take the blame from you, make excuses for it? Well, maybe (and I say that seriously, it could just be an indicator) there's something going wrong right now. Doesn't have to be hardcore porn, violent videos or other dark things. Could also be alcohol. Or Social Media. Sports. Videogames. Anime. Reading books. Using Reddit. Youtube. Drugs. Visiting sexworkers. Using 4chan. Watching TV. Going to bed too late. Masturbation in general. Using Online Dating platforms. Netflix. Gambling. Smoking. Self-harm. Overusing Newsplatforms. Fast food. Smartphone usage. Shopping. Hooking up. Working. Debating strangers online.

&amp;#x200B;

The list is endless. No, of course not everyone is in immediate danger of doing the same things I did. But everyone, because they are human, is in danger of adopting behaviours that are addicting and damaging. It's just in our brains and new technologies make it easier than ever to get addicted to some things.

I would recommend everyone to educate themselves on the topics of dopamine and social media / the internet and on what porn in general can do to your brain.

Lastly ... the internet is surely one of the most magnificent innovations of mankind. But don't think it doesn't have dangers, because it does - and most of all, recognize, that you're not invulnerable to those dangers.",30Dec2020,1

I just graduated from school and had 3 interviews. All 3 places offered me jobs. I graduated with honors. I barely can get a congrats, actually I don’t think I did. My brother gets a job and gets taken out for dinner. 
I don’t know if it’s just a difference in treating a daughter versus a son or what. My brother thinks it’s because I’ve always succeed where he struggled with school from a young age. Even if that’s true it really effects me the difference in treatment. Just wondering if anyone feels the same.",30Dec2020,1

142," Just a note, I do not want to say everyone but me in video games is toxic. I'm simply saying my experiences.

I  started playing video games on console (including portable ones) when I  was in primary school, and I mostly played alone. Occasionally would  play with some family members but mostly played alone, and I enjoyed it.  Eventually my consoles and games broke and I turned to online gaming  instead, and it has killed my passion for games in general and has made  me weary of trying them and I just end up being bitter after my  experiences in them. The issue is almost never about the game itself  that made me stop playing it, but the community around it.

The  toxicity and the cliquish nature of online video games just makes it  hard to socialise, since the nature of it being online many times demand  socialisation. Maybe it's because I'm naturally a loner but I often get  burnt out on online video games that demand you play with others. I  either have to make it a point to refuse socialisation with people in  games to preserve my sanity (and at that point, I question why do I have  to go at such lengths to make it comfortable) or become burnt out of  the nature of the community of the game and never return again. It makes  it hard to find friends, and I try, but I really never fit in and make  friends I feel comfortable enough to play with, and I end up not finding  anyone and just leaving the game because I'm tired of dealing with  impudent and perverse people and also tired of the ""gg ez"" ""git gud"" etc  nature of online game communities which makes it unbearable to play for  me.

I like video games, but my  experience in online video games has left me very bitter. It makes  trying to find games hard since so many are becoming online these days. I  pretty much now only seek ones that I can play by myself or where I  don't have to interact with anyone except for gameplay in a versus. It  makes me feel like I'm missing out, or just simply am just too  maladjusted to cope with the communities of games I try to play. It  becomes too much of it, and too hard to avoid because of the lack of  friends.",30Dec2020,1
143,"As a kid I was very much an extrovert and loved going out and being around people but now at 21 it almost feels like a task and I avoid people as much as possible.

144,"I've just realized that I can make my face look more symmetrical by slightly moving certain facial muscles in a certain way. I know it sounds weird as fuck, but I have A/B compared pics of myself doing this and without and it's honestly shocking to me how much better I look. I imagine that trying to do this all the time would be incredibly annoying. does anyone actually do this?",30Dec2020,1

Im meeting so many people who are in my eyes unworthy to be living.


They're human but, they're horrible examples of what we can become emphasis on we there because we are the same species as them we are the same type of creature our consciousness' differ that is all. What we believe is right or wrong, good or bad - - they think the opposite and its difficult to coexist alongside them.


Im meeting Alot of people who I really don't need to meet. I don't need to help them I don't need to guide them being a good person does not mean I owe the world anything and I owe you, nothing.


So unless you have a debt I need to pay you for I'm going on my own path now and shutting the gate behind me. Call in the airstrike the fate is fucking gone there isn't even a way to follow me wherest I'm going where you go you won't come back.

Roza.


You don't need people in your life just because someone is a human that doesn't justify their true nature that doesn't make them sacred it doesn't make them holy albeit I am a human but,


Im done. I don't need you. I'm needed elsewhere, for something far more important.


Take your alcohol and your cigarettes and piss them up the fucking wall for all I care I do not walk around with sympathy I do not carry pity if you seek these things you better
