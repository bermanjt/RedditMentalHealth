0,"First excuse my English its not my mother tongue. So I was downtown with my friend and there was that random kpop dance battle or idk, we didn't like kpop but we still went and observe it by curiosity. And there was that guy that both caught our attention. He was extremely hot and danced so well that I eventually fell for him even though I didn't know him. We watched him for like an hour in which he went and kissed his gf lol. So we left and I ended up crying in the bus because of the emotion ig (I could feel my heart beats when seeing him). It was not hard finding his Instagram as a friend of mine knew him and ofc he had like 2k followers, handsome as he was. I also got his gf's ig and during the following week he put smth like a broken heart in his bio that he deleted later but I checked his gf's highlights and the stories in which he appeared were deleted. I concluded that he was no longer in a relationship and I shot my shot a few days later, an hour ago. Now we talked a bit and he was really nice, he is actually 2 years older than me, hes 18 and Im 16 but he didn't mind and honestly me neither 2 years arent that big and tbh I don't necessarily want to be in a relationship w him, I don't have the word for it in english but kiss him++ and all that stuff is enough for me (not necessarily sexual yk). He ended up telling me he was going to sleep but he would have liked to talk more and that we could talk again and all that stuff and WOW I was so happy I couldn't stop smiling and blushing.

Now here's the thing. When I asked for his ig to my friend she told me she was an asshole and from what I heard he raped his ex gf (not the one I talked about, the one before). She told me that the day I saw him for the first so I was happy to find myself reasons to get over it, but I obviously didn't and as she didn't give me more details I didn't put that much importance in that thing and neither did my friends. Now after I started talking to him I went back to my friend and asked her for some details and I told her I dmd him. She laughed and told me that it was a bad idea. The rape is indeed real and his ex is actually a friend of my own friend and there will be a trial soon. Moreover, I learned that he is a narcissistic pervert and that he threatened his ex to not leave him and was putting pictures of her body as a phone wallpaper. You got it, this is the worst fucking person I could get. The thing is, I have a huge crush on him and talking to him strengthen that, and my heart still want to talk him even though I know all that shit. And everyone can warn me about it, I know I'll come back at him. My friend told me he didn't care about girls and had no respect for them but I still know I will come back as if smth was gonna change, because that's my crush and he explicitly agreed to talk with me knowing my purpose. Idk why I do that, I know I shouldn't. If things go further, even though I don't think so, I'm forbidding myself to send any nudes as I know what happened with that other girls. But I know I want to get him so bad. Idk idk why I do that. I'm sorry for his exes and every person he hurt. I am aware that I am stupid for doing that just because I crush on him bc he's pretty and he dances well",01Sep2020,1

6,"You can call yourself whatever the heck you want.  I try to refer to myself as a man. 

This brings up the question, what does being ""a man"" mean to me?  The first thing that comes to mind is being an adult.  

Not taking the easy way out.  Telling the truth, even if it is awkward.  Making the unpopular decision.  Keeping commitments.  Asking for help, because, being a martyr and holding things in is not healthy, and is even the easy way out, in a sense.  Man up, and ask for help when you need it.  People want and need to help you, just like you might want to help them.    


Being embarrassed, and doing the right thing anyway.

It's really not about being macho, hunting, owning a truck, being ripped or those other tropes.  Yes, I   
gained confidence from some physical pursuits, but it is not about that.  


It's more about being kind, understanding, and having unbelievable patience when called for.  I think that is a real manly trait.  Being tenacious, in a quiet way.

I love humor and joking around, but being a man is sometimes knowing when to STFU and not tell that joke.

To be honest, I struggle with this sometimes,and that's OK, because this is an ideal I am working towards.  I fail, and act like a jerk.  But I still will call myself a man.

For those of you who own a dog or grew up with a dog, you know first hand that they're family members. Even if you don't have experience with dogs you can probably still sympathize with that. 

My friend and his siblings are scattered across the states, and so they weren't able to be there in person with the dog. My friend knows I understand what it's like. That's why he asked me to stop by his house this morning and pet him and spend time with him and tell him how loved he his and that he's a good boy (maybe even the best). I was his doggy ambassador. 

He wasn't in any particular pain, he just had bad stomach issues and couldn't eat and was stressed and hyperventilating. I let him lick my face too which he always loves doing. It was his time, unfortunately.

I'm an atheist, but for the sake of my fucking sanity I choose to believe that a special heaven exists for pets, where there's some sort of being that can communicate with them and tell them how much they were loved by their families. 

It's been hard on all of us, especially them, but it's hard on me too in my own way which is why I made an alt to post this catharsis. I grieve fucking hard, for people and for pets.

8,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

9,"*I'm not sure if this is the sub to have a discussion about this but I feel like it would help me a lot if I could figure out IF i'm racist and how to change this mentality.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe in everyone being equal. All people of all races, all educations, and all genders. I strongly believe that I love all lives, even the ignorant. 

The video's we see a lot now a days almost always show people doing the same things.

* People! dying
* People! losing control
* People! running
* People! fearing for their lives
* People! crying
* People! screaming

# People!

but

When I talk about these videos I talk as if giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, or at least I hope I do. I talk about cops ""being forced"" to draw their weapons because the suspect refuses to cooperate. Like if cooperating would fix everything. I talk about how cops are not all bad. I talk about how People! are diversified in education and yet the victims all have one thing in common. I really want to believe that those who know better, do better. I really want to believe that there is hope for change.

I don't feel racist and yet I am more afraid of People! than I am of cops. I don't fear all People! because of their skin color. I fear People! I DON'T KNOW because of the TWO bad encounters I had with ignorant children that were probably trying to take out their anger created elsewhere, on strangers. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and even then I didn't believe that they deserved to be treated the way they are treated in these video's. 

I really need to believe that the real enemy here is ignorance.

Some people are ignorant. Some ignorant people are angry and don't know how else to take care of their anger than by screaming and fighting and making sure others hurt the way that they do. Everyone does what it takes to heard, and this is what I believe Black Lives Matter is about; People! being heard, respected, and treated the same.

Everyone deserves to be heard. 

People! are the ones screaming right now.

Im not proud of this, but I’m so apathetic that no matter how amazing my therapist is, I know I am not going to listen to her advice. I’m not going to put in any effort into making a better life for myself. I just don’t care enough. I don’t know why I’m like this but I know I will nod and agree with her, on an intellectual level, but at the end of the day, it’s too much work. I’d rather just continue to be miserable and stay out of everyone else’s way. 

I don’t have the energy or motivation or will to even try. I don’t care if there’s a known cure for depression. If it requires any effort I’d rather just be depressed. And no matter how much everyone says it’s worth it, I’m just too lazy, exhausted and indifferent to even try to help myself. I know that’s not how I SHOULD think. I know that’s “irrational” and I’m not proud of it. I know it’s my own fault and I do not feel sorry for myself.

Sure I want my life to be different, and I want to be different myself, but not enough to do anything about it. I’m simply too lazy and exhausted. I do have a job as a waitress that I hate but I make enough to eat and sleep and honestly I am okay living on barely any money so even that isn’t motivating me.

I was vivisting a Russian prison for enemies of the state (not a gulag) but i was taken to a place for the worst criminals, or atleast what Russia perceived to be their worst criminals. I was never told what their crimes were.

It was a hexagon shaped room, all cladded in blue tiles, it was surprisingly well lit by natural light, here was a pool in the centre, kind of like the base of a fountain. And round it, were chained prisoners. Each one chained to a cage of rotting meat. Irc, one was connected to a lot of electrodes.

The guard told me, that for the rest of their lives, these prisoners will be tortured for 15 hours a day. Everyday.

The prisoners looked like they'd lost all hope, tired, distraught, completely given up, but they weren't restrained completely, I remember one prisoner looking at me and there was nothing in his eyes I mean mentally, it was like he was looking through me, completely detached from reality.

 Another prisoner was seated, legs crossed with his hands in the prayer 🙏 position and his eyes closed, probably asking whatever God he could for the strength to carry on. 

I remember thinking that if I was in their position, I would rip my own throat out, and i was perplexed that none of the prisoners had done the same.

50,"I'm a fellow liberal, but after I have thoroughly viewed the videos and whatever relating to Kenosha that night I think that Kyle Rittenhouse doesn't actually did anything wrong.

OK. Even if you want me to be very nitpicky towards every incremental aspect of the incident, all I can say is that Rittenhouse just violated the underage gun laws, and that's about it.

Now look at Joseph Rosenbaum. He was seen [provoking anyone](https://twitter.com/HalleyBorderCol/status/1298839381290213376) to ""shoot him"" and of course the ""n-words"" while Rittenhouse was [just RP'ing as a 'good volunteer'](https://twitter.com/MarkDice/status/1299250471069085696) helping wounded people out there, unlike Rosenbaum.

Now Rittenhouse's complaint as a defendant mentioned that a large crowd was chasing him after he stopped (or tried to stop) an arson attempt and that Rosenbaum was stalking him and then tried to rob his gun before Rittenhouse shot back in a panic of self-defense. To be fair I can't say whether this did actually happen or not, but there is [at least one video](https://twitter.com/MarkDice/status/1298756466417864704) and even [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/us/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-shooting-video.html) that correlated to Rittenhouse's claim of events.

Enter Anthony Huber. After the first shot he and others moved towards Rittenhouse and Huber made physical contact with him with a skateboard. According to his claim, Rittenhouse, seeing himself gonna be violently attacked, proceeded to fire self-defense shots that killed Huber.

This would be easily judged as a self-defense case had toxic politics and racial debacle not been involved. Furthermore looking at the nature of these three perps (including by rap sheets) it appears that ironically Rittenhouse is the ""less evil"" amongst the three.

After the deaths of Rosenbaum and Huber, the authorities would remove their records from most publicly searchable databases like pedophile registries as always for anyone who deceased for any reason. I found it incredibly disingenuous that this was used to spin into ""there is no criminal records at the first place"" and all the related banters.

Joseph Rosenbaum was [on the Arizona sex offender registry](https://www.wisconsinrightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rosenbaum.jpg), required to registered for life. According to [this](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/01405.htm) then [this](https://www.edwardspetersen.com/criminal-defense/arizona-sentencing-guidelines/) 10 years would be excessive per Arizona's criminal statue unless the victim in question is below the age of 15. 

That's a perp whom most of you and us will despise of or even wish death of because he's a waste of oxygen and that (you can check /r/inceltear for that as microcosm), and now he's literally asking for it with the unquestionable explicit ""shoot me!"" accompanied by n-words. Not to mention all those accompanying infractions in-jail and out-jail pertaining to assault.

That's a play stupid games, win stupid prizes situation for both Rittenhouse and Huber, the latter also having multiple domestic abuse cases on his rap sheet.
 
I cannot comprehend how our side was so gullible enough to be baited to cling on this alternative fact which would make ""gaslighting"" and ""WTF"" seemed like an understatement. All I want to see now is let the court do its job unperturbed in determining whether self-defense is indeed the case in the incident. This is coming from a liberal. Would you defend them too if instead of Rosenbaum and Huber, there are the Christchurch mosque shooter and Parkland shooter coming menacingly in his way?

Edit: Let's do a thought experiment. Imagine there are two people wants to rob or main you but you have a gun on your hand. You tried running away but you tripped down only to see that they are moving closer and closer. When they are 1 meters away and about to lunge at you what would you do?

And no, downvotes are not a magic wand to wave away the giant elephant in the room, either. Of course it was wrong when George Floyd and Jacob Blake are slain in white-privilege based police brutality, and Rittenhouse is not a saint either as multiple alt-right rants were found in his profile, but in this case I have to be very frank and fair as possible.

2. Found an internship in a foreign company was supposed to become a full-time job but didn't because the company failed to meet the requirement for a visa for a permanent job. So had to move back at the end of the internship

3. Full-time in a foreign country but had to quit because the working condition was terrible. 

4. Finally a great job with good pay and work/life balance. Had to quit because of stupid family reasons.

5. Started job searching but had to stop in the middle because apparently my family is very impatient.

6. Started working as freelancer

7. Now looking for a full-time job again because freelancing didn't worked out for me.

I dread it. I have never been fired but still find myself jobless again and again. I just want to work in a decent place for years. I don't want to go through this nightmare again and again.",01Sep2020,1
53,"I woke up at 5:30am and could not fall back asleep. Once again. I am lucky in that I usually have zero problem falling asleep when I go to bed around 12:30am. But at least twice a week I'll wake up in the middle of the night and my body will just rebel against the idea of going back to sleep. So I'll lie awake disturbing my partners sleep. 

And of course I'll start to get tired enough to fall back asleep right around when I need to get up for work. 

Started taking melatonin when I started having trouble falling asleep too back when the Pandemic was fully developed. Sometimes I feel like it helps me in the middle of the night. Sometimes not. This morning is twice in a row that it did not. Even tried to take an extra 2.5mg right as I'm going to sleep in a hope that it'll help extend out the melatonin's effects. (7.5mg total)

I just hate this. Hate having to trudge through the day extremely tired and low energy, feeling like I can't accomplish anything. Can't accomplish as much as I want to at work. Even lower energy for when I come home to my girlfriend after work. 

Anyone have any good advice that could help me out?",01Sep2020,1

I don't want to destroy my feet and toes and end up with painful deformations, ingrown nails etc. Alternative are minimalist/barefoot shoes but are either ugly or expensive as fuck. I think the problem is that I'm just poor and can't solve that in the short term. Maybe I'll have to embrace pain and possible health issues by using bad shoes.

She wants to finish this relationship and never talk with me. when girlfriend asked ""why?"" she said that  ""he is older than you, he is repeating many years, he is not a doctor, you need to married with a doctor, you can not go to outside of this city, he and his family belittle... etc"" these are some of them. My ex girlfriend didn't say all of them for my not broken.

So why not put that energy into finishing school (only have four more classes till I get my bachelor's like wtf why am I not taking this semester seriously), exercising (wanna fit into a lace dress by New year's and feel sexy), spending more time with my mom and younger siblings rather than being out and coming home at like 3:30am from friends and accomplishing absolutely nothing at all other than regret?

63,"Growing up my parents were incredibly unstable. My bio mom is (finally) diagnosed BDP and my bio dad is an enabler/mildly brain damaged therefore totally brainwashed by BDP mom. When I was 14 my parents forced me out of the house and I had nowhere to go. Wandering the halls at school, a friend asked if I wanted to stay with her. From 14-15 I lived with her parents and her younger brother who I’m still best friends with to this day (15 years later). 

I went to visit foster parents this weekend for the first time in a few years with foster brother and our SO’s. Foster Dad says to me at the time it all went down he was scared to death. They already had two kids, one who was getting into trouble quite a bit (the daughter) and the idea of bringing in another kid who was having trouble was terrifying. What if I was even more trouble? There’s the liability of taking in someone else’s kid. Not to mention my insane parents that came along with me. 

It’s never once occurred to me that the people who took me in would have felt that way but makes total sense now that I’m older and can relate. F-Dad says to me “Aunt C (f-parents sister who knew me since the age of 10) said you were a smart kid, you had so much potential and you needed a family to care for you. She said to take the chance and help out someone who really needed it” so they did and they took me in. 

Since then I had moved back with my parents but was very in and out every few months/weeks, bouncing around on friends couches. At 16/17 got my first basement apartment while in high school. I graduated high school early, went to college (graduated), continued moving around with roommates until I was 21 when I moved in with my fiancé’s parents for 5 years. During that time I saved every penny, paid off my student debt, bought my first rental property for some friends to live in. I continued saving and 4 years ago my fiancé and I bought our first home together. Ive been working the last 8 years in a highly respected role at a major financial institution in Canada. COVID pending I’ll be getting married next year to an amazing man and our dog child will be up there with us. 

I feel like I have so much more respect for these people who took me in as a child. They played such a huge part in my life and I was so unaware at the time. They saw potential in me when my parents left me homeless at 14. It was undoubtedly the hardest point in my life, my parents were cruel, they kicked me out Christmas morning, they called me awful names, told me I’d never find someone that loved me. These people took a huge risk when most people wouldn’t and helped a child with potential. What they did has taught me to be more compassionate, more empathetic and to help others who otherwise wouldn’t have a chance. The fact that I’ve now come so far because of their kindness means to me I can and should pay it forward. I can never repay them, but I can help someone else in need. I hope I can impact someone else’s life they way they impacted mine. They are what amazing parents are and I’m grateful I had them in my life if only for a little bit. I don’t regret my incredibly neglectful parents, they made me stronger and it’s because of their neglect that I found amazing people like foster family. Everything happens for a reason. Every experience has something to gain. I love these people so much. I’m so grateful.",01Sep2020,2

I went to her room and asked her to take me to the hospital bcuz I felt I was gonna die. And she wasn’t even taking me seriously, she took her time, gave me a pill and started screaming at me saying I was faking and being a drama queen. The entire drive to the hospital was torture. She told me she didn’t care if I died that she had other kids. She said I was ruining her life and trying to kill her and even called me demonic. She said she wanted me to leave her house after this ( I did).

But it's not just loneliness, it's sadness too. I don't know why i'm sad. Is it because i'm getting older, growing up and reality hits sometimes?

Well, on Saturday they had a massive fire bigger then my truck, they left with it in full flames at 730 without my knowledge.

81,"(Edit: This isn't me ""vaguebook"" complaining about my own parents. My parents are great.)

A lot of boomer parents I talk to seem to have their heads in the sand regarding the new economic landscape. They seem to think that the age old advice of ""get a degree, get a job"" will still lead to success and security. They measure success by things like homeownership, advocate ""sacrifice"" like forgoing lattes and avocado toast, while ignoring that their kids are struggling with student debt, stagnant wages, and lack of healthcare.

Boomers, please listen to your kids. They're not even kids; the youngest are about 30 years old. They have been adults in this world long enough to know the problems they face, and it is not a lack of gumption or work ethic. Please believe your kids when they say their situation is not their fault. They are facing their third recession on top of a student debt crisis, on top of a pandemic, on top of a civil rights movement, on top of a rising fascist political wave. Some things are actually beyond the control of individuals.

Boomers who have wealth, ask yourself why you built your wealth, and how are you going to use in the next 20 years of life? Turns out, helping your kids (or others through gofundme, micro loans, etc) with emergency expenses or doctors bills or whatever won't make them ""soft,"" it won't make them ""lazy,"" but it might save their lives!

Finally, even if you can't financially help your kids, which really is fine, **at least don't try to gaslight them into thinking they're just snowflakes** **for having a realistic understanding of current events**. The simple of act of believing, commiserating, and understanding a whole generation's struggle and fears will forge a much needed bond between you... and refusing to do so can hurt the relationship beyond repair.",01Sep2020,1

91,"(Using fake names here)

I became close friends with a girl named Sally in high school. I have had mental health issues since childhood (parents divorce, lost my mom to suicide in 4th grade, being split up from my siblings after). In high school I discovered alcohol and started drinking a lot on the weekends with Sally. One bad night, me and her both cheated on our boyfriends. It was with older guys that I've come to realize took advantage of how young and inexperienced we were. Anyways, I eventually find out she's been spreading it around that I cheated, with no mention of her own actions. We had a huge falling out because of this and didn't reconnect until junior year of college.

It's been about 3 years since junior year but this past summer we got really close and hung out with a group of people from our high school a lot. As soon as I showed interest in one of the guys, Sally told me that she had sex with him freshmen year of college. Literally the same day that I told her I was interested in him. Here's the thing- she told me not to say anything because her current boyfriend didn't know, and because that guy is still best friend's with her bf. I knew that Sally had been dating her boyfriend since senior year of high school, so I thought she had cheated, and I thought that was fucked up (I've matured since my high school days and thought she had as well).

I ended up bringing it up to Sally a week later to get the story straight. I told her how I felt about it and she changed her story saying her boyfriend does know about it. I asked if I could bring it up to the guy I had showed interest in because I no longer wanted to pursue him knowing he fucked his best friend's girlfriend. She said yes, then once I did she accused me of trying to break up her and her boyfriend. We had another huge blowout. We made up because we're friends with all the same people, and I gave her the benefit of doubt that her boyfriend did know despite the story changing. Everything seemed cool.

Now, months later this issue has been brought up again by her boyfriend. He's pissed at me and has been pretending to like me since the fight. I asked him if we were cool after the fight and he said yes. But now he's uninviting me from a group trip because he said I never apologized. He also believes I tried to break them up, made things up in my head, and that I had no reason to drop the guy I was into. He thinks I blew the whole thing out of proportion, and I still don't know (or really believe) if he knows the truth.

The worst part about this is that my best friend since 7th grade, Tara, is in the middle of it. Me and her reconnected with Sally together in college. Tara recently started dating one of Sally's boyfriend's best friends, and it's her first relationship. Tara was the one that let me know there was talk of uninviting me, but I found out she lied about the reason why. One of the other guys texted me and said it was fine if I came, and then Sally texted him saying ""we need to talk"". No one was giving me the whole story so I messaged the guys saying I wasn't coming instead of waiting around for them to decide my fate. I was a little sassy, but I told them that I wished they'd talk to me, instead of about me behind my back for months. I called out Sally's boyfriend for holding a grudge and not saying anything about it, then randomly uninviting me and continuing to not say anything. How am I supposed to help solve this when I don't even know it's going on?

Anyways, the guys ended up being very sarcastic and accusing me of things I did not do. I have not heard from Sally once since all of this. But who has? My best friend Tara of course. The night that I sent that message to the guys Sally went over to Tara's after, and posted a snapchat of her dog. In my opinion, to make sure that I knew she was with her first. Me, Sally, and Tara had plans before the fight to hang the next day. The next day comes and I don't hear from either. Eventually I text Tara to ask what she's doing that night and she said she's hanging out with Sally, Sally's boyfriend, and his best friend (the guy I dropped after the first fight). After she had already seen Sally the night before and hadn't even tried to talk to me in person yet. She did. And then she hung out with them the next night too.

I've told her that its making me feel like she's taking their side. I told her it hurts me that she's only made an effort to see them since this has happened. I told her to be wary of Sally's motivations to get so close to her, especially right after the fight. She just keeps telling me that she's still my friend and their friend, and she's sorry if I'm hurt by that.

94,"Before college, I had a decent amount of friends. Most were like acquaintances but still, they were friends. College hit two years ago and I realized that I don’t have many friends as I did before. I lost a toxic friend but gained a wonderful friend name Sarah. We do everything together and we love each other like friends are supposed to and for that, I love her and appreciate her so much. The only thing is, I can’t talk to her about everything that I want to or have normal conversations with her because she has a few medical issues so it’s difficult to talk to her about things sometimes. Which is no big deal because i love her regardless. 

Sometimes I feel very lonely when Sarah or my boyfriend aren’t always with me but I think Im okay without needing them. I’m trying to self care more and think about myself more.. love myself more too I suppose. Maybe that’s why I like to bake alone and do crafts alone too. 

Recently, my boyfriend said I should make more friends because it would be a healthy thing to do and to have. That’s true because I wrap myself in my head a lot and it’s terrible for me. I have a lot of depression and whatnot so having more friends would get me out of that state. It’s just so hard to make friends these days, especially with COVID going on. But even if I don’t have a lot of friends, I’m okay. As long as I am happy with how I am and how life is going, it’s all good. 

I’m not exactly sure why I felt like posting this, probably to see if there are others like me who feel the same way, or maybe how I am going about this is the wrong way to do it. Sorry if this post was pointless but thank you for reading.",01Sep2020,1

Man, what do we even fight about? All that bullshit, all that hating, all that envy and for what? 



Soon as we got something we are afraid someone may take it away.


But ain't nobody take it away if it's rooted in your heart, if you did it out of compassion, of understanding and caring others.



This might just be a dreamers little melody, but I just wish to speak to you, the particular one, sitting there filled with hate and anger.



In one situation we judge in a harsh way, the next we show mercy to others. 



It's all a push and pull and it goes on and on and on.




I don't ask for love, I ask for comprehension that basically, deep down, we just wanna be understood.

99,"Long story short, I've got depression, anxiety disorder, and I often overthink my relationships with people. I often think if people don't text me back, that means that they don't like me or think that I'm annoying, which I found to be pretty common among people like me who spends most of their time on the internet. So I take breaks once in a while to find my balance and get back on track.

One time in the discord server that I had been a part of, I went on a tangent on how I don't feel valued in the community that I helped create. Someone(we'll call him C) thought that it was an attack on the community and someone else(let's call her A) thought it was a personal attack, when in reality I was just ranting on about how I feel worthless and unloved. I got banned for that, and I can see why. I talked in an inappropriate way in an inappropriate time in an inappropriate channel. Banned? Justified. 

Some time later I got back into the server, and A starts to attack me based on the mental struggles that I was having. Leaving the clan, not talking to people, and having suicidal tendencies. Everything was on the table for her. I start to feel uncomfortable. I told her that I kinda felt uncomfy about her using my vulnerabilities as punchlines and all i got was ""So you like to goof around and joke but when it's me I can't? Cute."" as a response. So I apologize and say that it was my fault for ranting in the server, which it really was, I shouldn't have done that. ""Okay""was the response.

A few weeks later she's still doing it. At this point it was just being mean. I didn't like it at all. She types in C's twitch chat that no one confronts her and that everyone runs to someone else to cry about things. That was clearly aimed at me to provoke me. So I got angry. So I dm her about it and ask her wtf is going on and I am confronting her now about the mean things she's said about me and to me. and uh well, i got blocked on discord, ig, phone number. and i got banned in C's chat by A, which i spent over a year in. vip badge and everything. my ban note was ""trash"", which just says that I'm trash. C saw it and didn't do a thing about it. So now I realize my worth to these people. Over a year of friendship gone because of my one misstep that happened only once during all our time together.

So now A says that I'm a piece of shit for using mental illness as an excuse for shitty behavior and pretty much all the homies that i thought were friends agreed with her, even though I've spent almost 2 years with these people and only about a month with A. So now I'm the asshole and pretty much the closest people I have on the internet agrees with her. 

So I cut them off. I don't need ""friends"" who would pull the carpet out from underneath my feet over something I didn't do intentionally. And I certainly don't need someone who won't speak up for me when I clearly don't have equal power in a conversation that was meant to throw me off the boat. I want to live my life now. I'm going to stop living for others' sake only because I wanted their recognition and adoration. All that means naught if I can't receive any love in return. So bye, A and C, and L and D. Have a good time and leave me alone. Thanks.",01Sep2020,1
100,"Yup. I met this guy when I was 13 and he was 15 at the time, we can call him T. (Currently 28F &amp; 30M). We both grew up in church together. I can’t ever forget. The very first time I knew we liked each other. We went to a teens church retreat camping trip one weekend and I remember trying to nap on the couch but not fully asleep yet. And I felt his presence on my face. He was checking to see if I was asleep, which at that moment I didn’t know what to do I remember just thinking to myself to keep my eyes shut and if he kisses me I will die right here right now. I felt all warm inside and happy and I knew I wanted him and the rest was history. 

We started off as friends. Close friends. Hanging out together with church friends, going to the park and playing sports together, hanging out at the park sometimes alone. Then very close friends. When we used to make out and touch each other..a lot. But never to the point of sex because I wanted to be his. Officially. I loved our adventures and our talks about life and the world and stupid shit too. At 14 &amp; him 16, I wanted to be his girlfriend. I was ready. But I wanted the commitment. I wanted to be his in every way. I mean obviously we were young at the time but it was very important to me. I had a certain set of values that I wanted to uphold. A lot of them based off how I was raised and my beliefs. He said he wasn’t ready for a relationship...I was heartbroken for a while and then I moved on to another guy that I worked with. 

I had lost my virginity with him, and things were great. We were together for 2 years. But towards the 2nd year, I started to cheat on him to be with T. T was there for me because he cared about me and wanted to make sure I was good. He made it known that we are good together, we just mesh. That spark. He knew me in ways that my ex didn’t at the time. That ex was not only cheating on me with 3 other girls, he also faked that he had a baby with one of them, for no other reason that he is still a cruel person till this day. I was devastated. But T comforted me, and again I fell for him, this time I was 15/16 and he was 17/18. T had gotten into a bad car accident during the time I was with my ex. I remember feeling very bad about that because I felt like I failed in not being there for him. He went through a lot.. I found out through church friends. I felt guilty for a while. But we reconnected after he got better and we were THE BEST of friends. We were inseparable at that point and did everything together. Oh if I could go back to any of those blissful carefree summers as a teen in the city with just him, some money, and my metrocard...I remember the first time we had sex. It was fucking unimaginable. I knew right then and there that I HAD to be with this guy. Like there’s no way. He checked out in every way. We mentioned to each other that we really wanted to be each other’s firsts.. but glad that we were together when we were. We were really good friends, we meshed so well together as far as our personalities and values, he is tall, hot and funny, and the sex was amazing. He is very smart and a boss and so am I. He was naturally a grounded person,(Taurus), which I was highly attracted to because he would help keep me grounded. I am also a grounded person as well as I was founded with that mentality, and my rising sign is Taurus. As an Aquarian, we tend to be in the air a lot of the time and very sociable, approachable, and fun. His comfort, humbleness, warmth, and kindness was my daily cup of coffee. Exactly what the doctor ordered. He was my home. He was everything I wanted in a boyfriend and more. But again, he said he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship even though we were basically a couple... and again, I was heartbroken. 

Not for very long because then I got with someone else. Whom we started off as friends, and it was great. And then we became something more. We ended up going away for college 5 hours away with 2 other friends that were part of my friend group and we were in different schools but just 45 minutes away from each other so I would see him most weekends. But I didn’t want to be with him because he was wayyy too pussy for me. I just couldn’t be with someone that didn’t have a backbone. I was raised to be independent. I found it very unattractive. Eventually he ended up breaking up with me because someone posted a pic on FB of me dancing with a random guy and accused me of cheating lol. This was a big deal though at 17/18. I was JUST dancing. It was very minor but whatever. I didn’t really want to be with him anyways. He broke up with me and I was 18/19 at the time.

And then T and I reconnected again... and I fell for him again. Since I was still in school upstate our relationship was long distance. We Skyped almost every night and would always sext and talk about how much we missed each other. He visited me only once. I figured it’s because he didn’t want to upset his parents on his whereabouts. I believe he was only in one other relationship that ended after we reconnected that time. According to him it only lasted a couple of months. I’m sure he was dating. But he always comes on to me as a one woman kind of man. And I wanted to be his one and only. We were still young and coming from a Christian background it was always so hard for my mom to let me out of the house. That was the main reason why I decided to go away for school. I was always sneaking around. For the most part I was traveling back home to see him and my family. It was always an adventure. He would sneak me into bars, we would hang out at parks and all over the city. Go out to eat, to the movies. Just us. It was pure bliss. He was 20/21, I was 18/19 at the time. Everything was great. But he ended up breaking up with me again, just a little after my 21st birthday. I was so devastated. I was very hurt. Very very hurt. I had moved back home not only for him, but also because I couldn’t afford the tuition to finish my last year. I knew at that point there had to be something more than him just not being ready to be in a relationship with me. I didn’t know what it was. He was always so closed off he never really opened up to me as much as I wanted him to, (again, Taurus). Because he wouldn’t open up to me, I was always seeking reassurance from him. I just knew that I was in love with him and basically had to force myself to give up on him. And I did for a while. We still kept in contact as I remember still going out and hanging out with him in my early 20’s when I was old enough to get into the bars. I moved out of my mothers and was living with roommates, so that gave us more of a chance to be together. I could be alone in a room with him for hours and it feels like time stands still. We would be together almost every day. Whether it’s going out to a bar, out to eat, to the movies, the park, the world was endless. Time was endless... So I didn’t understand what he was talking about. Eventually he told me that it’s because he didn’t think I was pretty enough to be formally introduced to his family and friends as his girlfriend. I wanted to die. Literally. I was so embarrassed. Humiliated. I couldn’t believe he said that to me. I didn’t talk to him after that. We left off at me punching walls and him telling me I needed help..

At 23 I met my ex fiancé. This relationship was the relationship that solidified the fact that I really am meant to be with T. When I was with my ex fiancé everything was great. I was in love, I found someone that wanted to be with me and didn’t care to show me off to the world and thought I was his muse as he was mine. That’s all I wanted from someone else. That’s all I wanted from T. And I got that from him. So when he proposed I said yes. And I was happy. We were living together, had a dog together, were working on our goals individually and as a couple. But my ex fiancé was possessive and very jealous and didn’t let me do anything other than being with him all the time. At the time I was working and going to school full time. I couldn’t even celebrate my promotion when my managers took me out for drinks without my ex fiancé storming in coming to pick me up as if I am doing something wrong.. I couldn’t handle that. I needed my space. The more he smothered me with his jealous, possessive ways, the more distant and unattracted I was to him.

In the 2nd year in the relationship, I started cheating on my ex fiancé to be with T. Again. He came back into my life after him being in a committed but LDR. That lasted probably about 2 years. I couldn’t help it. Even though I was still in love with my ex fiancé, I still loved him. Deep down I still wanted to be with him and like come on. That’s my baybeeeee. I was wayyy more confident in myself at this time, but I started to lose my confidence with my ex fiancé. With T, it’s like I’m home. He brought out the good parts of me. He apologized for what he had said in the past. We had already grown up a lot at this point. I accepted it and We left it at that. I wanted to be with him but I had to decide if it was worth it. I was truly hurt by what T said to me. But I really loved him. I couldn’t shake the feeling. I couldn’t help it. I was in love with 2 people at the same time. I was at a stand still. Eventually, when I chose T, and left my ex fiancé for good, it was already too late. T had broken my heart by getting with someone else, I found out about it. This was during a time where my ex fiancé and I were living together but broken up, AND for that entire year while we were waiting for the lease to finish, he was with someone else, and me? I was with T. The relationship had died. Me being me though, I loved them both. When T got with someone else we went our separate ways again. I was 25 already. He was 27. He said he couldn’t take me seriously as I was broken up but living together with someone..smh

25-26ish was interesting. I was dating this guy that we reconnected from college days. It was fun and everything was great but AGAIN, I ended up with someone who wasn’t ready to be in a relationship. Soo I ended things after about a year and a half. 

And again. You guessed it. T and I reconnected again. At this time, T was very depressed and anxious. Being 29 with no job still living with your parents must be really rough. Not knowing how to go about doing what you want to do. He wanted me to be there for him. To comfort him. And I did. Because I loved him. I stopped talking to that other guy 2 months prior to T apologizing to me. I had a pregnancy scare, had to get an abortion. It was T’s. I did it not only because I knew we weren’t ready yet, also because I wanted to make sure I had finished school and had my own place with T. He was there for me and supportive through it all. Our relationship was great. I couldn’t wait to move out together with him. We would always talk about the future and how it would be like with us. Our little bubble was perfect. But other aspects were not. Outside of us he was struggling with who he wanted to become. He wanted to be able to provide and it was so hard for him to find a way to get to the right path to start his career. So he started pushing me away. One day, I tripped. Mentally. And that was it. Because I too, was dealing with family problems outside of us. He started pushing me away after that. He started seeking therapy and he was diagnosed with anxiety. And then he broke up with me. And that was last year in September. Since then I have been trying so hard to get back with him. I took time off to seek therapy which is something that I did do before but I stopped going. This time I wanted to make sure that I stuck to it and I have been ever since. I am a completely different person because of it and have grown to understand that sometimes you don’t have all of the answers. But all you can offer is love. But love also can only get you so far. That we should also love with all we got and tell people you love them like it’s your last day.
But with T, he got into a relationship about 4 months after he broke up with me. And he’s been with her since. 

Here comes the hard pill. The flex. 
He said that I never had him and I never will. He never loved me. He was using me and manipulating my emotions to feed his own ego and his own selfish desires. Deep down inside he knew he was using me. He knew he was never going to be able to be the person that I wanted him to be, which is my boyfriend. He knew he was doing harm and wasn’t fair to me so he had to leave. The only satisfying thing was the sex. He never considered us a couple or ever being together. In his mind he was never my boyfriend. He never really cared as long as I was available when it was convenient for him. He doesn’t feel like I would fit into his family. He AGAIN, dosent think that opinion will ever change. And he dosent want to even tell me why. He also thinks I’m a stalker.

So why do I still want to be with him and still have so much hope and faith that he will come back to me? Currently at 28 &amp; 30? Because T is biased, he is basically in the same relationship that I was with my ex fiancé. I learned a lot in that relationship. He has never had a relationship like that. This is the full on learning relationship for him. He will realize one day what he lost. All I ever wanted was to be with him in every way. That’s never going to change for me..And I will keep working on myself until then. I can’t shake this feeling. I am going with my heart. I am still young, and life changes every second of the day. I am very much hurt. But I know this isn’t the end. Long live star crossed lovers. Forever? Forever.",01Sep2020,1

103,"I've been studying Japanese for a few weeks now and it made a bit more aware of my own language (Spanish) and how it'll be if I was in the position of someone trying to learn it.

I'm more aware of how many words we made up, how many times I had to ask my parents what a word means because of lingo and some words that change through generations, how sometimes I ask how to pronounce a word and there's a debate because no one's sure.

You can learn Spanish and think you're fluent but then go to Mexico and realize that we use so much lingo that you don't understand, then go to Argentina and they have a whole new set of lingo, a different accent and now you're lost again.

Also, you'd think being bilingual means your mind has everything organized, but no, your brain just takes everything and throws it there, now you're struggling to speak to someone because you remember the world in Spanish but the person you're talking to speaks English.

People also tend to ask me advice on how to learn another language and honestly, I don't remember, people ask me why you say a word or phrase that way and I don't know, I just know that's how it is but I can't explain why.

109,"Ok so to give a background I am a vegan for 3 years and I have boycotted palm oil as well. Btw palm oil is found in almost 90% of commercial products. So I don't even eat maggi or chips.   
Yes I am on of those tum log ghass phus khate ho. Truth be told Ghar ka khana when made with veggies is vegan. 

Now many would mock veganism so I have deep empathy for animal so those meat eaters coming here to troll please stay out maybe you would learn a thing or two. 

As I said I just have deep empathy so I avoid animal derived product, would I say veganism is healthy answer is yes but subjective as well because maybe my body is also okay committed to the cause. 

What I cannot stand is veganism has becoming a business for high profile,  veganism has been made into a joke by celebrities. People say get almond milk, soya milk and so long heck make your own nut milk at home. I used to buy almond milk it used to be for Rs 350 for 1l and damn its expensive. So I use nut milk on rare occasions I am happy drinking ice tea yes ice tea has a lot of sugar but I am fine with it. I am too lazy too make my own milk and I don't miss any milk based products even sweets so I am good. 

Now these health fads and health lifestyle guru's are kinda promoting the wrong messages about veganism. 

First there is a type which would say you are not supposed to cook even plants and live off seeds. This go nut based lifestyle is again expensive and gives a messages that veganism is for the high class. 
Second those celebs who come out they are not vegan anymore, heck they don't even sound apologetic. I know me being vegan for barely 3 years I may break but when I see people unapologetic is what hurts me. 
Third good health is nothing but business, I see all this oil free,  fat free, gluten free. They are promoting nothing but business. I sometimes feel our poor laborers are more healthy than these health freaks.  Our workforce poor laborers eat normal dal chapati and deliver a lot of man power. What is even healthy? Avoid something so that a person doesn't die, you know that sounds more like a better mouse trap. I am not a expert but I feel any diet when has stuff in moderate quantities if it doesn't effect your reading you should be good. 

Ask any nutrition expert as they willing to visit and give a lecture on healthy food in slums they won't because there is no profits.

See I know veganism is not for all because if you have empathy for animal you can make it work but as I said its not for all and its not possible everywhere. I know people are eating meat because people are eating meat from thousands of years. So to break traditions is just not possible and I respect that. I know I do judge meat eaters but hey I am a vegan so that comes naturally. But again I think humans evolved in places where there was no water vegetation so it was hard to grow crops hence they chose this. My only humble please is try to avoid animal derived products as much as possible. Maybe you haven't realized it lately people eat meat more for the taste and not for health benefits something what kfc and mcdonalds promotes which I hate. If for the sake of argument if you said you need chicken for protein I would say maybe it makes sense, but if you had 3 chicken burgers   and want a 4th one just for the taste this is what I feel is wrong. I even feel bad for those women who keep on buy leather bags after leather shoes and animal tested makeup because they are coco.

     
Now coming to animal welfare, Ohh boy you maybe shocked to hear the things I am about to say. Guys I used to support many charities / ngo. The fact is many ngo's misues your  donations. Heck you may see some posts on your social media asking for donations and someone who feels for animals would gladly donate but I have visited many animal shelters. Some would put a high profile cruelty case and get donations and that donation would not even be used for the actual cause. Btw this is don't by few but according to my numbers its 30% which is still huge. I would come to know a case so I make a google pay donation ask for updates and bam the case is either dead or released within a week. This happen a lot more than you think. 
Guys whenever making donations to any ngo even if its animal related sit on their head ask for updates and if a ngo is not giving timely updates they are full of shit. These ngo's are very smart they take donations because guess what some of us have a heart and we roll out the money and than we get busy and forget about the case. I remember one special case where I was asked to sponsor a  surgery table and pay the rent bills by this ngo so that they would do stuff. Sounds good on paper next thing you know cats died there in the name of neutering and the ngo refused to comment turns out they didn't hire proper vets they hire para vets who are not qualified to neuter. I am still angry because it feels like funding a terrorist. 

Heck there are more fake animal lovers and I feel there are 70% who won't do shit go to social media be a keyboard warrior and buy a breed walla dog to make a fashion statement and than dump them when the vet bills pile up.

Sometimes I respect animal haters at least they are  honest in their feelings, I do need to mention animal haters are not animal haters they are just not comfortable yet to share space with animals because humans have evolved so rapidly animals were forced out what is left in your are struggling. 

Also not every cat or dog needs to be in a shelter, don't think you made its life great by putting them in shealther. Many shelters are very depressing and not well maintained. A animal is better of free.",01Sep2020,1
110,"Hi, so I'm fairly new here. i don't use reddit a lot, though was unsure of where else i could post and felt the need to share something, my ""story"" I suppose, as the past few days have really defeated me. I have had the deep desire to end my life since last Thursday. I feel like I'm holding onto something still, but I feel confused. I feel deeply dissociated. Last week was the 1 year anniversary of my sister's suicide and I had not prepared for it. Unlike her birthday, my birthday, Christmas (UGH don't get me started), I just hadn't mentally prepared for it. I didn't feel like there were any ""nice"" rituals I could do. A birthday is a celebration, where you can cook their favourite meal, watch their favourite shows, etc. But the anniversary of the day they killed themselves? I felt lost. Anyway, I want to share my story and I hope someone will read it. I always thought if i post my entire life story online I would want to do it meticulously so as to try to express my personal experience of this world, but I don't have the strength right now so here goes the lazy version:

Writing about this sort of stuff feels cringey and self-pitying, but I'm gonna go ahead anyway. I have struggled with depression since being 13, when one day my mother kept asking me what was going on with me and I couldn't speak and she kept asking and eventually I burst out in tears and told her I didn't want to be alive anymore. She cried too and said she'd sort out me getting help. She died a few months afterwards and that's when my life really took a turn for the worst. My dad is an emotional cripple; he just can't do feelings and ""softness"" and perhaps because he had never wanted kids in the first place (and neither had my mother, but she gave in to pressure from her mother, that's like an open secret in my family which I consider strange but okay) and his frustration/resentment toward me and my sister was something he did not restrain. I mistakenly came out as gay at my underclass school and was incessantly abused, constant verbal harassment, violence, I had my clothes stolen and pissed on and was abused outside of school grounds. The worst of it was they followed me home claiming they'd tell my dad I was gay (small town) so I often had to wait alone in a field for a few hours so i could be sure that wouldn't happen. When I was 17 I overdosed and ended up in hospital, the staff told me my dad would pick me up the following morning but he never did and I had to walk home. He was deeply distressed and in a rage but for many months after, which I recognise as his way of being upset and concerned and I recognise he was not able to do more, but I felt cheated that he couldn't suppose me like how I would consider a normal person would.

But anyway, I moved on past all that, went to university, left my home country to start a new life abroad. I just never knew what I was doing, I never had the sense of having an emotional core or a true sense of being ""me"". I made a LOT of mistakes. I genuinely had no idea what I was supposed to do in life. The feeling of depression that started when I was 13 never went ever and long story short I ended up on drugs and doing sex work. Eventually I ended up living on the street. As much as I'd felt I'd suffered, that was just too much for me. I admitted myself to detoxification clinic in the psych ward of the local hospital. I spent 3 agonising weeks there, where my sense of reality was shifting in all sorts of directions and the depression that I'd suppressed with the drugs came back with an absolute raging vengeance. The drugs (GHB, diazepam, heroin towards the end and alcohol all the whole way through) had actually done a pretty good job at masking my depression if I'm being honest, but it was a stressful existence where I was constantly considering how much of whatever I needed next and where Id get it from and so on so on and living that sort of life means you will fail to fulfil so many of life's obligations that eventually you life becomes true unsolvable chaos. But i don't want to babble here.

I spent a year with my father in my home town. He was good to let me stay with him, but there was no emotional connection there. I was deeply depressed for around a year and I could not read or write or really think, which was insane as I had thought I knew what depression was, but that exceeded all my expectations in the worst way. But eventually I got a job in a factory and worked enough to earn enough to move abroad again. I continued to struggle with depression, barely managing to function and around a year later my sister, who had been my only true ally in life and the only person I knew that I truly, deeply loved, took her own life. She had been asking to call me the days before, but I hadn't found time. Life being life, I had lost my flat 2 weeks before (that actually wasn't my fault). I moved in with my boyfriend who I am grateful for, but is the epitome of tough love but I had been feeling overwhelmed and EXHAUSTED and didn't make time for my sister. Then comes a call from my father in the middle of the night, we don't call so I immediately knew. After my sister died I was struggling insanely but my boyfriend never relaxed on trying to motivate me, telling me I needed to get my life in order. It took a few months of working overtime and flat searching until I was able to find and afford a place, but that did happen. And that has helped me so much, having my own place. So i am very grateful for that.

But I haven't been able to find the strength to do anything other that the bare basics of life. The absolute requirements. My boyfriend is constantly deeply frustrated with me. He hates that I don't have any friends, that I never go out, and he believes depression is the result of making the wrong choices in life so doesn't really have any sympathy. He doesn't believe mental illness is actually a thing and thinks ""depression"" is something you can never wallow in, i.e not getting up in the morning is never acceptable ever. So I don't use the word around him and try to push myself. I know that he genuinely wants to see me succeed, but I feel that his perspective is so off. He has had his own struggles and I understand that his world view comes from how he has survived and thrived, but ultimately I don't like how he treats me. I see how his friends cringe in embarrassment when he talks me down, but he can't see it. He wanted to leave me during the early months after my sister's death but I always managed to talk him out of it. I can't imagine how I'd survive without him. Despite the bad treatment, I know HE believes he's doing the right thing and to be frank I just can't DEAL with having no one. Which I know is selfish, but I have been trying to improve for my sake and his.

But anyway, back to the matter at hand, the first anniversary of my sister's death has come and I've lost myself. I feel like my sister never even existed, I can't conjure up the idea of her having a presence in this world anymore. My memories feel very vague and I just feel like I don't understand anything anymore. I can barely remember my sister. I read her past instagram posts earlier and I felt like I was caught between two worlds, living in between two dimensions. Ugh. I can't find the right words. But basically I just feel like fucking shit.

And now I don't know what's come over me. I wrote out some notes to family and old friends, which is awkward as I'm not close to anyone anymore, but I felt like I should leave something for someone. I ordered what I'd need to end my life online but I don't feel the sense of peace that I've been feeling these past few days from considering and planning to do it. I don't think I will do it. I think that my mind is taking control of me and playing out this situation for the sense of relief the prospect of dying gives to me. Ultimately I don't think I will be able to do it. For a start I'd feel too much guilt. My father has failed in his role as a parent but I know that he doesn't have the capacity to do more. He's a macho man and a hooligan and never learnt how to enact being an emotional being. My grandma was always an idol of mine and is in her 90s. But I just feel so very, very sick of life. Being born in this time period, in a 1st world country and as an able bodied white male I recognise that I have privileges. But I do feel and have always felt that I despise being me and my earliest memory is of wishing that I could fade away and never have existed, to disappear in a way that wouldn't cause pain to anyone. I don't have that sensation the way I used to back then, but I still wish I could just quietly bow out, like this isn't for me, I don't wanna do it, but without the BANG that suicide causes. Because it brings on a massive bang, I know that after what happened to my beloved sister.

I just tidied up my text so it is readable, but my apologies for the sloppiness. It could flow a lot better. I just felt the need to share this I suppose. I'd appreciate any kind of responses,

""Poptarts or waffles?"" I think to myself.
I chose waffles, but what made me chose the waffles? Did my personal preference tell me to? How did I shape my personality the way it is? Did I chose to like the things I like, or do we all just like the things we like just from the way we're born? Poof, I'm here. I don't know how or why, but I just exist, and everything I am subjective to seeing and knowing exist... I never chose to be born, I never chose the genes I have, the people and environment Im in and the way it affects me.

People say you can become anything you want, do anything you want, and shape your destiny with the power of your free will, but what do you want? What made you want whatever you want, and how do you really know what you really want if you even do want anything?

From my understanding, we are all biological machines just living within the illusion that we have control. But often thinking of the illusion makes you slip and fall, so I guess I should just quit thinking and become immersed in this world again.",01Sep2020,1

I'm upset at r /tarot. It's an extremely unpleasant place where m o d s act like they're in middle school and abuse their power.

Let me relay my story: When I first joined, I had hoped to become a part of a community that could help me to learn tarot. I had hoped that I could grow in my understanding of tarot by discussing ideas and sharing interpretations.

'Lo and behold, there is a list of rules in sharing interpretations. My first two posts were taken down about an hour after I posted. I realized that I may not have followed site rules, so let it go and decided to do better next time.

I posted another interpretation/spread today, like I had seen SO MANY other users there do. Many, many people take pictures of their spread, write titles not even as informative as mine (e.g. ""Look what I got today""), and usually include in a comment info about the deck, their interpretations, etc.

Well mine was taken down within 20 minutes. It was so fast. I realized that within that span I was still writing my comment to include required information. I had to go through the trouble of asking that my post not be deleted.

Upset about my experience (since I had seen SO MANY posts just like mine or worse going up and nothing happening), I posted a complaint. What happened was... jaw dropping.

No sooner had I posted, my post was \*immediately\* taken down under the false accusation of discriminating against other users (what?!). I then was told that ""we won't hesitate to ban you"" for ""stirring up shit"" when actually I was relaying a disheartening experience. I then told them that the way they responded to an unhappy user was inappropriate, and I was then told something to the equivalent of ""WeLl LoOk At yOu.""

I don't recommend this PoS sub to anyone. Find a forum, hopefully one where there aren't teenagers running the site.

I reported the place for abuse of power, and blocked all participating m o d s and the sub itself. I can't believe that a complaint about m o d e r a t i o n resulted in a threat to ban and impinging on my freedom of speech; that's disgusting.

I am quitting reddit for not better enforcing that users should be able to complain about m o d e r a t i o n in subreddits, and even their own subreddits.

119,"tl;dr: After my grandfathers funeral, I wept in the arms of a tailor who was taking my measurements.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to share a beautiful encounter I had after the death of my grandfather a few months ago. 

Backstory: My last name is O'Neil

My paternal grandfather was 86 and going strong. One Sunday, he was walking down the steps at his church, forgot something in the car, turned around on the stairs, lost his balance, and then fell and hit his head on the brick steps. That day, after being brought to the hospital, he was conscious and lucid enough to recognize and have conversations with everyone who came to visit him. A day later, I went to visit him and he was completely changed. He was in and out of consciousness and didn't know why he was in the hospital...which made him irritated and a little bit grumpy. A week later, he died from his injuries. He was the best man I had ever known and I miss him like crazy.

Ten days later we had his funeral, which was beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. As per his - very vocal - requests over the years, we had bagpipers for the funeral service and for the burial. As it happened, after the funeral and luncheon, I had to go get a suit fitted for a wedding I was going to be in. I walked into the tailor shop, wearing my funeral attire. The tailor who took my measurements knew my last name from my appointment and he asked me, 

""Do you know that the O'Neils (Uí Néill) were some of the greatest kings in the history of Ireland?""

I told him that my grandfather had studied history and our ancestry and that he made sure I knew about our family's history. We then had this brief conversation,

Tailor: ""So what's with the formal wear?""

Me: ""I actually just came from a funeral.""

T: ""If you don't mind, can I ask who the funeral was for?""

M: ""Oh that's fine. It was actually my grandfather's funeral.""

T: ""Grandpa O'Neil?""

M: ""...Yeah.""

T: ""Was he one of the great O'Neils?""

M: (choking up and starting to cry) ""Yes. Yes he was.""

T: ""Dude, bring it in.""

I turned around with a questioning look in my eyes, like I was saying, *Are you implying we hug?* He audibly said, 

""Yeah, dude. You need a hug."" 

So I gave him a big hug and then I started to weep uncontrollably. There we were. Two bearded strangers sharing a moment. He grabbed a pocket square from a shelf and started to wipe the tears from my eyes, all the while saying softly, 

""Let it out man. Let it out. He knows you loved him, and he knows you miss him."" 

After a few minutes, I composed myself and we just went back to the measuring and fitting. People may have walked past, I wouldn't have noticed. After our fitting was done, I went to leave. I turned around and started to apologize, but he interrupted me and said, 

""Don't apologize. Men feel. We are told to hide them, but we need to embrace our emotions. 

I came back a few weeks later to pick up my suit and he was working that day. I walked in and right away he asked if I needed another hug. I told him that I was alright, but I appreciated his offer. 

Men, don't be afraid to share, feel, and embrace your emotions. And don't be afraid to meet someone where they are if they need a hug or a shoulder to cry on...even in the middle of a tailor shop.",01Sep2020,1

She was very childish and happy, but had some issues 

She had a mental disability and our school didn’t really seem to accommodate to her needs 

She would frequently have trouble with work and whenever she would get stressed she’d have a meltdown, the teachers didn’t do anything about it except stare and ridicule her, I remember she shouted out that she wanted to jump off a bridge (keep in mind this was a child), she wanted someone to talk to but the teachers refused to let anyone engage with her or discuss her feelings (claiming that it was a way to get out of trouble) she constantly wanted her mom but the teachers just laughed

128,"Weird title and I honestly don't know how to put it, but every day I feel like I'm not really in this world. I operate normally and do tasks at work, at home, play games to chill, search for problems in my car. You know, the basic stuff. I can do this, but I think I'm doing it on sort of pilot mode. I can analyze problems, but I don't feel like I'm doing it consciously. Month ago I bought myself some CBD. Before playing a game I smoked it and at one part in time, that lasted 10 seconds maybe, I've felt like I entered a different state of mind. I was somehow wholly engulfed in what was happening on the screen. I really don't know how to describe it other than a different state of mind and feeling very focus'y like. I think I feel this way since being 16, if not more, so that would be 4 years already. I think CBD somewhat slows me down a little and makes me able to (at least very slightly) be more present. I'm sorry, I didn't clarify what I mean by being present. I think it has correlation to that focus state, cause when I try really hard to (spoiler, it works in 5% at best), focus on, let's say, what I'm writing now ,I somehow feel more present. More present of my body, where its limbs are, of the rain outside the window, of my PC humming. It doesn't last long however, multiple seconds and it's back to that ""watching"" state.   
Don't know if it's important but through ages 15-19 I had some depressive issues. I'm pretty sure I have r/SDAM along with r/Aphantasia. It's weird, You would think that not being able to recollect memories would make me live in the moment, but it makes me live THROUGH the moment, not IN the moment, as basically (once again, I think) I produce no memories due to no focus and I can't recollect memories cause I couldn't focus in the first place.   
I'm sorry if this post is a mess, as I'm a tad tired. If You have any idea, even the stupidiest, please share. It feels like I'm living as a vessel (not necessarily bad, I mean I've accepted it, but if it can be better, I would take that).  
I have looked at dissociative disorders and didn't find one that matched me, so it's probably not that. I suspect I may, MAY, have ADHD, but I'm not sure and even if I do, the symptoms have probably subsided a little (or my brain enters that ""piloting"" state to dampen the symptoms idk).  
If it's a bad post for my topic, please remove and point me to other, more relevant suitable subs.  
I have also posted this on r/NoStupidQuestions.",01Sep2020,1

131,"After 26 years I finally decided that I should really look inward and figure out who I am. What am I doing with my life? What really makes me happy? Why am I incapable of showing emotion? It's been almost 20 years since my parents' divorce which I like to believe is the root of most of my personality downfalls. But after so long you'd think I'd be mature enough to realize that I need to fix these problems, I can no longer use the excuse ""oh I'm like this because my parents didn't love each other, so I don't know how to love"". My mother, bless her soul, is an absolute saint. She loves so deeply and cares so much about everyone. It boggles my mind how she has the mental fortitude to do it. My father on the other hand, I'm not entirely sure he even cares about his own sons (my parents had three boys). They had 50/50 custody so every other day we would be at my dad's house, which is a pig sty, and he would literally fall asleep on the couch every day we were there. Those are my childhood memories of my father, waking him up when it was time for him to take my back to my mother's house. I'm afraid I have more of my father in me than I do my mother, but I truly believe I have both of their personalities in me and I really want to dig deep and find my mother's. I'm just not sure how to go about doing this.
