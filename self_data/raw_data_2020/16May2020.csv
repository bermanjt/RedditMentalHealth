2,"I'm not the most punctual individual out there, but it's not like I don't care about tardiness.

There just were several cases such as the train station I take to work having issues and closes down indefinitely and commute just being a pain in the ass especially during holidays and inclement weather. I live about 10 km from work and live in a city where being stuck in traffic jams is normal. But with that distance, the ETA is always jumpy - like I could arrive an hour and a half early, or 30 mins late.   
I'd been planning to move nearer to work but the pandemic has paused that issue for now.

I did have a couple of cases of sleeping in and not hearing my alarm clock. Today was one of the 2 instances that I was late because of it. It had both happened on a rainy day and my phone's speaker is faced down on the bed unnoticed. Even after picking a really loud alarm tone (though lately I changed it to mild because I started waking up before my alarm anyway and the loud noise gives me a crappy mood). It's embarrassing to have my supervisor to have to call me to wake up - twice now. I even missed a team meeting. 

I already have a record of making lots of work mistakes, and this kind of incidence hardly helps. I'm worried that my colleagues' opinion of me is worsening each week. I never thought I'd be the kind of person who f's up a lot and is late to work lots of times, not to mention quiet and awkward.

What's infuriating the most is that after all this, I'm still sleepy af.",16May2020,1
3,"My best friend in convinced that she has no purpose in life and she is 100% ready to die. Please, anyone that can offer help to help me help her find purpose and happiness in her life, PLEASE let me know. I've been doing the best I can to help her, and I swear if she dies then I wont be able to keep on living",16May2020,2
4,"I’m not going to lie. I was struggling. 

I grew up with.... a complicated family. I live in the US but I wasn’t born here. I didn’t get to have my loving family nearby. And the family I had was very different and I got lost in the cracks while my parents worked very hard to make a life here. 

I got into partying early. I looked for love everywhere I could - food, drugs, my friends families, parties, the internet. I was a very pretty girl in high school but no one could tell because I was obese, and hoped to hide it with goth attire. 

I thought I was special. That I just needed to get away from my current life and people would see that. What followed was flunking out of college, some morally horrid decisions, treating friends and family like shit, moving around A LOT. 

Nine years ago I met one of my best friends when living on the coast. This person became the greatest victim of my personal issues. I dumped all my emotional issues and problems on him. And he took it because he is a legitimately good person, only briefly shutting down the friendship when I got so out of control with my clubbing and drinking that it was impossible to deal with my mood swings. 

Unfortunately, I figured out how to make a lot of money with my looks. This sent me on a journey where my priorities were fake nails, eyelashes, hair extensions, fake tans, clothes, designer bags, lots of clubs, lots of partying. My friends were all really gorgeous girls and we did nothing but complain about stuff and judge others loosely. And then complain some more because we felt we were being somehow wronged in this make belief world we were living in. All any of us wanted was this perfect guy who was really hot and had money and was spiritually amazing and somehow obsessed with us enough not to ever cheat or make us feel insecure. He of course was not real.

In 2017 I tried to commit suicide after an Instagram model gave me an STD and proceeded to degrade me and try to ruin my reputation. 

I wasn’t successful. Instead I took a solo trip to Hawaii to soul search. It was raining the whole time and I hated it.

Upon returning I decided I was going to get better. And if I couldn’t get better I was going to end it, but for real. With no room for error.

So I started therapy. I paid out of pocket with no insurance. I drove 2 hours away for my weekly appointments. I started attending AA. I started eating better and going to the gym again. 

I moved out of my old apartment and into a new one without roommates. I bought a new car and new furniture. I created a home around me instead of a temporary living situation.

I talked to my grandma more.

It took about two years for me to feel okay. Since then I’ve had two major times where the suicidal thoughts came back. I haven’t been back to the club scene. I haven’t been in contact with those same friends. I haven’t done drugs.

I’ve had lots of heartbreak during this whole time that I don’t feel the need to mention. There was always something wrong with the relationship and I felt like I wasn’t good enough and blah blah. I blamed myself. I got ghosted. I got cheated on. I moved on.

About a year and a half ago after a series of unsuccessful first dates, I met a paramedic off Tinder who agreed to go with me to see the Nutcracker around Christmas as a first date. I proceeded to get food poisoning from romaine lettuce and puking for 14 hours, 15 minutes into the play. He stuck by me the entire time, despite having to be at work for a 12 hour shift the next day. Counted that as an L, shit happens, moving on.

But he texted me to grab breakfast the next day. And we have been together ever since.

He is the love of my life. A man who has treated me fairly and lovingly. He doesn’t always have all the right things to say, he gets irritable and cold sometimes, but he has loved me without question since the very beginning, and I him. We moved in together after seven months of dating. We are now at a year and a half. 

Lately, and in the past, we like any couple have gone through rough patches. Recently it was particularly bad. I blamed him, got angry, and left to my parents for a few days. It’s a 10 hour drive each way. I kept trying to figure out why I am so neurotic. Why I am so volatile and why can I not just be okay with being loved. Why am I the way I am? I went and did the right things. I got therapy. I got a hold of my drinking. I started school again. 

I was listening to an audiobook called Boundaries. And that book changed my life on the drive.

It suddenly became clear to me that most of my personality flaws stem from this stupid easy concept. I have zero boundaries. I don’t respect other people’s boundaries. I don’t enforce my own. 

So I started putting work in. 
Had the tough talks.
Tried to make peace with my family. 
Tried to make peace with religion and God (something I’ve had a stick up my ass about since I was young)

And for the first time in a long time..... I feel okay. Truly okay. 

If this relationship ends, I’ll be okay. 
If my best friend doesn’t speak to me again, I’ll be okay. 
If I have to move away from this city I love, I’ll be okay. 

I no longer have anything fake on my body, if you don’t count tattoos. My hair is shorter and it’s natural color (mousey brown it’s gross I assure you.) I don’t have the designer stuff and I had to file bankruptcy recently to settle up past credit card debt. I gave up everything to make myself okay. And this is the first time I feel it. This is the first time I’ve respected myself. 

Don’t get me wrong. I’m not in the shape I want to be in. I still have a ways to go until I get my degree. But these are things to work on and fight for. 

I don’t know why I felt the need to write this out, but I wanted it to be written somewhere. 

It gets better. 

You just have to try and really make it better.",16May2020,1
5,"I understand that I’ve been fortunate enough to be working in an industry that is currently still deemed as essential and also have the ability to work from home. Our company, based in Los Angeles, has been working from home since mid March, and we have about 2-300 people in the office usually. 

However, this week they’re starting to discuss how to slowly bring the employees back into the office. They’ve included that they will continue working from home where applicable, follow the state guidelines, and provide PPE. 

A lot of my coworkers that I’ve talked to actually enjoy WFH and feel that WFH is working for them, which is the feeling I share as well. But I know that isn’t the case for my direct manager, who doesn’t like WFH, citing reasons such as difficult communication/meetings and such. I know he doesn’t take the coronavirus seriously because he’s still unnecessarily going to places that are open just to “get some fresh air”. He also believes that the stay-at-home order and all the closing of non essential businesses are too much, so I’m pretty positive that he’s going to make us come into the office whenever possible. 

I’m pretty young so I don’t belong to the high-risk group and I live by myself so I don’t have anyone to possibly spread the virus to. But still, with that many people in an office setting, a lot of whom I have no idea if they’re adhering to the social distancing guidelines, etc. I don’t know if I am being selfish but I’ve literally been staying home other than groceries for the past two months. I am also getting all my work done while working from home, so I see no reason why I should be going back to the office this early. Do I have a case in telling my boss that I would like to continue working from home if they do in fact make us report back to the office?",16May2020,1
6,"A couple years ago, I lived in an apartment with three friends of mine as we all went to the same college. Two of us four brought a ton of cool stuff, people, and general social stuff to the place. I could sit out in my living room and smoke weed and drink booze with my friends. Even at the time I was living there, I knew I would never again live in a place as cool or as fun as that for the rest of my life. 

But it still sucked. My friends liked me enough but never actually respected me- partially my fault, I should've been a more effective person and shouldn't have led a life that engendered that disrespect. They went behind my back to plan to live without me the following year. (Didn't end up happening with them at least, but what matters is that they seriously tried.) It was the best time I've had in my life but it still sucked. I still didn't have any respect, just a higher degree of freedom. 

Months ago, I was talking with one of my old friends/roommates, and casually mentioned how that year was ""as good as it gets"". His response, equally casually? ""Not even close."" 

My life is way, way worse now. I didn't even graduate. My own fault, yeah. School makes me sick. Too bad I'm unmotivated and getting dumber by the day.",16May2020,1

Currently waiting to pick up at the pharmacy and normally they’re really fast (you get shorter wait if you come in uniform so I would usually just come in my lunch break) I came in, checked in and thought it was taking a while, felt like forever and checked my watch at it had barely been 10 min lmfao",16May2020,1

I've mentioned this to them (which was awful in itself, I hate talking about that sort of stuff) and they clearly didnt care, telling me to put headphones in. They don't seem to care that I'd rather be sleeping than laying awake with my headphones in at 3am when I have an exam or college at 8:30. However, when they're trying to sleep, it's an entirely different story. Any remotely loud noise, even just something being accidentally dropped results in me being shouted at. I honestly cant wait until I can afford to leave and get my own home, but that will be at least 3 years. I have a weekend job nut I hardly earn enough to buy myself lunch twice a week.

15," 

Hi, I am worried I am possibly becoming a sociopath for several reasons. Here is why;

Possible reasons WHY I could be a sociopath:

1. I  have low empathy, I can't cry at sad scenes in TV shows and movies and  used to brag about it nor can I feel what another person is feeling.
2. At  some point in 2018, I used to use a shock collar to punish my dog when  he got in trouble, and sometimes it caused him to run so I used twice. I  didn't intend to hurt him though, nor did I realize what I was doing.  But I never felt regret or remorse till now.
3. I have low remorse, I cannot feel bad for some of the bad things I did(lying, bad scores, and using darknet forums)
4. I  get unwanted violent thoughts about torturing animals or killing  them.(I hate them and I want them gone and hopefully will NEVER act on  them). I do want these thoughts permanently gone.
5. I  used to be angry and somewhat violent when mad, I would plan on killing  myself or shooting up my school(not to kill anyone though, just shoot  in the air and let security guards stop me) or hit my brother really  hard.( This all stopped though)
6. When  I listened to black metal, because I was drawn to it's ""evilness"" and  thought it was cool, I tend to imagining me burning a church because  Mayhem and Varg Vikernes did it and I thought it was ""cool"" and ""evil"",  this thinking only happened when I listened to normal black metal and I  never acted on it.
7. I used to be a MASSIVE LIAR and lying would be a impulse when I got in trouble.
8. I am very impulsive at times.
9. I  am not social, when I can be able to talk to others, I simply don't but  I do talk to my brother a lot on a daily basis and defend him.
10. I got bullied frequently.(The cause of the suicidal thoughts and school shooting thoughts.)
11. My mother and a teacher possibly mentally abused me at one point, for silly reasons.
12. I feel I am unable to love, though I feel close to my brother and don't want him gone. I want to love though.

Reasons why I could NOT be a sociopath:

1. I  have high compassion.(I tend to feel a urge to hug anything sad,  especially anime cats) This compassion tends to fluctuate at times  though, to the point I practice compassion by imagining a crying anime  cat and I feel immense pity for ""it"" and hug the pillow to nothing at  times.
2. I  might have empathy.(Yesterday when doing work, I seen a picture of a  bird from a oil spill and thought about how scared and sad it was and  wanted to cry, or felt the urge too along with hugging it and I imagined  a crying cat when practicing compassion and also felt sad too.)
3. I  might have remorse.(When I was 11, I yelled at my bird for biting me,  and I scared it I began crying for 5+ minutes apologizing to it, kissing  it, and petting it. I recently felt regret for masturbating to  questionable material and using the shock collar on my dog at one  point.)
4. I am very loving towards animals.(To the point I kiss them, pet them, lay beside them, hug them etc.)
5. I am not lying much anymore.
6. I am not manipulative or cunning, nor am I pleasant and charming.
7. I  am calm and gentle now.(I don't hit anyone, when I get mad it is only  for a moment and rarely it is possible for someone to anger me).
8. I can keep relationships for 1-2 months.
9. When my puppy and great grandmother died, I was really upset for a few days to a week.
10. When I see strangers(especially older people and children), I wave hi to them or let them pet my dog.
11. I hate the violent thoughts I get and want them GONE! They are frustrating me and I dislike them.
12. When I seen something about the recent shooting of that african american man, I felt sad.
13. I  got scared and couldn't sleep after reading about some criminals,  fearing they would get me or their crimes flashed in my mind and it  scared me.
14. I wanted to be a police detective at one point because of Law and Order, NCIS, and Criminal Minds.
15. Other's suffering isn't funny to me, and I don't watch murder videos nor do I want too as I might get scared by them.
16. I  have low self-esteem and don't think i'm the best or important, I think  I need help and want to change. I am not egotistical and I am the one  who ends up apologizing.
17. I  am not intelligent, I am too lazy to get good grades and work hard on  my school work. I am terrible at math and am almost unable to pass it  and get a good grade and am currently failing english.
18. I am a pescetarian meaning I don't eat beef from mammals or meat from birds. I only eat seafood, rice, fruits, vegetables, etc.

What could this be? I **refuse**  to be a sociopath or psychopath, and I never want to be one. I am  wanting to develop empathy, love, and remorse... yet I feel if I am a  sociopath or psychopath, that is not possible. I don't want to ever harm  others and I want help, yet I am too scared to tell my parents about  the thoughts and I've considered going to a psychward.

16,"Hi, sorry if this sounds offensive or inappropriate, I am from Australia and I have never met a black person or African American unfortunately so I am quite ignorant to the culture.

Is the way of speaking depicted in the game accurate to what it is in real life in America? Thank you",16May2020,1
17,"the way it all went down honestly broke my heart, but we stayed friends, even though he ghosted me for a bit after it, which is when I needed him most...nope he stayed away until he needed me. So I ended up falling deep into depression, still in the same state but oh well.

And now we're here, he's not around right now due to not having internet, and he won't have it for a few weeks, and this sucks because we was just starting to get close again.... and today, I did a dumbass thing, I looked at everyone he follows, a seen he's following a few women now who have ""fitness pages"", you know, the kind where they post picture of themselves pretty much naked to show off their body. And the thing? I'm not exactly ""fit"", like, i'm not fat, but i'm a little bit pot-gutted, and I have been for a bit now, though I was trying to get into shape, and while he never told me not to do it, and did always tell me that he didn't think I needed too, he said he loved my body the way it was.

Which i'm now thinking was fucking bullshit. Cause he likes fit girls, he's made a few comments on women's body while we would watch movies together like ""OMG SHE'S FIT!"", or once a guy turned a girl down and he came off with ""He's such an idiot, look at her! nobody would turn down a body like that, i'm triggered"". So with that, and the fact that I know he uses those other girls photos to wank to, Yeah, i'm really thinking he actually didn't like my body.

Now I have a plan, i'm gonna work my ass off to get as fit as those other girls, which I stopped trying to do because of depression, i'm going to start that back up, and when I get fit, he's gonna see that, and I hope he wants me back, and if he does, he'll find that he can't have me now, cause he fucking hurt me, my world fell apart and even now things aren't good, he put me through hell.

I don't know if this would be called ""revenge"" of some sort, but it's gonna fuel me to finally get this done. If everyone has read this, thank you, i'm kinda just venting it and I know it's long, but yeah. Thank you all and I hope you're all doing well",16May2020,1

I pushed past it and finally found medication that allowed me to function as normal as possible and got into a fairly good college. It took me 5 years instead of 4 since I had to transfer but I did it. After almost failing out of high school since I could barely attend, I graduated college with the highest of honors.

I have $133k saved up currently from an early investment in Bitcoin, but I am planning to save more form the work that I am still able to do (Doordash, Postmates, Part time Office work) to Invest in a fourplex to build passive income so that I don't have to worry about working in case I deteriorate further to the point of not being able to work at all.

My girlfriend is very supportive as she has the same illness and tells me that I'm doing the best that I can, but I can't help feeling like a huge failure and a disappointment to everyone around me. 

Am I a loser? or am I just being too hard on myself for something that's ""Out of my control"" as my girlfriend says.

Which I had not opened nor opened the curtains of in many many months, but now I’m hot and craving fresh air so I opened my curtains and window today and remembered why I had them shut. 

We live in an apartment fairly close to another building and my window looks directly into this other apartments window. Honestly 13 year old me would be so let down by the fact that I had the plot to a bad ya novel thrown into my lap and I didn’t take full advantage of my obvious storyline destined to fall in love with the stranger through the window. 

Alas the person that lives there and I are both adults and keep our curtains closed fairly regularly and I never catch them inside the apartment and they never catch me inside mine and now I’m disappointed that I didn’t fall in love with the boy/girl next door that shares a window with me.

54,"Oh man.. I don't even know where to start. I actually have this problem. And if i don't do something about it i might ruin myself for good. I'll try to describe it to the best of my ability but i think in the best way to describe it i just have to say that it's my mentality, lack of self respect, lack of trust in the people that i love.
I'm nearly 21 years old. I'm unemployed and i don't study anywhere i live at my parents house. I have only finished high-school like 2-3 years ago (its a bit hard for me to track time) I've been to some jobs on and off and I've tried studying too. Quit studying after half a year because it wasn't meant for me i knew that. Quit my job later on too. And since then i haven't been able to get back to one. Once i came to apply and i was scared but i didn't show it to anyone. I was scared so bad actually because the job was really hard and i thought i might not be able to do it right. So i ran away from home with my car and just tried to escape. In fact i planned on never returning. And just killing myself because i don't want to disappoint anyone so much anymore. But I'm afraid to do that so i ended up getting back. I've been to 3 psychologists 1 psychotherapist. And a neurologist i think (because it's the the only available psychologist-like person that might help me) so i had taken medication a year or 2 back. I'm so afraid to apply for a job now. I just keep looking at work ads.. But I'm afraid to commit to one and actually start doing something with my life. Same goes for studying. I feel like I'll quit again and just waste my, my parents' time and will..

I have a girlfriend actually. And I've known her for more than 2 months now. We are dating since May 2nd. And i have had a lot of trouble with relationships in the past too. I have no idea why am i like that. But on Thursday.. I went to see her (she lives like an hour drive from me) which is quite far considering that my car is not that fuel economic, and that i rely on my parents for money. And that day was going great but we got to spend a little less time than usual. Since i don't come to her as often as i would like.. I felt bummed out coming back home. And it actually felt really sad for me. It burned my chest and i almost cried (i used to cry a lot, but now it's usually numbness so it's weird that i did) i realized that instead of loving her. I'm actually obsessed.. Because it scares me that I'm going to lose her. I have no reason to think that. It's all in my head. As most of my problems are. But i do not know how to deal with them. Yesterday i kept feeling even worse... I wasn't productive at all. I was alone in the house. Didn't go anywhere. Watched the Office for the entire day.. I kept feeling worse. And i felt like no one to talk to. Because most of my friends don't care. I talked to the friends that do care or can still listen to me.. And i don't feel better. I think I'm slowly losing my girlfriend because she'll soon realize how hard it is to actually stand me. She likes me very much actually.. And she's the nicest and she's beautiful and i couldn't stand losing her. I've been thinking a lot about suicide.. But I'm too afraid.. I don't know what to do.. I know that i have to change my mentality, i have to do something about myself so i could actually love myself instead of hating. But i don't know what to do to make this happen. I have 0 energy 0 motivation 0 self-respect. I'm embarrassed by the way i am.

Some guy with a few years over 30 mentioned he was missing a big part of his life because he couldn't interact with people
I'm 24 and in some form feel the same.
I don't have any problems having conversations with people, be it online or IRL, the way I interact with people is through humour, which leads in some way to people not taking me seriously, I think, but it is my way of communicating and so far I think I don't have a bad relationship with no one, but this is because I really don't have relationships. I have friends, who lasted years, with whom I discussed deep thoughts and feelings, but I usually distance myself for months without noticing the differences.. When I see them again is when I realize I haven't spoke to them in month or more, and these are people I truly care about. 

Romantic relationships? None. Well two attempts but I can't get past a few days because I back up or It's obvious that I don't know how to treat people in the context of a relationship
In some way I don't feel pressured to have a partner now, but at the same time I do need the affection of someone, I think. This leads me to think how maybe I'm looking for approval... But I can't seem to find where does that need come from... 
But I think I'm not a potentially good partner, I see in myself some selfish behaviour and when I question myself about it... I'm not sure I would care enough for a girlfriend and her personal problems, I would probably ignore them. This is actually one of the reasons I distanced from one of my friends with who we always kinda go back to say ""let's see if it works put"" for me to just walk out a few days later cause she already has enough problems and responsibilities to take another one.

The interesting part is that... I don't  think I want to change, and I know what I have to fix about me... But I don't, because I don't want to give my time to no one... But I be haven't been using it.. I just sit there and watch life pass.
I do have a small project, thanks to which I've got a small audience and it is rewarding, and I like doing that... But I fell... Tired

I first experienced it my first time smoking marijuana, it was the most terrifying experience of my entire life and it has been a reoccurring thing since.

I know that it’s in my head and that it will be okay, but it still takes a toll on my mental health.

Look, I get we need to keep transmission down. And if you are sick, you shouldn't see anyone. But when I go to the grocery store, I am in contact with the lingering germs from hundreds of people. If I get take out that's another 5-10 people. And that's ok. If we want to talk numbers to remain scientific, why is it so unacceptable to see one or two more people? 

We are social beings. When did we decide that human contact is not essential but liquor is? This is the weirdest aspect of quarantine culture to me.

88,"I don't know if I'm in the right Subreddit but I just wanted to tell this story.

So, since it was mother's day last week, a memory from kindergarten came up again.  
I've always been a perfectionist and I cared a lot about the things I made for my mum. So I was really excited when the kindergarten teacher said we're gonna make heart shaped soaps for mother's day. 

We had two colours, blue and pink and since my mum's and my favourite colour was blue, I obviously chose that one. I made her a nice blue, heart shaped piece of soap, put my name on it (as in, we all carved our names into the soap at the bottom) and then we put all of them in a box. 

The next week, when they were done everyone got theirs, but when I went to get mine, the only one left was a pink one with no name on it. I looked at the teacher and said: ""That's not mine, I made a blue one.""

And her answer, which I will never forget, was: ""You didn't make a blue one, you're a girl, you made a pink one. You probably just forgot.""

I tried to tell her, that someone must've took mine, probably a boy who made a pink one and didn't like how it looked in the end. They would have just had to check the names on the soaps to find out who took mine. But she insisted that every girl made a pink one and so did I, since I was a girl and every girl likes pink. She even said, that my mum would probably like it more than a blue one.

So, I went home with the pink soap, gave it to my mum on mother's day and told her what happened, almost crying because I thought she wouldn't like it. She said it's no big deal and that she likes the pink one too and that it's a great present.

I begged her to talk to the kindergarten teacher and to get my blue soap back. She did talk to her (since she felt I was being treated unfairly) and the teacher just said, that it is really unfair from me to accuse other children of stealing, just because I didn't remember what colour soap I made.

To this day I am pissed off by this...  
Pretty messed up that we're being confronted with these gender stereotypes at such a young age...

And that was definitely not the last kindergarten story I have to tell...",16May2020,1

97,"I’m “lucky”. I’m an “essential worker” so I get to work from home. It’s great, because I’m still earning wages, but my job which I used to love has become excruciatingly taxing. 

I work in banking customer service, and no one ever calls because things are good. But now all my calls are crying about how they can’t feed their kids, their unemployment hasn’t come in yet, their account is extremely negative and they can’t afford to pay it off in time before it’s charged off. 

My equipment isn’t as good as at the office creating a lot of connectivity issues, lag on calls, distortion and static making just doing my job more difficult, and my overworked manager (albeit unintentionally) makes us feel pretty guilty about needing to make schedule adjustments for technical issues. 

I know being quarantined without work is a mental health struggle of its own, but I would love to just have some time off. Even if it were just a few weeks. I’d request it off if my job were accepting time off applications right now. I’m so fucking drained. I spend my shifts witnessing from the financial side how people’s lives are falling apart, moreso due to covid, apologizing that my availability is limited, just chatting with lonely old ladies who have no one else to talk to and can’t even see their own family. My day is filled with 

“I know when it starts getting bad in my area I’ll be one of the first to go”

“If this takes me there will be no one for my children”

“Since losing my job I’ve had to feed my kids bread and juice for days in a row”

“I’m just so lonely”

“Sometimes I just go for a drive and watch as people go about their lives knowing that I may never get to do that again before I die”

I’ve spoken to doctors in New York, desperate to set up a beneficiary on their account. I’ve spent hours helping older people sign up with our online services, more than a couple being reduced to tears because they can’t grasp the new tech. I’ve been forced to tell people that I don’t know when their stimulus check will come in, or if they’ve been approved for unemployment. I’ve been yelled at just because people are so upset and frustrated and miserable. 

I have friends on unemployment who complain to me about how frustrating quarantine is. How it’s affecting their mental health. I just want to scream. I know how unfair it is to compare struggles, and I probably wouldn’t be doing to hot without anything to do all day, but it just doesn’t feel fair. The only reason I haven’t quit my job is because I’m hoping it gets easier eventually, and I won’t be applicable for unemployment in my state because I don’t have a 2 month gap between jobs when I started this one 8 months ago. 

I just don’t have any empathy left, especially towards people whose greatest complaint in life is they’re being bored into a depression. Like, I’m sorry. That’s terrible, it is, but for the love of god I am not the person to complain to. I am not the one to sympathize with.",16May2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

Today I watched this video on YouTube called ""How an Artist Turns Pro"" and it mentioned a familiar topic that I've already heard before on one of Joe Rogan's podcasts.  It is the idea of resistance and how it curbs our creativity. It was a truly inspiring video that was based on a book called ""War of Art"", and it appeared on my feed at the right moment because a couple of related things have been crossing my mind lately. 

I've been trying to figure out how long it would take for me to get better at writing if I wrote everyday, and asked myself if I was even able to get better at it eventually.  So far, I made it a point to just do it no matter how lazy I felt or how long I would stare at a blank computer screen. Then, with the help of that YouTube video I watched recently, I discovered that what I had in mind was in fact the right way to approach writing.  I shouldn't think about the prestige that comes with being a great writer, but I should focus on the craft and avoid resistance while I'm at it. Another way of looking at it is developing a good habit of constantly establishing myself in a flow state. By doing this, I am hoping that my skill in writing will continuously develop in the coming months.",16May2020,1

I’m always jealous of how most I people can relate to “gossip” about stuff. Today I found out I can be those “normal” people and felt bad about it. I was watching a drama about some country bumpkins going to the city. They all wore ridiculous clothing except the “attractive one”. He wasn’t the main character and were on the equal levels as the others but was dressed nicely. It’s weird how I didn’t find anything wrong with him wearily “proper” clothes and still being categorised as cringey. I think I somehow felt relieve of some sort that the good looking guy wasn’t wearing the weird clothes. Idk why but it made me feel shitty...

107,"I don’t want to reveal too much but...yeah. She’s an alcoholic. She has been for probably 30 years. I’m 18(F) and I can’t remember a time where she wasn’t a drunk. She drinks all the time. She actually got a DUI recently, which -shocker- is her first one. I have several traumatic experiences related to her alcoholism. When she’s drunk she is manipulative and egotistical and can’t just leave my dad alone.

Since the pandemic I haven’t been able to leave the house. My parents are both deemed essential so weekdays are alright. I’m alone most of the day and my dad makes a point to stay out of the house at night because he knows that she will antagonize him ruthlessly. Dealing with her is something I can usually manage. However...weekends are a nightmare. She gets up in his face and he tries not to engage but she can’t leave him be. She always has to bring up something that’s happened in the past just so she has something to yell at him about. She slaps him sometimes which makes me so mad I want to hit her.

This year they decided they are going to divorce. My dad has told me that he would have divorced her way sooner, but everyone told him it’s better for kids to have a two-parent household. (Unless the household is toxic. But whatever. Just my opinion.) My mom has a low paying job and my dad has always made more than her just because of the field in which he works. My mom is using her uncle’s money (he is somewhat well-off) to pay for an attorney, and she plans to make my dad pay her like 400 (could be misremembering) a month for the rest of her life. She’s also trying to take one of his cars, which was his dad’s. Her ultimatum is either she gets the life payments or she isn’t leaving.

I don’t understand how she expects to keep a relationship with my sibling and I when she’s so hell bent on making my dad suffer. My sibling is older and tolerates my mom more, maybe even still loves her. I don’t know if I love her. I don’t know if I ever have. I don’t know if I’ll even feel sad when she dies.

My school shut down in March. These past months have been hell. I hate living here. I can’t even go anywhere when they’re fighting because I don’t have a car (plus the pandemic, so I can’t go out with friends). I don’t know what to do.",16May2020,1

That lasted for about a year which resulted in me losing roughly around 50 pounds. Once I was okay with my weight I started eating lunch and dinner which tbh was a huge improvement and made me feel happier and pretty much just maintained the weight I was at. Now, fast forwarding to today, my current status is my bf is living with me, he is a tall skinny guy with a very fast metabolism so he doesn’t gain weight as fast as I do. He likes to eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a late night snack every day. So, once we started living together I would do the same and eat 4 meals. However on my end I have a slow metabolism and gain weight whenever I breathe so this soon became difficult. It’s coming up to us living one year together and I have gained around 20 pounds since we started to live together. To some, this may seem like nothing, but to me this feels like the end of the world. I hate my body and I hate how I feel like I need to starve myself to see improvement. My bf knows how I feel and I’ve made many plans to lose weight. Currently my plan is to stop eating breakfast and only have a late night snack some days.

I like to knit so I was going to ask for some decent yarn that you can't get from Michael's, and it's about $15-20 per ball and a $50 winder but Im second guessing myself. Why should I want this? I can just have my family but me the cheap shit. Why do i deserve the expensive stuff?

It's so pretty though. . . .",16May2020,3
139," 

So, I (M21) have been in a bit of a bad place for a while and could really do with some help.

Until a few years ago I would've considered myself as pretty sharp and intelligent. Over the last few years I've noticed my procrastination levels raise through the roof. I'm in my final year at university and everything has caught up with me. I know I can do this level of work, it isn't that the content is incredibly hard. But honestly, I just dont even know.

I've either handed every assignment in late, not at all, or have left it til the last day to start actually writing. I put a lot of effort into the research but I just have a block when it comes to actually writing it. But essays were LITERALLY my strongest point. I've kinda done that again today. It's fucking breaking me honestly, I don't know what is wrong with me. Quite often I struggle to remember words and information that I definitely know and it frustrates me so much. I feel a lot less happy than I did a while ago. I was in the gym for a solid two years, made some amazing improvements and then lost interest.

I really don't think that I'm just lazy. I spend hours TRYING to improve myself but I feel like I'm literally losing my mind.

It's reached the point where I look at other people doing normal, productive things and I think, ""How are they actually doing it?"" I can literally take days replying to people's messages. I sit in my room with my laptop open from 9am - 6pm trying to do my work but I've just wasted an entire day and in the process I'm ignoring everyone.

I also lose and damage so much stuff and it's the most frustrating thing. I can't put a finger on it. It's like a part of what makes me who I am is just gone. And it has been for a while.

I'm losing my mind. I want to be productive as that's when I'm happiest. But I can get lost in my own thoughts and daydream all day. I don't want this to set the tone for my adult life. I want to be better than that.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

140," You're a student. You follow a routine that's not supposed to be followed. You feel bad at it. You watch some Motivational Videos. You get charged. Adrenaline's up and you start performing better at your schedule. You study a lot. You feel good. Unfortunately, after 4 or 5 days, that motivation goes down. Like 'Chaser Effect', in NoFap (you may have heard of the term) you're now below zero and performing even worse than how you were performing earlier. You're watching 3 to 5 movies a day. Again, you feel bad at it. And Ultimately again, you watch motivational videos and the cycle goes on.....  
**So, doesn't it look similar to what we do with Porn?**

What I think of myself is I've trained my brain like no one ever does. It's not cigarettes, not alcohol, but sedatives like Porn and Motivational Videos are relaxing and charging me up my brain &amp; body to certain higher levels; and when you fall from those charged heights, you become worse at your life. Abusing Motivational Videos as well, is the next level of substance abuse. Cool !  
(This time, it's definitely not the motivation but it's Counselling that I really need)

141,"Background: My husband and I bet each other all the time, about games were playing or movie facts or even if we’re grocery shopping and debating whether or not we already have something at home. We have a blast and invented a family currency to bet with and have been using it for years without having decided what we can actually spend it on. 

We were playing Uno with a friend and they mentioned what if they won some... what does it get them? And I’m still just at a loss of what to actually do with it. 

I would love to go online and be able to make up cool looking bills with our names on to exchange but I still need a point to it I guess? Right now they are just paper slips we drew. 

Ideas we’ve vetoed:

-Nothing sex based. We host a lot and think it would be cool if our friends could have fun earning them or even our kids in the future. 

-Using them to not have to do chores, but we don’t really fight about that stuff and have a natural flow already. 

-Real money, but we share all our finances and are comfortable enough to buy something if we really want it. 

-Getting to pick movies??? 

- First one to 100f is supreme lord and ruler (of the house) forever?! (There’s only like 40f total right now)

That’s really all we could ever come up with but it’s been years now so please shoot me some ideas of what u wish u had in your household or just any inspiration. 

Tl;dr - Can’t find a use for a homemade currency we’ve had for years",16May2020,1
142,"I’m in recovery from everything— meth, heroin, benzos, bulima, and alcohol. Alcohol has been the hardest one to kick mainly because it’s so accessible? and because I live with my mom who drinks. 

Each time Ive come home from rehab (3x now) I notice she’s drinking more. My dad even told me a while back that “maybe she’s drinking because of how worried she is of you”

I just want to escape that horrible thought in my head by drinking it away. Just like she’s doing. Addiction is a deadly cycle that I can’t seem to break",16May2020,1

144,"There was a reason why i’ve felt [F16] like my home doesn’t feel like home. First of all right now my mom got surgery. But I have to do all the chores, when I’m sitting down I get Called lazy or useless. My brothers works but they can’t do anything at home. They say that why I am here, I’m the one who needs to do everything here in the house. When I tell my mom what I wanna do in life she just says oh your just talking nonsense. My dad well he doesn’t give a crap about me. Honestly last time I stayed at his house, I wasn’t feed to the point I lost 5lbs in 2 days. I get called ugly, fat, bitch, etc. My mom says no one would want me since I’m ugly. When my mom wants something for the store she usually wants me to go, but Where I live in the afternoon there’s a lot of homeless people or people who are addicted to drugs. I really don’t like going cause it makes me feel uncomfortable. In school I’m told that I am lazy person who sits in class doing nothing. When I’m reality I’m trying but I don’t understand. My teacher once marked me that I have cutted class when in reality i didn’t cause I went to go to bathroom I also even told him I was going to use restroom. A teacher also made a rumor that I go around making out with every guy. In my family I only had a limit of 100 dollars for Christmas, while my sibling had 200 or more. I am never allowed to go out unless it’s people from my church. My mom also doesn’t make doctors appointment when I’m dealing with problems such as me not being able to breathe through my nose correctly or feeling dizzy when I get up. I only go to my psychiatrist for no damn reason, I can’t say anything cause my mom is in the room. I am just tired of feeling like I have no freedom. My mom makes comments on Asian people, saying how they eat disgusting, I’m into Kpop so she comments on the guys I watch. I don’t care what she thinks about them. I like and enjoy all ethnicities.",16May2020,2
145,"Often times I(23f) think about an old bestfriend, our relationship stemming from childhood. We were extremely close in high school, and now that I look back on it, this type of behavior was still present in her during that time, but things became more intense once we roomed together for college. She consistently treated me as if I were her idiotic child who needed guidance in this world; I would ask simple questions because I am human being with still very limited knowledge of everything in this world, and she would degrade my intelligence viciously at times. She hated people who lashed out at innocent bystanders whenever they were in a bad mood, but she herself would take her frustration out on me by talking down to me, again insulting my intelligence/abilities. As time went on, I stopped telling her much of my personal deep thoughts and emotions because once you did that, she had to put her 2 cents in, and you were incredibly stupid &amp; wrong if you did not follow her advice. She belittled my opinions and actions daily. She built her confidence by bringing down the appearance of others and vanity became her god. Her engorged ego prevented her from being wrong. She would throw fits if she couldn't get a guy to come over whenever she so badly wanted to have sex, like a child throwing a tantrum over toys. Truly a spoiled brat, she was.

There were still good times and good memories in between all these problems. I've never liked confrontation; it's difficult for me to think of an instant response when in a heated argument, I freeze up and can't think of what to say. She convinced me for so long that she was always right, that even her worst excuses/arguments make me stop and wonder if I am the one at fault. 

I'm very happy to have her out of my life, but I still wish I could point out her toxic behavior to her, maybe take a crack at her ego, but she is very much convinced she was, is, and will always be in the right. 

I feel like it's my own fault for being friends with her still for so long, and I wish I could turn back the clock and stand up for myself more.",16May2020,1
146,"I’m just really thankful for what I have. 

That I have a great internship, have been earning a lot of money through fashion resale, have been talking to a few people who care about me. 

Sure, I worked hard for a lot of what I have, but there’s no way I could have done any of it without the support of others. I’m very thankful for everyone and everything I have in my life. 

I have so much compared to so many, so I try to help others in the way others have helped me when I can. I feel terribly that so many people do not have the support they need to be able to succeed more in life, but I hope to be able to give that to someone so there is one less person out there who is suffering so much. 

I’m just really thankful for what I have because I know so many people don’t have what I have. So, tears have been falling down my cheeks more often than usual. 

That’s all, really.",16May2020,2
