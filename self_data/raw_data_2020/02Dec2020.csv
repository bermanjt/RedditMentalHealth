2,"She died at the beginning of the year. She was 36. Wtf. I'd known her for 20 years. Being a teenager was turbulent for me but she was empathetic, kind, supportive and reliable. She was only 2-3 years older than me but she'd had it much harder and never let that show. 16 year old me has done a lot of growing up and I have since done well for myself by conventional standards, she was proud of me. For so many reasons, I hope she knew how proud I was to call her my friend.

I absolutely can not handle death. I am not religious but I ask ""her"" for signs all the time. I dread to think what I'll be like when my parents go (hopefully not for many many years). I desperately want there to be more to life but every logical and scientific bone in my body just says nope. When you're gone, you're gone. Can. Not. Deal.",02Dec2020,1
3,"I regret my decision. I regret breaking up with you. I regret ending what is conceivably the best relationship I'll ever have in my life. No one is perfect, no relationship is perfect; looking back though, our relationship had so many amazing qualities. I don't think I've ever had such deep, intellectual conversations with someone. I don't think I've ever gotten along so well with someone. I don't think I've ever felt so comfortable, so at ease with someone. 

You were amazing. You're tall, beautiful, intelligent, driven... You're mature, emotionally intelligent, you really had every quality I could have ever wanted in someone. 



And, I left. I ended our relationship, and if I'm being honest I didn't really know why. Looking back, I can see through the fog of that time. I had to get away, I can see now that my mental health was slipping away. I was becoming a person I never wanted to be. So I left. I called it off, I left you there, and we haven't said a word to each other sense.


It was probably the worst decision I've ever made. I don't know what the future holds, but I know that I left something amazing. That I left someone amazing. 

I want to reach out to you.  I want to call you, to apologise. I want to ask if you would ever take me back. Thing is though, I don't think you would answer. Knowing you, you've moved on the best you can. 

I need help. I need someone to tell me if reaching out to you is the right thing. That there's hope, that maybe we can fix this. Or, I need someone to tell me that I need to leave you alone, and that I need to move on.


I miss you. I still love you, and I probably always will.",02Dec2020,1

But recently my mom and step-dad found out how late I was staying up and now they are cutting back the time and putting it on not anting to be bad parents and it not being healthy.

so i was trying to ask a question about why women would hire male sex workers in the sub where you ask women stuff(think we all know which one it is). apparently i can't ask questions that exclude gay women. but the question is open-ended. it does not exclude gay women, bi women, gender fluid women, or whatever kind of woman you want to be. you can be gay, bi, non-binary and you can still hire a male sex worker.

the question was: why did you hire a male sex worker?

that's why

&gt; You cannot direct your question specifically at women who sleep with men. 

doesn't make sense to me when you boast your sub to be inclusive, you exclude women who do sleep with other women. they can hire male sex workers, too.

23,"I finally found the courage to tell my family that I don't think gay people should be allowed to raise children. They are a traditional neo-liberal-cosmopolitan-woke family so I knew the news would be tough to hear. Especially for my uncle. He fought in the ACLU-UCLA wars a decade ago. It was time though. I started by explaining to them that I in fact did NOT believe that men and women were equal. After some hysterical crying by my cousin Mindy I moved on. I told them that I always felt different from everyone else, and that I believed children need both a mother and a father to fully develop. This of course brought the chorus of ""HOW ABOUT SINGLE PARENTS"", and ""BABIES NEED TO BE ADOPTED"". I reminded my family that study-after-study show that children are more successful in two-parent families than single-parent families. Also that the issue of adoption suggests a much deeper moral decay, which no one likes to address.
I concluded that millions of years of sexual reproduction have brought us to this point. Deviating from our genetically-driven goals suggests a problem and not a solution. I left them with the question that I am still wondering. To what degree do we need to participate in another person's delusions?

33,"tl;dr -- We were polyamorous but not out with our friends or families. I caught my wife sexting with an old flame and confronted her. She confessed to sleeping with that person, a mutual friend from before we were married, and after pulling teeth, she admitted to a third instance with someone while on a work trip to Italy. I can't tell anyone because they'll draw the wrong conclusion.

_____

When we met over six years ago, I was fresh out of another LTR -- a monogamous one. She was fresh out of a poly arrangement in which she was committed to one person and seeing another (ethically and openly, or so I thought when she described it to me). We clicked instantly like I never thought I would with anyone. Some time passed and I confessed that I was a little bummed out about not really getting to date at all. She told me that she had been poly and it suited her, so she wouldn't mind me dating around. She even set me up with a friend of hers, and that lasted about six months until we moved across the country together.

Fast forward to spring 2019. We got married. Everything seemed great. I was super in love with this person who seemed 100% compatible with me. She and I had shared interests, a similar sense of humor, a sense of adventure, we were both highly compassionate and progressive thinkers. I really felt like I found my person.

In the summer of 2019, she was on an extended work trip in Italy. We talked some throughout, and she described some of the people she had met. One person, she said, she had bonded with in particular. I was happy she had met a friend, but I just couldn't shake this feeling that there was more to that story. I hated the idea of being a jealous person, and besides, I trusted her completely, so I discarded those thoughts.

Late in 2019, she broached the topic of getting involved with someone overseas. The guy from Italy was bisexual and knew a woman my wife would probably like a lot. She told me that the guy and the woman were conveniently poly as well, but that her dominant interest was in this woman. She had this super vulnerable moment in which she confessed that she had a lot of strong feelings about heteronormativity after we got married, and that she really wanted to start exploring her bisexuality, which was causing her a lot of identity anxiety. She really sold me on the idea, assuring me that the guy in the couple was not really a factor, that she wasn't really interested in him, and that they wouldn't be sexually involved when the three of them met. I really sensed that I wasn't getting the full picture, but, wanting to be a supportive partner to her, I agreed (with some caveats). I told her I felt somewhat threatened by this thing, and specifically by the guy's involvement. She assured me it was nothing to worry about. I dropped it.

This year has been terrible for everyone, so as the year went by, I gave her a bit more leeway to involve herself further in the triad. I could tell she was talking to the guy individually, and I occasionally caught a glimpse at their conversations when she left her phone open next to me or she was being careless about keeping it out of sight. She was spending more and more of her time talking to them and spending less and less time on us. I told her as much and she promised to find a better balance.

Things got a little better after a while, but went back to kind of shitty. I was not getting the attention I felt I needed, and our #1 rule about open relationships was always to ensure that we protect ours above all others. What she was doing was not what I agreed to. I think I told her she needed to make changes three or four times this year. I eventually just kind of gave up.

We were cuddling in bed at one point a few months ago when I said playfully, ""I love you the most. Do you??"" I was expecting an equally saccharine reply, but she looked concerned and said, ""I don't love like that..."" which really hurt. I felt like this was an easy, obvious answer, especially given that we were fucking married. I pushed a bit more and she was unwilling to say the words I said, but tried to dress it a different way, saying ""But I chose *you*."" I still felt really stung by this. It tore me up for about a week. 

The whole time I was upset, I really resented that she had her support network with this other couple and I was left alone. She just didn't really make much of an effort to make things right or console me. She later said she was just trying to give me space. I thought that was understandable, but I was still hurt. I eventually got tired of being alone in my misery, so I swallowed my pride and tried to go back to how things were.

Fast forward to a few nights ago. We were both a little stoned and watching TV. I caught glimpses of her talking to her college friend, A. I had some knowledge of this person. They were roommates briefly, involved briefly, but, I thought, close-but-platonic in the present. I didn't really think anything of it. We went to bed and had sex. But then she got up to pee and left her phone open on the bed. I was curious so I glanced. Their messages were sexual. I only read a few lines before I got sickened. She said, ""I'm going to fuck [me] tonight but I'll be thinking of you."" I was heartbroken. She came back and got in bed and I asked her point blank whether there was something going on between she and A. To her credit, she admitted some of the truth in that moment. She said yes, but only message exchange. For some reason, maybe from numbness, I tried to console her and said we'd talk in the morning. I rolled over and went to sleep, eventually.

In the morning, she actually broke down and admitted the real truth, which is that they had hooked up while she was visiting New York previously. I was disgusted enough, but then she hit me with another bomb. She had apparently also hooked up ""some"" with a mutual friend she met through me before we moved here, over four years ago. For some reason, this fucked me up more than finding out about A. I think it's because I never once considered this as a possibility. Like, I'd entertained the occasional ""what if...?"" about she and A, based on how close they apparently were, so I had a consistent, low-grade suspicion. But this other guy? Never, ever thought about that as a possibility. FUCK.

I took that opportunity to ask her if she had been totally forthcoming about the overseas thing. She said no. She admitted that she and Italy guy had hooked up after all, and that her interest in having a relationship with him was a major factor in being interested in getting involved in their thing. I fucking knew it. I just knew something wasn't right with that story.

So here I am, contemplating a life of divorce after just 18 months married. As if this year wasn't fucking miserable enough. She's making all these promises about cutting those people out of her life, blah blah blah. It's bullshit.

So, we get to the point of this post. We were never open about our poly stuff. I can't tell anyone about her infidelity because my friends are largely her friends, and they're going to ask questions. I'm going to have to explain that we were poly, etc., but they're going to say shit like, ""well, there's your problem. You should have just had a closed relationship!"" I'm sure many will also silently judge me for having an alternative relationship or think *I'm* probably unfaithful/untrustworthy as well. But the polyamory was never the issue! The issue was that she was a fucking sociopath the whole goddamn time and I had no idea. I was too blind to see it.

The other thing really preventing me from outing her is that her career is extremely promising, but very niche. If this gets out to her colleagues or collaborators, it could seriously ruin her chances of getting the job(s) she has worked her entire adult life to earn. I just can't be responsible for that. You might say, ""You're not responsible -- she did this to herself,"" and you'd be right, but I just can't do it. Her colleagues are friends to me, and I could just never look them in the eye again.

I feel so alone. These last four years here have been the best of my life, in terms of personal growth and career moves. A huge part of the reason for that was her involvement. We were such incredible partners. Everyone admired our connection. But now I know it was all built on unforgivable lies. Fuck this.

One of the most infuriating aspects of this shit is that she had countless opportunities to just tell me the truth. I maybe even would have been amenable, with the right amount of open communication. But no, it just had to be behind my back.",02Dec2020,1

35,"Our mom loves us and we all love her.  

But she fucked us all up. We were always too good, could do more to make boys like us and a myriad of other things. We siblings were four, the oldest brother, and three girls under him. Youngest was a surprise at six years younger than the baby of the brood. I’m the oldest girl. I was never smart enough, our brother covered that territory. You know even when I made the point to learn how to rebuild an engine and he didn’t care enough to. He failed out of our dads alma mater because he had trouble focusing. He made it three semesters when I went for four years and even though I changed majors my second years and was raped by my bosses son in my fourth year of college I’m the biggest failure.  

I married the guy that was nice to me after I spiraled so far without any one questioning why I dropped out of college, dated a guy that punched a hole in a wall and couldn’t be bothered to find me when I was drunk off my ass trying to get home.  

You know. I had a Family that loved me. My older brother is “successful,” he’s had four careers in the last decade.  

I had two children with the guy I that was nice to me, bought a house and worked for the same non profit for 15 years through my divorce and financial down turn. Decided to change careers four years ago. I was irresponsible, what would happen to my kids. They’d end up with their dad.  

I found the change wasn’t for me, sought a new change that didn’t work out and ended up unemployed. Keep in mind that I’m still under 30 at this point. My brother moved out for the last time at 33.  

I was told I couldn’t sell my house and move back in. This was justified by the youngest sister because brother didn’t have kids and just one cat. I’ve only moved home once, it was after college for just a few weeks. Brother moved home four separate times.  

My younger sister moved to A big city and has been gone 15 years. She her own struggles she never shared and then married and moved to NYC she always tells me that I’m too close to our mom and she can’t relate because she moved away for a reason.  

My youngest sister moved back to our hometown after college. She moved into my house because I knew how moving home to mom and dads came with strings I didn’t want her to have to deal with.  

We lived together for almost year and got to really know each other, I’m 8 years older. So I felt the bond of sisterhood with her for the first time. It was lovely. The sister I was close with as a child moved on and didn’t want to relate even though she could, the sister that i did think couldn’t relate, I realized, could after getting to know her. This was my mistake. Thinking the eight years that separated us in age wasn’t so different in experience. Especially after speaking to her and us revealing to each other our situations weren’t so different.  

Here’s where I made the real mistake, I thought because she told me she wasn’t like me, She couldn’t tell our mom how she’d messed us up. I thought this meant she approved of me airing our three times mutually experience stuff to our mother as a collective thing. I was the oldest, I’d always had the most open dialogue with our mother even if it’d been hard. My younger sisters had thanked me one time for telling our parents about different times they’d been looking for attention in poor ways.  

But tonight I learned that I’m not really the voice for “us” when we collectively discuss an issue we all shared and found strength in talking about, and even though it was in the past, I don’t have the right to discuss my trauma and say the others experienced it the same when directly asked.  

So I guess I can’t discuss the problem with people who’ve experienced the same exact thing and then provide the same lightning rod services that have been lauded in the past because “not all of us need the issue confronted with her.” Because all of a sudden this time is different than the last time I’ve been the heart breaker for our mom. No one told me to confront her so why would I presume to do the same as the last 15 years???  

Well fuck you both, sisters that have used me to start the convo, but many times had to be the bad guy. I’m done. You always liked me bringing things to a head so we could deal with them but I’m done.  
I will only talk to my kids about school. When my mom Thanks me for having them on the computer at the time they should be, I won’t laugh with you at her expense, I’ll just think she’s an idiot with nothing going for her and thinking I’m doing her a favor by having my own kids at school at the right time.  

I’m not going to call you for dating advice; I won’t be there when your husband treats you like shit. I won’t be there when you’re excited about a promotion. I’m done. We can’t share the most intimate part of ourselves, so fuck being close. Be gone you self declared “free woman”. Be gone you self important “nonIowan.”

It honestly makes me feel like I am unsuccessful in life and like I’m not actually getting anywhere. Most of the time success stories are told by those who focus on one particular skill, one talent, one passion, one career path... and make themselves the best at that one thing to achieve success. Personally, I feel like I have too many interests to settle on only one thing. 

Do you think being a “jack of many trades” can lead to success? Or is focusing on one thing the only way to reach the top? 

(PS. I’m sure that many people will ask me to define what success means to me. To me, success means having a job that I am actually passionate about that pays me well and allows me to live securely and comfortably. Success also means the ability to raise a family in a house I own where we don’t have to want for anything or have to go without.... It feels like with each passing year, the “American Dream” slips further and further from reach.)",02Dec2020,1

48,"hey

I had a revelation last night. Wanted to know if anyone else who'd experience CEN felt the same way.

As a child, was anger the only way you could communicate to your parents? I'm currently seeing my first boyfriend ever, but because of covid we're seperated. I find myself getting angry at him when I want to feel his love/feeling a love deficit. They tend to last over the course of a few days in a passive way and I always place myself as a victim. These arguments aren't severe in that either one of us are threatening the relationship, and they aren't out of the blue. They are resolved when he essentially coddles me and reassures me/tells me what I want to hear.

But I started thinking about it last night and where it came from and I figured out it was the only way I could get my parents to pay attention to me. Sadness wasn't a thing in our household (male dominated), so the only 'vulnerable' emotion I could have that warrented a response was anger. I'd yell at my dad in anger over something, and he'd laugh, but he'd listen and try give a solution, no matter how shitty the solution was (for example my brother always used to use my things and my dad would say 'we'll buy you a new one tomorrow'). 

I'm happy I figured this out but I don't know where to go from here. It feels terminal and very shameful, especially the victimisation. I'd like to know if anyone else feels like this.",02Dec2020,1

Only 1 is a true friend. And he's also been made fun of by the other 3. To provide more context, there's this girl who isn't really attractive and not my type at all, which we'll call ""Kup"" bc one of the bullies have Reddit.

Then the 3 bullies call me ""Kup lover"" and i say no you kup lover. Then we started fighting and I was crying during it and they keep catcalling me. What the hell. Ok I don't usually swear in real life and I don't cry that much but I cried again today and probably will  tomorrow when we hang out again. A*gain.*

    They have been catcalling me Kup lover for at least 2 months. It's just not fair to make fun of people.

*And when we do hang out again tomorrow I* will say my final words and never see the 3 of them again.

My final words would be : ""you bitch motherfucker go to hell you crack head. you're so pathetic you don't even understand how much you hurt others. you've never been bullied before, and do everything for attention. If I made you stand on your own, with no parents to support you, you would be dead in a matter of days, because you're so useless and don't know anything. go to hell you *cunt*, I hope you never see you ever again in my life."" then I would point the middle finger at them and walk away.

60,"I’m a high school student and because in my freshman year (my country’s equivalent) I did well in the final science exams, my teachers decided put me up a grade for science, even though by far it is my weakest subject. I’ve been doing reasonably well in science, which branched off to physics last year, which I also did pretty well in. So since this year is my second to last year of high school, I do physics at the level of the senior high school grade.

So flash forward to today where I had a physics exam, where I was to take the test at the last level of high school physics in my second to last year of high school. I have a reputation amongst my peers as being “the smart kid”, which I don’t really enjoy being much.

In this exam, despite how hard I studied, I am feeling pretty unconfident about a fair bit of my answers, with me having to pass 2/3 of the papers to graduate physics. I don’t want to feel the shame of repeating a subject I was meant to be put up in, but I won’t know if I had passed or not until the day the exam results are available. I am uncertain about what to do or what to feel about this. I am very nervous and anxious...

65,"I guess I’m just posting to rant, posting to hear other stories about regret, to be heard I guess. Maybe some advice too.
My whole life essentially has been run by someone else and their ideas for what they want for me. That someone has been my narcissistic abusive mother. I’ve been abused my whole life, whether it be by her before I cut her off or by other people, acquaintances, authority figures, therapists even. I just don’t see myself as the same level as normal people, I’m unable to form close relationships, and everyone who comes into my life leaves within a month tops. I regret joining the military. It’s worsened my gender dysphoria that I’ve been experiencing ever since the beginning of high school. Namely, my gender’s only value being put into sex. I didn’t know when joining that I would get raped twice. I didn’t know that sexual acts were a graduation requirement and mandatory once you turn 21. I’m so incredibly ashamed to be 21 and I can’t even look anyone in the eye. I have panic attacks and shame attacks all day. I’m so depressed I can’t get out of bed most days, luckily with covid everything’s online so I don’t have to. I’ve lost so much weight and have developed a heart problem due to lack of calories for months and months. I regret allowing my mother and my dad to make the decision for me to enroll in a service academy, when I knew in the back of my mind that if it weren’t for the free college good education I wouldn’t be there, because I didn’t want to be in the military. I now suffer from flashbacks, depression, nightmares, panic attacks and suicidal ideation every single day. There is no escape and no point in living this kind of life. I’m destined to be abused and tormented by everyone else, including myself. I’m tired of living like this, trying and trying again for nothing to help anyway. It’s like pissing in the wind.
If anyone can relate, or if you have advice on this situation please let me know. I’m looking forward to your answers.",02Dec2020,1
67,"(Please don't give me awards, I do not wish to get these useless things in a subject like this. I don't want ""karma"" or ""points"", I want to open up)

I've always had troubles in romance as a teen. I've been sexually assaulted as a teen which made it hard to talk to girls without feeling exposed, including my family members. I didn't know how to talk to girls. It was before I turned 16 or 17 (it's been long) I saw a girl who didn't seem to intimidate me. She was like one of the boys. It was in a wedding party of my friend's dad. The group I was with in the wedding were people my age in one side of the hall, aged 16-24. It was mostly his cousin's and few friends since they had a huge family tree. Thats when I met my friend's cousin. She was perfect, at first it was like the crushes that you had at middle school. Everything was what I liked. But when we had a few drinks from the bottles that we poured from people's tables and had a chat. I felt something again, nothing I ever felt this time. It wasn't that crush thing, I felt warming, caring, exposed. But I felt good to be exposed to her. The lightness of my stomach and my calm heart, all mental and physical pain eased when ever she touched me on the hand. I got her BBM pin then. I couldn't stop thinking of her for the past few days. The next week we met and had our dates. First girlfriend, the first person to love.

Coming near my 28th birthday, it was nearly 1 ½ years when we got engaged. I've gotten ill, I couldn't sleep for a few days at a time and even when I did it was no longer than 3 hours. I became anxious and depressed. I couldn't remember information easily. I had gone shaking. My body felt like I was carrying twice my weight. I couldn't react properly and was often day dreaming deeply. I kept on falling down the stairs because of missing a step. I refused to see the doctors in the same place I worked in. It wasn't until they notice me shaking while I was stitching up a patient with a small cut. They physically made me see the neurologist, one of my friendish co workers. They put me through an MRI and said I have parkinson's disease. If that wasn't bad for me, it was caused by a malignant tumour in my brain. It was compressing parts of my brain that likely caused it. While I was given chemo and radiation therapy for a few weeks to a month. My fiancée refused to be near me in the house, in the same room I was in. She rarely talked to me, she always moved when I sat next to her. She refuses to respond to me when I ask whats wrong. She rarely went outside and rarely ate the food I make for the house. I wasn't mad at her and even begged to hear her voice without hearing it for weeks. She wouldn't budge. I felt like the same person before I met her. My little brother lived with me 99% of the time. My now ex-fiancée saw him as a son figure (he is nearly an adult). As a protest, he refused to talk to her since she done the same to me. I tried convicing him to be with her and calm her down. Understand why she's doing this. It just made him be disappointed at me. I called her friends and they can't get her out. 

I got my brain operated, remove the tumour. Got rid of most of the symptoms I've had. But the surgery messed me up in different ways now. I stuttered severely, my reaction time was noticeably slow, I couldn't stand problem without help loosing a little bit of sensation. My back feels worse (I have had ankylosing spondylitis for a decade), everything feels more painful, I still have trouble making new memories and retrieving them (milder now), my vision is little bad, I still day dream heavily, I am still anxious. I was a wreck with more problems.

She refused to visit me, went away when my brother faced timed me. A short while ago from now, she requested a divorce that I agreed to do. Still going through the process, but it was for the best and the worst. I admit I'll never find anybody as perfect as she used to be. She is now moving out and moving with her family members. I am not depressed about it yet, but I know it will hit me when I'll find nobody. I still need a long recovery. And probably going to get attacked by some redditors for wating ""karma"" like my older posts when I don't even know what it is, what it does, how you get it, why its good. I don't want no awards for the same reason and it won't help me. I go on reddit and talk about these things cause I have nobody else to lean on at the moment. I like reddit for the talks and share a lot of stuff. Some people look at my history and say stuff about it and call it evidence for whatever. I don't understand what they're proving and how the ""evidence"" proves what they claim. So for the love of God please stop assuming stuff so quickly and jumping to conclusions. The least you could do is question it to me and make your mind up. The most is not giving me ""awards"" or ""karma"" but to make me feel like I am talking to people.",02Dec2020,1
68,"I find myself with new obsessions every few months.

For example, I fell in love with Beetlejuice the Musical last year. I learnt all the songs, roped my friends into liking it, talked non-stop about it, drew art and at one point begged my parents to take me there saying I'd pay for the flight even though I have no income. Of course, the answer was no.

Then after a bit, I just forgot about it. I very rarely do/see anything related to it.

Then I got into B99, staying up all hours to binge it. I constantly talked about it to friends, made art etc.

I then got obsessed with Unus Annus for a month, and now it's gone I don't talk about it much.

I don't seem to be able to stay in one thing for long. Not only that but when I'm obsessed with something I often wonder if I could do it as a job: Yt, Acting etc and then when I'm not obsessed I don't want to do it nearly as much.

70,"This is a confusing long rant that I don’t know how to sum up. Im not sure if this is the right subreddit either so I posted it in two places. 
I think this might be rambling. Sorry in advance. 

I don’t really know how to describe what I’m talking about. I struggle with having a reaction? I don’t act or have a response when I should. Like if something happens that requires me to respond emotionally or physically or verbally I just...won’t react at all. 

My family’s always like “why didn’t you tell me” or “why didn’t you respond” or “have you done this, why haven’t you done it yet” and I have no answer to give them because I don’t know why I don’t do it. 

I just seem to freeze in every situation put before me. I know I should do something when someone asks me a question or I need to talk to someone or do something but time and time again I find myself being sort of *mentally stuck* and I have no idea how to force myself to take action. It’s like there’s a block in my head. A foggy wall that I occasionally stumble through. 

I also have a hard, *impossible* time saying no or defending myself when it comes to decision making. Even if I don’t want to do it, I just can’t seem to make myself speak up. Before I can even think about it, I’m nodding my head or saying okay. I’ll complain sometimes but in the end I always do what I’m told. It’s annoying as hell and it goes horribly well with my slowness in processing what’s happening. 

The same thing happens with my reaction time. Someone will throw an object at me and say “catch!” And I will just let it hit me instead of grabbing it. I’ll have been processing the event so slowly that I can’t react in time. My family makes fun of me for being so slow physically and lacking any sort of energy. They laugh about it but I can’t seem to change or control it at all. (Although my mom has expressed her worry about me driving because it requires a quick reaction time) 

I feel like a zombie sometimes. I move slowly, I do chores slowly, I eat slowly, I live slowly. To me it feels like I’m a muddled, confused, fumbling being wading through the molasses of time. Everything just moves so fast. People, cars, events, animals, *time*, etc. I blink and a week goes by. 

I sleep for a day and somehow that day turns into five days later and I can’t remember any details of the previous days. All of my memories feel foggy and I can’t remember details like colors, weather, age, people, events even. My family tells stories that supposedly I’m a part of yet I can’t recall or my memories of the event are messed up/wrong. 

It’s been years since I graduated high school but it feels like I just graduated a year ago. I can’t believe I’m 22 because last time I checked a year has passed yet it’s somehow been many. 

I can’t process that I’ve been working at a job for two years now and I don’t even remember working during Christmas *which I must have* because on paper, the year I started adds up to 2. This is going to be my second Christmas and yet I can’t seem to remember it, or Thanksgiving for that matter. 

I’m convinced these two characteristics of mine are tied to one another. They are a problem, yet I don’t know how to fix them. I’ve lived my entire life like this. It’s a part of who I am. I just wish the world would slow down.

72,"Hey, thanks for taking time to read my post. It might not seem like a big deal but currently I am just really sad and i need help. I am in my early 20s Female and my university shut down due to COVID in March. At that point i used to be 54 kg/120 pounds and that's the highest I've ever weighed in my life. Btw I am just 5'2 :( Since, childhood i have struggled to gain weight. I have never been underweight because i have always maintained my body by dancing and other exercises. I had fat in all the right places always. For past 2 years, all the medication (for asthma) and lack of exercise maybe helped me gain weight. However, i was never exactly fat, I would say I was a little unfit. I got off those damn asthma steroids as per doctors as they didn't work! After 3 months of getting back into exercise i lost 6 kgs/13 pounds unintentionally. I lost mainly stomach area and thighs. And can i tell you how happy I feel to see my body! I remember first time realizing how my goals I thought were impossible were achieved! 

But recently i met my relatives and friends. Most of my friends were happy about how much more glowing and pretty i looked ( they were also the ones who always said the same before i lost weight too). But some friends and relatives especially the older ones: kept saying things like you shouldn't lose weight fast, no one will marry you, my god you are only bones, you need to eat something, are you anemic? are you vomiting food?, after marriage you'll gain weight automatically, what's the use of working out you'll have a baby and stomach will never be the same.

I brushed them off because i was pretty confident in myself and my body. However, my mother who heard all this bs just concluded they are right and that something is wrong with my body and needs to be fixed. Coming months after that, she didn't let me cook for myself, she cooked baked everything and blamed how little i ate. I ate everything, never gained weight though. 

But recently my 2 grandmothers and our house maid complained to my mom that because my mom didn't feed me I am thin. Bruh, I have no idea how they all ganged up and came to that conclusion. The impact it had is what makes me sad, everyday my mom fights with me saying that you don't eat enough and you should eat more. She yells at me everyday saying i am a disappointment and see what others are saying and even tells things like I can't spend my life at the hospital for you, you are ruining lives, etc. I stopped exercising and only did 10min yoga stretch and this is the 4rth month. My weight hasn't changed 1 bit. I even got test results and doctor confirmed that Iam in fact healthy and its absolutely normal considering my history but still mom thinks otherwise. I want people to just shut their mouths about my weight and goddamn ""future problems"" when I am not even thinking of marriage, which is not possible :(

So I need help! Tell me what I can do. I want to stop this cycle. Better i want to change my mind being even bothered by them and their judgmental opinions.

Okay so earlier today a friend mentioned to me that there's going to be a giveaway of gaming mouse from a Facebook page. The giveaway will be in a form of live stream and winners will be announced during the stream. Winners have a minute to comment before they are forfeited from the giveaways. It was down to the last giveaway when the randomizer showed my name. The problem is my name on Facebook is only my first name and no surname. As I saw my name picked I commented that I have won but apparently they decided to have different winner since I should have used my full name.

78,"I'm going to preface this by saying that any weight loss is better than weight gain. And it will sound petty of me to be complaining about my slow progress in a time when a lot of people aren't getting any exercise and gaining weight. 

Almost exactly one year ago, I weighed 102 kilos. I was at the fattest I had ever been. My brother was also overweight and my mom too. So we decided we would get a treadmill. A lot of people gave me shit for it saying I was getting the most expensive clothes rack ever and that I should just get a gym membership. Which I just might after all this quarantine shit. So the end of March comes and we finally have it and coincidentally, that's when things started getting serious here in Mexico. Gyms start closing, people are told to stay indoors. At this point I am using it everyday, but just power walking. 

Near the end of April, I lose my job and now I have a lot more free time so I decide to kick it up. Two weeks pass and I lose almost 2 kilos. At this point, I am thinking I am going to reach my past weight of 80 kilos. Fast forward to now... I weigh 93 kilos. 

Thing is, I know I could and should do more. I bust my ass 5 days a week just so on the weekend I can pig out and get it all back. Exercising is the worst part of my day and my progress has been glacial because I don't have a good diet to go along with it, but I know that the second I stop, I'm gonna balloon back up to triple digits.",02Dec2020,1

80,"This is my first time writing in Reddit, so excuse me if I am doing something wrong. I am currently enrolled in my local community college. Since the beginning of my senior year of high school I did not have a clear path in mind on what I degree should pursue. I graduated this year and my first semester of college is going to be over next week. I still have no clue about what I should do. I know that I could use this time to explore what I like but having all of my classes take place online has made it even harder for me to do so. Also, once I transfer I will not be guaranteed that all of my credits will transfer to the field of study I end up choosing. 

My original plan was to try to go into the Nursing program offered at my local community college but I always get cold feet. I really like the idea of doing nursing as it will allow me to open up (Since I tend to keep to myself) and because I'd feel as though I would be having a purpose. But something tells me that I will not be able to do it ;-;. People think that I'm crazy when I tell them that I feel like I'm too dumb for college because of the grades that I get. The only reason why I am able to get the grades that I have is because I am good at finessing my way through things (Especially since everything is online, since you have access to everything). I am horrible at taking exams because whenever I try to study my brain just goes all over the place (I also have real bad test anxiety). I also don't remember that last time I actually put effort into a class since I've gotten used to it. It is also so competitive that if I do pursue it, I will need to wait a whole year before being able to be accepted into the program. I also heard a lot of scary stories of nursing school and working as a nurse that have made me super anxious about making a decision. But if I do end up committing to it I know I will have to sacrifice a lot of things to make it through. I also have a scholarship so I don't want to risk losing it or taking too much time as it only covers three years.

My true passion is art and since I was in middle school I really wanted to be a graphic designer. I have always been more of an artistic person. But seeing the amount of money that they make makes me steer away from that. I don't see the point of going to college for a career that I can probably get a job with a diploma, certification, or trade school. I have been doing so much research but nothing seems to be right for me. Some areas of study sound so interesting but they require Calculus which I know I can't pass. Ugh, I am so tired of stressing about this. I feel like a complete failure for not knowing what I should do. I know it sounds dumb especially because of my age (I am only 18) but I hate knowing that I might be wasting my time. Don't get my wrong, I have been doing research on other fields (Teaching, Policy, Dental Hygienist, and Social Work) that I could do but I can never make a decision. Please let me know if anyone else is in (or was) this situation or if you have experience with any of these fields could you give me insight of what you do (or how college was for you)? Thank you :)",02Dec2020,1

83,"I was torn between two crushes, a guy at work and a girl I met on tinder (I'm bi btw), i was leaning more towards the guy because he was showing he liked me, he was very touchy and gave me a lot of attention and I really liked it, the girl suddenly stopped talking to me and I thought I did something wrong, but brushed it off because I wanted to give the guy a try.

Anyway, two days ago a new girl was hired and suddenly I was replaced, he was constantly staring at me, constantly by my side, hugging, gifts, he called me cute nicknames and told everyone he was the only one that could use them, but the moment she arrived I lost all of that, he even calls me by my name now...

I want to be angry at her even tho it's not her fault, I feel like if she never arrived something else would've happened between us, but I know it'll still be bad in my favor, he's a piece of shit.

I need more time to let go of this feeling because I feel weird towards her, if this didn't happened we would've been friends right away, I should warn her about him tho.

Anyways...yesterday, like a sign from the universe, I finally got a text back from the girl, she said she was having a bad time with mental health and needed a break, she still wants to hang out and apologized for not staying in touch.

I should've stayed with her from the beginning, now I'm heartbroken but hopefully it'll be okay.",02Dec2020,1

I know it's hard sometimes to see that life is worth living. Sometimes things just aren't ok. Sometimes you just aren't ok. It's ok to not be ok. I'm not here to say that things are just going to magically get better on their own, cause both you and I know that's not how it works. I'm here to say that if you put in the effort, you can build your life worth living. You need to live. Not for your family. Not for your friends. Not for anybody else. You need to live for yourself. The only way to make your life worth living is to make it for yourself. If you try to always base your reason for living on external factors things won't get better. If you lose those external factors you will be back in that dark place again. You need to find it in yourself. You need to live for yourself, no one else. Because what you want matters. You matter.
If you can't find anything big, start small. Maybe, ""I want to get up in the morning so I can have my favorite cereal"". Then keep increasing. Take things slow. You don't need to rush. One step at a time.
You can be ok. I believe in you.",02Dec2020,1

Why ask for help if you wanna stay where you at?

I felt like this my whole life with family drama and attempted to kill myself three times in my life time because I really felt empty inside. I was feeling like my family were putting their past trauma on me and treated me differently. Even when I was molested and sexually assaulted by a family member they didn't believe me. I became the villain basically because I want to be a better person but they rather bring me down.

I love the friends I have but sometimes I feel like when Im expressing my feelings towards something I'm being ”too extra” or I should ”let it go” and it can be times where a person did me wrong and I'm supposed to let it go? My circle became really small after that.

99,"Hi everyone, I am a 20 year old woman and I am about to be completely and utterly screwed. 
I graduated from high school in 2019 with good grades and started college the following Fall. I had big ambitions to become a dentist (which takes at least 8 years of schooling) but almost immediately after school started my life started taking a turn for the worse. 
I suddenly lost all my motivation and I had an extremely hard time focusing on my classes which ultimately led to me failing my first semester of college. I took a required semester off and thought about what I want to do, but I kept getting distracted and confused and I don’t know what I should do. I got back into school this Fall but once again my grades were terrible and I am probably going to get kicked out of school again. 
The worst part is a had a scholarship that I worked so hard for throughout high school and after losing it last year I somehow managed to get it back for this year again but as I said earlier I failed my classes. I have Aspergers, which I think is a huge factor as to why I’m having such a hard time, but I told the scholarship people at my school that I would work harder and talk to people if I needed help but yet here I am about to get kicked out a second time. I am going to have to pay back a years worth of college and my family and I are financially challenged so I am having anxiety attacks every night thinking about how I am going to break the news to them. I am so scared of disappointing them, my dad worked so hard to try helping me get the scholarship back and I let him down. I still haven’t even told him I’ve failed in school again yet.
I was so confident leaving high school in what I wanted to be and what I wanted to do but now I have a hard time just getting out of bed in the morning and I’m so tired of it. I’m tired of being unproductive and having anxiety attacks every day worrying about my future and I have absolutely do idea what I should do. I’m so tired of living like this but I just can’t find the motivation anywhere to actually change anything and it’s destroying me. I don’t even know if I want to be a dentist anymore (or even go to college) because of how long it takes, but the problem is I don’t know what else I would want to be. I want to be able to make enough money to service in this hellhole of an economy but I don’t think I will ever be able to without going to college and getting into a huge debt.
Does anyone have any advice on how I can get my life back on track or am I just destined to live like this? My biggest problem I guess is I just don’t know what I want, but I’m 20 years old and everyone around me expects me to know what I want to do and if I don’t go to school then I will probably be seen as a failure to my family.
And on top of all this, I’m also currently unemployed. I have been searching for jobs and applying to a lot of them but absolutely nobody will hire me. My mom is also asking me for money to help her pay a utility bill and I am absolutely freaking out because I cannot use my school money but to her money is money and if I don’t help her she will kick me out so I don’t have a choice. It’s funny because she used every single penny of my financial aid last year to pay rent for a new house that ended up being a scam and she promised to pay me back but so far I haven’t seen a single penny back. I’m such a failure to everyone around me and I’m getting nowhere in life and I’m very tempted to just end it all.",02Dec2020,1

And I feel very bad when people leave - be it going abroad, or relationship breaks up. I feel like I can't keep up with life which objectively is not true because I'm doing better than the majority of people around me, but still I feel that emptiness.

At the start of my relationship my fiancé said that he and his first gf of four years ( they broke up when he was 24 he is now 31) and he fizzled out. That they were too young and that had they met when they were older things could’ve been different. This comment still irks me and it kind of stops me from feeling completely secure in this relationship. Though he says I have nothing to worry about and he’s just being mature about the situation it makes me feel like she was the right one for him, they just had bad timing and I’m the next best thing. We’re 31. 

Am I just being insecure or am I onto something here. It puts me off and I find I put 70-80% effort into us rather than 100% as I maybe should. I also see my self as loving him but not in love because these thoughts put me off.
