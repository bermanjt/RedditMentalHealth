0,"This is why conflicts of interest are a thing. The NYT's report identified that Trump ""is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years...And the business carrying the bulk of the debt -- the Doral golf resort ($125 million) and the Washington hotel ($160 million) -- are struggling, which could make it difficult to find a lender willing to refinance."" They then mention that, post-covid,  ""analysts have predicted that the hotel business will not fully recover until late 2023.""

It's not surprising then when we look back and see how the president downplayed the severity of the pandemic from the very start. His businesses and personal wealth stood to be severely impacted from the fallout of a national (global) pandemic response. Instead of focusing all his efforts to contain the spread, he focused on creating the illusion that everything was fine. Decisions were made by our top leadership, and people died. He would eventually admit he'd lied to the public, but only for OUR own benefit.

I'm not saying i can say with certainty that there would have been less deaths if someone else had been in office instead of him, I'm saying someone like this should have never been in office to begin with. His leadership decisions were undoubtedly influenced in some capacity by his personal interests, and that's why it's so important for every elected official to be transparent with their finances.

Our leaders can never have the opportunity to serve their own welfare at the expense of the People's.",29Sep2020,1

5,"I posted a little while ago on here about some really fucked up stuff I‚Äôve masturbated to or fantasized about. Ever since I could remember (since at least 10) I‚Äôve been a heavy porn watcher, which turned into an addiction and has almost ruined relationships. I‚Äôm now a late teenager and have stopped watching porn all together.

Anyways, recently I‚Äôve been coming to terms/finally realizing the terrible things I‚Äôve masturbated to or have done when I was a little kid. The one that hurts right now is a memory of being at a family get together. I was 11/12/13 and I was pushing my little cousin (probably between 6-10) on a tire swing.

For a couple of the times I pushed her, I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù grazed her legs or lower back with my hands. I did this because it aroused me at the time. I never touched her inappropriately, just in this way. 

Then I remember she was sitting on a chair in a house I think and when she got up and left the room I licked the chair she was sitting on. This just fucking sickens me typing this out but this I was I remember. I‚Äôm ashamed of myself and am having some thoughts of suicide (not really wanting to carry through).

7,"Earlier this year in May I parted ways with someone I really liked and who maybe liked me too but was not good for me. I broke it off. I don't want to go back for sure. I recently started dating. I downloaded Tinder, it's been about a week. 

 I'm having weird thoughts. I feel like shit when really cool good-looking guys don't like me back or leave me on read.¬† And then I think back on him. He was extremely handsome , 6""5 and funny and confident. I think: I bet he's basking in all the attention he's getting. I bet he's more succesful than me. He's probably going on dates and having multiple women after him. 

I guess I shouldn't care. But I do. It's not really jealousy I think but it feels as if I'm in a competition with him. Childish right?

I think it's pretty well known that women have more options than men on these apps. I'm not doing bad, I get a lot of matches with attractive men but somehow it doesn't matter and I need to do extremely well  in order to feel good 'bout myself and feel like I'm doing better than him and prove that I'm worthy and wanted.

9,"For context: I live in another state than my grandpa and step grandma , but I can call, text or chat with them on Facebook. They each had two chat groups with me and one of their groups would have a bunch of their friends in the group as well.

   
  For about half a year to a year I was in the group chats that my grandparents had made with their friends and I. 

   The thing is they never asked me if I wanted to be in it. I never talked in that group because there would be religious stuff (they believe in god and go to church) (I can‚Äôt think of the words sorry) and trump stuff (mostly my grandpa). 

    It got to the point that I deleted the groups. 


      My grandpa is so bad that he can‚Äôt even get fish at a restaurant because each time he complains ‚Äòit‚Äôs not wild like it says‚Äô and it want to talk to the chef‚Äô. He actually yelled at me in the middle of a restaurant when I didn‚Äôt want to eat the cooked carrots (I hate cooked carrots). I felt so embarrassed and the thing is the menu didn‚Äôt mention that there would be carrots at all. 

   My step grandma isn‚Äôt all that bad and I think my grandpa added me to the groups, but when I visit them I am mostly with my step grandma, as a result I have a better relationship with her. My grandma doesn‚Äôt really care about politics and when I am at the house we don‚Äôt pray. 

  I am not religious and the only way you can make me believe in something is proving it with science and being able to connect it to a time in history.  I literally feel awkward if I go to a church service.

11,"I turned forty last week. 

The weekend before that I dropped out of an MSW program for the second year in a row. This is the fourth time in my life I've dropped out of graduate school. BPD, PTSD, depression and bullying, just like last time. I'm not from the city I'm living in, I lived here as a kid and moved back a few years ago after the last grad school disaster. I do not conform to the local 'blonde, blue jeans, midwestern woman' mold, I'm from the east coast and probably more goth-punk than I should be at my age. The faculty in this program made it clear that I would not be accepted as a fellow social worker... client yes, colleague no. 

I have an MA in Classics but no references from that program and I live in an area where that subject isn't valued. I am lucky enough to have a volunteer gig teaching at a local Uni for Seniors program but it is not a paying job... it's also the uni I dropped from... which I'm seriously thinking of suing for damages. 

I am in a quarter million in debt from all my misadventures in grad school. My parents have agreed to pay it off but that will leave them destitute, so I've brought ruin unto my family. I myself am on welfare and food stamps, with a Section 8 inspection on Wednesday. At least I'm fairly certain I'll pass that. 

I am single, celibate and barren. I have no real friends in my local area, the people I am close to are elsewhere and old local friends have moved on in life. I feel left behind by life in general. Part of me blames myself for my choices and I do admit that I have never given much thought to my future. At the same time, it still feels like everything is stacked against me no matter how hard I try to find work, network or try to improve my lot in life. 

So surprised I made it to forty. I'm sure I won't live to fifty but am already struggling to reach forty-one.",29Sep2020,1

&gt;Not to sound like Lucille Bluth here, but did anyone else think as a kid that braces cost $200,000+ because the parents on sitcoms freaked out about the price of braces more than the price of their mcmansions and cars? Turns out they're only like $5k  

The group is ripping me apart right now talking about how poor they were, or how they're one paycheck away from homeless, and how I must be dumb for my misconception because I don't come off as rich (this was meant as an insult). People are tagging their friends to come comment and dig in to me. (In my online sphere, tagging a friend in a controversial post means they were shit-talking in a private chat and the other person is having trouble finding it). I deleted the post, but people are making new posts about it. 

Yeah, I'm fairly lucky to be in an okay spot and even the ""cheaper"" price is out of reach for some. I understand it's a struggle. I don't mean to talk down on poor/poorer people and I don't think they're somehow lesser for it. For me, $5k definitely would mean making payments and having to save for it. But it's not as expensive as a house. 

But it is obvious from context that I meant 5k is \*\*only\*\* 2.5% of what I thought, not \*\*only\*\* 5k as if it's a small sum of money. Anyone with a brain would know that. People are being intentionally obtuse in order to look like victims, get woke points, and be mean to me.",29Sep2020,1

Sometimes people think you might be depressed for no reason or whatever. Sometimes people so very easily say ""whats wrong"" but what could anyone do? They don't truthfully know whats happening inside your head, nor do they understand how you could possibly feel. So how could they be prepared for the day you finnaly break down after hearing ""whats wrong or how are you?"", and you tell them exactly how you're feeling. How you want to dissappear like a shadow after the sun shifts. How you dont want to exist anymore because you feel like you're the burden of every group. Because the truth is im not. Im not alright, everyday I answer the questions with the typical ""ah, nothin much"" or an ""I'm doing alright"". I think the reason im not okay anymore is because I miss being someone anyone gave a shit about. I miss coming home from work to a hey how was work. I miss laying next to a beautiful girl watching shows like supernatural or dexter. I miss the goofy car rides, the shotty music every guy pretends to like because their co-driver is making every single song that comes on pure entertainment. I miss being cared about because sometimes all I do is care... I care about how someone else is feeling i sit and i listen to them when their day was just a little worse than normal. Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong about me caring I absolutly love caring but I am so absolutely sick and tired of hearing everywhere from peoples mouths to social media about how x and ys relationship is this or my relationship is that because there is always a person that would do anything on the planet just to have someone care again.

34,"Does anyone have a disorganized attachment style? I'm trying to resolve my childhood trauma before I become a parent one day. 

I think my childhood trauma is why I have mental illness now. 

Like... 
my grandmother's parents were evil. The literal definition of evil. She ran away at 16 and didn't see her parents again till they were dying. They didn't miss her or love her. Although I had a good relationship with her, she was often dismissive. 

Her daughter, my mom, struggled with mental illness. She spent several years in a mental hospital. Her dad wasn't around much during her childhood as he was working all the time. She didn't become close to him until she was an adult. Although mom said she had a good relationship with her mother, she often said she felt like grandmother didn't understand her. She says she barely remembers her childhood. 

Growing up, my parents had a versatile relationship. They split and got back together several times. They often got into fights and would slam doors/cabinets and throw stuff at each other. Their screaming would fill the house. I would become terrified and hide in the stairwell. It made me cry. No one ever comforted me. Even when I became a teenager, their fighting distressed me. My mother was more inward with her emotions. She would simmer in her anger/sadness while my dad would scream/yell. 

When my dad would get angry with me, he would scream and yell at me. I can't believe I forgot this, as I am writing this post this memory is coming back to me. When I was a child, he terrified me when he did this. He never hit me but he came close a few times. And just the pure anger. And how red his face got. When I would cower, he got more angry. By the time I was a teenager, I knew how to disassociate and it became easier. 

My dad never validated my emotions. I learned very quickly to hid stuff from him. My dad said his way is the only way. Despite loving my dad, there was fear. 

I used to tell my friends that it felt like my parents didn't really love each other. That it was this lie they put on. Everyone said I was crazy, but they didn't hear the screaming. The times my dad would back his stuff up and leave for days at a time and no one knew where he was. Mom told me to never tell anyone. Shhh don't tell, ever. 

The day I left for college, my dad left too. He divorced my mom. I barely have a relationship with him. He's remarried now. Doesn't need me. Guess I remind him of his past life. Hurts. He says he loves me but it doesn't feel like it. He enever asks how I'm doing or check in on me. 

I've been struggling a lot lately. And I'm getting the courage to see a therapist. But is there hope? To get past this? To break this chain of trauma that seems to keep getting passed down generation to generation. 

I hope one day I feel less alone. I feel so alone in this world.",29Sep2020,1

I‚Äôve never really \*actually\* cooked in my life, appart from helping my grandma bake or some real easy microwave dish. I thought cooking wasn‚Äôt For me. Typical nuclear family, my stay at home mom use to homemade cook for us. I‚Äôve never really felt comfortable actually using the kitchen, like messing with the stoves and all. That‚Äôs her room, if I was to do anything there I felt like I had to ask her first (or she would wake up and come panicking in the kitchen asking me what I‚Äôm doing, which just thinking about it I‚Äôm getting stressed). And if I asked her if I could do something she would usually just go in the kitchen start doing everything. Add in that I‚Äôm somewhat skittish around hot stuff, I‚Äòve never ever tried to do anything even remotely ambitious cook wise in my life. (and too be fair having an experienced cook at home also calls for laziness). 

My mom was diagnosed with cancer recently, so she‚Äôs staying at the hospital now it‚Äôs just me and my dad at home. I‚Äôm vegan while he‚Äôs not, so we have a system where I cook for me, he cooks for him, sometimes we cook like pasta or fries for each others. I also live during the night while he lives during the day, which he spends at the hospital. Which means that oftentimes I‚Äôm alone at home and can only rely on myself to eat, but I can also asks him how to do something if I don‚Äôt know.

But despite the taste I‚Äôm clad about it, I had \*fun\* cooking it, without feeling like I was trespassing in a space I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in. 

I know my mom was trying to do good by me, she was never abusive or anything. I‚Äôm getting the vibe that she felt like she \*had\* to keep doing everything for me, basically keep mothering me like a little child.

 I was dizzy and I tried to make the promise in order to force myself not to do the ocd compulsion. I canceled the promise on the last moment, but I am not sure if it was canceled. Some weeks ago, I ordered food and the delivery came to my door. It was paid and I just, spread my arms away from the door line in order to get my food and put them back inside. I freaked that this action may have counted as going out (because my arms crossed the do
or line) and going back (because my arms with the food crossed the door line again in order to get the food inside) 

As I was going to the kitchen I freaked about accidentally, touching the paper napkins of the delivery bag. I left the bag on the table. I saw the paper napkins being near where I grabbed the bag and tried to imitated the grabbing of thebag to see if I accidentally, touched them. I did the imitation gesture and my fingers touched a little the napkins. I freaked because of my imitation.

It all started last month, when I got laid off from my admin job because of covid, they had to cut staff. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt qualify for the Covid relief scheme, so that meant I went on jobseekers benefits. This does not even cover my rent, let alone my share of bills and food. 

For the past month, I‚Äôve been eating through my savings at a rapid rate. I‚Äôve tried to claim any other benefits I can while I‚Äôm in this position, to no avail. I‚Äôm already 400e in debt to my landlord, although she is a very kind older lady and has given me the option to pay her back in installments. Even still, I feel horrible having to have special circumstances made for me.

I‚Äôve been using online resources to try and make some cash on the side, as my full time job now is applying for and searching for actual employment. It has never, ever been this hard for me to find a job. I am genuinely gobsmacked at the jobs market here currently.

I‚Äôm at my wits end at this point. There‚Äôs no end to my spell of misfortune in sight, I have college equipment I need to buy with little to no help, and then food to worry about. I had to give my dog, my fucking dog, to one of my friends last week because I can not afford to feed him. The fucking look in his eyes when I left was heartbreaking.

I‚Äôm so determined to get myself out of this, but I really am losing hope. I‚Äôm just tired, and I want my ducking dog back :( 

Does anyone in ireland know of ANYWHERE that is hiring? I have skills in Irish. It would be a great help.",29Sep2020,1

22 M indian here and I think I'm bisexual and I'm kinda freaking out.  I don't judge anyone on basis of their sexuality but I'm judging myself and I'm really scared to experiment . I come out to 2 of my friends and they are very supportive but idk sometimes I feel really ashamed and embarrassed about myself which leds to severe anxiety and I'm not able to sleep just because of this issue. I think it's my internal homophobia which is telling me all these thoughts as you know society in india is really toxic about these lgtb issues and you were never told that you can love whomsoever you want too.",29Sep2020,1
55,"I never had a girlfriend but had some great supportive friends, got good grades, had very good daily habits and my family was very proud of me, the only thing I was missing was someone to love me but I didn't mind that much.

Last month I started hanging out with this very beautiful and lovely girl who is very supportive, the thing is that since I fell in love with her, each day has gotten worse. I started hanging out less with my friends because I only wanted to be with her, I stopped some of my habits since the only thing I could do was think about her and now that I hang out quite often with her, my parents feel that I am going to fail in class since I don't do much at home.

I'm completely in love with her and each second I spend with her, I'm the happiest I could ever be, but once I arrive home, all the problems come, it's gotten so bad that Whenever I try to sleep I spend around 3 hours in bed just crying.

Last night, I went to her house and we started kissing on her bedroom, everything was so romantic, we were completely in the mood, then she asked for sex, I agreed but proceeded to fail miserably. She gave me a condom and I put it wrong, she gave me another, I put it wrong again and whenever i tried to put my dick inside her, it kept slipping out. We ended up being naked for 2 hours in a very uncomfortable situation since and that situation made things worse because I kept losing my erection. This mistake has made me feel the worse I could ever be and literally thought of killing myself every minute since that happened, It was so awkward, she felt so disappointed in me that I just want to sleep and never wake up again.",29Sep2020,1

63," 2 years ago, due to anxiety of my ocd, I tried to make a promise to God about not returning home just to get paper napkins which was something that my ocd was telling me to do (compulsion)

 I tried to make the promise in order to force myself not to do the compulsion and feel relieved and use the excuse of the promise in order not to feel guilty for not doing the compulsion. I canceled the promise in the last moment but I do not know if it is valid or not.

 I played a video game that and I was using my character to enter a hospital. In the hospital I talked to a person and then, started investigating it. i found some clues and one of them had something like a map drawn in a piece of paper which could be a paper napkin or normal paper.

 I closed the game because it reminded me of the canceled promise. Today, I was searching for a walkthrough to see if that item was a paper napkin. I found one and I started reading it but it did not say anything. 

 I freaked. Does reading the walkthrough about that part of the game that had a paper item, is the same as ""returning"" in a way? If the paper was paper napkin does it mean that I may have broken the promise?


 The canceled promise was:

 about not returning home just to get paper napkins

 and I maybe, somehow ""returned"" to that specific part of the game while reading an internet walkthrough. The character in the walkthrough takes that paper with him. what if it is a paper napkin? I was not playing the character in the walkthrough but I KNEW that the writer writes about the player that takes a paper. what if there is a chance that the paper may be a paper napkin?

is it the same as the promise? Did I broke the promise just because I read a walkthrough of a part that there is a chance that the character is taking a paper napkin with him?",29Sep2020,1

Hi y'all, I just wanted to share some headcanons about my favorite slasher! This is more about the original movies than with the remake, please let me know what you think and if you have any to share please do!

&amp;#x200B;

* As bad as he is, he's a really good maintenance man despite the only job he had for a while is being a BRT (and a janitor)
* Like a REALLY good maintenance man, a jack of all trades, really. Good enough that if he really wanted to, he could have been a renovator
* A guy who likes being in charge of hands-on tasks (insert glove pun here), I HC him as someone who likes to garden. The lawn in one of the flashbacks (the one with Loretta and Katherine) is taken care of by him.
* In regards to the above, Loretta does gardening too, but Freddy is the one who wakes up at dawn to work on it until dusk if he has a lot of free time
* I headcanon him as, at the very least, bisexual. Closeted.
* Also in the non-binary spectrum (mostly out of projection), because of one episode in Freddy's Nightmares (I don't remember the episode name sadly) where he dressed up pretty feminine. I know this is probably a gag and there ARE men who are GNC/feel better dressing up in femme clothes, this is mostly just me projecting
* Again in regards to his bisexuality and being non-binary, he is closeted and mostly lashes out when his masculinity is questioned due to the fact that he has internalized homophobia. He isn't sure how to feel about being NB aside from confusion because during his time there wasn't a word for people like him yet
* He probably likes snakes. A sort of fixation for him
* He suffers from C-PTSD from the abuse he suffered from Underwood and possibly the other foster homes he's been in as well as from childhood bullying
* He has  **Athazagoraphobia** or the fear of being forgotten and often projects this by lashing out or harming either himself or others. (Yes I know as a demon he gets his powers from being acknowledged but still, it's fun to think about) 

And that's it for now, let me know what you guys think!",29Sep2020,1

78," Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk 



Another instance is when she said she booked me in for a mock interview and I said ‚Äòis that ok?‚Äô And I sort of turned my head away and nodded like I was being moody and I wasn‚Äôt I was just tired/lethargic and she was like ‚Äòyou could look more enthusiastic about it like‚Äô abruptly. Is that bad? :/

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks/scowl when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor  was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley/giggly way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòthis is brilliant news, very well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I‚Äôm thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‚Äòawwwww ok......and well done‚Äô as I was walking away. she said ‚Äòlet me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc‚Äô often on email replies when I told her I got a job also. 

Alao: she started saying the ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it",29Sep2020,1

83,"So a whole bunch of shit has been happening lately. 

Some of my grandmas relatives got kicked out of their sisters house, so he plus his kids and wife came up with their trailer to pull up on our lawn because my grandma told him he could. 

I haven‚Äôt interacted with them much overall, haven‚Äôt even seen his wife of kids once, but from the get go he has been all over in my house talking to my grandma. 

They were doing trades of help basically, which I also helped with by doing stuff like cooking them food since they couldn‚Äôt and stuff like that. 

He has said multiple times that he isn‚Äôt worried about any one of us contracting covid because he believed his family already had it. 

Parts of the electricity within the house went out as well, the 2nd only outlet in my room, and all of the fridges and freezers within the house. 

So all of our food went bad, and we‚Äôre already poor as it is. I only get $300 in food stamps every month and we can‚Äôt afford food to go bad. 

The other day they got sick, apparently it‚Äôs passing now, but now I‚Äôm sick with the same shit, but a hell of a lot worse. 

I think it passed onto me from a chair that I commonly sit in, which pisses me the fuck off because I‚Äôve been at home all fucking summer and all fucking year long, I haven‚Äôt gone out to do anything fun like many other mother fuckers have. 

I‚Äôve been here, stuck in my room with nothing but my phone to keep me company, and of course my Grandma who is a great friend of mine lol. 

I have existing illnesses as well, including cancer, near kidney failure, a few others, and asthma. 

Yesterday I took a nap around 4:30-5:00 and woke up around 6:00. 

At that point I felt a sore throat, but I figured it was because I was thirsty since I always wake up with an extremely dry mouth and my teeth hurt, but it goes away when drink something. 

Then it got worse gradually, my nose began to run and I began to struggle to breathe, but it didn‚Äôt get serious until like 1 am when I was trying to fall asleep. 

I began to struggle to breathe and ended up calling my grandma to help me. 

She couldn‚Äôt find anything and was trying to set me up with some oxygen but the tanks kept leaking all of the air out freely so she had to just let them all run out because the valve wasn‚Äôt working. 

She searched for other medicine too but couldn‚Äôt find it. 

Next day I‚Äôm still feeling like shit, am struggling to take care of my dogs and take my medicine, and now I‚Äôm worried that I have covid, which it seems like I have.

I‚Äôm scared to get tested though, I definitely don‚Äôt want to get anyone else sick with it, or whatever I have.",29Sep2020,1
86,"It's a lot of small things but it adds up. Break-out sessions are awkward as hell. Professors can now more easily keep track of participation and seem to have less qualms about calling out people who are quieter. And whenever a class requires having your camera on the whole time that's just an added bonus of stress. All this without leaving the house. Some days that convenience seems great, but other days I just miss walking through the city in between classes with my headphones on.

Admittedly a huge part of my situation specifically is that I'm a 4th year university student who has become fairly jaded with my degree field (politics) all the while discovering and actively pursuing alternative interests. It's really hard to be engaged most of the time in this environment, and combined with the stress and negativity of the US election (which I'm required to follow) and all of the other challenges of this year it just seems like a long road ahead.",29Sep2020,1
87,"I used to be a chef for a long time. I was good at it too. I really enjoyed it and its the only time in my life I really felt *good* about myself. I think I have validation issues. At that point in my life I got so much validation from my peers, customers, family, friends. I was so passionate about what I did and the food I made, it felt like a real sense of belonging, especially with all the people whom I used to work with, whatever kitchen I was in it always became a second family. That career gave me a sense of identity which I never had previously.

For a lot of reasons, I can't (***really*** *shouldn't)* go back into that line of work. It's not a job it's a lifestyle of 60-70 hour weeks with pay of around a 35 hour week. It's a life heavily wrapped in drugs and alcohol and i'm sure anyone who has worked in this industry can agree with me. However it made me feel alive. It made me feel like a valued human being. Like I was ***worth*** something.

I've been working in a form of music education now for a few years. I've been playing music for a long time and nobody has ever actually cared if I was playing on stage or teaching them, i've never really got a pat on the back for anything i've done. I worked ***so so hard*** to get out of the catering industry for the good of my long term health and I feel like i've just disappeared. There's nobody in my life anymore. Nobody cares about the work I do, I don't feel good at it either and it's just killing my motivation for it. Even now i'm constantly working on my theory and practical side and just never seem to get any credit for anything I do. It feels i've just been sidelined by the world. This job is so much better in terms of finance, work life balance, I get over 10 weeks off a year, but it feels like an enormous sacrifice for losing my identity.

89,"I used to have a compulsion to put out lighted cigarettes that I was finding thrown in the street because I was afraid that a car may catch on fire or explored or something like that. I was afraid that I may had the chance to save people but did not because I was lazy and I was afraid that perhaps, this will anger God.

I stopped doing that compulsion. I do not remember how or when I convinced myself to stop it.

Today, a cigarettes was thrown in the street and ocd started telling me to put it out. I tried to ignored it but I was having thoughts similar to these:

Maybe Gods will be angry with me if I do not put out that cigarette. So, I returned and put it out.

After some hour, I started remembering that I used to do that compulsion and I somehow, managed to stop it. I started worrying that I may have made a rushed promise to God about not putting out cigarettes in order to force myself stop doing the compulsion. I cant remember any promise but I am worrying. I used to fight compulsions with rushed promises to God. What if I started ignoring that compulsion because I replaced it with a rushed promise to God? I cant remember.

I am angry with myself because I should have ignored that cigarette. What are the chances of a car to catch fire while below it there is a lighted cigerette? I should have been smart and think that there are almost zero chances of a car catching fire and that I should ignore it because of a possible promise to God but the guilt made me put it out and act compulsively.

Do you think that if I made a promise about putting cigarettes out that I find on the street, is it valid?

They made me feel like I was nothing special, and that there will always be other girls that are better than me. Naturally, I ended up in abusive relationships with unfaithful men. When my exes cheated on me, my parents blamed me. My dad said men are biologically hardwired to stray. My mom said I didn‚Äôt do a good enough job of convincing they I was the one. 

So I hated men. I wished I was a lesbian basically all my life. (I tried to see if I could, but didn‚Äôt feel it) And yet, what I‚Äôve wanted more than anything was to fall in love. I fear I‚Äôll never find someone who chooses me‚Äî there will always be other women. And so far, every guy I‚Äôve liked did choose someone else. It‚Äôs destroyed me. 

I don‚Äôt want to be angry at men anymore though. Sometimes I feel like no guy could understand what I‚Äôve been through. I‚Äôve been abused by the few bfs I had. The guys I‚Äôve hooked up with acted like they liked me but totally played me and chose someone else. I used to be the girl who posted all over her fb and instagram about how men ain‚Äôt shit. But I realize I had to stop. I have to heal, and learn to let go of my anger. I know men are just people, that I can‚Äôt just project my own insecurities onto them. I feel like this resentment is keeping me from being a healthy partner to be with. I don‚Äôt want to make excuses for why I‚Äôm this way anymore. I just want to get better. &amp; yes, I‚Äôm in therapy.",29Sep2020,1
99,"Hey all, I've made multiple of these already. I first tried to do this every month, but that proved to be too frequent. For that reason I decided to do this every 2-3 months. Last one was before the summer holidays even I believe. I haven't looked at that yet, but I did check how long ago it was. Besides looking back at my life and seeing how it progresses as someone who moves  into the 'adult life', this is also improving my English.

Because that's one of the things I have been doing in September. This was my first month of school and I had English. I realized how bad my English is and that it needs improvement. And so I started doing that. Not just during those English lessons, but also in my spare time. I even made a subreddit myself for improving my English named r/englishwordoftheday. It's not really a popular subreddit, in fact it's only me posting a word every two days. And it has been up for barely a week, so only three words in there. In that subreddit I just post words I don't know the meaning, search up the meaning and post it there. However I do need to check those words better and more often. I barely remember what words I out there and what they mean. I only know 'to impede' and this way that will really impede me üòâ.

With the other things in school it has been nasty. I remember from before the summer that I didn't concentrate well and my motivation was low. I want to say I have improved, however if I'm honest I am not sure if I did. When school is over it's still rare for me to work at it. I do like my study, but I'm just lazy.

My mental health has been alright. I stay up until 1 am, but it's not that bad since I don't go to school. When I wake up 9 am I still slept 8 hours, what it enough sleep for me. An unhealthy habit I sadly kept was jerking off when I go to bed and when I wake up. It takes a lot of time and I always stay in bed some time after and then to away. Today I got out of bed 10:30 because of that, while I woke up at 9. I do not have any suicidal thoughts luckily. I did have it for a short time when I panicked and saw I am falling behind with school. It's just the fear of not knowing what to do anymore if I fail my study, you know?

There's also my physical condition. There's not much to talk about for this topic. I don't have a great physical condition. Maybe I could weight myself: 95,3 kg. That's a lot actually. Before corona I weighted 85,5 or something like that.

My friends aren't a lot. I had this friend last year who stopped with the study sadly. There's one other guy I'm still sort of friends with. I've been placed in a different class so that sucks. The teacher called me on my phone because there were too many in our class and he placed me in another.

There's not much more to say I guess. My next post here might be around Christmas. Maybe I'll do something with a new years resolution then based on my previous three posts and the one I am making then. If you've read this all then you must not have had a lot to do, so maybe you could give me some tips on my English while you're at it? Most people on this site seem to be English native(Mostly USA) anyway. Then I hope to be posting something positive around Christmas. Take care!",29Sep2020,1

103,"I used to have a compulsion to put out lighted cigarettes that I was finding thrown in the street because I was afraid that a car may catch on fire or explode or something like that. I was afraid that I may had the chance to save people but did not because I was lazy and I was afraid that perhaps, this will anger God.

I stopped doing that compulsion. I do not remember how or when I convinced myself to stop it.

Today, a cigarette was thrown in the street by an other person and ocd started telling me to put it out. I tried to ignored it but I was having thoughts similar to these:

Maybe Gods will be angry with me if I do not put out that cigarette. So, I returned and put it out.

After some hour, I started remembering that I used to do that compulsion and I somehow, managed to stop it. I started worrying that I may have made a rushed promise to God about not putting out cigarettes in order to force myself stop doing the compulsion. I cant remember any promise but I am worrying. I used to fight compulsions with rushed promises to God. What if I started ignoring that compulsion because I replaced it with a rushed promise to God? I cant remember.

I am angry with myself because I should have ignored that cigarette. What are the chances of a car to catch fire while below it there is a lighted cigerette? I should have been smart and think that there are almost zero chances of a car catching fire and that I should ignore it because of a possible promise to God but the guilt made me put it out and act compulsively.

Do you think that if I made a promise about putting cigarettes out that I find on the street, is it valid?

107,"In casual internet conversations people will often use the exclamation mark to not only show excitement, but also to show agreeableness or to be apologetic.

You will also notice heavy use of the exclamation mark by advertisers. Ever go into one of those in-line reddit ads with comments enabled? You can see it there. Or go into subreddits dedicated to and run by a content creator, see it there, too. The exclamation is used to make you feel more agreeable with them. When people are trying to come across as friendly, they tend to start using the exclamation mark more.

Now there's nothing inherently wrong with this. Being friendly is good. Wanting to sell stuff on the proper mediums can be okay.

But what makes me absolutely cringe is seeing blatant self promotion disguised in subs where it is not welcome. Typically it goes like this:

1. Someone posts a photo of some art or creation somewhere  
2. Someone else asks where it came from, where they can find more  
3. OP tells them it's OC  
4. Someone asks to pay for it  
5. OP offers buying info  

Of course this is happening in places where posts that advertise as self promotion from the start get removed or banned. But here it's ""organic"" so that makes it okay. Some of you may see this as wholesome, and maybe it even is sometimes.

But that's not what this post is about. This post is about the exclamation mark. Those OPs in the described above posts are extremely active in the comment sections of their posts. And I swear to fucking god every fucking comment they make has an exclamation point. I hate it. I feel like I'm being buttered up.

Anyways fuck all of you have a terrible day. I have some of these you can borrow for the comment section:

109,"Me and my friend have been fighting alot the past two years, most of them are due to miscommunication and different personalities.
For example: she doesn't like when i don't talk to her everyday, she likes us to talk constantly, which is hard for me because i'm not a talkative person.
She is the type that almost doesn't take anything seriously and always joke around when when we are discussing serious topics, i'm totally the opposite.
I don't like to joke 24 hours and don't like to mix serious conversations with jokes.
I pointed this out to her many times but she struggles to do so because this is her personality.
She always does this thing which is she says ""let's watch a movie together now"", when i agree ,she replys with ""oh really, i was just joking, but if you want no problem"".
It happened the first time we went out together, she suggested that we go out , when the day came and i called her, she was sleeping and didn't know that i would actually take it seriously.
At first it didn't bother me, but she does it alot.
Now i don't know when to know she is being serious and when she is not.
I told her about this but she can't understand why i care so much as its not a thing i should get mad at.
The last thing that bothers me is she can be so rude sometimes.
Last week, i told her that an artist she is interested in his works were shown at the louvre museum.
She coldly responded with ""so what!"".
Then i awkwardly replied with ""Aren't you amazed?""
She replied back with ""Do i have to be amazed!""
And then the next day she called a pic that i picked for both of us to put as a wallpaper as a ""retarded and ugly pic"".

So i need your opinion, do these things sound like a normal things that i shouldn't be mad at?",29Sep2020,1
111,"We're British and my grandad voted brexit, which I on the liberal left spectrum opposed greatly. He likes Boris Johnson and doesnt think Trump is all that bad - he doesnt like the level of immigration in the UK and reads The Sun and The Daily Mail. Politically  we have absolutely nothing in common.

BUT he is the most kind, generous and selfless man I have ever met. My grandparents brought me up after my mum passed and my dad was abusive, and they have done nothing but give to me and my brother. He would literally give his last penny to make sure we were okay.

Their issue is they were brought up (and never moved away from) a very white, small city and just believe any thing they read in the media, which over here is predominantly right wing pro conservative. They're not inherently racist or mean, they just believe what they read.

My SO is black, and when we moved over here they let us both live rent free with them for 6 months.  Then my partner recently injured his ankle and struggled to walk to work. 

My grandad just said to me in his thick Yorkshire accent (in secret bless him so my nan wouldn't know he was spending their money, even though she'd have no problem with it)  ""Bless the poor lad, cant have him struggling going to work every day love his heart- here's ¬£200, get him a decent little bicycle together to work on"".

Man this guy gets about 1000 a month pension. He just gave my SO 1/5 of his months pay to make sure he got about okay.

My point is a lot of the older generation are brainwashed by right wing media from ""a better day"", and we should be patient and educate rather than get mad , because some of them are thoroughly kind but uneducated.",29Sep2020,1

I hadn't seen or spoken to him  in a couple of years until me and my dad bumped into him in a restaurant. He then sort of restarted a relationship with my dad and invited him over for dinner and my dad said I should go too and told my brother I would be going, so I did.   
We had a nice time but my brother is just as obnoxious and arrogant as he has always been. His girlfriend was lovely and his daughter was the cutest, most loveliest human even at just 2 and a half. I'm at an age where my body clock feel like it's ticking so I don't know if that's having more of an impact but I think I am willing to put up with my brother just for her.    
His girlfriend has a big family that they are both very involved in, which is obviously lovely and I live with our mum who my brother seems to have some deep seated issues with and despite my mum writing him a letter and trying to amend things he still doesn't really want to, which makes me think he would be reluctant for babysitting duties.   
Obviously best case scenario is it helps bridge the gap between us and have a better relationship but he is very set in his ways and a bit of a narcissist, so I don't have much hope for that.

I just put on a fake smile and go on with the day despite feeling like a fucking empty shell.

Barely any texts what so ever... monday, we text for 2 hours, and today, we text a little, but idk whenever I ask if she wants to facetime or call she happens to be busy or something. She said she was like angry afterschool or something so I asked her why and said if she ever needed anyone to talk to about that kind of stuff, know that im also going through a lot too, and I would talk to you about it anytime im all ears. She says got it, and then says shes like an introvert, and me being one, I felt good knowing I had one friend or person I knew who I could FINALLY talk to in person, who wont look at me like im weird for being an introvert. So I tell her that, and she literally just responds yup. And then i reply ‚Äú:/ see u later then im going to sleep‚Äù and then she just replies with a waving emoji.

Hey guys. I don‚Äôt post often so bear with me.

So a quick rundown about me. I‚Äôm 20, I live in a rented room with 3 other people in the house, I‚Äôm in my 3rd year of college and I am being decimated my this pandemic. I came here to see if any of you guys can offer me some advice, tips or even possible positions to apply to. 

It all started last month, when I got laid off from my admin job because of covid, they had to cut staff. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt qualify for the Covid relief scheme, so that meant I went on jobseekers benefits. This does not even cover my rent, let alone my share of bills and food. 

For the past month, I‚Äôve been eating through my savings at a rapid rate. I‚Äôve tried to claim any other benefits I can while I‚Äôm in this position, to no avail. I‚Äôm already 400e in debt to my landlord, although she is a very kind older lady and has given me the option to pay her back in installments. Even still, I feel horrible having to have special circumstances made for me.

I‚Äôve been using online resources to try and make some cash on the side, as my full time job now is applying for and searching for actual employment. It has never, ever been this hard for me to find a job. I am genuinely gobsmacked at the jobs market here currently.

I‚Äôm at my wits end at this point. There‚Äôs no end to my spell of misfortune in sight, I have college equipment I need to buy with little to no help, and then food to worry about. I had to give my dog, my fucking dog, to one of my friends last week because I can not afford to feed him. The fucking look in his eyes when I left was heartbreaking.

I‚Äôm so determined to get myself out of this, but I really am losing hope. I‚Äôm just tired, and I want my ducking dog back :(

129,"It all started when I was about 3 years old. I was at a grocery store and I was at the cashier about to leave when I noticed a girl on the ground I didnt see her fall but I heard it and when I looked down I saw she had a huge gash on her inner thigh a really wide deep one lots of fat was visible and I was worried the wound would be fatal so I reached my hand out to her and she reached back and my mom started pushing me really fast out of the store and I figured it was because she was trying to ""spare me this gastly sight"" but that was not the case unfortunately. Not too long after that I had this dream where I was standing over a cliff at palos verdes estates and I forgot to mention that before I reached my hand out I felt a very negative presence coming from me but anyways I felt that same negative presence coming from my sister(younger one) and my parents but I couldnt believe it was them so I called out to God and he appeared to me as ""The Appearance"" and he didnt say any words but it felt like he was offering me a life that just didnt seem attainable by an average kid like me so I started stressing out and then the devil appeared as a negative presence to my right and he was seemingly offering me something but it felt like I was about to be exploited in some awful ways that I didnt even want to think about and Id remember my dad telling me that all kids goto heaven and if all dogs goto heaven then surely all kids goto heaven right? But then I heard a verse and he said ""for I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."" But I still doubted so I said ""let me fast forward things for you"" and jumped off the cliff and did a 180 to look back at my parents like ""look I made the right choice!"" And they all had this really evil look in their eyes same evil light and they were smirking and then I started falling and as soon as I fell my soul started trying to rip out of my body and grab for the 11 with what I made out to be ""NOO, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?"" ""WHY?!"" and then demons appeared in all the cliff shelves dancing celebrating me falling with spears and they were pretty short brown with like a kind of triangle head and thats when I got scared and thought to myself ""well maybe all kids dont goto heaven."" And I called out to God ans Christ answered and I looked to my left and saw the most beautiful sunset id ever seen in my entire life to this day and a seagull was flying by with the grace of God(why I love seagulls) and Christ began to speak and he said ""all sins can be forgiven a man but blasphemy of the holy spirit can never be forgiven, you are guilty of an eternal sin and while I was very calmed by those words and all the fear had gone I was concerned that he might have been telling me that that was exactly what I just did and I hit the rocks and everything went black for a few seconds before I woke up in my bed with a bit of a gasp and was really startled but I definitely didnt make enough noise for my sister to come barging in the room like that with this michevous childish look in her eyes, nothing like whatever was in her body in that dream and I think I was supposed to wake up screaming which I have heard her do a few times throughout the years but anyways woke up feeling all doped up, guessing they gave me some drug that caused me to not remember falling asleep but yea that was phase one of them trying to convince me I was dead. Fast forward to 2011 and itd what I felt like was the eve of my birthday and I passed out while doing noz and I used to get these visions when it happened of what I thought were glimpses of the future and what I saw was so alarming it made me want to start chasing those visions but I could hardly ever remember anything and because I was an idiot I kept doing it. Well Im sitting there with these 2 guys one of which I was having a conversation earlier about how I always tried to read the bible but couldnt understand it and thought it was just stories that I was suppose to draw wisdom from and was also unaware that there were actually direct instructions but that obviously had a lot to do with my upbringing but anyways he said maybe you should try just reading verse by verse and that was the end of it we went back to talking about drugs and stuff but later that night we end up in the parking lot of a weinersnitzel and I ended up doing to much noz and passing out in the back seat but I dont remember passing out just waking up but in the dream I was sitting there same situation parking lot noz tank and all the sudden the dude in the passenger seat who I was having a conversation with starts glaring at me and im thinking it was similar to what I saw when I was 3 in that dream with one of my sisters and my parents but I completely forgot about all that and I heard this verse that I heard when I woke up on an operating table after being put on a 5150 but Ill get to that in a second it said ""if you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved."" And I said it it my heart but not out loud and The Holy Spirit descended upon me and I looked up at dude in the passenger seat thinking hed be glad but the glare was much worse and I felt like my life was in danger so I started looking at the door handle thinking about running and being the dumb teenager that I was I reached towards my waistband to insinuate that I was armed as well because that was the vibe I was getting and the way he was walking and pulled a chair out for me earlier that night kind of gave it away as well and the whole time Im thinking man what is this guys deal doesnt seem like theres a way around this one(lots of near death experiences) and I was thinking alright Im just gona run and if I take a couple bullets in the back then screw it maybe I can still get away but idk something came over me and I started really thinking about the nature of this encounter and that he might have been hired to do this so in that case maybe it should just end with me and with the setting I probably wouldnt have gotten away so I filled up a baloon and went to take a last hit and I barely even got any air before I saw a flash and the baloon pop and the bullet hit the bridge of my nose and it felt like Id got hit with one of those things they kill cattle with accept it seemed to shatter my face for the millisecond that I felt it before everything went black for a few seconds and I appeared above the car looking down at the bloody windshield and being the idiot party Bob that I was I said ""ohh man what happened down there?"" And a voice said flatly ""you're dead"" and I think I said what but we went at some lengths and he said you still have to go to hell and I said ""WHY?!"" as I had just felt the holy spirit descend and I think I heard ""no unclean thing shall enter it"" and he sighed and said let me rewind this for you and I woke up in the back seat with the guy who I assumed had just shot me in the face and they were really calm and it is my theory that this is just a dream because of the one when I was 3 but yea don't use n20 to chase visions. Fast forward to phase 3 of their plan to convince me I was dead. Operation take down Bob I called it. XD anyways its new years eve 2012 and a fight breaks out at a party we were at and I had that stupid noz tank still but anyways this girl I know comes out of nowhere with another girl I knew and one that I didnt and there was one guy with me and the first girl says ""youre coming with us Robert"" and my dumbass was like right on lets go. So we goto this party and the vibe changed in the car she was looking at this crown royal bottle like it was a poison apple or something and I chalked that up to her maybe feeling guilty about drinking and was like whatever. So we get to the party and I honestly dont even remember much aside from sometime during that night I ended up making eye contact with girl 1 and shes got this weird look similar to one she tried to give me back in 2011 when I was selling n2o on a deck and I looked up to the stars and said in my heart ""man theres gotta be something better than this out there"" and Christ looked down from his throne and said ""yes there is and things will get a lot better very soon"" and that was enough for me felt it right down to my bones and I nodded my head and as I was looking back down I caught girl 1s gaze and I could feel that just for a second she had that same hope for glory but went back to trying to freak me out or something darkness that looked like light in her eyes and I wanted nothing to do with it having felt what I did from heaven but anyways back to new years eve 2012 and shes got that same thing going on just a little more intense and the entire party seemed to freeze almost as time stopped and I challenge you to find the science in that but anyways felt like time stopped and I didnt like it one bit so I called out to God but he didnt answer right away and again very hazy *cough*(they totally dosed me up) but eventually he did and it was very confusing but what they were trying to convince me was that I had died twice missed the resurrection and all hope was lost which was bogus because if that happened we'd be eternally separated from the presence of Christ and Id remembered all those dreams and encounters I had throughout my life and it caused me to ugly cry up a storm but I felt something like someone calling and I looked up at the stars and said with God as my witness I will get back to you and I will marry you. And thats the story of how I started 7 years of battling with not being sure if I was dead or alive but my motto was irregardlesslyyyy of whether I was alive or dead the goal has always been to ""live in the spirit in the estimation of God so if Im dead then leme make a buncha noise nd try nd get enough attention to burn this lie to the ground or find other lost souls like me if I was dead and mess with some shades. And thats how I began fixing my life by picking up trash and transitioning into more adventurous therapy like cold water therapy, sleep deprivation endurance exercises and intermittent fasting and combined military endurance exercises disciplines with Native American vision quests kinds of things and spent about 4 years doing that before I got sidelined with an allergic reaction that almost killed me and left me with a lot of really debilitating and seemingly permanent long term medical issues and I did this all by myself because I wasnt exactly doing my self any favors with the lifestyle I lived before I decided it was time to grow up and was exiled by all my family and friends hence me wrestling with whether I was alive or dead.

Oh yea I left an important part out about how they tried to convince me Obama was the antichrist who would implement the mark of the beast and this was before I remembered all the dreams I had throughout my life and all I knew about that was what I saw on youtube about it rfid chips nd all that but anyways I got thrown on a 5150 and one of the days maybe the second I woke up on an operating table with a bunch of surgeons around me in full scrubs and they had all the lights on very bright and they said we want to give you this mark will you receive it? And immediately my heart sank and I heard a verse say ""if you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved"" but I just said no and they said in a creepy childish voice ""but youll be able to buy or sell!!"" And I said no again then they say ""well kill your family if you dont"" and I heard the verse again ""if you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you'll be saved."" But I sighed and ok Ill take it and I think they moved around a bit and 131 woke up back in my bed in the mental ward. I think they did throw a chip/s in God knows where but it wasnt the mark of the beast. ""He who pursues kindness and justice will find life and honor."" While ""he who digs a pit falls into it and the stone falls back on him who rolls it"" but ""all who call upon the name of the Lord will be saved"" and always remember ""admonish the idle, cheer the fainthearted, encourage the weak, have mercy on all."" Oh yea and ""do not despise prophecies, do not quench the spirit test everything, retain what is good."" We have people counting on us all across the US and ""the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few."" I am currently in Eugene Oregon. This is my testimony to Jesus Christ and my emergency flare in the dark steward of Christ Robert Kyle Luis Connelly. Good luck.",29Sep2020,1
131,"I don't have any health problems, I'm 32 years old.
I do get thirsty from time to time, which is solved by literally a sip of any fluid.
I'm the type of guy that brings 1 can of cola to a friend's house, and after 4-5 hours the can is half way. 
My pee is not orange, it's normal.
I don't sweat a lot in comparison to others, not even when exercising. 
If I do excessive work outs, I dare to drink like half a small bottle of water.
Whenever it's hot outside, the drinking is a tiny bit more.
I tried drinking the amount suggested to drink, several times, but I just can't, it makes me sick, feels like force feeding I guess.

Is there a term for this? Do others have this as well?",29Sep2020,1
132,Where I live is looking at kicking people off disability to save money because of coronavirus.  My parents have said if this happens they would let me come back to live with them.  They're both recently retired and I'm sure they'd rather do other things with their money.  I've been worrying about it a lot lately because one of the perks of disability is a lot of free time and no money to afford filling it with distractions.,29Sep2020,1
134,"I work at this company and we like to pretend we're family but we're not. I keep getting emails critical of my work sent at like 11pm on a Tuesday with no forewarning. Who does that? passive aggressive bitches. They're all over the PNW. I don't speak to my real family and once COVID is over and I can job hunt again I'm leaving behind you fake motherfuckers too

141,"I love the internet.

I believe it can be a valuable tool.

Just like any tool, if abused it can lead to horrible consequences.

I‚Äôve become addicted to platforms like Reddit as a crutch to procrastinate my responsibilities.

With October coming up I‚Äôve decided to take a ‚Äúsober October‚Äù break from platforms such as Reddit. Once October starts, I‚Äôll be gone from this platform and others. I doubt anyone will see this but I wanted some sort of reminder or holder of accountability that I could look back on when I‚Äôm done. Wish me luck please. Goodbye Reddit (or goodbye in 22 hrs and 45 mins)",29Sep2020,1
142,"Even worse than not quarantining, she's having to babysit my sister's kid who is also going to back to school. So if the school gets an outbreak she's almost sure to be exposed to it. 

I'm not mad about her not wanting to continue to quarantine, or that she's helping my sister out. I'm just mad at all the time I wasted helping her when there were actually fewer cases back then. I can't even keep up with all of my own errands, and I had to try to find the time and energy for hers.",29Sep2020,1
