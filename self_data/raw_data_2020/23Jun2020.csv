0,"Ah I know I will probably get a lot of comments telling what I’m doing isn’t right and how it’s illegal or whatever but I really just need this off my chest. 

So I am 17f. My boyfriend is 29. I don’t know how this started really. We are long distance and have never met. Everything we do is in secret and I’ve told him my age so it’s not like he doesn’t know. He has been asking for explicit pictures and I have been sending them. I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’ve sunken too far into this. I never had a boyfriend before and he knows this. 

I think he’s taking advantage of me. I think my friend is also taking advantage of me. He’s only 21 but he’s been constantly asking for pictures of me smiling or just in a pretty dress, he apologizes constantly when I say I don’t want to and that even though it makes him sad he won’t ask again. 

I feel sick sometimes. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of, my whole day is full of them messaging me non stop. I’m getting tired of it. I’m scared of what might happen if I say how I really feel. I’ve made some really really bad choices and I don’t know how to fix them. 

Thank you for listening, I probably won’t reply to comments because it gives me anxiety. I just really really needed this off my chest. Thank you again ^^",23Jun2020,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

5,"I need to get something off my chest. Today, we picked up my grandmother from the hospital for the second time this month. 
On the way home, my mother (her daughter) was asking what happened and such. My grandmother responded with incomplete messages, saying random sentences. My mother and I looked at each other with a concerned look. This is where I started to worry a bit. I then thought it might be because she's tired.

Once we got home, we asked a couple more. She doesn't remember her name or where she is. Now this scared me. She's currently lying down trying to get some rest. I'm praying to God that this is just a side effect and not a long term thing. My whole family is devastated, my grandmother has done wonderful things to us. She's kept the house under control and has been more of a mother to me than my biological mom ever will. This can't be her end, because I need her more than anything now.

I guess the ideal song would offer both.

25,"Okay so this is a repost! I originally posted this on r/creepyencounters (titled: I was friends with a satanist- things didn’t end well.) I received overwhelming support from everyone but unfortunately I got locked out of that account therefore, the post is no longer available after only 3 days up. I’ve decided to repost on r/self through my brand new account because I still have overwhelming emotions towards this, and the feedback from everyone was helping me immensely. Sorry if you’ve read this before and lastly sorry for all the grammar errors I’m not good at writing stories. This is a long one. 

Everything you’re about to read is completely true. I’m still working out my emotions and feelings regarding this situation but hopefully this can reach a person or two. It all started in 2018, at a residential trade school for young adults (16-24) we lived and studied on campus. 

A little background on me. I’m a super short, skinny and nerdy type young adult. I’m quiet and shy and reserved. I haven’t had many friends in my life but I’m still good with people. 

On my first day of the program,I met a girl (we’ll call her Jane) instantly Jane and I clicked. She quickly opened up to me about her life as I did the same to her. She had a killer smile and told me she’s a Christian who had been to church in the past (this is important for later) Jane and I would hang out all day, and basically get to know each other. Within 7 days, Jane met another student (we’ll call him  Raul) One day Jane was telling me about him and how they are dating. At this point I was just happy, that she was happy. A couple days later Jane introduces me to Raul and I thought he was pretty cool! Raul is a 6 foot tall, long haired and self proclaimed satanist. His skin was full of Pentagram tattoos and other symbols. I did not judge and saw Raul as a cool fella. Very quickly we became close too. Raul and I would a couple days later become roommates in the dorm we’re assigned to. Jane was happy because she knew I would keep him good company when it was after hours. Jane and Raul would invite me everywhere with them. They would sit with me during every meal, and it basically was the 3 of us 24/7. We did everything together and spent every moment together. It wasn’t long before Jane started opening up about her love for witchcraft and black magic. Raul would always talk about his satanism and explain how he killed a couple goats and held various rituals (there was video evidence) at this point I should have maybe walked away or questioned my relationship with them but at this point I felt strangely attached to them. Two months in and other students would call me their “bitch” or their “pet” and would try and convince me that the two of them are just using me. Those words always slipped out my ears. In hindsight I would listen to everything they told me and I did become a follower and in the strangest way couldn’t break free from them. I’m not sure what it was. They never made me feel like a 3rd wheel. We spent nights at hotels, on beaches and if anything on campus.  About 5 months in I had a depressive episode and tried overdosing on my physc-meds (stupid I know) Raul found me semi-conscious and quickly took the rest of my anti-depressants away. He told me that Jane will distribute one a day until I’m better. That was fine with me. The next day came and Jane emptied my pill bottle into the trash, telling me “you don’t need these” instantly I panicked, because I knew the side effects that were to come.  On the second day I had a break down. I was balling my eyes out and I remember them two so vividly standing over my venerable body, watching me cry. Jane asked me “is this a cry for help” and that really killed me. The 3 of us at that point had been through so much In so little time. Not to mention, everyone else kept warning me that there’s something wrong with them. I dealt with the side effects for three more days, until it became to much. I abruptly quit the school and left. I was shattered into pieces. Loosing my 2 best friends was 100x harder then losing my first love. But I had to be strong and cut them off. I was devistated and constantly thought about them. I tried to stay strong. 

8 months go by and Jane contacts me, apologizing. My heart dropped because I was happy to hear from her. Jane and Raul finished the school and were now living together at a rental home. Jane was 6 months pregnant and was happy. I was happy to hear. We would then talk all day everyday for the next 6 months. One day in mid 2019 Jane wanted to talk to me. She expressed how she wants me to live with them. Jane expressed how she’s having a hard time trusting Raul with their 5 month old child. She pleaded with me that I move there so I could help out and watch the child because she just didn’t trust Raul alone with him. I said yes and she paid 200$ taxi ride to get me there that same night. 

Their child was beautiful. He was the most precious human being I’ve ever laid my eyes on. I fell in love instantly and once again felt super attached to Jane and Raul. On my first night there Raul and Jane were fighting. Raul would leave the house for 30 hours straight and worry Jane to tears. I quickly saw the instability. I expressed to Jane that if anything she needs to talk to him, or get out. But she always just told me that “she’s use to it by now” it made me super sad to hear. I quickly saw Raul was not right. He would torture a cat and that worried Jane. There were definitely good days, were we would talk like old times but I was quickly feeling extremely attached again. 4 months later Jane and Raul had a talk with me. It was a talk I’ll never forget. They basically told me that they’ve been “testing out witchcraft methods on me from the start” they explained it wasn’t really manipulation, but it was a form of manipulation. They explained how much they love me and I played it off like I understood, but I really was torn apart and confused. The house was always dark and it was indeed a dark time in my life. I never conformed to satanism or witchcraft but I watched them read their books and listened to them discussing the topics. Once again, old friends of mine were warning me that, they’re just using me. But I was in love with the now 3 of them. Manipulation or not. 

As I mentioned, the house was always dark. I saw figures and one day mentioned the figures to Raul. He laughed and asked me what I saw. I told him and at that very moment, he showed me a couple pictures he drew. The pictures he showed me were exact replicas of the figure I saw around the house. It was 100% spot on and I was baffled. I asked “what is this?” He told me that what I’m seeing is “Lucifer” the conversation really ended there. 

A couple weeks went by and to cut this story short I wake up one morning around 3:45 am to Jane and Raul standing above my bed, watching me sleep. I woke up as Jane was clipping a strand of hair from my head. They didn’t think I would wake up (I’m a deep sleeper) but I really did wake up to the two of them creepily watching me in that dark room. Later that morning Jane and Raul couldn’t explain to me what they were doing. I was at a loss. To cut things really short, I left abruptly 48 hours after that and haven’t talked to them since.

I’m beyond torn apart and feel like part of my life is missing but for my own good I need to stay away. I’m not sure if witchcraft is real... but it’s unexplainable how attached I was (and still am) maybe I’m just weak and I was prey to them. I appreciate everyone reading this. And I hope it can at least teach a lesson about people and how they’re not always what they seem to be.",23Jun2020,1
27,"I don’t know how to describe my need to move out and maybe live alone other than I really want to. I live with my girlfriend now and I love her but the best feeling I’ve ever had living somewhere was when I first moved out of my house and into a college dorm. Because I had furniture, a room, etc. that was all empty and I could organize MY way. And so everything was organized perfectly and in sight and hung up and I had the energy to do dishes by hand cause I did the dishes by myself and felt organized. I had a water bottle. I knew where my things were cause they were in sight (I have no idea where so many things are in this apartment they’re so out of sight I feel kinda chaotic cause I can’t remember where things are or if I have them, etc.)

29,"Outrage culture is making us assume intent and jump to conclusions

While this applies to many things in general, let me illustrate what I'm about to say with a specific example that is relevant right now.

I see many people posting, calling out their school teachers for instances of micro-aggressions and racism. Let me preface by saying that I am not trying to undermine their voices or trying to say we should not listen to them. But consider a brief excerpt of a post that I saw on my IG:

""Librarian ABC has been very racist to me on multiple occasions and has been rude to me for being loud. She asks the white kids to 'lower their voices' but complains to me 'you are very loud'.  School XYZ needs to show that they are actually serious about racism by firing faculty like this""

Now, there is a good chance that ABC does not have a racist bias and is actually asking the student to be quiet because she is, in fact, very loud. Yet if you have enough people outraging over this and putting the pressure on the school management, the school may end up firing ABC over this and tarnishing ABC's employment records. This is dangerous and this outrage behavior can hurt people and make us less sensitive and empathetic. 

This is relevant today because we have seen and heard so many instances of racism in recent days, that it's easy for us to ""assume"" racism even before completely listening to what the person who is being accused of being racist is saying. You might have even noticed this happen in some ""Karen videos"" where the person recording the video has assumed and called out racism even before they actually try and have a conversation with the other person or try asking ""Hang on, why are you saying that?"" (Emphasis on the \*some videos\*)

As a brown kid myself, I have had teachers be rude to me on many occasions. But I could never confidently say I was being discriminated because of my brown-ness as opposed to the virtue of me  being an annoying little shit that I know I am. Conversely, the teacher may just be a ""rude asshole"" as opposed to being a ""rude and racist asshole""

People often times are not self aware of how they're coming off or how they are interpreting things. It's so relative many times. So before you give in to the outrage culture and assume intentions and jump to conclusions, here's a few things you can try instead:

&amp;#x200B;

* Talk to the person you think is committing a micro-aggression
* Talk to a 3rd person about the instance",23Jun2020,1

I have had a friend group from college for about 9 years now. We had been keeping in touch via a  group chat, as we live all over the country, and the occasional trip to see each other. We regularly talked about politics and had lively debates often, but something about 2020 has made the dynamic change, possibly permanently. We have been getting into more and more heated arguments this year. After arguing with these friends about Trump's moronic/racist/inflammatory words and actions, and about the BLM protests I stopped checking the group chat for a few days to cool down.

There are different colored eggs like white eggs and brown eggs, but if you open them up they both have the same thing inside.

People are always treated differently based upon the race they are apart of.

I thought it will be my mom, but I have a sister and she loves both. My sister hates me and I don't think she will be my choice anyway, she loves me as a sister but we dont have that best friend type sister relationship. My father loves my sister more, even though he won't admit.

I turned to my friends. There's this girl I'd call my bestfriend. She is a very kind, good person at heart, but I don't feel like I will be able to give my everything to her. I told myself you don't have to love all good people. I have been good friends with this pair of friends. The thing is I hate one of them irrevocably, she is shallow, I hate how her mind works, she is selfish; let's call her leah. Leah and Anne are bestfriends since childhood. I really connected with Anne. Our mind works similarly. The only thing I never really understood about anne was her taste in friends. Anne is smart and mature and she is original, as everything opposed to what leah is. I didn't understand,  did she not see leah or was that she was really mature and didn't think it was a big of a deal, there must be something about leah, I don't know what.

Anyway, I decided to suffer alone. I think it may be because of the books and movies where they show two orphan kids being friends forever. 

I don't know why I got very irritated with Anne but I loved her as well. But I would be very rude to her. Maybe I didn't want anyone to think I was gay. And I got more irritated when she didn't let that affect her. We got into an argument, me and anne; she asked me why I was rude to her always, how can I explain that, I told her I had priorities in friends unlike her who is an hypocrite (not true) who loves everyone equally. She does though spend time with everyone in our group and has inside jokes with everyone in our grp. Leah was not affected by that at all. When I said that to her she became angry because she interpreted my words as that she wasn't my priority. She thought I hated her, that's how I wanted everyone to think I don't know why in that moment I felt like telling the truth. I regret It very much now. I explained her she was priority. I told her I admired her how she doesn't judge others and acts always the same to everyone. I can never be like that, If I hate someone they will know it. She told me she does have judgements but doesn't let that change the way she acts because they might be going through something else. We weren't talking just about leah, other girls too. She told me she like how I was brutally honest. She was wrong I was not brutally honest, I was an asshole.

Since then she was actually overdoing being the nice person. I decided to let it slide.

Sometime later again there was a fight, not an argument, a fight. Not gonna give the story, leah did something shitty. I reacted thus I became the shitty person. Anne was fighting for leah. In the middle she called me an asshole. I couldn't stop crying for hours. 

I was changing my school this year. And the fight was partially abt that because I made a statement that I will leave all my so called friends and never have to be rude again. I don't understand. There won't be a better opportunity to get rid of me. Are they doing it to prove they are nice and good? They say that they will miss us. To be honest I will too but I was just scared they won't feel that way abt me. But there's this thought that they are still maintaining their image of being the 'nice' people and the whole relationship is ingenuine.

I am looking for reasons to hate her so I could finally leave her alone and also be satisfied. Today she said smtg very dumb and I am very happy because I feel less guilty that I am being toxic to her.  [I spoke to her after almost a month, The fight happened two months ago and we pretended that we were cool for the sake of our other friends,  and I spoke to her about a doubt that I had, she was being a bitch, I am happy]

I still love Anne, she is pretty,  but am I that shallow? Do I want a friend because she is pretty. Also she is somewhat like me. She is the person I would be doing wild stuff with. Getting tattoos and dying my hair and worse. Is that not enough for her to choose me. And I don't want to be that kind of a brat to ruin a friendship. It kills me. Is it a cosmic joke? We cannot co-exist at the same time. She is literally me and I hate that and I try to distinguish us as much as possible.

Is it wrong to want to give all my love to a person and expect the same? It feels like a burden to carry and to distribute it to different people gives me the headache of keeping tabs like u do if u invest in stock market. Also in the background,  I kinda don't want that. I feel guilty of loving someone who is not family after everything my family has done for me.

I don't think I am a psychopath, I can think rationally, I can make rational arguments. But the problem is I cannot feel rationally.

I finally feel relieved to process all that and put it down in words. All the fleeting emotions were given new power once I gave them words. Some emotions dissapeared as I tried to catch them and assign them words.",23Jun2020,1
53,"Like I miss my friends but I don't know what to reply when they ask me how am I doing. Because I went through a rough patch from which I haven't recovered from and I avoided communicating with my friends because I felt like I am a failure. I have watched my social circles slowly and naturally die off.

I don't have the courage to give anyone a call because I don't have any reason to call them except for I miss them and I feel guilty for cutting them off. The question ""how am I doing"" feels like a pathetic question. Because career wise I feel lost and I quit a good job because of a million problems.

I tried to talk with a long lost friend but it was just long pauses. 

""How are you doing, OP? How does being a banker feel like?"" he asked. ""I quit my job in banking, I have been unemployed for the last 8 months"". ""Oh... That's very unfortunate. Why though? It was a good job."" ""I don't want to talk about it. How are you doing?"" ""Ah..... Fine....I guess. Ah...Give me a call someday. We will hangout."" ""Okay, will do"". ""Talk to you later""

However I'm apparently a bit of a genius on the side, since people often feel the need to call me smart, and I don't see any logical, rational, truthful reason for that. I'd like to think I radiate an aura of not caring about who's ""smart"" and who isn't; I'm definitely not suffering from low self-esteem most of the time, and I own up to my mistakes and wrongdoings when I deem myself mistaken or guilty.

At first the mod said it was because “I was spreading literal disinformation”. They never even said which part of the comment or thread was false (because it wasn’t), even after asking politely the mod was rude and dismissive. Then when I asked what actual rules I had broken it changed to I was being racist/abusive. I kept my cool still and asked  what part of the thread had been racist or a abusive and the mod responded “I’m gonna let you figure that one out for yourself chief, because chances are if I explain it to you it’ll either go in one ear and out the other, or you frankly give zero fucks and just want any excuse to foam at the mouth and defend literal slavers and traitors to the USA for whatever ass-backwards reason you might have.

I play games online on my PlayStation and I normally get a lot of stick and aggro off certain people close to me saying negative things regarding my hobby.

I speak to some people online through my games and the community is lovely. People just want to have fun, they just want to play, there’s no hate or discrimination.

I have channelled my focus and feeling of like I’m pointless/worthless into creating a YouTube channel that now can help people and bring a community together, by showing tips and just general wins and fun. I thought about this idea from watching YouTubers play to try and improve myself and as I saw the benefits they were doing to me and my mental state, I thought I would give it a shot.

I may help no one or I may help one person, but at least I am trying and it has made me feel optimistic for the first time in what I recall a very, very long time.

I admitted yesterday that I need to talk to someone and I will and for that I am proud that I’m taking small steps into the correct direction. It’s ok to be insignificant.

But one day in quarantine I was watching a really hot erotic movie where the leads had a ton of sexual tension and I got horny and started rubbing my clit and holy shit lmfao I got so wet. haven’t been able to orgasm yet but I now realize why everyone’s so obsessed with masturbation and sex, it feels amazing.

77,"Authentic / Authenticity = Not using photoshop 

For the instagram influencer, there are three possible worlds. In the first and most ideal world, they are the only person using photoshop to improve their pictures. In the second most preferred world, no one is able to use photoshop. In the least preferred world, everyone uses photoshop. 

Imagine you are an attractive young lady who hears about a mail in beauty contest. Each contestant will mail in a picture of themselves and judges will distribute a $1000 cash prize according to ranking, with the number one place receiving most money and the last place receiving very little. 

Your goal is to earn the most money, so you decide to doctor your pictures to get an edge on your competition. Your competition, using the same logic, also doctor their photos. The end result? 

Everyone places about the same as they would without photoshop, but has to do extra work. You are in world three. 

The solution to this is collusion. If you could get all of your competitors to agree not to use photoshop, you could move to the second world, where no one uses photoshop. However, there is a strong incentive for each competitor to defect and try to live in world one. In fact, there are a number of reasons why collusion becomes very difficult in this scenario, and defection very easy. 

The first reason why defection is so easy is because there isn't a reliable way to prove you aren't doctoring your photos. In fact, regardless of whether you use photoshop or not, you know that some of your competitors will accuse you of it anyway, *and* if you're any good, they will almost certainly not be able to guess which parts are photoshopped if you do use it. This is because well done photoshop looks indistinguishable from natural beauty to most people. This makes credible promises extraordinarily difficult, since there is no way to verify if someone followed through, or has a reputation of following through. 

The second reason is that there isn't a great way to punish your competitors. If your competitor doctors their pictures, what is your recourse? You have two options: Drag them for it publicly, or doctor your own photos to decrease their share of the winnings. Considering the first option, you could go on the timeline and start talking about how she's fake this and that, but this strategy is weak from overuse. Even if someone isn't doctoring their photos, this strategy will always be levied against them by competitors anyway. And to make matters worse, the kinds of people who care most about authenticity are not your primary audience. 

If you get posted to pretty ugly little liar forums... Who cares? Those people don't pay your bills. It literally does not matter if they think you're real or not. (Remember this point, it will come up later when we talk about other strategies for encouraging authenticity.)

The second option, doctoring your own photos has it's own big problem: In this game, strategies are sticky. 

The traditional solution to defectors in game theory is tit for tat, or tit for tat-tat. Because the game is played in iterations, when they defect, you defect next round. Or if you're a little more forgiving, you defect after two defections from their side. But here, every time you switch sides you incur a penalty. Remember earlier when I said it's hard to verify if someone has a reputation of authenticity? I lied. There is at least one very good way: Catching them changing strategies. Both the person who is consistently authentic AND the person who is consistently inauthentic have plausible positive reputations. Only the person who switches does not. 

So if collusion is so difficult, what are the other options for promoting authenticity? 

Well, there has been a hereto unmentioned group of players. The women affected by rapidly ballooning beauty standards. Instagram has been shown to have marked negative effects on mental health, particularly for young women. ^[\[1\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15213269.2016.1257392)[\[2\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40519-017-0364-2?fbclid=IwAR1fIR5D-_MwHN5WNv-jf93vX_A_L74kZC-eipIm-DThk5oQyMFlDjWMNp8) We can think of this as a negative externality. If these women worked together, they could offer monetary incentive to any beauty contestant willing to forgo photoshop. How much would you pay to insure authenticity? There are a lot of instagram reality users. What if those people, and other interested individuals, created a third party that could verify authenticity and pool resources? If an influencer could prove their authenticity, they would recieve a monetary reward from the organization. This would also provide a fantastic way of verifying reputation, since any influencer not willing to take this money could be suspect.",23Jun2020,3

I need to lose 30-40lbs at least and I suck at dieting lately and haven't been exercising outside of my job duties because the gym has been closed and working 10 hour shifts gets me really unmotivated. I feel terrible about myself. 

I don't have any friends really aside from people at work who are just good for small talk of course.

Hey! This is the story of my ex girlfriend. Let's call her N.

N, as said in the title is a compulsive liar and I genuinely still don't know so much about her.

It all started when one of my acquaintances introduced me to N and K (One of N's ""friends""). We were all having a conversation about Anime. I didn't really watch it all that much but I pretended to know what I was talking about.

After that, Me, N and K started to become close friends. Because of this, I actually started to get into Anime. Eventually, I fell for N, and she ""liked"" me too, and so we started dating.

Let's get into the lies.

N initially told me she was from Japan and could speak Japanese fluently (She tried to fake this by spewing out nonsense that *sounded* Japanese), She also told me she had really bad Anxiety and Depression and took Antidepressants each day. She told me she was Muslim, which I know to be true. At one point, she started claiming to have a Japanese friend (A), which I later found was a guy who ran a YouTube channel that, of course, she did not know IRL.

I believed all this, up until one day she claimed she was from Morocco and grew up there, which is believable, as she has a darker skin tone but then it hit me. I asked her if she is actually from Japan and she said ""Oh yeah, it's just that I visited Morocco"". Okay, conflicting Story lines here, I thought. In Hindsight, I should've seen through this easily but I just wanted to make the relationship work and I guess I ignored it.

She started having days where she couldn't get out of bed, due to lack of motivation and ""going to hospital"" due to panic attacks. Now, I'm not saying she did not have panic attacks but I am sure she did not have Depression.

We eventually broke up and I saw through her immediately and I felt so annoyed that I didn't beforehand.

She started coming to After-school Clubs (Yes, this was in HS) that I went to. She acted really creepy by messaging me through Wattpad, she would say stuff like ""Please come back to me"" some days, and others she just got really annoyed that I made a new friend (He is still one of my best friends :)). I couldn't find a way to block her but she eventually stopped anyway. She even tugged on my arm as I was walking home, begging me to give her another chance and forgive her. My only response was ""Get off of my arm"" and that was that.

One day I made a friend with another girl. S. S and I hung out a ton and we became really close friends. She revealed she was also friends with N but had decided to not let that tear apart her friendship with either of us. After a few weeks, one day, I came over to talk to her and the poor girl nearly had a damn panic attack as if I had murdered her entire family. She said that apparently N said I was a bad person and has convinced her to stay away from me. Great. Another friend down.

This hit me hard like a punch in the face. I started having self-image issues and felt horrible about my life. She eventually ""came out as Autistic"" a few months later and people still believe it.

She made a friend who was a trans man and then was trans herself all of a sudden. She goes go by the name Levi, which I have no problem sharing as I don't view it as her real name. I'm not here to be called Trans-phobic. I legitamletley believe she is being a 'Trender'.

I found out for sure that she was lying when I met someone called V. V also got screwed by N and we got talking.

It turns out that she though N learnt Japanese through Anime and just grew up here. In response, I told her my story and then boom. I believe N threatened Suicide a few times against a few of V's friends. I know for a fact she contacted 'my new friend' saying to tell me stuff, he declined for me and that was that.

A year goes past and she starts telling everyone in the school that I have a Foot Fetish. I have no problem saying this here as none of my friends know I use Reddit but I do, in fact, have one.

This resulted in her group yelling ""FEET"" whenever they say me. Hell, they still do. People came up to me and said, ""Hey thisismypr0naccount0! Look at this!"" Before raising their leg up slightly.

There are other small lies I wont go into as they could fill up a Novel on their own.

I hate how this all still affects me now, when it shouldn't. V is now my Girlfriend and I hate how I can't seem to move on from all of that.

98,"So I’m a grade 10 student I did English 10 this year, but I managed to get a 50 mainly become of a missing poster project which I did with my group. I was gone one day and they never managed to finish it, but apparently before school was over my friend did finish it got a full mark but I didn’t get anything despite doing half the poster. Which cut my mark down a lot, it sucks it’s the summer now I got my report card and it seems like it’s too late to fix the error. My friend felt sorry, my Dads extremely mad and Im basically being disowned over it no matter how much I explain to him what happened. 

So that’s what’s happening in my life now, I’m extremely disappointed although are marks don’t matter because of covid. But I’m still butt hurt over it, over a simple grading error which probably messed up our other group member as well. As my friend who had it passed it in, I can only assume she thought he was doing it solo. Now I’m sitting in my house basically rambling to himself about how stupid I am, he thinks every thing I’m saying is excuse and that I’m bull shitting.

My parents are divorced, it’s always been a broken family should I move away from my father. Because it doesn’t seem like he wants me anymore, I’m kinda lost and I’m gonna ask for help in this post as well. I just need advice I’m extreme stressed about it, my English teachers error basically made everything flip outside on me and I have no one for support. This is basically my cry for help, so I’m just gonna share this to reddit.

Edit 1: My Dad for hours has been basically raging, slamming stuff and mumbling stuff loudly about how stupid I am and that all that. I don’t know what to do, he’s going crazy or something, I’m feeling like crap.

Edit 2: He was saying that he won’t cook for me anymore for awhile and all this crazy stuff, over a grade 10 report card. So I’m basically on my own, should I run off to my Mom?

102,"My stepdad's cat was hit by a car at around 8:30 am today. This was the second time Faith was hit by a car. Last year she was hit on Halloween and lost her right eye. My mom called me a few minutes ago to tell me the news. I didn't cry at first because I was still in shock, but as soon as we ended the call it hit me like a missile and I started balling my eyes out. I can't remember the last time I cried. I'm making this post as an archive for my future self to look back at and remember what a wonderful cat Faith was.

When my stepdad first adopted Faith she was only a year old. Faith was mostly black with white patches. I grew up with Faith and I treated her like my own child. I still remember the first time she ate treats out of my hand, and that memory is never going to leave me. My last memory of Faith was last week when I was sleeping with her in my bed and her paw was in my hand. I now think of that as a final goodbye, figuratively slipping away from me. I not only loved Faith as my cat, but I loved her like my child.

- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bite to me about how much she smells.

Please understand my way of thinking even tho its completely crazy , i also dont agree with hitlers racism just to clarify 


I dont know why but i admire hitlers achievements up until 1938 , where he rebuilt the economy, solved the unemployment issue, he then reunited his empire, i dont admire or condone his “night of the shattered glass” or the other stuff he did to minorities.

I did economics and politics,Law A-levels and the more i learnt about hitler in my own private time the more i admired him, i dont agree with the racism at all but the way he spoke and the way he influenced people and cast them under a spell to the point they were even willing to die for him is incredible , the fact he died for his country and didnt run , he stayed in berlin with his people.

No leader these days would do that , they are all cowards ,england shouldn’t be as it is where the conservatives and labour party bash heads and wait for one another to make a mistake so they can use it as a point of concern or topic to speak about when trying to be voted in by the public. 

We need to unite our country and lead us to victory, solve economic issues in the north east and gain the popularity of the nation not just the majority.

Then we can reclaim our lost land and build our nation to its former glory and intervene effectively in foreign conflicts as america does due to their vast empire they have and the amount of imperialism and loyalty to the American flag.


Boris could have been the one but he was not , we need a leader who can solve the issues for the rich and poor not one or the other , labour is favoured by the poor because most of their policies are directed at the poor thats mainly why the north is a labour stronghold while the south is a conservative dominant area , as the conservative policy’s mainly benefit the wealthy and middle class.

We need to unite as one similar to the mongol empire did or germany did and have the nations peoples willingness grow our empire and achieve industrialisation similar to china and a army as big and strong as the major players in the world .



The moto shall be , “one flag 7 seven continents “


Disclaimer : i am not a fascist , i just want to bring our country and others out the libtard hell hole we and they live in,political correctness has went for too out of hand as well.

We could invade the middle east with british soliders and occupy the land and take their main resource which is oil then sell it to boost our economy and start paying off the stupid amount of debt we have accumulated.",23Jun2020,1

Anytime someone cuts her off on the road or something, she’ll get angry and honk and curse and it’s just a lot.

Today there were a few girls by the pool in my apartment complex, I live in an apartment over looking the pool and my sister saw that these girls were smoking a hookah and we heard the loud music. It didn’t really bother me or my sister, but it really bothered my mom. 

She got really mad and called the office and the guy there said they’re allowed to smoke and I could tell me mom was pissed. She starting going on about how we’d been here 15 years and that was never allowed. That smoking shouldn’t be allowed. That she was allergic. That kids live here and second hand smoke is dangerous. 

She made me walk down to where the pool is with her to look at the big rule board at the pool. It said nothing about smoking. There were ashtrays on either end of the pool and my mom was just getting angrier and angrier. We went back inside and she called again, saying the same things and that she wanted to talk to corporate. 

She was yelling pretty loud at the guy and eventually hung up on him after calling him a “fucker”( idk if she said it to him or right after she hung up) then she yelled “fuck” in her room but the walls are thin and it scared the shit out of me. 

She called security and took pictures and videos to send to other office associates. Security took care of it but the other office people claim that they never saw the hookah and that made my mom even more mad. She called security again to make sure they saw it and she’s continuing to fight with these people. 

She came to my sister and I and said that whenever people are at the pool being loud, we need to let her know or call security. That she wasn’t going to be nice anymore (as if she was nice before). She’s been ranting me to all day about this shit and I’m just in a tough place.
