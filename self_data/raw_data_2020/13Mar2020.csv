0,"I personally think it's a little extreme, but it's a small break. We're still going to have class, but we essentially have the Chromebooks so we don't have to make up days (not like we've ever actually done that).

I've been really hoping for spring break, but idk about this. I could really use it to catch up but I'm not really a social person outside of school and there are certain people who just make my life so much easier and happier and I won't be able to see most of them (hopefully I'll still get to see the bf!)

And then there's prom. I'll be honest I've been really late for everything with prom (literally just took my dress to be  altered 2 days ago), but I'm still going to be mildly upset if they move it. It's next Saturday (not the one this week) and it just feels so close at this point. I've been really excited to spend the night with new friends I've made this year after some former friends decided to up and leave. 
There's just a lot of mixed feelings for this and I figured I'd just vent about it a little",13Mar2020,1
1,This is a question that i feel needs to be answered just in case i am lost. I love my partner for who he is and how kindly he treats me. I try my best to do the absolute same to him and constantly worry that he might not be happy when he always reassures me that  i do. (not directly but his words and body language does most of the time),13Mar2020,1

5,"All I care about is why I wasn't popular back in  secondary school, why was I too sensitive or too nice, too friendly, too over eager? I feel like a loser, even at my big ass age. I want the popular girls back when I was in secondary to think I'm cool, my Instagram is dedicated to seek validation. Why don't I have popular friends, I'm an outgoing nice girl, what is wrong with me? 

Why do I feel unfulfilled in my career choice. Is being marketing that bad?  Why is the only reason I want to get a 1st in my degree for the validation of others? I only care about what my job title looks like to others. I eat at places that look cool, do things only to look cool on social media, just to show those girls from school that I can be cool too. But I'll never be that. They'll always remember me as the girl who cried a lot. Lol  

Secondary was the biggest social thing for me. I didnt go college and do uni online, so it feels like that was it. No new way of making friends. I have great friends dont get me wrong, but I can never fit in with the ""in crowd"". Why am I not worthy?",13Mar2020,1
6,"Basically I have no friends and feel pretty lonely. I have a feeling I'm not gonna be making a lot of friends during this Corona Virus period, considering pretty much everything is shut down. Is there a good way to deal with loneliness when I can't even go out and make friends or do anything fun with anyone for that matter? A good place to find and talk to people online maybe? Idk I'm just really tired of being lonely and it's really the only problem I currently have. I have been very depressed and anxious but I've gotten so much better. Now I just need to have some people around me. A friend group to play video games with or something. Someone to talk to so I'm not so alone and bored.",13Mar2020,1
7,"Back to loving my self now , maybe stop shoving sugary crap into my face tomorrow, 

But what ever I‚Äôm doing, slowly but surely going to show my self the love and care I need

This virus. 

It's already beginning to splice itself into our conversations, our actions, our actions our actions. What are we missing here? 

How different are my next few weeks (weeks??) going to be? 

Is 40% a lot? Is 

60%? 

Is it all no big deal? Should I be joking about it?

9,"Having a global pandemic that's changing the world, dropping stocks, causing closures, cancellations, and deaths, and you're at ground zero in the US, it feels unreal.",13Mar2020,1
10,"Just to be clear, yes, I understand that covid-19 is nothing to sneeze about. It‚Äôs causing panic, distress and death. 

That being said; I came home tonight to my bf cancelling our vacation plans over the phone bc of the damn virus. 

Didn‚Äôt discuss it with me, just cancelled. I‚Äôve been working my ass off for months to pay for this trip, to make some extra money to spend and actually enjoy myself for once in my life. Now my promised vacation is no more, I had no say in it, and I‚Äôm extremely upset. In the grand scheme of things I understand this is insignificant, but it was very important to me.",13Mar2020,1
11,"I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve come to this realization so late. Do you guys remember 2016. The world was in shambles. The memes were A1 tho like they are now so there‚Äôs that. But yeah, I think election years are cursed.",13Mar2020,1
12,"It doesn't matter If I'm on a hospital floor saving someone's life,

or If I'm a good friend and I make someone's night,

or If I'm a wonderful daughter who makes her parents proud,

or If I spend my hours volunteering for non-profit organizations,

or If I'm a great significant other that makes someone's life worth living

I feel so incomplete. 

There's nothing missing in my life other than a few goals to check off, I am NOT depressed, but when my head hits my pillow every night, I can't help but think about how my efforts don't seem fulfilling. No amount of presents that I buy myself, or trips I indulge in, or activities I spend my time enjoying, or friends I have make me feel content in myself. I don't want more, and I'm fine with having less. 

I rock, and I'm proud of my achievements (the work I choose to do and volunteer for), and how giving and unconditionally loving  I am. I'm kind to a fault, but it seems like the world needs that. 

I use the money from my $12/hr checks to buy little presents for EVERYONE in my department for all the holidays I enjoy (Christmas, valentines day, Easter, Halloween, etc.) and no one is ever left out. The smile across everyone's face give me a nice feeling, and it's not that I expect anything in return but what does anyone do for me?

Does no one enjoy my smile? Is my laugh not worth cracking a joke over? Have I not done enough to become someone who is of meaning? A hello when I'm seen across the street? Is my name that hard to remember?

If anything, I guess I just wish I meant something to myself so I didn't have to feel this way.

The world is so lonely, even with so many people around.",13Mar2020,1
13,"...I don‚Äôt get it. 
Stand up straight, smile, be confident... it‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs hard to keep an act. 
We are not happy all the time, it‚Äôs painful to keep a fake face around people. 
I am seen as a bit of a joker, I make people laugh, I also check in with anyone when I see there down, I can usually tell when something up with someone. But I feel like no one can tell when something is up with me, I‚Äôm a time bomb ready to explode, it hurts so much keeping it all in, All It takes is someone to ask me how I am , really, how am I.",13Mar2020,1
14,"You don't have to agree with what someone says, but you can understand why they do what they do or think what they think. It's bothersome that people can't seem to practice the simple principle of understanding. My Dad is one of those people who you can't get through to. 

I was asking him to *understand* why someone would do x and he kept saying ""well they shouldn't do it at all to begin with."" This isn't what I was saying. I wasn't asking if he thought they should do it or not, I was asking him to try and understand. Understand does not mean you are okay with something, it means you took the time to evaluate why a person took the actions they took.

I really think that being *understanding* of other people and stuff in general seriously helps eliminate a lot of close mindedness and ignorance for people. This is just something important that I wanted to share.",13Mar2020,1

Girls tell me I‚Äôm pretty and I dress nice and put effort so idk what the problem is. I‚Äôm smart and ambitious. My girl friends tell me I‚Äôm the sweetest girl they know and they‚Äôd date me if they were a guy. I feel lonely sometimesss I wish I had a boyfriend just to see what it‚Äôs like. To be hugged and kissed and feel protected and cared for. And know someone‚Äôs thinking about me and they like me. It‚Äôs pathetic.

18,"My dad was never in my life; I‚Äôve seen him maybe once or twice. Today while on the phone with my girl, she asked me


‚ÄúIf you could tell your dad ONE thing, what would it be?‚Äù


I told her I‚Äôd probably just say nothing, because I never really cared about him walking out on me. I‚Äôve seen him maybe once or twice in my life, and it is what it is. She continued on to ask me if I wondered if he started another family or anything, and I told her about them. As the conversation went on I started feeling the urge to cry. I don‚Äôt know why- it‚Äôs not like I miss my dad, but it‚Äôs just fucked up how someone could do that. I had to hang up for a minute because I couldn‚Äôt carry on a conversation. I went my whole life not caring about him being a deadbeat, so why do I feel anything now? I still don‚Äôt care I guess, but what happened to make me feel so bad now? I honestly think it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs the one who asked me. I really do have an amazing girlfriend , and we can talk about anything. Talking to her about it just kinda opened me up.

24,"&amp;#x200B;

1. Changing sleep patterns: restlessness, hot feet, waking up two or three times a night. Feeling tired after you wake up and sleepy off and on during the day. There is something called the Triad Sleep Pattern that occurs for many: you sleep for about 2-3 hours, wake up, go back to sleep for another couple of hours, wake again, and go back to sleep again. For others, the sleep requirements have changed. You can get by on less sleep. Lately I have been experiencing huge waves of energy running into my body from the crown. It feels good, but it keeps me awake for a long time, then subsides. Advice: Get used to it. Make peace with it and don't worry about getting enough sleep (which often causes more insomnia). You will be able to make it through the day if you hold thoughts of getting just what you need. You can also request your Higher Power to give you a break now and then and give you a good, deep night's sleep. If you can't go back to sleep right away, use the waking moments to meditate, read poetry, write in your journal or look at the moon. Your body will adjust to the new pattern.
2. Activity at the crown of the head: Tingling, itching, prickly, crawling sensations along the scalp and/or down the spine. A sense of energy vibrating on top of the head, as if energy is erupting from the head in a shower. Also the sensation of energy pouring in through the crown, described as ""sprinkles"". This may also be experienced as pressure on the crown, as if someone is pushing his/her finger into the center of your head. As I mentioned in #1, I have been experiencing huge downloads of energy through the crown. In the past, I have felt more generalized pressure, as if my head is in a gentle vise. One man related that his hair stood on end and his body was covered with goosebumps. Advice: This is nothing to be alarmed about. What you are experiencing is an opening of the crown chakra. The sensations mean that you are opening up to receive divine energy.
3. Sudden waves of emotion. Crying at the drop of a hat. Feeling suddenly angry or sad with little provocation. Or inexplicably depressed. Then very happy. Emotional roller coaster. There is often a pressure or sense of emotions congested in the heart chakra (the middle of the chest). This is not to be confused with the heart, which is located to the left of the heart chakra. Advice: Accept your feelings as they come up and let them go. Go directly to your heart chakra and feel the emotion. Expand it outward to your all your fields and breathe deeply from the belly all the way up to your upper chest. Just feel the feeling and let it evaporate on its own. Don't direct the emotions at anyone. You are cleaning out your past. If you want some help with this, say out loud that you intend to release all these old issues and ask your Higher Power to help you. You can also ask Grace Elohim to help you release with ease and gentleness. Be grateful that your body is releasing these emotions and not holding onto them inside where they can do harm. One source suggests that depression is linked to letting go of relationships to people, work, etc. that no longer match us and our frequencies. When we feel guilty about letting go of these relationships, depression helps us medicate that pain.
4. Old ""stuff"" seems to be coming up, as described above, and the people with whom you need to work it out (or their clones) appear in your life. Completion issues. Or perhaps you need to work through issues of self-worth, abundance, creativity, addictions, etc. The resources or people you need to help you move through these issues start to appear. Advice: Same as #3. Additionally, don't get too involved in analyzing these issues. Examining them too much will simply cycle you back through them over and over again at deeper and deeper levels. Get professional help if you need to and walk through it. Do not try to avoid them or disassociate yourself from them. Embrace whatever comes up and thank it for helping you move ahead. Thank your Higher Power for giving you the opportunity to release these issues. Remember, you don't want these issues to stay stuck in your body.
5. Changes in weight. The weight gain in the US population is phenomenal. Other people may be losing weight. We often gain weight because many fears we have suppressed are now coming up to the surface to be healed. We react by building up a defense. We also attempt to ground ourselves or provide bulk against increasing frequencies in our bodies. Advice: Don't freak out, but just accept it as a symptom of where you are right now. You will release/gain the weight when all your fears have been integrated. Release your anxiety about this. Then you might find it easier to lose/gain the weight eventually. Exercise. Before eating, try this: Sit at the table with an attractive place setting. Light a candle. Enjoy how the food looks. Place your dominant hand over your heart and bless the food. Tell your body that you are going to use the food to richly nourish it, but that you are not going to use the food to fulfill your emotional hungers. Then pass your hand from left to right over the food and bless it. You may notice that the food feels warm to your hand even if the food is cold-- I like to think that the food is good for me when it feels warm and nourishing to my hand. I have also noticed that when I practice blessing the food, I don't eat as much. It is important not to let yourself off the hook when you forget to bless the food before you eat. If I've forgotten and I've nearly finished eating, I bless the food anyway. That way I don't slip out of the habit. Another thing you can do is to stay present while eating -- don't watch TV or read. Heartily enjoy what blessings are before you.
6. Changes in eating habits: Strange cravings and odd food choices. Some find they are not as hungry as they used to be. Or hungrier. Advice: Don't deny what your body tells you it needs. If you are not sure, you might try muscle-testing before you chose a food to see if it's what your body wants. Also try blessing the food as described in #5.
7. Food intolerances, allergies you never had before: As you grow more spiritual, you are more sensitive to everything around you. Your body will tell you what it can no longer tolerate, as if it, too, is sloughing off what doesn't serve it anymore. You might be cleansing yourself of toxins. Some people find they often have a white residue in their mouth, much like that of runners at the end of a race. Advice: An acupuncturist told me that this film can be removed by sloshing 2 tablespoons of cold-pressed olive oil in your mouth for 10-15 minutes (don't swallow, whatever you do), then spitting it out into the toilet -- not the sink, for you just removed toxins from your body and don't want them in the sink. Brush your teeth and do the same. Then clean your brush. (Sorry this is yukky, but it works.)
8. Amplification of the senses. Increased sensitivity. 8a. Sight: Blurry vision, shimmering objects, seeing glittery particles, auras around people, plants, animals, and objects. Some report seeing formerly opaque objects as transparent. When you close your eyes, you no longer see darkness, but redness. You may also see geometric shapes or brilliant colors and pictures when eyes are closed. Colors appear more vivid -- the sky might look teal or the grass an amazing green. Often I see grids running across the ground. As you become more sensitive, you may see shapes or outlines in the air, especially when the room is almost dark. When your eyes are open or closed, you may see white shapes in your peripheral vision (these are your guides). Advice: Your vision is changing in many ways -- you are experiencing new ways of seeing. Be patient. Whatever you do, do not be afraid. Hazy vision maybe relieved by yawning. 8b. Hearing: Increased or decreased hearing. I once thought I would have to pull off the road because of the painfully amplified sound of my tires on the freeway. Other symptoms are hearing white noise in the head, beeps, tones, music or electronic patterns. Some hear water rushing, bees buzzing, whooshing, roaring or ringing. Others have what is called audio dyslexia-- you can't always make out what people are saying, as if you can no longer translate your own language. Some hear strange voices in their dreams, as if someone is hovering near them. You can either ask the presence(s) to leave or ask Archangel Michael to take care of the situation. Again, there is nothing to fear. Advice: Surrender to it. Let it come through. Listen. Your ears are adjusting to new frequencies. 8c. Enhanced senses of smell, touch, and/or taste. I notice I can now smell and taste chemical additives in some foods in a rather unpleasant manner. Other food may taste absolutely wonderful. For some people, these enhancements are both delightful and distracting. You might even smell the fragrance of flowers now and then. Many of the mystics did. Enjoy it.
9. Skin eruptions: Rashes, bumps, acne, hives, and shingles. Anger produces outbreaks around the mouth and chin. I had a dermatitis on my extremities for several months that accompanied healing an episode from my past. When I had worked through most of the issue, the condition was released. Advice: You may be sloughing off toxins and bringing emotions to the surface. When there is an issue to be released and you are trying to repress it, your skin will express the issue for you until you process the emotions. Work through your ""stuff"".
10. Episodes of intense energy which make you want to leap out of bed and into action. Followed by periods of lethargy and fatigue. The fatigue usually follows great shifts. This is a time of integration, so give into it. Advice: Roll with the nature of the energy. Don't fight it. Be gentle with yourself. Take naps if you are tired. Write your novel if you are too energized to sleep. Take advantage of the type of energy.
11. Changes in prayer or meditation. Not feeling the same sensations as before. Not having the same experience of being in contact with Spirit. Difficulty in focusing. Advice: You may be in more instant and constant communion with Spirit now and the sensation may therefore be altered. You will adapt to this new feeling. You are actually thinking and acting in partnership with Spirit most of the time now. You may find your meditation periods shorter.
12. Power surges: All of a sudden you are heated from head to toe. It is a momentary sensation, but uncomfortable. In contrast, some people have felt inexplicably cold. I have experienced both. More recently I experience waves or currents of energy rolling through me. Sometimes the energy seems so intense when it first comes into my body that I feel a little nauseated. But if I think of the energy as divine and let go of fear, I feel wonderful and enjoy the sensation. If you are an energy worker, you may have noticed that the heat running through your hands has increased tremendously. This is good. Advice: If you are uncomfortable, ask your Higher Power, that if it be for your best and highest good, to turn down/up the temperature a bit.
13. A range of physical manifestations: Headaches, backaches, neck pains, flu-like symptoms (this is called vibrational flu), digestive problems, muscular spasms or cramps, racing heartbeat, chest pains, changes in sexual desire, numbness or pain in the limbs, and involuntary vocalizations or bodily movements. Some of us have even had old conditions from childhood reappear briefly for healing. Advice: Remember what I said about seeking medical help if you need it! If you have determined that this is not a medical condition, relax in the realization that it is only temporary.
14. Looking younger. Yippee! As you clear emotional issues and release limiting beliefs and heavy baggage from the past, you are actually lighter. Your frequency is higher. You love yourself and life more. You begin to resemble the perfect you that you really are.
15. Vivid dreams. Sometimes the dreams are so real that you wake up confused. You may even have lucid dreams in which you are in control. Many dreams may be mystical or carry messages for you. And in some dreams, you just know that you are not ""dreaming"" -- that what is happening is somehow real. Advice: You will remember what is important for you to remember. Don't force anything. Above all, stay out of fear.
16. Events that completely alter your life: death, divorce, change in job status, loss of home, illness, and/or other catastrophes -- sometimes several at once! Forces that cause you to slow down, simplify, change, re-examine who you are and what your life means to you. Forces that you cannot ignore. Forces that cause you release your attachments. Forces that awaken your sense of love and compassion for all.
17. A desire to break free from restrictive patterns, life-draining jobs consumptive lifestyles, and toxic people or situations. You feel a compelling need to ""find yourself"" and your life purpose -- now! You want to be creative and free to be who you really are. You might find yourself drawn to the arts and nature. You want to unclutter yourself from things and people that no longer serve you. Advice: Do it!
18. Emotional and mental confusion: A feeling that you need to get your life straightened out--it feels like a mess. But at the same time you feel chaotic and unable to focus. See #45. Advice: Put your ear to your heart and your own discernment will follow.
19. Introspection, solitude and loss of interest in more extroverted activities: This stage has come as a surprise to many extraverts who formerly saw themselves as outgoing and involved. They say, ""I don't know why, but I don't like to go out as much as before.""
20. Creativity bursts: Receiving images, ideas, music, and other creative inspirations at an often overwhelming rate. Advice: At least record these inspirations, for Spirit is speaking to you about how you might fulfill your purpose and contribute to the healing of the planet.
21. A perception that time is accelerating. It seems that way because you have had so many changes introduced into your life at an unprecedented rate. The number of changes seems to be growing. Advice: Breaking your day up into appointments and time segments increases the sense of acceleration .You can slow time down by relaxing into the present moment and paying attention to what's at hand, not anticipating what's ahead. Slow down and tell yourself that you have plenty of time. Ask your Higher Power to help you. Keep your focus on the present. Try to flow from one activity to the next. Stay tuned to your inner guidance. You can also warp time by asking for it. Next time you feel rushed, say, ""Time warp, please. I need some more time to -----."" Then relax.
22. A sense of impendingness. There is a feeling that something is about to happen. This can create anxiety. Advice: There is nothing to worry about. Things are definitely happening, but anxiety only creates more problems for you. All your thoughts -- positive or negative-- are prayers. There is nothing to fear.
23. Impatience. You know better, but sometimes you can't help it. You want to get on with what seems to be coming your way. Uncertainty is not comfortable. Advice: Learn to live with the uncertainty, knowing that nothing comes to you until you are ready. Impatience is really a lack of trust, especially trust in your Higher Power. When you focus on the present, you will experience miracles -- yes, even in traffic.
24. A deep yearning for meaning, purpose, spiritual connection, and revelation. Perhaps an interest in the spiritual for the first time in your life. ""Constant craving"", as k.d. lang says. The material world cannot fulfill this longing. Advice: Follow your heart and the way will open up for you.
25. A feeling that you are somehow different. A disquieting sense that everything in your life feels new and altered, that you have left your old self behind. You have. You are much greater than you can possibly imagine. There is more to come.
26. ""Teachers"" appear everywhere with perfect timing to help you on your spiritual journey: people, books, movies, events, Mother Nature, etc. Teachers may appear to be negative or positive when you are trapped in polarity thinking, but, from a transcendent perspective, they are always perfect. Just what you need to learn from and move on. By the way, we never get more than we are ready to master. Each challenge presents us with an opportunity to show our mastery in passing through it.
27. You find a spiritual track that makes sense to you and ""speaks to you"" at the most profound levels. Suddenly you are gaining a perspective that you would never have considered before. You hunger to know more. You read, share with others, ask questions, and go inside to discover more about who you are and why you are here
28. You are moving through learning and personal issues at a rapid pace. You sense that you are ""getting it"" quite readily. Advice: Keep remembering that things will come to you when they are ready to be healed. Not sooner. Deal with whatever comes up with courage and you will move through the issues rapidly.
29. Invisible presences. Here is the woo-woo stuff. Some people report feeling surrounded by beings at night or having the sensation of being touched or talked to. Often they will wake with a start. Some also feel their body orbed vibrate. The vibrations are caused by energetic changes after emotional clearing has taken place. Advice: This is a sensitive topic, but you may feel better blessing your bed and space around it before you sleep. I rest assured that I am surrounded only by the most magnificent spiritual entities and am always safe in God's care. Sometimes, however, the fear gets to me, and I call in Archangel Michael and/or Archangel Uriel. I don't beat myself up for being afraid sometimes. I forgive myself for not always sovereign at 3:00 a.m.
30. Portents, visions, ""illusions"", numbers, and symbols: Seeing things that have spiritual importance for you. Noticing how numbers appear synchronistically in your awareness. Everything has a message if you take the time to look. I enjoy the experience of ""getting the messages."" What fun!
31. Increased integrity: You realize that it is time for you to seek and speak your truth. It suddenly seems important for you to become more authentic, more yourself. You may have to say ""no"" to people whom you have tried to please in the past. You may find it intolerable to stay in a marriage or job or place that doesn't support who you are. You may also find there is nowhere to hide, no secrets to keep anymore. Honesty becomes important in all your relationships. Advice: Listen to your heart. If your guidance tells you not to do something, speak up and take action. Say ""no"". Likewise, you must also say ""yes"" to that which compels you. You must risk displeasing others without guilt in order to attain spiritual sovereignty.
32. Harmony with seasons and cycles: You are becoming more tuned to the seasons, the phases of the moon and natural cycles. More awareness of your place in the natural world. A stronger connection to the earth.
33. Electrical and mechanical malfunctions: When you are around, lightbulbs flicker, the computer locks up, or the radio goes haywire. Advice: Call on your angels, guides, or Grace Elohim to fix it or put up a field of protection of light around the machine. Surround your car with bluelight. Laugh.
34. Increased synchronicity and many small miracles. Look for more of these. Advice: Synchronistic events tell you if you are heading in the right direction or making the correct choices. Honor these clues and you cannot go astray. Spirit uses synchronicity to communicate to you. That's when you begin to experience daily miracles. See #30.
35. Increased intuitive abilities and altered states of consciousness: Thinking of someone and immediately hearing from them. More synchronicities. Having sudden insights about patterns or events from the past. Clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences, and other psychic phenomena. Intensified sensitivity and knowing. Awareness of one's essence and that of others. Channeling angelic and Christ-consciousness energies.
36. Communication with Spirit. Contact with angels, spirit guides, and other divine entities. Channeling. More and more people seem to be given this opportunity. Feeling inspiration and downloading information that takes form as writing, painting, ideas, communications, dance, etc.
37. A sense of Oneness with all. A direct experience of this Wholeness. Transcendent awareness. Being flooded with compassion and love for all life. Compassionate detachment or unconditional love for all is what lifts us up to higher levels of consciousness and joy.
38. Moments of joy and bliss. A deep abiding sense of peace and knowing that you are never alone.
39. Integration: You become emotionally, psychologically, physically, and spiritually stronger and clearer. You feel as if you are in alignment with your Higher Self.
40. Living your purpose: You know you are finally doing what you came to earth for. New skills and gifts are emerging, especially healing ones. Your life/work experiences are now converging and starting to make sense. You are finally going to use them all. Advice: Listen to your heart. Your passion leads you to where you must go. Go within and ask your Higher Power, ""What is it you would have me do?"" Watch for synchronicities. Listen.
41. Feeling closer to animals and plants. To some people, animals now seem to be more ""human"" in their behavior. Wild animals are less afraid. Plants respond to your love and attention more than ever. Some may even have messages for you.
42. Seeing beings of other dimensions. The veil between dimensions is thinner, so it is not surprising. Just stay in your sovereignty. You are more powerful than you can ever imagine, so do not entertain fear. Ask your guides for help if you slip into fear.
43. Seeing a person's true form or seeing loved ones with a different face -- past life or parallel life.
44. Physically manifesting thoughts and desires more quickly and efficiently. Advice: Monitor your thoughts. All thoughts are prayers. Be careful what you ask for.
45. Left -brain fogginess. Your psychic abilities, your intuitive knowing, your feeling and compassion, your ability to experience your body, your visioning, your expressiveness all emanate from the right brain. In order for this side of the brain to develop more fully, the left brain must shut down a little bit. Normally the left-hemisphere's capacity for order, organization, structure, linear sequencing, analysis, evaluation, precision, focus, problem-solving, and mathematics dominate our often less-valued right brain. What results are memory lapses, placing words in the wrong sequence, inability or no desire to read for very long, inability to focus; forgetting what you are just about to say; impatience with linear forms of communication (audio or written formats); a feeling of spaciness, being scattered; losing interesting research or complex information; feeling bombarded with words and talk and information; and a reluctance to write. Sometimes you feel dull and have no interest in analysis, lively intellectual discussion, or investigation. On the other hand, you might find yourself drawn to the sensate: videos, magazines with photos, beautiful artwork, movies, music, sculpting, painting, being with people, dancing, gardening, walking, and other kinesthetic forms of expression. You may search for spiritual content, even science fiction. Advice: You may discover that if you allow your heart and your right brain to lead you, the left will then be activated appropriately to support you. And someday we will be well-balanced, using both hemispheres with mastery.
46. Dizziness. This occurs when you are ungrounded. Perhaps you have just cleared a big emotional issue and your body is adjusting to your ""lighter"" state. Advice: Ground yourself by eating protein. Sometimes ""comfort food"" feels right. Don't make any food right or wrong for you. Use your guidance to know what you need at any given moment. Take your shoes off and put your feet in the grass for a couple of minutes.
47. Falling, having accidents, breaking bones. Your body is not grounded or perhaps your life is out of balance. Or your body may be telling you to slow down, examine certain aspects of your life, or heal certain issues. There is always a message. When I recently broke my ankle, I understand that my ankle was taking on what I myself refused to deal with. And that was all of the above. Advice: Stay grounded by taking your shoes off and putting your feet in the grass; even better, lie down on the grass without a blanket under you. Feel the earth beneath you. Get out in nature. Slow down and pay attention. Be mindful about what you are doing. Feel your feelings when they come up. Stay in the present. Surround yourself with blue light when you are feeling shaky.
48. Heart palpitations. A racing heart usually accompanies a heart opening. It only lasts for a few moments and means that the heart is re-balancing itself after an emotional release. I had one episode that terrified me: I woke up in the middle of the night, my heart pounding. I thought it was going to come right out of my chest. It only happened once and was, I understand, a huge heart-chakra opening. But I did check it out. There is nothing wrong with my heart. Advice: Remember what I said about getting medical attention when needed. Consult your doctor about any conditions you are not comfortable with.
49. Faster hair and nail growth. More protein is being used in the body. Too bad we can't tell the body where to grow the hair and where not to grow it. (Or can we? Hmmm.)
50. A desire to find your soulmate or twin flame. More than ever before, the idea that we can have a relationship that matches who we are seems more desirable. Advice: The truth is, we have to be the kind of person we want to attract. We have to love ourselves and where we are right now before we can attract a more ""perfect"" mate. The work begins at home. Here is how I think it works: Hold the desire for this person in your heart, but without attachment. Expect that someday you will meet someone who is more suited to you, but let go of any expectations as to who this will be and how it will happen. Focus instead on cleaning up your own life and being the kind of person you want to be. Be happy now. Enjoy your life. Then you may see.....
51. Memories surface. Body memories, suppressed memories, images of past lives and/or parallel lives. We are healing and integrating all our ""selves"", so expect to have some of these experiences. Advice. Keep in mind that it is best to recall what only what comes to mind, leave the rest alone, don't analyze everything to death (because you will be stuck in the tape loop of infinite issues to process), and feel your feelings as they come up. Ask for help from your guides.

30,"So I'm a pretty worthless guy. No friends, never had a girlfriend, kissless, virgin, you know the works. A while back, I invited a group of coworkers to an escape room because I was tired of being lonely all the time. Things went great, but eventually they all kind of broke off into their little friend groups and left me as the odd one out. So I went back to being lonely. 
 
A couple of my coworkers (both women) even became best friends to the point that they were hanging out literally every day. It made me kinda jealous actually. Eventually they had a falling out. I wont go into details because frankly the entire situation was really stupid and not very interesting, but they fucked each other twice, and they both have boyfriends. So you can fill in the rest of the blanks there. 
The other, more interesting part came to light shortly after the initial fight. See, turns out, one of the girls sells NSFW content for extra money on the side. She managed to convince the other girl to start...""working"" with her, and for a brief period they were ""business partners"", for lack of a better term.
 
Turns out the veteran content creator came out of the whole ordeal much worse for wear. She was constantly sulking, making depressing social media posts and generally just acted like the world was falling apart around her. Frankly it was childish behavior for a grown woman, but i couldn't help but be bothered by it. Nobody seemed to be talking to her though, maybe because they were uncomfortable with her line of work, maybe just because they didn't want to involve themselves in the drama. Who knows. So I did something on a whim that I never could have foreseen myself doing. I asked her out to dinner. Not on a date or anything (I mean, shes already proven herself to be a cheater anyway, let's not gloss over that), but just as friends. For some dumb reason, she said yes, and we went out. 

I basically used it as an opportunity to sulk for myself, and unload all of my emotional baggage onto her (including how bad it felt when nobody wanted to befriend me at work). Part of me wanted to turn it into a sort of victim olympics, and explain why my lonliness was far worse than hers, but we wound up finding a surprising amount of common ground. Obviously the nudes became a topic of conversation, but there wasn't much more to be said besides ""I needed the money"".  After a lot of talking, and airing out our grievances, I guess we just bonded over our suffering. Eventually we looked at each other, and she said ""I just lost my friend, everybody probably hates me now, you don't have any friends... why don't we be best friends now?"" 
 
My heart kind of fluttered a bit, I don't think anybodys ever said anything like that to me. So of course I had to say yes. We got to talking about what kind of activities we're going to do together. We just signed up for a dance class that starts next week. 
 
So yeah, I'm best friends with an e-thot now. What a strange pair we are.",13Mar2020,1
31,"I have to get this off my chest. Sorry if this is a strange subreddit for this, but I didn‚Äôt know where else to put it.

Has anyone noticed that you seem to get upvoted/downvoted based on how popular your opinion is? This has bothered me for some time because you can be so respectful, receptive, and nonjudgmental, but you‚Äôll still get downvoted just because more people disagree with you than agree with you. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to be punished for thinking differently than other people when you‚Äôre being so cordial with it.

I personally upvote someone‚Äôs comment that I‚Äôm having a debate with, even if I disagree with them, just because they took the time to have a discussion with me and were friendly.

32,"  Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",13Mar2020,1
33,"I know I should have implemented every precaution that I'm putting into place right now 2 weeks ago.  I had blind faith in the United State's competency.  I may suffer because of that.

I'm not a hypochondriac, I'm a realist.  I've had extreme fatigue, a dry cough and intense lower back pain (that lasted for only 4 hours) in the past 2 days.  I do not have a fever.  I do not know if I have coronavirus.  I do not believe I do yet, but I will continue to act like I do unless I don't develop a fever within the next several days.

I work at a convenience store, so of course I am in constant contact with people.  I can not afford to quit.  

There has been one confirmed case within 20 miles of me.  I know that there are much more.

Today was hard. Really, really hard. Not in a work sense or anything, but I guess in a shell-shock/coping way? I had a horribly vivid nightmare about what happened Friday night, which kind of set the tone for my day. I could not stop thinking about it, except while balancing my checkbook. I guess the numbers helped clear my mind, I dunno. 

It was at its worst toward the end of the work day. I had gotten stuck in a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù loop and grew so sick to my stomach that I nearly threw up about three times. I was thisclose to breaking down in the back room, I‚Äôm not sure how I was able to come out of it. 

I wouldn‚Äôt wish what happened to me on anyone, ever. I‚Äôve felt nauseous to varying degrees all week, my appetite is gone, and I swear I can *feel* his fucking hands on me sometimes.

45,"I‚Äôm not going to get into too much detail, but last year of school, during the fall, felt like some of the happiest times of my entire life, and then that winter and spring were some of the worst in my entire life. With hindsight, I can see that I had underlying issues in the fall that kind of exploded that winter, so I wasn‚Äôt really as happy as I thought I was at the time, but in the moment it felt so amazing sometimes when those issues weren‚Äôt showing themselves. I have some pictures from those times of some of those ‚Äúhappy‚Äù moments, or at least, I used to.

I finally got up the urge tonight to delete them. In them all, there was a commonality of one person. One person who made me feel so happy in the fall, but who would later make me feel so much self-loathing in the winter and spring, it was so bad that I‚Äôm still not totally over it. With all of this self-loathing, those ‚Äúhappy‚Äù times aren‚Äôt so happy looking back, rather they‚Äôre terrible, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to delete the last remnants of them due to a mix of, fear and nostalgia, I guess. But I finally did it.

Looking back at those pictures would only ever bring me pain, any happiness that may have been associated with them is forever gone. I‚Äôm now able to see through the fake happiness in them that I thought was real, and so seeing them only dredged up issues I‚Äôd rather not dredge up. It was a difficult decision, because despite the pain association with those pictures they were still technically memories, but I figured they‚Äôre memories that are better left behind anyways. I‚Äôve been making plans to escape my painful last recently, and this was just one part of that, and finally, I was able to do it. I was finally able to free myself from the hold those pictures had on me, and hopefully, I‚Äôll never ever see them again in my entire life.

I hope I made the right decision in doing this, I hope I won‚Äôt regret it later, but for now, I‚Äôm so glad I was finally able to press the delete button on all of them. Because they represent a first step for me. The first step to starting over.",13Mar2020,1
46,"So I was working in night shift and I realized that the key to my home is missing in my pocket. Searched my bag and all the places that I've been that day but I couldn't find the key. But there was a possibility to still get a duplicate of that key from a friend who lives around 2 KMS from my office. But the problem was I had two locks which I was using interchangeably and only one of them I have given her the duplicates and I wasn't sure which one I used that day. It was 6 in the morning and she ain't picking the call. I waited for an hour and I got a call back from her. I told her about it and she said come to my flat I'll give you the keys. I walked all the way up to her apartment and was stopped at the security. I forgot the flat number and they ain't letting me in. I called her and she told me the flat number and I got in. NO! She didn't. She didn't pick the call for another half hour cause she was sleeeeppping! And after 30 mins of my futile attempts to reach her I somehow convinced the guard cause I vaguely remembered the flat was on fifth floor and they let me in. I got in the lift and reached the fifth floor. NO I didn't cause the power was gone half way through. And I got stuck there for 20 damn minutes. Mean while I thought every damn possibility of how I ended up dying here. But then after 20 minutes of yelling and banging the door I somehow got out of the lift. And found out I was just at forth floor. Then took stairs and reached her flat. Rang the bell. No I couldn't. Cause she disconnects her bell every night. So I was banging the door while all the neighbors were watching my ass. But fortunately at the same time she saw my missed calls and called me. She opened the door and I said you are so insensible and careless person. And she said she was sorry that she dozed off. She told me to calm down. No nothing happened as such. She yelled at me and said I am not careless YOU ARE CARELESS. you lost your keys not me. I left. Took the stairs and walked two KMS to home and finally tried to open the lock.

Not in like a dead or alive sort of the way, but you are everything that makes a great partner. You are so kind and so compassionate. You communicate with such honesty and sincerity. You are so supportive of the people around you, even when you are going through so much yourself. 

You have expressed with me how you feel about your age and being a single father, and tbh I don‚Äôt care about your age. How you take charge and take responsibility for parenting your daughter is one of the things I love about you. Not everyone gets to be so lucky and you made sure that luck didn‚Äôt have anything to do when it came to your daughter having a loving father.

I love that you love board games, videogames, fantasy books and other nerdy stuff. Not because of what they are, but because they mean so much to you. Your passion and creativity is so infectious. You put the pop and color in a world full of greys and cubicles. 

You value a person for every part of them. What is important to them is important to you. You learn to love the things that others might hate about themselves. You love a person for the whole individual they are.

I wanted to tell you whenever the world felt shitty and I started becoming a cynical bitch, I always thought about you lol. I would always shrug it off and think, ‚Äúwell at least there‚Äôs people like Derek‚Äù 

Derek, anyone would be lucky to come home to you at the end of day. To gossip with and diet with. To watch random Anime with. To play games with. You‚Äôre so cute. You‚Äôre so sexy. I can never see you as a negative in someone‚Äôs life. I can only see you adding worth.

65," Honestly idgaf how big headed its gon sound but im ahead of everyone in everything. Taste, mindset, general outlook on life, knowledge, no one comes close. Ive met lots of people and know their capacities, they will never come close. But now, the problem is that

I dont use Instagram and other stuff. And i feel like im fucking 90 cuz of that. I have never posted a pic of mine, and it makes me feel so awful. I hope that im wrong but i think that people unconsciously overlook me cuz of that, meanwhile tho i feel like a fucking god around them. Thanks god i at least dress well, but even that dont satisfy me. Cuz honestly i can do way better but im just forced to stick to the generic clothing thats sold in the malls. The reason is that i literally dont know where to get certain items, again not trying to sound cool, but they aren't necessarily too popular to be sold at malls. But fuck it, it aint about clothing.

Ive noticed that im always angry because of that. One of The reasons why i dont use these platforms is that it makes me anxious It makes me anxious, cuz what if i wont get enought likes?? (As an example) I feel so fucking awful cuz of that. Always angry. It drives me nuts

I lowkey punch the screen when i see others faces on it, it fucks me up so so much. Im tired of everyone flexing. Like who tf brags about their taste in music. Like you know how they be posting screenshots of tracks theyre listening to? I hate that, like who gives a shit. And yes, again even in that, i have broad knowledge, i listen to tons of great music and i even produce it, but no one knows it. It fucks me up.

I know that i might sound so annoying, but looking at my life rn, thats like the biggest mental problem i have. Constantly thinking that ur lacking something, mixed with the feeling of being above others creates so much frustration and anger in me. This hatred lowkey is always accumulated in me, ready to explode. In a weird way i do feel like that its like a build up to something climatic, but god knows if its gon be me fucking others up or putting that emotion into something positive.

Again, i really dont want yall to come at me saying that im narcissistic and thats my problem. Like honestly, HONESTLY, i do know what im capable of, and what others are too, and yes, maybe the things i said about myself werent put together in the most mature way, but i swear its all facts.

Whenever im out in public, i want to start a riot. Start a fight, i dunno. Its so bad and damaging for me. Imagine being constantly frustrated.

At least i feel powerful in real life, again honestly, im pretty attractive and can feel the attention from everyone, but these days i think that social media has way more influence on how ur percieved compared to how you really are. And it again fucks me up. Want to tear everyone apart.

The only way i see my life going is concetrating these havey emotions and my ambitions into my goal, of becoming someone really successful and famous. And i mean after that at least i will use instagram and shit, i know it sounds stupid, but thats the only way for me. And thats why in a weird way i partly enjoy being the way i am, feeling the way i feel, no one has this much fire. It can help a lot",13Mar2020,1

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to.

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

I'm relieved to say that China is now over the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak with life returning to relative normality. We are all teaching online, but the stores are open again and there's more people out and about smiling, interacting, and going about their business. For the first time in months, I am personally feeling happy, healthy and confident about my future in this country. 

However, I see that what I have been experiencing for the past two months is now steadily being repeated around the world and it's causing a creeping panic. I'm not one for false positivisms. I can't say it's going to get better because to each their own (and own government). However I do want to root YOU on as you try to pull through this situation. I've been there, it sucks, and it might suck for a while. All that said, here are some (hard!) lessons I learned over from being locked down in China for 2 months that I hope might help you.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Don‚Äôt internalize** **your** **feelings, find social support and vent!** I‚Äôm going to be real. Cabin fever is one hell of a ride.Yes, I was scared of the coronavirus but the situation also left me feeling frustrated, powerless, hopeless, bored, paranoid, restless, anxious, angry, apathetic, isolated, claustrophobic, misunderstood, and depressed for weeks on end.¬†Reach out to your friends and family, use SAFE online support message boards like Big White Wall, or call crisis hotlines like Lifeline. Don‚Äôt let those feelings brew up in side of you because stress CAN affect your immune system.
* **Focus on achieving small daily tasks for yourself.** For me, the days began to blur together and sometimes I felt like there was no end in sight. Have daily tasks but also add variety to them. Try new exercises, cook healthy and different recipes, or play mentally stimulating games (crosswords, board games). You won‚Äôt be feeling good about your situation, but at least you can feel good about yourself.
* **Limit your daily coronavirus media intake.**  You don‚Äôt need to know every single thing about the coronavirus. Step away from Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, FoLearn how to protect yourself (CDC), learn about the most important updates concerning your local area, but just stop obsessing about the latest theory. 
* **And speaking of obsessing, chill out about the toilet paper!** 75% of the world doesn‚Äôt use it anyways. Filipinos use a bucket; the Japanese use a bidet. Unless you get diarrhea or the sniffles during this, YOU DON‚ÄôT NEED THAT MUCH TOILET PAPER
* **You don‚Äôt need TP, but you DO need food****.** Don‚Äôt rely on fast food, eating out, or delivery services. Eventually the restaurants will close and worrying if your ordered meal is contaminated is no fun. While your neighbors are on the hunt for toilet paper, start stocking up your freezer and pantry! Buy in bulk, because let‚Äôs be real ‚Äì you don‚Äôt want to go back to grocery store for a long time. Please practice social distancing! See [a related post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/fhysk7/20_meals_i_cooked_and_the_ingredients_i_used/) for some of the meals I made and ingredients I used that lasted me this time.
* **Accept your limitations** **and ask for medication.** Every person is wired different and sometimes your brain has a way of taking over ‚Äì no matter what you do for yourself. Please know it is perfectly normal to ask for antidepressant/anxiety medication. Everyone is looking for a vaccine for coronavirus, but in the meantime, let‚Äôs not forget depression is a disease too which CAN BE TREATED. Despite having done my MSc in this area, I admittedly have spent far too much of this lock down suffering because I was too proud and ashamed to ask for any sort of help. But what was the reaction from the old Chinese doctor when I finally did ask? He was proud. He said ‚Äú90% of Chinese should be seeing a psychologist and be on medication right now, but they let face (stigma) stop them. You Americans, you know what you need and you seek it out. Taking care of your mental health is just as important as your physical health.‚Äù",13Mar2020,1

82,"I could use some outside eyes on this for perspectives sake. This has to do with a relationship that never truly reached the level of being partners, but seemed to be more than friends. This is a long one, so please bear with me.

So I had a friend who is poly. We met at work. She saw my IWW pin. We found out we were both Anarchists. She invited me over to her house to hang out many times, we would go out for food or coffee once in a while, text a little, etc. 

One time after eating out, she tells me that she thinks I'm cute, and that she has a crush on me. I tell her that I like her as well, she is beautiful, and I'm happy that she told me feelings, since I was content just being friends and was likely never going to push the issue. I figure at this point that it's time for us to start dating.

Something to point out here: I am a virgin. Also, I have never been in a relationship before. I am almost 30. This is probably because I have been painfully shy and introverted for most of my life. In fact, this woman was basically my only friend.

Anyway, I expected that we were going to start to become more intimate (holding hands, cuddling, kissing, talking about our intimate life details and our pasts, confide in each other, etc.), eventually leading to physical intimacy. 

There were several occasions where she invited me over, I got dressed up, put on some cologne, made sure I had a condom in my pocket, and tried to mentally prep for sex. Then...it turned out that we just had the same kind of evening that we had had before we expressed our mutual attraction for each other. Forget the sex, we never even advanced to holding hands. We did hug at least. This was the only time that we ever touched, was a hug goodbye.

On one occasion, we hugged for a good minute straight. I wondered if the problem was that she was waiting for me to make a move, but I would never try anything if it didn't seem like the other person wanted it; the last thing I want to do is be a pushy man, pushing the boundaries to satisfy my wants. After the hug, I finally express to her that, if possible, I would like to expand the scope of our relationship. We clarify in texts later that I mean sex. She explains that she is currently waiting a certain period until she is sure she is out of the incubation period of a certain STI, so sex where she is penetrated is out of the question until then, so I suggest pegging. She tentatively agrees for some point in the future.

However, shortly thereafter she explains that her primary relationship is on the rocks, and that she doesn't actually have the space for a new relationship with me like she initially thought she did, though she does express that if such a space does open up in the future, we should definitely pursue one, and she would like to be friends for now.

At this point, I am happy either way. After all, I might not be her partner, but at least I will be one day.

I've never been to therapy, so I don't have a diagnosis here, but sometimes I enter what seems like manic episodes. I am all keyed up, I make rash decisions, it's like I can't think straight. During one such episode, I told my friend that I was ""obsessed"" with her.

Jesus Christ.

I know, I know.

Why would I say that? I think perhaps I thought that it was akin to saying ""you're my whole world, baby, you're my everything."" I'm not sure. I...wasn't thinking clearly. I don't know.

Whelp, she tells me that that made her concerned, but we chalk it up to ""new relationship energy.""

During this time, it feels like I am filled with my love for her. I want to be the best potential-partner I can be for her. I start coming over to her place more, a couple times I bring her coffee at work (thinking it was a nice surprise. I mean, I get my coworkers coffee all the time, so why not for my loved one?). I want to interact with her more. I comment on all her posts on FB.

On a certain post, she makes a cryptic comment. I ask about it, she tells me to message her. I do. I ask if it's an inside joke kinda thing. She says it is, then asks ""is that OK?""

A weird response, I think, but I say ""of course.""

Then she says ""I think you really need to step back.""

I am flabbergasted. What? I don't understand. I don't know what I did, but the last thing I want is to do anything that would cause her pain or discomfort, so I quickly try to explain myself along the lines of ""I'm sorry, I didn't realise this was a personal thing, I literally thought it was an inside joke and that you were fishing for someone to ask about it.""

She tells me that she thinks I am commenting too often on her posts.

I am now in full manic-panic mode. I need to do something to fix this. I delete the comment that started all this. She is taken aback, says that she didn't want that, she just meant that she wanted me to change in the future.

I then proceeded to go through and delete every comment I ever made on her posts, and remove every like.

Then I told her this, that I did this because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable, and since my comments were doing that, I needed to get rid of them.

I next thought that I should show how authentically I wanted to make sure I couldn't upset her in the same way again, so I unfriended her. Can't respond to posts that I can't see, and I can't upset her with my responses if I cant respond in the first place. Well, that would be rude to only unfriend her, and leave everybody else. After all, all those other FB friends were lesser in my eyes than her. So I unfriended everybody. I told her what I did.

It felt as if her next response drove the final nail into my coffin. She said that I had problems, that I needed to get help, that she couldn't be the one to help me.

I was despondent. I was depressed. I was suicidal. I cut myself. At least I had the shame to not tell her about this self-harming episode, and as long as I am able I never will.

I was at the highest point of my life, and in the span of a single day, I was at the lowest. It seemed like a depth that I would never recover from.

After a few months, she reached out. She said that, if what happened was indeed because of an episode of mine, that she was willing to try to reconcile, to be friends. We messaged a little. She explained some things, like how she had a history of being stalked, so what seemed like loving behavior to me were red flags to her, and that, even though she told me that we should become partners in the future, she didn't really mean that, that she really just wanted to be friends (which still confuses me, because when I asked whether she was mistaken when she originally said that she liked me, she said that she wasn't, she did like me and have a crush on me).

It was too painful, though. I couldn't take it. I needed to just excise whatever part of me was still attached to her. It was the only way to end the pain.

I deleted our chat logs, any pics she had sent me, and blocked her on social media.

Fast forward 10 months. I'm on tinder, failing as usual (this particular issue is for another subreddit), and I see that she has an account, and she has liked me. I am filled with emotions. Why? Does she just want to extend the pain, just when I thought I was over it? But what if she wants to reconnect?

I like her back. We talk a little. She immediately expresses her regret. She apologizes. I apologize. She wishes that we could be friends again. So do I. I am hopeful, but cautious. We friend each other on FB. I make sure to very rarely like or comment on her posts. I only message her weekly or every other week or so.

That is where we stand now. We haven't seen each other in nearly a year. Frankly...I don't think I can ever ask her to meet with me irl. Perhaps if she asks first, but me? What, and risk coming off as a creep?

After this fucking ridiculousness on my part, my pathetic passive-aggressive behavior, my neediness, etc., I wonder what the verdict is. AITA? No, I kid. I would just like to hear what you might have to say about this. If you could help me to point out my failings, so that I can learn and come to better myself, I would appreciate it. Obviously I am aware of my passive-aggressive behavior with deleting my FB comments and all that.

Am I right in thinking that part of the issue was out of our hands (the misunderstanding about how she thought we both understood I would never be a partner, and how I thought we both understood that I would someday be a partner), and part of it was very much my fault (my manic episode (actually, would that be my fault? Certainly not seeking treatment is) my manipulative behavior, etc.)? It also seems as if part of the issue may have been one of conflicting time requirements. She was my only friend, my only loved one. I wanted to spend as much time as possible with her (tbc, I never saw her more than once a week, but I did message her every day). To her, I was only one of several relationships she had to manage. As they say in the poly community, love is unlimited, but time is not.

Something that has stuck with me to this day is this: why did nothing ever happen between us? Why did she treat me like a platonic friend, even before the cracks started to show, during the period when we were in that strange limbo above friends, before she told me that she had to rethink starting a relationship with me? Was she...expecting me to do something? Me, the painfully introverted shy loser virgin? What, did she expect me to grab the back of her neck and force a kiss on her? Also, the fact that she most likely has fuckbuddies (I have gathered this from conversations with her), people who are not partners but she still has sex with, still irks me. Back when times were good, why did she never have sex with me? Was I (am I) a joke to her?

tl;dr I ruined my one and only ""relationship"" (more than friends, less than partners). I would like advice on what I did wrong, and how I could do right in the future with other people.",13Mar2020,1

89,"First as a kid till 7th grade I was abused verbally and physically by my father until my mom divorced him.
When I was in elementary school I was the smartest kid in school and always got As but my parents never acknowledged me and were like ‚Äú okay ‚Äú . And never came to the party the school do for kids with higher marks in school. I saw kids parents giving them flowers and gifts and I was alone . in my 7 years of having high marks my mom came only twice and was late. And I only got a gift once, but turns out all my siblings had gifts too so I wasn‚Äôt special. I‚Äôm school I was bullied A LOT but never physically . I never had friends in elementary school and kids where always making groups and tell other kids not to talk to me. So I go to my class once and everyone ignoring me. Teachers where nice but never did anything. I had my hair short and they were like YIKES u look like a boy and that was in 1st grade ( I‚Äôm in 11th grade now )and I still remember , the supervisor scolded them but I was really hurt. When I told my mom about it she just told me to ignore them and they‚Äôll eventually stop ! But they never stopped . I learned how to defend myself the hard way and I developed anxiety , depression and trust issues . 
Now I live with my mom . She makes me and my sister do house work and my 4 brothers DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and the worst thing they trash the house . They throw socks everywhere and shoes in every corner of the house and I‚Äôm the one supposed to clean after them. They don‚Äôt respect me and sometimes hit me and my mom doesn‚Äôt say anything but when I curse them out she tells me to respect my older brothers ? THE FUCK ? My sisters are another level of asshole . They don‚Äôt have any problems with cleaning after my brothers or anything but I have a problem cuz it‚Äôs not fair ?

Why don‚Äôt u be like your sisters ?) cuz I‚Äôm an individual human being with individual character ?

95,"I'm on mobile so some things may be spelled wrong and all that. Plus, I start to vent more and more, some of the things get spread out a lot, and some things do repeat. My apologies in advance.

Everyone knows about the coronavirus but all the things that are having to prevent it doesn't make sense. It's getting to the point where I'm actually get worried about everything.

Where I live, currently no one is affected by the virus. But towns and cities around me are getting infected. I know currently here in America there's not that many people infected, but there are still people infected.

Especially with living in Texas, in one of the biggest states, with a big population, with big cities around seems kinda terrifying now. I know I'm safe and so is my family and friends, but the decisions and actions being taken don't sound right to me.

People who are infected are still traveling. Some people don't have school for a few weeks while some schools are just done with the semester. People are advising people to stay home. Events and other public events are getting cancelled.

They basically want people to stay home. But you know what isn't closing to make sure people don't get infected? Churches and other places where older people go to a lot. Young people, or just people who probably won't get infected. Or if they do get infected it won't be as bad compared to a young child or older person getting the virus.

Once again, I know I'm safe for now because I'm not a child or a older person. Plus, I don't have a bad immune system. But, I still have very young cousins who could get infected and still have very much alive grandparents on both of my parent's side.

I'm just pretty worried about them. I'm even kinda worried about the other people who go to my school and even strangers.

I know the coronavirus isn't as bad as the flu. And I kinda wish all the panic over the virus would actually calm down because things seem to be going badly, or may go badly. 

For example, people are panic buying so some people probably don't even have some things they need need. Events are being called which is making people upset and angry even though people who are not old or very young go to.

Some people probably can't even make money so they can't support their families and probably don't have enough food or supplies right now. And no one is doing anything about that. But letting a virus spread probably quicker is totally okay, but we let all these other things go unnoticed and just ignore them.

It feels like the government is using the virus to make it sound really bad and scary so they can cover something up. Or maybe something else. And Trump doesn't want to get tested for the coronavirus even though he's been exposed to it. 

Everything seems so chaotic and saddening in a way. Nothing really makes sense now. It feels like we're just all puppets being controlled by politics as puppeteers. I feel like we're actually not getting the truth. It feels like something is being hidden away that we aren't allowed to know about. It feels like we can't be safe no matter what now, so we're just doing what we're told. 

I really want to know what's happening. I want to actually know why all these things are happening even there are better ways to prevent the virus. I want to know why people are making the virus such a big deal to the point where that is THE NEWS WE MUST KNOW almost every single second. I kinda fear for my safety and others now.

I know some people may get upset at me for my opinions and what I think. So my apologies. 

Also, my apologies again for this being so long.



TL; DR: I'm kinda worried about the coronavirus and the chance of it hitting where I live or my family. But I really wish so many things weren't cancelled because some are unnecessary. People panic buying is really bad now since so much stuff people actually need is getting sold out. Things seem extremely chaotic to the point I feel like others and my safety is possibly in danger.",13Mar2020,1
96,"All, 

I have finally solved my bad breath issue after over $2000 of wasted money and hundreds of hours of research. For those of us who have, or who have had bad breath, if fucking sucks on every level. Below is what I have gone through, and the solution to my problem. I will try to keep it short and sweet, but its been about 3 years of work. 

The moral of my (everyone has different issues) solution is: Get rid of the food and bacteria in your mouth on a 2x a day basis. Doing so creates an environment in your mouth that keeps the good bacteria in check and the bad bacteria from stinking your mouth up. 

**Analysis:** 

Starting out I noticed the bad taste in my mouth was coming on every 3-5 hours and would smell awful. I would have to eat something or brush my tongue to get rid of it for the next 3-5 hours. I had no clue where it was coming from or what the issues were. 

1) Went to my Dentist: No Cavaties, no gum disease, nothing wrong with my tongue. 

\- They told me to make sure I was not over bushing my teeth, or using mouthwash more than 1x per day. They said doing so would strip your mouth of its natural flora. 

2) Went to a top Ear Nose Throat doctor. Nothing wrong with my sinuses, nothing wrong with my throat, no oral thrush. 

\- The ENT doctor prescribed me antibiotics, anti fungal, and magic mouthwash to take separately to see if any of them would solve the issue.  None of them solved my bad breath long term. If anything they made it worse. 

3) I eat very healthy and am in good shape. So we ruled out a poor diet or poor life style as the cause. Diet and exercise can been a book but I will keep it short. 

4) Went to my pediatrician. We discovered I am a-lot gassier than the average human and am prone to diverticulitis. So he told me to take Align Digestive Probiotic, you can get on amazon. He told me to take it everyday for at-least 4 weeks. I am currently 3 weeks in and it has helped a ton with my overall digestive health, and may be one reason to my breath drastically improving. 

5) The doctors  were able to help me rule out issues that were not causing bad breath. This really allowed me to focus in on that the bad breath was still coming from the back of my tongue every 3-5 hours. 

**Solution:** 

Knowing that I did not have any major issues I took it upon myself to figure out why I was getting terrible smelling breath on the back of my tongue. I began to learn about the tongue and learned that the tongue has several different types of hair on it. Specifically Filiform Papilliae (FP). FP help with digesting food and act like the hairs on a cats tongue. If they are not properly brushed, they will not naturally detach from your tongue and they will grab all of the food you eat and keep the food on your tongue. When the long FP hairs grabs the food on your tongue, it creates a thick mucus that is a cest pool for anaerobic bacteria. The anaerobic bacteria break down the clumps of food on the back of your tongue and release a sulfur, shit smelling smell as they are breaking down the food. After noticing the back of my tongue had longer than average hairs on it I knew this was the issue. 

BRUSH, FLOSS, CLEAN THE BACK OF YOUR TONGUE. ITS THE BREAK DOWN OF FOOD PARTICLES THAT CAUSED MY BAD BREATH. 

**Nighttime Routine (Most Important)** 

1) Brush for 2 minutes (Ive tried every toothpaste under the sun. I now use a generic crest toothpaste) Make sure you get all surfaces of your teeth. 

2) Brush your tongue with tooth paste and make sure to get way the hell back there. I gag for sure. 

3) Floss using the hugging method. 

4) Use an Orabrush to scrape your tongue. Dont be too aggressive but do it until your tongue looks white and you stop scraping off gunk. I do it 6+ times.  

5) Rinse and gargle with a mouthwash. I use Pro-fresh, or Listerine now. 

**Morning Routine.** 

1) Brush for 2 minutes 

2) Brush/Scrape my tongue 

3) Take an Align probiotic

4) Leave and kill the day.",13Mar2020,1

99,"Hi friends!

I hope you're keeping well. I don't usually come here, but this felt like a good forum to just share some tips on how you can orient yourself around the chaos of these times. I hope this finds anyone who needs to hear this.

# Humanity has an opportunity to shift, and evolve into a higher version of ourselves. This includes you.

This coronavirus chaos is *polarizing*. Some people are going to use it to move deeply into doomsday scenarios, paranoia, blame, judgment, xenophobia,  and aggression. They will be moving psychologically backward.

There will be some people who will refuse to engage. They'll hoard resoures, hole up at home, hold their breath, brace themselves to just wait and *just get through all of it*, and come out unchanged.

But then there are people like you and I who have the chance to *stay grounded, stay sane, and breathe through this whole experience.* We're keeping our wits about us. We're staying mentally online. We're being smart about what we do, but we're remembering to smile and relax.

When we stay present and grounded through this, then we allow fear to arise and complete itself without getting mentally caught up in it. We allow it to be processed as an energetic experience, instead of staying locked up in our minds.

This is how we evolve as people.

Many of us will be evolving rapidly in these times.

# Remember the Now; Dwell in the Now

This will sound weird, but follow me here:

Remember that there's only the now-moment. Everything that has ever happened, happened in the Now. Anything that *will* happen will happen in the Now. The Now is all there is. A still, vast, wide arena in which all of this drama is playing itself out.

All of our wars, famines, diseases, disasters have all played out in the Now. The Now itself is indestructible, just as silence itself cannot be destroyed.

Ground yourself in the Now. Observe the Now in which all the chaos is playing itself out. Let everything arise that's arising, let everything go that's going. Witness all of it without judgement, just pure acceptance.

As this happens, choose what actions you'll take and take them. But drop all negativity about it. Your negativity is not useful now.

# Keep your humor about you!

See if you can remember laughter throughout this whole thing!

See if you can have some fun. What opportunities do you have now if you're staying inside to isolate yourself? Let's turn this into the world's biggest sleepover!

# Stay with your breath

When all else fails, just breathe slowly through your experience. Nice deep breaths. I sincerely believe that all is well and will continue to be well.

All the best!

104,"I work in the service industry in a location where there have already been confirmed COVID19 cases. People are fucking animals, so every day I deal with people coughing around me without covering their mouths and then handing me money or whatever. Just a lot of really unsanitary behavior.

Schools around me have been shut down, but there is no sign that nonessential businesses are going to be hit by the same restrictions any time soon. I am from the US in an area where they've done very little testing but I have to imagine the disease is already getting a foothold here.

Unlike a lot of Americans in my situation I have been lucky and careful enough to be able to save a decent chunk of money. I could live off my savings for months without any income and be fine.

That being said, I like my job and would like to keep it, but if I were to announce that I'm not coming in until this virus has passed it is very unlikely that they would allow me to come back afterwards. Even though it's a job I like, it is not irreplaceable.

I imagine that within 2-3 weeks this area is going to be put under quarantine as people wake up to the severity of the situation, but in that time the chances of me being exposed to the virus seems unacceptably high.

Am I over reacting? Should I #StayTheFuckHome? I guess I just want some second opinions on this whole issue. I'd like to have a job to return to, but from everything I've heard this is a miserable illness to catch and I'd like to avoid that as much as possible.",13Mar2020,1

I am indeed a Christian, I‚Äôm a lesbian so I don‚Äôt hate gay people. I think women should have control over their bodies. And I don‚Äôt think the world is 6000 years old lol. 

So if you have any questions let me know. I‚Äôm not a good apologist for Christianity, so I can‚Äôt really answer why God does the things he does, but I‚Äôm trying to spread the word because I care about you particularly, whoever you are out there. GOD LOVES YOU YES YOU!

So there‚Äôs that, I love you all.

TLDR: Christ died for your sins, repent, Believe in the gospel. Do what you will with this info, I‚Äôm just planting seeds. God will do the rest in your life!!",13Mar2020,1
109,"To be honest memes used to be a common ground on humour I used to share everyday. Isolating myself meant losing track of all of that. My interest changed drastically after I shut myself indoors, and it's getting close to an year for that, and about 3-4 years I have had time to meet up with my friends. Social media is the worst thing to look at when you're not doing much with your life, but is a great tool to connect with people when lonely. But I guess it's neither for me since now neither do I genuinely care about others' lives nor am I able to interact with anyone to help myself.",13Mar2020,1
110,"I've spent the majority of my life as a consumer; someone who just experiences media created by others, whether that's TV shows, movies, video games, etc. For the longest time, I've been content with that fact. I'm not popular or famous in the slightest, but my life is simple and one I can handle on a regular basis for the most part.

However... I'm wondering as to whether or not I should break that mold and try to produce a form of media myself. Now obviously, I'm not about to go for anything out of my league here. I don't have a college education and don't intend on obtaining one, so an indie game or a novel is the most plausible form of media I could create at the moment. Other than a redistribution of how my free time is spent, there would be no immediate drawback to this either. I have an unrelated source of income in the form of a retail job that sustains my current living situation, and I don't plan on spending any large amounts of money on the creation process (at least to start, that is), so it would really just be a matter of putting the effort in.

Problem is that my immediate interests tend to wander a bit. The longest I've been focused on a single project was a little over 2 months before I either scrapped it or had my attention drawn in by something else or another idea. I believe it might be due to Asperger's Syndrome - which I was diagnosed with as a teenager, and which is known to cause intense bouts of interest in very specific activities and subjects - but that's besides the point.

Since the start of 2020, I've been trying to be more productive than idle, and I've been making a great deal of progress now that I'm an adult and have a vast wealth of knowledge at my fingertips thanks to the Internet, but I'm still wondering what the general consensus here is. Should I try and overcome this mental hurdle and focus on my own creation for once, or should I be content to sit back and watch others do the same?",13Mar2020,1

121,"I'm a Game Master at an escape room within commuting distance of a major city that has seen confirmed coronavirus cases. Our town has been canceling major events, including elementary/high school/college attendance. I am begging y'all: PLEASE AVOID ESCAPE ROOMS DURING THIS TIME.  


We've been seeing a lot of cancellations, thank god. But random folks are still booking in some of those cancelled slots, bafflingly. My boss isn't willing to shut down the business entirely just yet, which I think is irresponsible, as we are a MAJOR germ vector.  


I want to stress that an escape room is, when you boil it down, a place where your objective is to *touch as many things as you can* to solve puzzles. While we're ramping up our disinfecting protocols in the wake of this virus, I want to stress that **there is literally no feasible way to disinfect every object in an escape room.** This is because:

* People in escape rooms touch far more things than what is relevant to their objective. Sure, they have to touch keys, locks, door knobs, important props. But they also touch random props, run their hands around every door frame, feel up every structure, and poke and prod random things that do nothing. There's some escape rooms that purposefully have players interact with things in ways that cause contamination - How many escape rooms have microscopes to peer into? How many pink eye cases have resulted?
* On busy days, there isn't enough time to be thorough with cleaning. Reset on a busy, mistimed day can be as short as 5 or 10 minutes. Imagine rearranging a whole room full of knick-knacks and locks and keys within 10 minutes, it's already very difficult. Add disinfecting the room to that? Impossible. We have extra GMs on cleaning shift but it's STILL impossible to hit every possible prop and surface with a Clorox wipe or a Lysol spray in that time.
* People do gross stuff in escape rooms. They sneeze/cough directly on stuff. They bite their nails while they're thinking. I've seen nose-pickers, hoodie-string-biters, thumb-suckers, and heard people say ""Should I put my mouth on this?"" People are BAD at puzzles and WORSE at common sense.
* The Game Masters that are resetting your room hardly have time for pee breaks on busy days, let alone 20 seconds of proper handwashing in between each rushed reset. The people who touch the most props are US, and we're risking cross-contaminating everything in our hurry to keep things on schedule.
* Just like every person with rent to pay, Game Masters also come into work sick, while managing symptoms with meds. Then we touch every object other people touch as part of our jobs. Of course, it's the business's policy already that GMs stay home if they're sick/contagious, but that hasn't stopped my coworkers in the past from coming to work anyway.

In conclusion: Please just don't go to any escape rooms right now. If you already have an appointment for your local escape room, call them and ask for a refund or (better) a voucher to come back when all this dies down. If they don't offer either of those options, they are not worth supporting, in my opinion. Support your local escape rooms by buying gift certificates and merchandise, but please don't physically attend this germ vector activity at the moment. The risk factor is way too high. On busy days, we probably get around 200 people of all ages coming in and out, touching everything.

Well let's go with the basic assumption that God has made us all equal as per our karma and has intended us to do good for others as well. Now see what went we started becoming too big for our boots and took the law into our own hands. We started doing harm to others wasted or time in scheming and plotting to get things more than others. Wasted or life, energy and time doing things that did come natural to us or was warrented by us. Now things are getting complicated we want more ... More ... And more. In search of more we started to loose things we didn't know about also... Like love, companionship, grace, novelty etc. We just wanted more so we got more of jealousy, hatred, lies, bitterness...

I feel a lowlife compared to other people, especially because I feel like I lack validation. Yeah, everyone needs validation, especially if they are feeling shitty. Can you imagine going to the therapist and not being listened to?

Also, I'd like to say something: our government ordered us to stay at home unless we have to work, buy groceries or any urgent health related issues.
Well, I see people going out to run or walk, and nobody fucking tells them anything.
If it was ME doing that, I'd probably get yelled at (don't get me wrong, I am staying home).

I mean, the orders from the government seem clear enough to me, but people are interpeting it however the fuck they like, doing their daily jogging.

Friends and family are acting like I'm making a bad decision, saying they would stay home all day if they could and not have to deal with people.  Some of them make 100k so I don't think they have really considered the tradeoff, which is not being able to afford many luxuries (where I live disability pays enough for lowincome rent + groceries + fast internet + a good phone and phone plan + $400 leftover to split between spending and savings each month so I saved and got a gaming PC as well).  I can't afford a vehicle so need to take the bus for groceries and when I need to go downtown to get my injection (for bipolar 1), I can't afford vacations, since I chose to budget for internet I can't have a TV (though I can torrent shows so it isn't a big loss).  I would also rather be working because I feel alienated not being around people most of the time.  I also wish my living conditions were better, I have some anxiety about coronavirus because where I live most people have some kind of chronic illness and hygiene for most isn't very good (you can smell BO in the halls sometimes), so I'm worried if any of them get it the whole building will become infected.

I don't express myself and I experience so many feelings. I want to make something beautiful but I feel that I don't have the ability to do so. I want to participate, I want to know how to celebrate life, to be close to the right people and to do something that makes me happy. 
What can I do that can help me find my way? I find myself longing to befriend people that are unreachable for me. I feel a need to create something but something's stuck. Please advise me.",13Mar2020,1

159,"Hi everyone as the title saids I'm turning into a really bad person but I don't feel the need to change it. I'm becoming more blunt in my speech, I regard other's feelings less and less unless I need something from them, I'm starting to become more comfortable with doing immorale things and generally I don't really care for the well being of others unless it benefits me in some way. Heck with all this Coronavirus scare going on I should be panicked or saddened that society is drastically affected but I'm not. I really couldn't care less if people died and I couldn't care less if they suffered I only care if me and the people I like suffered.  


As a kid I always wanted to grow up to be the good person, a person who spreads positivity, goodness, and help others but as an adult I realize that I also want to do it while receiving some sort of benefits. I also realize that a lot of people won't really help nor care for me and that I must offer value to myself in some way for people to be interested in me, I'm starting to just assign value to people and what they can give me, I tend to dismiss people with low value points to me.",13Mar2020,1
160,"I'm turning to reddit because I have been so fortunate in my life to not have grown up around death - the only death which has affected thus far me was another grandparent, in my early 20s. I haven't had any friends or colleagues pass away. I know I am lucky.

I have grown closer to my grandfather in the last few years, especially since his wife (my grandmother) suffers with Dementia and was moved into a care home 3 years ago. Since then, every fortnight I have met my grandfather and accompanied him to visit her. I almost enjoyed seeing him more than her, he's a hero in my eyes.

Now my parents are telling me to 'prepare'. How do I do this?",13Mar2020,1
161,"Hey guys and gals,

Before reading the following, I will recommend you to read the link below for background info.

Congratulations, you finished the story.

So, yes, I have school breaks from the Coronavirus.

This morning, New Client's wife, the Boomer, asks me to change her channel. I was in my room, the 70 sq ft room, sleeping. She nags me to turn on the TV and start spewing her filial piety BS and wanting to kick me out of here. I stay strong for a while, pretending to not know. I even said to her,

""Hey, why don't you ask your caregiver, Phuong Tran, to just turn on the damn TV. She knows, she know how to switch the TV to Youtube TV for you.""

And you know what Miss Bossy Phuong said, ""OHHHH, it is not my responsibility. Whoever stays in this home has the responsibility to help you \[NC's wife\].""

God, I wish to just ship the two of them of to some sagaland in Boomer Town and live there until they die with their wallet fat-full of Social Security money.

""You need to be filial with me."" - NC's wife

F you, why do I have to be filial to you? We live in America, not some Sinosphere countries.

Phuong Tran, if I have to privilege to meet you when I become the next Elon Musk, I will remember the day that you slap me in the face; and shove my dad down. I will remember that time that you stand close to me and try to grope me when I am 12. I will remember you that time when you brought your husband over and try to scam me by selling a ""virus"" Malwarebytes for $15 (It was in a Ziploc bag labeled Malwarebyte with scotch tape over it. )

Goddang, First Gen Adult Viet Kieu are crappily annoying, they don't know a single thing, and they think they are god of the world or something. Now, Second-Gen is a good bunch of citizens, they know how this society rolls. I like them and the third-gen (about my age) are probably the best generation.

I read somewhere that if people stand up together and stand up against filial piety, challenge the notion to its core, it will collapse like a House of Cards.

I know that NC's wife will passed away because she's 85, but Phuong, if you still live then, I will prove to you that I am not a loser, I will prove to you that YOU are the SCUMBAG LOSER. Look what you made me out of, mistreat me and bury me down, but I will rise and show to you that I can change your mind. When I hold a stack of money by then, I will remember YOU, and I will laugh at YOU back, for treating me like s\*\*\*.",13Mar2020,1
162,im literally crying right now. idk if its my period or whatever but for almost a month and a half now i have been working out 6 days a week and eating so much better but i have gained weight instead. i am 5‚Äô3 131 pounds and i used to be 127. i know its not a lot but NEVER in my life have i been over 127 for this long. i eat protein after working out. i eat breakfast i eat fruits and some veggies. i have smoothies. i have a cookie sometimes. and nothing i have gone up. im so upset. i so consistent and yet i havent lost weight. im just so upset. i know weightloss is over time not in one month snd certainly not by ‚Äòspring break‚Äô but for fucks sake i havent gotten anywhere and i still feel gross and unhappy. i wanna quit but thats just gonna set me back more. i want to keep going but i feel so damn stagnant. im literally GAINING weight like what the fuck. i know im not fat but i have felt so much better before. and im eating like clean vegan not my old junk food vegan self. im so upset.,13Mar2020,1
163,"Nothing brings me enjoyment anymore. I can‚Äôt afford anything I want to do. I can‚Äôt afford to go to the doctor. 

Every skill I‚Äôve tried to learn is too hard, every time I revisit it I get the bad feelings from before again. I hate being poor, being worthless with no skills mean I deserve to be poor.

I want to die so badly, but I always have a glimmer of hope that it‚Äôll get better

It‚Äôs been three years, and it still hasn‚Äôt gotten better. How much longer must I suffer",13Mar2020,1
165,"I had my cat since 2009, and it's about to turn 11.

I'm just so broken about the fact that it doesn't have long to live. Apparently the average lifespan of a household cat is between 13-17 years. that means I don't have that much time left with my cat.

My cat was always with me ever since I was young, and the fact that I don't have that much time left with it makes me cry.",13Mar2020,1

168,"I've always thought of myself as okay or good at things. Not that I'd never get low confidence. That happened a lot, actually, but I just always had a healthy sense of self. Just some low confidence here and there, nothing much.

But I've been realizing what an ugly person I am, both on the inside and on the outside. I look too skinny, my glasses make me look ugly, I'm too pale, my hair is a mess.

But other than that, I feel like I'm completely boring, because I'm secretly bitter about things.

For example, I focus way too much on finding a girlfriend. Am I good at that? No. I can't accept advice, I'm too picky, I can't approach someone, and I try to blame the world for my problems when I fail to get in a relationship due to my lack of a real personality.

I'm tired of being too ugly. I'm tired of having moments where I think I'm the hottest, coolest, smartest guy on Earth, only to then realize I'm having delusions of grandeur.

Nobody sees this cool guy I see. They see an awkward, lonely, ugly and maybe even creepy nerd.",13Mar2020,1
