1,"This is hear because I wasn't allowed to post on AITA and didn't know where else to put it. 

About 8 years ago my uncle was busted for watching CP. Apparently his online activity was being monitored and it eventually came out that he'd been watching it for some years.

He was arrested, his children (my cousin's) interviewed, and he went to court. But he wasn't sent to jail or anything. For the record, I sincerely don't think he ever touched his kids precious kids. 

I'm not supposed to know about any of it. Nobody really does - nothing came out in the media. They are an extremely proud family, and his wife was predominantly concerned with the impact it'd have on their reputation. 

I only know about the situation  because my aunt was so distraught at the time that she let slip to my mother, who then told me and my brothers thinking that we wouldn't spread the information. I didn't, only told my husband. Anyway, as such I don't know the details of what happened in court, and nor does my mum.

Fast forward all these years, nobody says a word about it. His kids seem to have forgiven him. They've continued their insular, self-serving lives, treating my grandmother badly before she passed away a couple of years ago. Now, his daughter is getting married and her fiance worships him.

Fine. Man's a pedo, hopefully he's got the help that he needs. 

But now there's a baby in the family, my other cousin P's toddler, and I feel myself raging about it. I tense up when P decides to change his son's nappy in my uncle's presence, I watch him and judge him as he watches and plays with P's son, and I keep bringing it up and telling my mother to tell P (there's a language barrier between us and I'm not quite sure how to say it). 

Mum's reaction: ""Oh, but I really don't think he'd ever do anything (to P's son). I said that's not the point, what if he's thinking weird shit? 

Brother's reaction: ""Oh come onnn. We don't know if he's actually a pedophile or if he's ever done anything  to someone"" and he implies that I'm stirring up drama. I try to explain my thought process, and the severity of the issue. 

If I'm honest, no one actively remembers or really cares. 

AITA for trying to get my family to acknowledge it as a big deal? Am I just being jealous and petty and unforgiving, sticking my nose where it doesn't belong?",21Jan2020,1

3,"Hello and thank you for dropping in.
I really need your help.

I am a guy with extremely low self esteem. So low in fact that I'm usually too afraid to mention it to anyone but my girlfriend, who has lost every inch of hope in me.

That's why I'm posting this. I know it sounds pathetic, but I need to read something positive about me. That someone believes in me, even if you don't know me.

Currently I am trying to push myself into 5 things:
1. Talking to a therapist
2. Mass-applying for jobs
3. Going outside more (alone because no friends)
4. Restoring my girlfriend's hope in me
5. Making my girlfriend feel appreciated, acknowledged and loved

If you have the time I would love to answer any questions you might have. It makes it easier for me to think about finding solutions to these things whenever I get to talkand reflect on them.

Thanks and good night.",21Jan2020,1

Bc were all friends I like want to know about it and I also feel left out and jealous but not actually bc I don't want to have sex with them or anything it's just weird having your 3 good friends now enter a new sexual relationship you're not a part of and now whenever were all hanging out I feel like the Vibe is different idk if they realize but,,,, anyway.

Today i was remembering all the people from back then a d decided to check his social media.

He has a freaking kid!!

When I tell you I was shook... This was the guy that used to describe his future as ""a rich, single guy that sleeps with whoever he wants until he becomes an old man and finally settles"".

He was the last person I imagined with a kid, I am really impressed and I still can't believe this.

10,"I’ve (18f) been dealing with my brother who is an addict for over 5 years. He’s had to get a heart valve replaced because of an infection due to used needles, he’s been in an out of the hospital constantly. He always lies to my family, he’s stolen from our family. 
Everyone says “he just needs to hit rock bottom and then he’ll realize he needs to get better.” But he has; multiple times. I’m not going to go into detail with everything he has done because I don’t know if he has reddit. But I’m so lost with what to do. He’s a 27 year old guy still living with him mom (my dad and her are no longer together.) I love him with my whole heart but I don’t want to see him dead before he gets the chance to have children or get married or before I graduate college. I want to see him succeed but he can’t do that with the choices he’s making.
My brother also sells weed and posts about it on Snapchat. And I do not mind him doing this at all as long as he is employed and not doing anything else but smoking marijuana. But I almost want to turn him into the police anonymously. And I don’t know if I’m wrong for even thinking this but maybe if his actions have consequences he’ll finally realize he needs to change? Please tell me if I’m a shitty person for thinking this is the only thing left to do. I’m lost and i want my brother back.",21Jan2020,1

16," 

I'm  not sure why I'm here or typing this. I dont expect much or even truly  care for the outcomes. I suppose to some small part of me, I see this as  some form of venting. Here I am, sitting in my room on my day off,  feeling as exhausted and drained as ever, and finding some form of small  comfort with my phone.

None of you know me. Who knows if any of you are even reading this, but I dont really care, because that isnt why im typing this. I'm doing this because, well, I dont really know, but I always found comfort and writing and this seems to help.

I can rarely recall a period in my life when I was happy. Genuinely happy. Sure there are laughs and some good times but those are as temporary as snow in winter. Truth be told, I've never had much of an easy life. This isnt some attempt at seeking pity or me bemoaning my existence, it's just fact really.

As a child, I grew up to a household filled with arguments and beatings. I'm not sure why my father behaved like that really. One moment he would seem fine, and then suddenly the oddest things would set him off. We had to learn to tiptoe around those triggers....the main idea was always not to get him upset. 

Can I really blame my mother for leaving him? No...not really, but I feel I can never forgive her for the method of it. I can understand the idea of cheating, but to do so with his friend seems a bit too far. Perhaps the biggest joke in this all is the fact that he turned out to be more abusive than my father. For a time we were with my mother, and her new husband would be sure to beat on her or beat on us in order to punish her. Funny really...her taste in men is quite terrible. Eventually she would disappear from our lives and my father would return, the broken man that he is, and he simply couldnt handle three children. 

By this time I was 8 years old and already understood more than most 8 year olds would. I knew the world wasnt a happy place and that choices had big impacts. I knew that other families were not like mine, and my friends were likely not having to worry about such ideas too.

Oh and I'm gay. Pretty amusing how these things workout isnt it? Not only did I have to deal with the chaos that was that home, but also the confusion of my sexuality which I noticed at such an early age. It wasnt until my later before I would accept it. 

Eventually my father would have us sent over to another country, far off in some third-world location. He would send us to his family, whom were already paying the majority of his bills as he could barely keep down a job even before the divorce.  It first seemed to start off fine but you could tell something wasnt right. There was a certain...tension to the air. I certain wrongness that blind-eyes were being turned to. I would only discover later that unfortunately my situation would not be getting any better.

We lived with my grandmother and father's siblings. In these third-world countries, it is almost natural for families to keep together, what with low incomes. I would later learn that they wanted us to cut off all communication with my mother and become angered at the very mention of her. We had to accept that she was a 'whore' as they put it, and should we not agree then we would be punished. It would be over a decade before I spoke to her again.

My uncle was quite the tyrant and would wait for my father to leave before exploding in fits of anger in the household. Eventually the fights and brawls would continue. My father with my uncle, and then my other uncle and my rather formidable sister with my uncle. The household itself was filled with a constant sense of despair that was near to suffocating, but sadly I was trapped and couldnt do a thing until I was older.

During all this, I was also attending a foreign school, where my accent did not help. Along with my, sadly, classified as 'feminine' behaviors made me become quite the pariah. Being called 'gay' and a 'fag' was quite common for each day, and denying it become meaningless after some time. You eventually become numb to the insults and even the attacks, or at least I did. That was the only way I could learn to survival this all, to become numb.

My acne was terrible, sadly a side-effect of my sensitive skin and near constant stress. I was additionally overweight, of which weight issues continue to plague me until today. I had very little positivity to focus upon.

This life would continue for 15 years before change could come.

I began to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts and after dropping out of university. I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety disorder and began to take treatment to manage it. Thankfully in doing so, I was able to push through.

The conflict in the household had reached a peak when my sister, so recently divorced, returned to the home with her year old son. It seemed history was doomed to repeat itself, as I looked into that boy's eyes and pitied that he was here now too. The arguments reached a crescendo to the point of breakdowns, and I suppose that was when it happened.

I stood up to my father and what he was doing and struck back. God it felt good but so terrible at the same time. It was at that point I knew it was time.

I was able to get back into contact with my mother and, with the few savings I had managed and finally flew back to my birth country. I was roughly 24 years old. I would later learn that running from your problems doesnt escape the demons within.

I was able to finally clear up my acne at 24. I began to try and get my life together, haunting by the depression and anxiety I feel. My father would end up following my brother and I to Australia and appeared at our doorstep. It would seem the family had gotten sick of his tantrums and bought him a ticket to come back. He doesnt do much but lay on the sofa watching the television. His mental state continues to degenerate.

When I was younger, I made a pact with myself that if by 30 my life had not finally gotten on track, that it would be best to close the book on it. It isnt madness really, it is just frankly logical, and I find it difficult to argue against the logic. I'm currently 29 years old. A few months ago I got a job I could be more proud of that has potential for growth, but then I look around me and see those barely on the cusp of 20 at the same job. Those individuals that were able to have a backing and basis to grow. That had the ability to bloom so much earlier in life and now are living a dream I so desperately wanted at that age.

I look at these people that walk upon a smooth, straight, and sunlit path to their goals, while I am climbing a steep and jagged wall in winter trying to reach the same. I see the sands in the hourglass I turned for myself running out and I reflect on where I am.

I have never been in a relationship, simply because I find I cannot bring myself to connect with people to such levels. I'm rather negative at times, of which a friend of mine at work recently told me that she hates whoever made me so bitter. I struggle constantly with my weight, even when i've been on a diet plan for such a time...I just cant seem to manage it. I'm constantly depressed, even with my medication, because I see myself at a point where it is too late to progress further. I am back to caring for a difficult father and secluding my sexuality among the bigots i'm surrounded by. 

And here I am, on my day off, in my bed, typing this out. I dont want to go out and just want to be to myself, reading and writing. 

That is me, congratulations if you read this far, but as I said, that was never my concern. I will very likely not be reviewing this post later, but do as you like.

17,"The doctor told me I'm a healthy young woman. I feel good. I just want to be healthy and free. I feel free right now despite going to work but I love the silence in the house. The warmth in my room. 

I still think about my ex but I learned that I am far better off than taking a chance in getting a permanent std or getting cheated on. 

When I read a woman on instagram, she disclosed herself .. it was scary and her bf told her.. he loves her.. and she was fully vulnerable and he took out her darkness and put her into light.. I don't have anything now but even disclosing my past sexual health it is scary.. doctors told me I don't have to since it's gone.. but my counsellor told me I should. Since tables turn you want them to tell you their health situation so it won't infect you..

I feel bad about my ex and I. I almost took off without telling him, I got infected by him. I hated him so much that moment, I wanted him to rot. But I couldn't do that.. cause the doctor told me if you like him.. get both of you cured.. I tried.. but the counsellor told me he will reinfect and cheat on you again. He was going to reinfect and cheat on me. I ended it before that happened. He won. He got to fck me, cheat on me, and give me a disease. 

I couldn't take myself out of there. If it wasn't for my counsellor.. I probably got cheated on badly and infected again.. probably uncurable.. 

I'm lucky enough to be cured today and living in peace. 

I just wish I can watch out for myself and not associate with bad people.",21Jan2020,1
18,"So I got off work early tonight and was struck by a wave of existential dread.  The world is going to be unlivable in 50 years or so, at which point I'll be 75.  First off even if I do manage to retire at all how much does it suck that I only get a few years to myself when I'm old and frail, probably needing some kind of care?  Second who the HELL wants to be 75 in the fucking apocalypse?  If I can even afford to live at all by then there's a good chance some ass hole will either rob me blind or rip me off behind my back since some ass hole always does that to the elderly.  Even If I can live in safety and comfort I'll be to frail and sickly to do anything.  

So I came up with a plan.  For now I'll vibe and save my pennies.  Then when I'm 40-60 years old I'll quit my job and do what I want.  Then when I'm done I'll give the rest of my money to my niece and off myself.  I likely won't ever have kids or a spouse since I don't think I'll ever want any so I won't be abandoning anyone.

The end is near. Why would I wait for this. Why not just simplify and end my misery now. 

I ask the question: why is death not an option for me to take?

Why would I want to see the end of the world? Why would I start a family knowing that only suffering is coming? There are so many things wrong in this world.",21Jan2020,1

Don't worry, there's a TL;DR at the end of the orginal post.
Anyway, after I made this post, I got a comment that I thought was hilarious so I posted to Facebook (no link just a vague text post) and the main person of interest in the equation took a sharp left turn into scorning me for posting about my issues on social media and somehow involving them when that was not the case at all. 

So they also posted to a sub Reddit, then plastered the link to their sub post on their personal Facebook profile with me tagged in it, completely stripping my privacy on the matter while the link slanders me for the subject at hand.

Long story short, without reading the entirety of the other post, I'm moving out with my s.o. but my s.o. and the roommate were friends and now I feel like I ruined a friendship by just.. existing.

35,"About 18 years ago I was in Wiesbaden Germany living with my parents bagging groceries at the local commissary. During that time I was getting fucked up a lot. Had been for pretty much most my life. At that time I was 27. When I arrived in Europe it was to escape the law. My parents were trying to get me sober by having me see a psychologist but I wasn't ready. During all this, I was singing all over the place. Everywhere I would go I would sing like a lunatic. Little did I know this place was huge for music. All my crazy singing paid off because I started making contacts on base with a few of the guys. I was pretty damn good at singing. I was powerful as all hell. I was singing r &amp; b. Mainly R. Kelly. That's around the time his 12 play album came out. After a few people wanted to be my agent I ran into someone who was a huge rapper back in Brazil doing stuff like c and c music factory. He was working with a studio off base that was trying to put together a group. It was going to be me him and the producers' wife. She was a singer then I was the second and BG who was going to rap. He hadn't been big in years but he was still thirsty for it. We did one single and it was called yoki yoki ye which meant much love in an African dialect. The producer was from Ghana. Get this, his last name was Soulman. After the single Adam the producer told me that they were going to drop the rapper BG and just use me and his wife. They were going to turn me into like a thug rapper-singer type and they said my voice was kind of like Rick Ashtly if you remember him. This fit me fine considering I was in a gang when I was younger.

 During all of this some strange things started happening to me. I was listening to my radio and I received a message that said I was going to be famous. I just shrugged it off as a fluke. I had been paranoid for a long time but I just attributed that to the drugs and crazy lifestyle. I had moved from bagger to working as a house meister at this catering center on base across town and I only lasted at that job for like 3 days. Those 3 days are a blur. I stayed drunk. My ego was out of this fucking world. I thought I was going to be the next big thing and I  was just partying my ass off because I was the shit. It didn't help that my reputation was pretty good because of the singing. People would stop me and ask me to sing to them. This one girl told me I made her toes curl up. I was on cloud fucking nine and completely out of control.  In those three days I was living at the job in what used to be an old officers club It was huge. It had a pool table and everything. I honestly felt like I had already made it famous. On my last day there I had been up all night drinking and when I went upstairs to help clean I got told I smelled like alcohol. I told her, ""bitch, leave me alone. I have to clean this shit."" or something. I don't remember this time well. Anyways that was a general wife and I got escorted out by MPs. My Dad came and picked me up and I was simply in denial. The next day I went back and broke in thinking I had to get the place ready for the day. I was completely out of my mind in what I now know is a manic episode. My boss Nick came and escorted me out and gave me a ride back to base. When he dropped me off out front I asked, ""Nick, am I fired?"" He said yes and I got out. I fucking lost it. I was hearing voices telling me I was jesus and that I needed to go to the gas station and get a job. It was horrible. Totally fucking weird. I walked past this guy and looked him dead in the eye and did that cross sign out in front of me like I was the pope blessing him. It was bad. 

After all the dust settled I was going to Drs to find out what was wrong with me and they couldn't determine wheather or not it was mental illness or drug induced. I still wasn't convinced until one night I was watching tv and The people on tv were reacting to my thought. I tried to prove it wasn't real by sneaking out around the tv and jumping in front of it grabbing my crotch. They all moved backward in shock!!!!!! I immediately woke up Mom and Dad and told them I was being like Aunt Pat. She's schizophrenic. I was now convinced I was crazy. I tried to go back to work as a bagger but I was in such bad shape I just couldn't do it. During this time as well I was told to go to AA so I was. I was finally sober. The meds I was on made me gain 50 to 75 pounds in a months time and I had quit talking. I think I was in shock after going through all that plus I was still very bad of mentally. 

Dad decided it was best for us to go back to the states so we did. He did that for me ya'll. Best parents in the world. I put them through hell my whole life. Arriving back in Alabama I asked myself if I should get fucked up or keep going to those meetings and since my brother wasn't getting high anymore I'd keep going to those meetings. After five years unmedicated in sobriety I tried to become a cop but lost it again and finally got diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar type. That was the first day of the rest of my life. I finally started to grow as a human being now medicated. You have no idea the difference meds can make. During this time I still wanted to be famous so I was writing songs on guitar and doing open mics around town. It was fun. After a while of being depressed because I just couldn't seem to make anything out of my life I finally filled for disability. Best decision I ever made. I finally found stability about three years ago. Around that time I also gave up on guitar and songwriting because I just became convinced that I'd never be famous and I just put it down for good. 

Well, just befor Christmas I got a sound system for my car and have been listening to some of the old music I was listening to that I used to enjoy. It reignited a spark in me. I started thinking about beats and wondering if I could make some. This eventually led to two weeks ago where I downloaded this music making app. I've been practicing everyday and I'm loving it. I fairly certain I'll never be famous but now I'm enjoying the ride with contentment in my life, good friend, 18 years of sobriety and a little bit of the old me back. Took me a while. Thanks for reading all this if you did. I appreciate it.",21Jan2020,1
36,My cousin had a snake bite early last year . Since then I live in constant fear . I’m never comfortable as I constantly think there’s a snake somewhere. I avoid  parking my car under trees because I believe there might be snakes up the tree . I check my car underneath the seats before driving . Sometimes I keep checking under the sofas at home or avoid  my bed entirely  because I start thinking ‘what if ‘ there’s a snake.  I know it sounds really unreasonable but I can’t help it . I’m constantly moving furniture in the house to check for snakes .  I don’t know if I’m going crazy,21Jan2020,1

At some point people will realize that Twitter doesn't matter. The sooner that happens the better.

For whatever reason, our elites and media are convinced Twitter is very important. Nothing is worse than getting criticized by the peanut gallery. Twitter can end careers, cancel television shows, bring down elected officials.

That power quickly turned from, ""complain about lost baggage on Twitter and get an airline ticket voucher for $50"" to ""I demand anyone I disagree with be exiled to Elba.""

The truth is Twitter already doesn't matter, like, at all to almost everyone. Ask your aunt or brother-in-law about what's trending on Twitter and you'll get a blank stare.

I have failed 14 attempts of suicide, bad at everything and nobody loves me, so literally escapism is the only option for me to choose for keeping myself to be happy. I still consider suicide as an option, but I no longer want to think about it, because I will fail again and feel sad about that again and again. I don't want to have that experience again.

45,"I was disappointed about something today and my boyfriend shut down and became in a bad mood. I wasn’t disappointed about anything that had to do with him or because of him but he has trouble with conflict and if I have any mood except for happy it makes him stressed, upset and withdrawn. I feel like I can’t express any negative emotion around him or come to him for support or affection if I have a negative emotion. He was upset saying, “god, this early? Really?” And saying he can’t spend all day trying to cheer me up and he wasted enough time already but all he did was ask me a couple of questions about the thing I was disappointed about I also answered those questions with no malice or upset to him. I was ready to do stuff together today and me being disappointed about this wasn’t going to have any impact on the rest of my day but he said we shouldn’t go to breakfast because of my mood and rolling his eyes at me and saying if I have a right to be upset about something he has a right to be upset too and just because he’s upset at me that I’m upset doesn’t make a difference. I felt sad and started crying which makes him more annoyed so I went to the shower to cry. All day he made small comments about it and keeps saying he hates the atmosphere and saying it’s my fault the atmosphere is like that and getting angry again and ignoring me if I got upset that he was angry at me again. I feel like I have no one to rely on for emotional support or to comfort me when I’m sad. Idk how to get over it and not take the things he says to heart or to not care that he doesn’t seem like he cares when I’m upset. He really does love and cares about me and it makes him feel bad when I feel upset but since he’s so bad with conflict it comes out in a bad way. Also when we are good we are amazing.

47,"I have been very busy and was not able to pleasure myself for the past 10 days, but last night I had a few hours to myself so I decided to spend some time with myself. I started off by rubbing a generous  amount olive oil all over my body, slowly massaging every part of my body I could have possibly reached with my hands. I spent about 15mins in self massage, and then I started to play with my balls, they felt so full and heavy and I enjoyed about 10mins massaging both my balls. My body was completely oiled up, slick, slippery and I felt so good, high and was in a sensual bliss. I then started rubbing oil on my asshole and started to feel even more horny, I stuck my middle finger inside, I kept going in until I found my prostate and then I kept rubbing and fingering my asshole until I had a rib shaking orgasm, twice once with one finger and then with two finger. My asshole was satisfied and my cock was drooling in watery fluid and it was rock hard, now I started paying attention to it, started stroking and massaging my cock in different ways, playing with my balls, stretching, pulling and stroking. I edged and edged for about another hour. I had edged until precum was drooling and then went back, and then got myself hard again and this time it would be hard to resist, I was feeling so good, with all the oil, the massage and the prostate orgasms and I knew this time there is no return, I stroked and stroked, soft and slow, hard and fast and kept stroking and stroking until pleasure and bliss. It was the most intense orgasm ever, my whole body was shaking and it lasted about 6 to 8 seconds seconds. I busted a load of thick, heavy cum all over my shredded body and then laid there on the oil, cum and other fluids for a few minutes and looked back on the filthy deed I had done..

48,"I was going to post this in r/dating_advice, but felt it started rambling too much. I would see a lot of posts there where people complain that ""it happens when you aren't looking"" doesn't work, and I was hoping I could provide some context for what it really means. The nature of the post didn't feel right for r/CasualConversation, either. I feel like I'm still processing the whole situation and haven't really been able to talk about it the way I want to with anyone else, so I figure I need to just get it out and relax a little.

So, I (25M) was single all through my college years. In that time, I definitely used multiple dating apps with minimal success. I tried multiple platforms and maybe had two actual ""dates"" in about 5-6 years, one from Tinder and another through a friend. I just had a hard time connecting with anyone I met this way. It's possible that I had some social anxiety that caused me to put up a defensive wall of sorts to protect myself from the pressure. There were often times where I would get pressure from a friend circle to find a girlfriend or get laid and the like. It never helped and never worked. I was at the point where I would actively refuse help or dodge a situation.

I (finally) graduate college and move out on my own. I'm now separated from the friends I made in college, though we still communicate fairly regularly. I quickly realize I need to get out and do something before I become a complete shut in that only goes to work and sleeps. I track down a nearby amateur racing group through some connections, find a local karaoke bar I can visit occasionally, and find my way into the non-collegiate theater scene. Over the year after graduation, I do more and more stuff for myself. I occasionally take myself out for nicer dinners. I'm going camping/off roading with a new group of friends.

Here's where the first one happens. I'm out at a bar post-show with my recent theater company. I show up to the bar after most of them arrive and sit down. Almost immediately, one of them quietly informs me that one of the gals in the group is into me and single. I figure out which one she is and more or less carry on with my evening because *I don't know what I'm supposed to do*. The night ends without anything happening. I hang out with the group a few times as my other hobbies allow, and I believe one of the couples in the group was trying to help set us up. I saw her a few more times with the same group, but nothing really came of it. My schedule made my appearances with the group random, so I eventually went back to doing my own thing elsewhere.

All this time, I've been good friends with another girl I met four years ago when I first started theater. We wound up in the same work place for a while, did several shows, hung out a bunch with both mutual friends and just the two of us. We were close, but never an item, much to the dismay of several mutual friends. She had feelings for a couple different guys over the years, but maybe one of them was considered serious, though none of them stayed that way for long. I met her parents, which didn't register with me at all because it wasn't the first time I'd met a girl's parents without dating her, plus meeting them was mostly circumstantial. I became sort of a close family friend, with adoption jokes eventually getting thrown around.

I was open to the idea of dating her, and did develop some feelings towards her, but largely kept them to myself. I knew there were a few key preferences of hers that I didn't check off, so I largely figured I was out of the running. I know this because at one point, her sister, who we'll call ""M"" and was on board the ""you two date already"" bandwagon, drunkenly informed me that, when M asked why I wasn't an option, the response ""because he isn't \[preference checkbox\]."" That was fine with me. People have preferences and I can't hit them all, plus I'm not about to lie about who I am.

It's worth noting that I am still on dating apps this entire time. I haven't zeroed in on this girl and gotten tunnel vision. I choose to hang out with her because I enjoy her company as a friend.

Fast forward, I've been graduated and doing my own thing. Sometimes I go over and help her parents with a few things because I like working on cars and we're good family friends. She graduates, and we occasionally hang out as time permits. I'm still on Tinder, and eventually Bumble, but still not seeing all that much success. At this point, I'm actually pretty satisfied with my situation. I'm working, I have hobbies that help me unwind, and I have friends I see semi-regularly. 

So shortly after new years, I'm invited out for a round of indoor go karts with her and her family, plus her youngest sister's boyfriend (also a mutual friend from college). Of course, the only thought going through my head is *""fuck yeah go karts, I love racing.""* So we do that, then go for a late lunch. It's casual conversation and nothing particularly out of the ordinary. We finish up lunch and the two of us head back to her car, since we all somewhat drove separately. 

And that's when the bomb drops. We get into her car, I shuffle the race gear I brought *(because of course I brought my own helmet)* into my lap. She kind of signs, looks at me, and says *""do you wanna date?""*

I'm completely thrown off. I had, up to this point, rationalized and accepted that she wasn't into me that much.

Fortunately, I didn't balk for too long and just replied ""sure,"" which then led to the brief and slightly awkward *""you're serious? Yeah. Oh shit we're actually doing this""* conversation. 

I guess my original point is that when people say ""it happens when you're not trying,"" they don't mean ""don't ever try."" Sometimes it's a slow burn that takes a while to build up. Not everyone can immediately jump into a relationship, and not all relationships will form instantly. It's poor form to expect every interaction to follow the same linear path set out by movies, stories, and even other peoples' advice.

Yeah, I could look back at what has happened and say ""you totally could have said something sooner,"" but I couldn't have realized that in the moment. Things aren't always immediately obvious.",21Jan2020,1
49,"I dont know if this pertains to just me or my situation right now. Recently, since the past 3 months, I came into contact with some people who are ex friends of my ex girlfriend. I went through a breakup in the past 3 months as well with her and when i met these people, i thought they were very warm, friendly and accomadating. They warned me about how sick my ex was and tried to get me to cut full contact with her. I didn't listen, even after we broke up we were still friends until one day, things between me and her got violent. 
I realized that her friends were right and she was a twisted manipulative person. I have dated her for 8 months and after we completely cut contact, i hung out with her friends more.
One of her friends is a girl who she  considers me as her best friend. This girl is super attractive actually and I had feelings for her first time we met because the matter of fact is, infront of my ex she acts like a really sweet and humble girl but when my ex wasn't present she herself is twisted and at times very spontaneous/ obnoxious. 
I found out in the next few days when we hung out a lot. including her other guy friend who is also my exes ex friend now.  
When we first started hanging out it was all fun and games, we hung out a lot, partied, talked shit about my ex and I'd even jump in too but of recently its been getting out of hand and they started showing their true colors. 
The girl, I still consider her sweet on the inside and out but she indirectly bashes me a lot which is getting really annoying. She seems like she plays mind games with guys she gets close to and she's told other people she has mixed feelings for me. I've tried helping her with her life. Helping her go back to school, curb her alcohol addiction, things like that but she takes it with a grain of salt. She had been going through shit of her own with her breakup. She had been in a 3 year long abusive relationship and I feel a lot of stuff she does now is caused because of her experience with that guy. She says that im the closest one to her and I told her im always there for her if she needs me but she's just a miserable wreck of herself to be honest. 
At this point, I've realized that despite how good looking she is, I wouldn't date her because shes super annoying and doesnt realize the things she says sometimes or how she says them. She genuinely acts like a guy and has little sense of morality. 
What's been getting on my nerves recently is that she thinks she can pop up to my place any time she wants and brings some of her guy friends over(she hardly has any girlfriends, they rejected her friendship) and waste my time playing video games when im genuinely busy with stuff. 
I'm not trying to prove that im too good for her. Matter of fact ive never had to do that with a girl before in my life but she depresses herself thinking that im the perfect guy and all this B.S. and she knows I wouldn't date her because of how she portrays herself to be around me and our other friends. 
I feel bad for the girl but she takes a stab at my previous relationship and her and her friends crack jokes about me and my ex constantly so she can make her feel better about herself and put me down. 
Yeah she claims shes joking and all but its her obnoxious attitude moreover which gets in the way.
Her friends just sway along to her because theyre hoping one day she'll do sexual favors for them. 
In reality, she doesn't like any of them but indirectly likes me but if her way of getting to me is by being obnoxious and careless about her actions then shes heavily mistaken. 
I'm a pretty passive, straightforward guy and she sees and adores that but tries to crack my shell for her own selfish benefit.
As for the others, they are just losers as well that aren't in school or have aspirations for the future. 
I enjoy hanging out and playing video games but there are sometimes when i feel third wheeled with them but intimidated to say it. 
How do i fix the imbalance in this situation?",21Jan2020,1
50," 

This week I'm about to finally going to pay of my debt!!!!! 

At the very begging of 2019 I felt like my life was over. I've never had a professional job. I've never had a job that required a degree. I've never had a stable job that gave me more than 30 hours a week consistently. I was more than 5 years out from graduating from college(I started college in 2008!). To top it all off I was in about 33000 in debt(with only about 4k in cash) from buying cars to do Uber and daytrading altcoins. If I held on to my Bitcoins instead of daytrading them I would be filthy rich at the moment. I thought to myself the only way to get my life back on track was to somehow find a jobmarket where jobs were given out like candy and at the same time had cheap housing options! Then I realized the bay-area fit that bill because there are a lot of 10+ shared Air B &amp;B's there.

So, I decided to drive a rented car(I know I'm an idiot( I should have just bought an airplane ticket!). across the country from Washington D.C.. Nobody gave me money. I did not have any relatives or friends in the bay area, to give me housing.

The first problem that hit me was I lost the only debit/credit card I had on me. I thought to myself I had no choice to go back home because most prepaid cards do not work with AirB&amp;B. Luckily, I found a prepaid card in CVS that I could activate in person that actually works with AirB&amp;B.

My second problem was I crashed my rented car in a ditch. I called the police, got the car towed, and told my Insurance company what happened. Instead of going back to check on the car the next day like a sane person would. I decided to take a flight to la and then a bus to san fran because I didn't want to waste any of my 4k because finding a job was my priority. Thankfully, I only had to pay 4k for the accident, which I paid at the end of 2019.

While I got to to the bay area I stayed in an Air B&amp;B and did Instacart/Doordash/Postmates to keep myself afloat, while I looked for a job. By the time I did get a job, I had less than 1k, so I borrowed 2k from my brother, which I paid off in less than 6 months. Before I got the job I also had to pay a lot of back taxes from 2017 and a really expensive(&gt;$500!) fine for driving without a drivers licence on government property. I also had a paypal debacle where I couldn't get my money out of paypal. Thankfully, I transferred my money into somebody else's paypal account, and he gave me cash.

By the time I started my first job here, I was almost in 40k of debt, so I decided to not just work at the airport, but also to live there! I slept in the terminals every [night.](https://night.my/) My pay was more than $600/week. I showered at a 24 hour fitness. Luckily, my job as a cashier gave me some free food. I worked there from April to July.

Then the miracle happened. One of my relatives told me I had a relative in the bay area, who had a job for me. My relative is friend's with the person who hires, and she had a lot of clout because she was one of the first employees at the company(more than 5,000 now). EVen better, the job was literally entry level! The job description did not list required skills and the only experience requirement was 3 years of customer service experience! And the pay was $46,000/year. I was very hesitant to accept the offer because I was getting free shelter at the airport, but then one of my fellow co-workers offered me rent for only $500 a month!

Because of a lot of debt settlements, with the exception of a $2600 loan that I only have to pay $100 each month on with no interest and my 2019 taxes, I am debt freee this weekkkk!

Of course I needed extreme luck to get a lot of debt forgiveness. At one point CO(Capitol One) was suing me, but their best offer was only about 80% on about 12k in debt. I couldn't pay that. But then the debt collection company found out I was in a state they couldn't do business anymore! So, they had to give the case back to CO. I then shouted at both them at CO because for a whole month they had no idea , who had the case. Amazingly enough when CO got the case back they offered me 25%%%%!!!!!!!

I would like to add with the exception of the instances above, I did not get help from anyone to help pay off my debt. Also, I did not have any insane investments that helped me pay off my debt.

In case people were wondering why I didn't go into bankruptcy. It was because I didn't want to go into bankruptcy until I at least had a decent job for the first time in my life. I disregarded the idea of bankruptcy once I realized my pay was 46k. To me 46k felt like discovering a treasure chest of gold.

I am going to end up paying about half the debt I owed.

I hope this post gives hope to people because at the end of 2018 I had no hope. I've never had a good relationship with my intermediate family. I had one cousin, who liked me. Since 1st grade, I've only had 1 friend(which I got at the age of 26), and he moved by the end of 2018. Without a job, career, and a social life, I felt like I had nothing. Remember, no matter how crappy your life is remember thousands of people like you are also here for you!",21Jan2020,1
51,"I've skipped school for a week or so, and now everytime I want to go back I'm really scared and I freeze up before I make it into school grounds, and just turn around and waste time till my parents leave for work, I'm really scared and I just came here in search of some kind words so I can muster up some courage to go back",21Jan2020,1
52,"I know this is a question for a doctor or psychiatrist, but to be honest going to one kinda scares me because it makes it real, or maybe I guess I am afraid of then telling me that there is nothing wrong with me and having my struggles invalidated. So I am posting here instead for now. Maybe eventually I will build up the courage. I have posted elsewhere on other subs, but it never hurts to get the opinions of multiple people wherever I can, without having to spam post one sub or whatever.

I am an 18 year old male, and when I was 11-12 (I don’t remember the exact age for some reason), I was molested by another boy that was 3-4 years older than me approximately. Could have been older, who knows. Anyways, I met him at my uncles cottage, and he took the time to become my friend and gain my trust, which he then used to get me close to him, restrain me and grab me through my swim shorts, which were really just thin soccer shorts. Up until early December 2019 I had repressed the memories. It wasn’t like I forgot, but I didn’t really pay attention to it or ever try to understand it. I usually just dismissed it as a close call because he didn’t actually perform any sex acts on me, and he didn’t touch me for long. But recently it has really been bothering me. I have been having terrible mood swings, that change from second to second sometimes. I don’t even know what I am feeling half of the time. Most of the time is is either sadness, panic, or anger though. Never really happiness. Maybe the odd time I feel hopeful, but it passes pretty quickly and doesn’t come back for a while. I have been having flashbacks that result in hyperventilation, racing heart, and restlessness. I am basically constantly grinding my teeth (I know it’s unhealthy) or shaking my leg because of the anxiety. There was actually one time where I was trying to sleep, and I started getting flashbacks and triggering thoughts and memories, and I started having the usual symptoms, but then suddenly I started shaking uncontrollably and my whole body went numb like when you sleep on your arm. I couldn’t control my muscles. I dropped a water bottle I tried to pick up, and I couldn’t open my eyes, the best I could do was flickering them open and closed. I spend a lot of time inside in isolation because the outside world seems too dangerous, like I can’t trust anyone. I can’t let anyone behind me, especially when I am lying down. I will turn to face them. Any sudden noise startles me, even if it was caused by me. If I see any content about child sexual abuse I start panicking, and I can get extremely anger sometimes and fantasize about strangling pedophiles. I even created a plan to attack a pedophile that lives near me. I have only ever told two people in my personal life, and I told them by text. It’s all extremely exhausting. Every time I have an episode I am completely exhausted afterwards. But despite that I still have trouble sleeping. I avoid sleeping, usually staying on my phone because I can’t stand not having a distraction. I still can’t admit it out loud, let alone talk about it. Sometimes it even feels like it didn’t happen, rather it happened to someone that used to be in my body but isn’t anymore. Sometimes when I am remembering it, I remember it from outside my body. I see it from up in the air. It’s embarrassing and shameful, especially because it was another guy. I feel like talking about it or showing that I am affected by it makes me weak. Like another guy overpowering me and doing that to me makes me weak. I sit. Want my family knowing I was touched by another guy, no matter my age or the circumstances. I have already written a novel at this point so I will leave it here. I guess I am asking people to share their thoughts or their advice. All replies are greatly appreciated. I’m not even sure if this sub is for posts like these, but I thought it was so here I am. Thank you for reading.",21Jan2020,1

I'm still at home and I feel like a big fucking idiot for wasting so much time and feeling helpless I dont have anything, i get the urge to fucking kill these people and at the same time i dont want to because I know there is still some hope, I'm only raging because I'm older and I feel like a big idiot for not realizing it sooner, they put a Vail on me I cant explain. And I'm fucking trying my best to see what I can do about this problem but I dont have many options the shame of being this way is driving me towards suicide, because I dont have any for my age to show and real accomplishments. I dont think it's worth the fucking struggle I have to face now, with what I want to do.",21Jan2020,1

62,"The rise of my character began after a very long selfish period filled with arrogance and vanity. 

Each and every failure was blamed on another and another and absolutely anywhere I could inaccurately place the blame-until I had no one, and nothing left to blame but my self. 

Of course we have our childhood and the lack of good parenting (some parents have no business getting into the business right)? Certainly, there are circumstances that we cannot prevent or politics that we aren’t fond of. 

Mommy stopped wiping my ass and calling me a dumb-shit long ago. The circumstances that I found myself in were the making of all of my thoughts and actions throughout life (what I think today, will be upon me tomorrow), and it certainly makes sense to be kind to everyone and keep negative thoughts out of conversations with others i.e politics 101. 

When we spend serious moments in silence with our thoughts and we observe how and what we are actually thinking, we can clearly see our failures and how they manifest. 

&amp;#x200B;

We cannot change the way someone else thinks, but rest assured, we can shape the way others view our actions, and our actions are character that come directly from our thought process.

Persistence in good thought, being the helping hand, kindness thinking, selfless thinking and believing in ourselves more than any other thought will persevere over time. It won’t happen over night, it won’t happen over a week, it may take months but, we will start to see the change in ourselves over time. It is a struggle but it is worth every moment of patience and steadfastness in our desire for a better more successful way of living.   

&amp;#x200B;

It sucked to learn I was an asshole! 

I cannot stress the difficulty and pain one must endure while looking in the mirror and within our own minds, realizing we are the ones in need of change. It is also easy to just keep on with keeping on. However, We all posses the strength within ourselves to accomplish anything we truly set our minds to. It is realizing this inner strength that takes a moment.",21Jan2020,1

And I know this is stupid but I think I like him more than as just a friend, even though I don't know what he looks like and never made a voice call. I thought he was enjoying writing to me too. But I sent him the last message two days ago and he didn't reply yet. His silence is making me feel really anxious and sad. I don't know what happened. I don't know if he doesn't want to talk to me anymore or if he's just busy, or if he's having a personal problem and can't reply, or if I said or did something wrong, or if he noticed that I have these feelings and he doesn't feel the same and decided to stop talking to me. Or maybe just two days is not enough to take any conclusion and tomorrow he will reply. A part of me believes that he likes me and will contact me again, but maybe it's because my heart is still too childish even though I'm an adult and I tend to be too hopeful and interpret things in a positive way. I don't want to send him another message because I'll come off as clingy. But I'm feeling really sad and I never felt these feelings for anyone before.

68,"I’m a 21 year old girl and it recently dawned on me that maybe college isn’t meant for me. 

I went to a small university of about 3,000 students for a year and a half before coming home after a psychotic break and taking a semester off. I went to community college this past fall and i’m still attending, however i’m unsure if this is supposed to be in my life plan.

I have no clue what i want to even major in. I’m currently taking classes to become a medical assistant, but i don’t even know if that’s what i want. 

I’ve always been the person that just wants to start working. I want a full time job. I want to get my life started. I’ve come to really realize lately that you don’t *need* a college degree, it just helps. Sure, i won’t get hired at every place i apply to, but i’m hopeful somewhere might. 

My childhood best friend works for “Yelp” (made up) in my city, and she said that she could get me a job and she mentioned a lot of their employees don’t even have college degrees. Everyone’s starting salary is $40,000 a year with all of the benefits, which is AWESOME. It would be a great starting out job if she could really help me get the job. 

I really have faith in myself. I’m pretty (yes i’m able to admit that), tall, charming, outgoing, social, i’m a fast learner, i ask questions, i want to do everything perfect, i don’t half-ass anything, i’m a ball buster, i get what i want, and i’m extremely street smart. Even if “Yelp” isn’t the place that hires me, i’m faithful someplace will. Worst case scenario, i just go back to school and take some classes that will be beneficial to me for the real world.

71,"Oh god where do I start.  


So I just recently graduated from college and I'm currently working from home, pay is good. No shit about it. So what's the problem?

  
At first, when my job started out as an ""i need to report to office"" kind of job, my parent seemed cool with me being independent and going out and what not, they were letting me live my life. 

But right now, since I work around 4 times a week at home, they started treating me like I'm in highschool again. They've been minding my business again, such as ""why are you lying down all day"" and I'm like bruh, my insane night shift is causing me health problems and insomnia already. And then they proceed to blaming me like ""that's your fault for not setting up your work space nicely"" and blah blah. I explained to them that I'd much prefer the office environment where I see actual people and well, basically, an actual office. At this point, they pretty much do not understand me because they own a business and wouldn't know what it's like to be a corporate worker.

My second issue right now is that I've told dad that I wanna be able to save enough money to take a year off, since I didn't do that. I applied for a job right after graduation. He just gave me the cold reply ""that's impossible. that's a movie. are you crazy? you have no choice but to work for the rest of your life."" Oooooh this shit burned mah heart. I mean I love him and all but damn. That was downright discouraging me from doing the following, which I've mentioned to him:  
\- studying abroad for 2-3 months  
\- travel maybe  
\- even study something here in my area 

he was like ""that's impossible. you can't afford to do that.""

I told him that I am already saving money. he was just like ""nah, your money gonna burn fast, believe me""

&amp;#x200B;

anyway, im hurt and sad right now. I've expected support lol. Which i shouldn't have I guess...

But what's more disappointing here is that ever since he got used to me working at home, he started treating me like I'm in college again. It sucks. Oh god. I mean yeah sure I could always go to the office to avoid this but bruh, the office is like 3 hours away from me. That's one way going there. I can't even. 

It's like we've lost boundaries.   


And I just don't wanna be direct to them about it because it's cause an uproar around the house.  
Unlike when I go the office, none of what I do after my shift is their business anymore.. unless I'm staying out past 4am.

84,"Hey all, I'm new to Reddit but I created an account to hear people's thoughts and seek help on what I'm dealing with. I've been having perverted urges since I was 14, now I'm turning 27 this year. I always thought it was normal, like maybe it was just apart of me going through puberty, but it seems that over time I've become self obsessed with these thoughts to the point where I know somethings wrong with me. The scenario starts when I was a freshman in high school. I had a hard time staying focused in class, that's been going on my whole life, I'm easily distracted and would entertain myself. Mind you I went to catholic school where guys and girls had to dress in uniform, guys in dress pants button down shirt and tie, girls wore button down shirts and a dress skirt. About a month into class, a girl got transferred into my Spanish class. She was a year older and I thought she was very attractive. My desk was in the back and she was placed in front of me. This is the part where everything hit me at once. I remember dropping my pen on the floor and it kind of went under her desk. I proceeded to try to get it when I noticed her butt was so perked in the seat seeping through the back of the desk chair with a beautifully arched back. I was immediately mesmerized and my heart started pounding. The image to this day is lodged in my brain. I was automatically distracted and couldn't snap out of it, I wanted to make contact with it so bad. So I did. I used to slide my knee under her butt to the point where she was sitting on my lap like santa clause. I bounced my knee enough for her to notice but she never did anything, never slid forward EVER because she was uncomfortable, unless she did know and she liked it; it was what I forced my brain to believe. That wasn't the only thing I proceeded to do. I wanted to see if I could grab it through the chair, I was very gentle because I was afraid I would get caught, but that built up the thrill of getting caught and I enjoyed that thrill. I successfully and gently grabbed her butt cheek and she still did nothing, didn't move making me believe she enjoyed it too. I put my finger in her butt and vagina just to see what it smelt like and she continued to shine her ass away at me. Considering I was sitting in the back and everyone in the class was generally in front of her, my only worry was for her to be uncomfortable with what I've been doing and get me in trouble. So next thing I had tried was that I physically got down on my hands and knees and put my face in her butt for a few seconds because again I was afraid yet thrilled to get caught, I was so horny that it smelt amazing. But it proceeds to get worse from there. Since I was rock solid hard from what I had been doing, I took my dick out through my zipper and placed it underneath her butt where I would put my knee, I let my hand off of it and flexed my dick as hard as I could into her for a solid couple minutes. I almost exploded all over her, meanwhile in this stage of my life, I've never masturbated or came so I never knew what I needed to do to make that happen, but I knew this feeling I was having in that moment was unbelievably exhilarating, but in the back of my mind I knew it was wrong so it was the only time that I did that. And yet, she sat the same the entire time I sat behind her. This went on for 2 months until my teacher wanted to change people seats, me being one of them. I went from an A student to barely passing each class because of this. Considering I learned what I did, I wanted to try it on every girl that sat in front of me, that I thought was attractive and had a nice body. In high school I was caught one time because the girl asked to switch seats with me so I did, but nothing was done to help me be afraid to do it anymore. It wasn't a big deal never got in real trouble and I wound up touching about 20 different girls in high school. In college, I had the same mindset, I was just so infatuated with touching a girls butt through the seat because of my experience in high school. I probably touched more in college. I would just let my fingers hang out in their seat and my mind was blasting off about how 'what happens when they sit up in their chair'. My heart would be pounding throughout the whole class, that's a lot of stress on the heart especially going through a whole day of school like that for 4 years. When girls eventually slid back upright in their chair, my fingers would get sat on and most of them did nothing about it or did not notice from what I know. My last year in college I got a little too excited. I did what I usually do to one girl and I saw her texting a friend about me during class, and it came to a point where she came up to me at a house party that weekend and flirted with me briefly, but I didn't catch the vibe because I was so worried about what she actually knew that I just walked away. There are probably things I don't know, secret conversations about me about what I had been doing. Ever since school ended, thoughts like these eat at me to the point where I get excited, my heart races and I have a uncontrollable urge to act out. And I continuously have. Occasionally I'll go to a local college and do the same procedure only a couple times out of a year to get my fix because sometimes I drive myself insane thinking about everything I've explained. I don't have any other desires, I treat women right outside of this 'fetish' I have, I don't have the desire to force girls into doing anything, I don't have desires to do this to kids under 18, that's just disgusting to me. I watch porn and all I watch is stuff that fulfills my thoughts, but even when I don't watch porn, I can be on social media and see a fitness model or even a girl that I know that I find attractive and it'll automatically trigger these thoughts and urges. I know my limit which is great for me to say but I know what I desire is wrong and the fact that I still act out makes me beat myself up, gives me mood swings and I feel guilty every time I think that way. I know keeping yourself busy will help limit the amount of times the memories pop back into my head but I honestly feel like that isn't the case because I think about it at work, the gym, in the shower, while I'm in bed, while I'm driving etc. I've been thinking about these things half of my life and I don't want to think like that anymore because I know it's just not a normal way to think, but the memories continuously go through my head regardless of what I'm doing. I see a girl sitting down anywhere now and a memory will shoot into my head and that's how it could be for a little while until I get distracted by something or have to put my focus into something else. I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone I'm close with about what I'm dealing with and I'm still unsure I'll get the answers I'm looking for from here but I feel like this is a good start in the healing process, something I'd really like to do so I can live a more normal life mindset wise. I'm prepared to receive some hateful comments from you strangers but I've come to a point where I can handle that more over explaining this to my family or friends. I don't want to be perceived differently in their eyes when I know I can get the help myself. I'm just hoping someone here will be able to help me. I feel like my mind is corrupt. I'm not sure what else I can do, I know for sure I should stop acting out but that only builds up more anxiety through thinking about my past. I've even searched how to delete memories from your brain because I just want this to go away so I'm not fixated on something so perverted ALL THE TIME.",21Jan2020,1

86," 

i feel like the fact that i dont get constantily tested and shit, causes me to go ape shit

ok so

i have always been into sports as a kid

have done karate (for 2 years) when i was younger then boxing for like three months. i started boxing just to kill time, and didn't take it that seriously tho.

i have also played some other sports (not fighting included) for years, basically i have not been physically active since like last year.

i think that having that fighting experience can do a lot to your confidence.

everywhere i go i feel this weird awkwardness in my body. i dont know why. i feel physically awkward and stiff. and i hate it. now im not scared of confrontations and shit, (even tho as a kid i have always been scared of it) and i frequently have intense stare downs with passers-bye who are around my age (im 19 btw) and i can feel that i kinda ""dominate"" (not the best word) them. but i have no idea what'd happen if a fight occured. now, i can square up and swing, but i still feel this weird way. its like im lacking something. i havent been in a fight for a while now. i used to get into fights at school, like messing around with my friends and stuff, but now that its over i dont do shit. The good thing about me is that even if im scared of someone, after getting punched, i always go gnarly on whoever is against me. Like i dont experience fear of someone. and as i said on the streets cuz of my attitiude i wont get pushed around, like i always feel repsect from others. Like majority of people wouldn't pick a fight with me one on one cuz just the way i look.

im at home punching walls and going crazy. and tbh, all of that happens cuz of insecurities .

is there any way to shake off this awkwardness?

i do get that it's a mental thing and i do feel way better on particular days. even when i feel this way i can force myself out of it. It occurs while walking. I have also noticed this weird thing that i cant run properly too, i just start feeling awkward. like when crossing a street, you sometimes need to speed up, but i never do it cuz it feels kinda awkward.Though, i always keep my head up, chest out and walk boldly, but inside i always fight this thing, i dont even know what it is. As i have already mentioned it causes me to look kinda even provocatively into others eyes, only for getting that assertive feeling, cuz as i said in most cases they look away. like i dont wanna mess with you type of way.

but should i do something about it? like physically.

Like, can a person who constantily gets into fights still be awkward? i know this is a weird question but im stuck with this thought that its all cause of not getting into fights more frequently.

i also do not play sports anymore. like i havent played for like a year.",21Jan2020,1

I realize that reddit in general is not the best place to ask for medical advice, and I'm not doing that. I'm hoping that someone might have had a similar situation and can give me some advice. 

Disclaimer: This might get kinda long, and I might wander off from my main point here, which is exactly the problem. Hear me out. 

It seems that I have a sort of barrier between things I want or have to do, and actually doing them.
I would not call it procrastination, as I'd classify that as a symptom, not a condition.

I have an insanely short attention span, and I'm having a hard time working on a specific task for anything longer than 20 minutes. After or during that, it starts to become boring, pointless, and stupid.

I'm having a hard time making plans and sticking to them. There's a part in me that's constantly sabotaging any success I could have, and I think it's a subconscious coping mechanism for getting into a sort of victim role that justifies my not-doing of things. 

The thing is, I'm not necessarily feeling bad about it. I'm happy in every day life, even while I'm actively avoiding responsibilities. I have somehow acquired a weird state of mind that makes failing feel better than succeeding.

I have some very important exams at uni coming up, and I have successfully procrastinated up to this point. Even if I started studying now, it's way to late to not fail all of them. Why do I not feel bad about this? I am way to content with failure to ever have any drive to succeed.

It's so bad that I don't even have the motivation to do things I know I enjoy. Like playing simulator games, drawing, diy projects, making electronic music, etc..

Let's take making music for example. Like, I can be inspired to Andromeda and back, trying various sounds in my head, thinking about ideas and stuff. But when it comes to actually turning on my laptop and doing it, I won't be able to. As soon as I stand up and walk over to my table, my motivation is GONE.

It's this sort of cycle that always repeats itself with whatever I'm doing. Be it creative, productive, or recreational. 
-I get motivated
-I have ideas
-I think about how to implement them
-I get overwhelmed by the workload that unfolds in my head
-I turn away from the task
-I feel good because I avoided stress

I've been asking people that are close to me and know me, for as long as I can remember now. But no one could ever help me.
All I ever got is ""Just do it""

Excuse my language here but this stupid fucking ""just do it"" just doesn't fucking work for me, get it?
Even if I ""just do it"", 5 minutes later I can't go on.

I've literally half-assed everything in my life, and I'm at a point where I feel like I should not be here (NOT in a suicide kinda way). I feel like I'm not qualified for the life situation I'm in, and have only come so far because I lied/cheated at key points and no one ever noticed.

I've already considered ADD, which would suggest that Stimulant drugs like Adderall or Ritalin would help, but they make it SO MUCH WORSE.
Sober me is motivationless and dissatisfied. When I tried Medication, I just felt wired ('wired', not 'weird') motivationless, dissatisfied, couldn't sit still, neither sleep.
Also, I tried every supplement under the sun, and I will list them if anyone asks, I don't wanna make this post any longer than it already is.

Oh, and I am sure I don't have a gas leak lol.

Thanks to anyone who read this whole thing, I truly appreciate it.",21Jan2020,1

100,"I am extremely grateful for your patience and understanding. I am 28, almost done with my associates and need this last general course to be done with them. I didn’t take bio in high school and it is really weighing on me that most of the students in this class are 18 - 20, not only that, but understand this material while I feel completely in the dark and a bit embarrassed with myself at my lack of knowledge. 

We were going over atomic numbers and electron shielding around the nucleus today and I was a bit lost. Me being a bit embarrassed to ask, but still did anyway on how to calculate for things or how many electrons formed the barrier at max capacity ect. She took the time to kindly explain how these things happened and kept answering my questions till I understood. It wasn’t till I left class that I literally almost cried thinking about it that I placed so much fear and doubt on myself or expectations that no matter what age or place in life someone always has wisdom or information to offer in kind and caring ways, sometimes you just need to put your ego aside and just open your mouth to be present with your own ignorance and let people help you.

I think next class I am going to thank her and let her know how much that meant to me that she acted in such a way, even if she didn’t realize how much it impacted me.

101,"I only starting writing a diary a couple months ago, and I'd notice occasionally I'd come back and it wasn't how I'd left it.

Things that could only happen if somebody had touched it, eg pens were rotated a complete 180 degrees, rulers were flipped on the other side, etc. I've done this twice and just now told her I know she's reading it and to stop.

I don't speak to her, because she is severely mentally ill with bipolar, she's basically almost the stereotypical narcissistic sociopath parent. I'm just fucking furious, those are MY feelings. Those are what I want ME and only ME to know. And she just invades my privacy and reads it, then denies reading it. I'm fucking disgusted by her, I hate her, honestly. I can't talk to anyone about how much this makes me hate her, because everyone else had nice parents and they can't understand bad mouthing your parents like that. They don't understand my mum was in insane asylums half of my life growing up. Honestly fuck her. She should know better.

104,"PLEASE HELP

So recently my life has been kind of a mess. I’m going to start from the very beginning for allot the info. So my friend and I, have known each other for 4 years. Since 2 years, him and I have been closer. In 2018, years he went to a different school. Before that we were at the same school. Our relationship was mostly healthy, we had a couple of disagreements here and there but he was a good kid. While he was at a different school, I made a couple of other friends. Last year, at the beginning of 2019, our relationship was still mostly healthy, but he was getting kind of selfish (like he wanted him to be my only friend). As I was saying, at the beginning of 2019, he switched to my school to be with me. We didn’t have any classes together so we were kind of away from each other. The first month of he came to my school, he got into trouble with other kids, trouble with the staff, and then I played a prank on him. He got me back and I thought we were cool. Then he went around and said that I said racist slurs. Then people came at me. I got him back by giving people proof of him actually saying a racist slur on message. Then we straightened things out. After that though, he started wanting to do things he didn’t want to do before. He changed. He really did. By the end of the school year, him, two of my other friends, and I, had a small friend group. Over the summer, we were cool. I have to mention that during 2019, we started having a lot of sleepovers. Too many. Again, over the summer, we were cool and we were all still friends. This year starts, and we’re still cool, until October. In October one of my other friends left the group, because my main friend and the other friend were harassing his girlfriend because my main friend had a crush on her the year before. So he leaves and then my friend starting calling the other friend a racist slur that the other friend didn’t care too much about. Then, the other friend decided to leave us both to join our other friend. He told him everything my friend had ever done and put some of it on me. In November, my main friend and I had gotten into a lot of trouble and I was advised to cut off my friendship with him by my parents. In December, the friend that had first left our group told me that if I cut my main friend off, me and both of the other friend could be friends again. I said ok. But then only me and him were cool, not the other friend and the ex main friend. I thought it was a good choice, but now when I look back, I miss being friends with my main friend. When everyone was cool. But if I wanted to be friends with him, he would be the only friend I have. And he’s not the same anymore. He’s different. His habits are bad. I’m so confused on what to do and I’m upset as well. Thank you for reading this far, and please let me know your opinion on this situation in the comments.",21Jan2020,1
105,"For the first time since I was born I'm going to spend my birthday all alone. That's exactly in 3 hours from now. 
My parents live in a different country and all my friends are kind of in a state of ""transition"" so nobody is here with me or available. 


Everyone is stressed out because of work or school or the cold in January and I'm at home watching how I met your mother. Anyway, I feel a bit lonely because I'm pretty sure everyone is going to forget, but that's ok.


It just makes me sad, I'm not used to spending my birthday alone. It has always been a festive day of joy and cakes and drinking, so it's weird today.


It's so insane to think about though. In 3 hours I'll be 23 years old. Time is passing by so quickly, that we don't even realize it anymore. It feels like yesterday I was in High school at 16 worried about the test next day that it is so weird to think that was 7 years ago. 


The house is so quiet guys. I live alone and today the house is absolutely silent. I guess that only makes me feel  even lonelier. If it wasn't for barney  being legendary there wouldn't be a single noise in the awesome flat. 



And that's pretty much it I hope I'll wake up tomorrow and go to work and not feel like I'm feeling right now. Maybe working and talking to people will make it go away and I'll be able to enjoy just a little piece of it.",21Jan2020,1
106,"I am 36 years old and have been ""working for the man"" since I was 14.   Aside from baseball, at which I was pretty good but not pro-level, I have never really had a passion for much. 

A few years ago I interviewed for a job with the Yankees marketing department, but the job didnt pay enough for me to be able to move from NC - but rather than give up my dream, I decided to try and take a different route and do my own thing.

 I am pretty good at video editing and pretty good writing - so I decided to launch a YouTube channel to talk about my favorite team - the Yankees - and baseball in general. I also started a podcast.  Just in case anyone is interested. I don't think my normal speaking voice is anything special but I am working on it and my delivery. 

I am very encouraged so far because I have only had the channel for a month and already have 129 subscribers and had one video that went viral and has over 40,000 views. I do want to get my podcast a bit more listeners though - I have only 35 downloads in 6 episodes.

Would love to hear stories of anyone else who has created a successful channel or podcast to get their stories and advice.

109,"So, I've been thinking a lot about my sexuality for the  past months, and I've recently come to the conclusion that I am soley into men (But I might have biromantic tendencies. Idk I think I'll have to definitely experiment). 

And I know that being gay is fine, and is at least relatively natural but the problem that I'm having is mostly with my nuclear and extended family. You see, on my mother's side I have homophobic family members that I know of that include my uncle, cousins, and grandfather. 

They don't seem to be too excepting of gays, and in fact the cousin that's around my age the last time I went over to their house said that being gay was wrong. And Ik that I probably won't be able to tell them anytime soon because they are VERY right wing, and would not take kindly to me coming out. 

Aside from this, my stepfather (who I'll call dad) and mom would probably be accepting of me, it's just that they don't think I'm old enough to know my sexuality (I'm 15M), and that I should wait until I'm sixteen to actually come out to them. (As I don't thjnk I'll mention this, I'll say that I did try to come out to them, but they kind of just brushed it off and told me to wait until I'm older.) 

And they sometimes talk about me with girlfriends, and having kids of my own, so I definitely know that they expect me to be at the very least bisexual (hell even my mother said she did), but I don't think I am at all. 

While I do love/like the female body (lady's, most of y'all are beautiful), I'm just not attracted to women like I am to men. I think girls are kind of cute, but it just isn't the same. 

So, with this all in mind, how would I come out to them? I really do want too, even if it does have some consequences but I don't really think that I'd want my family disowning me because of it. (But not my parents tho, they are mostly supportive of lgbt+ people)",21Jan2020,1

112,"For years I’ve noticed an attraction towards both genders. I just assumed I was straight even though I felt feelings for girls. 

Some days I find myself more attracted to girls, and other days to guys. 

I was scared to admit it to my grandma, she is the only person I truly care about her opinion towards me.

When I first told her that I was feeling bi tendencies, she seemed turned off, and told me she knew I was straight because I liked guys so I gave up on the idea for a long time. 

She told me she wasn’t against people having different sexualities, but she knew one day I wanted kids, and that I’d talked to her about guys before, etc. 

I’ve talked to her about it on more then one occasion since then, and I started to realize more and more, especially after getting over my fear of looking at people at least a little bit, that I find myself more attracted to girls then I ever thought. 

I don’t think I have a specific type, but I find myself usually liking the ones that dress, and have hair styles a bit more like a guy, but I have also found myself liking girls who look different as well.

     I’m in eighth grade right now and I just feel I’m not doing something right. I feel I’m not doing good enough in anything. Socially I feel that I can’t keep friends for long enough. Most say I’m annoying or last for a short time before calling me a jerk and stop hanging out with me. 

     For school I feel that I could be doing so much more since I got rejected out of one of the advanced high schools around here because I was not academically good enough. Even though I’m in all honors classes, I feel my grades are not good enough since I have put my mind set that I must get all A+ or I’m not doing good. I feel even hobbies I have I’m not good enough at or it’s just a waste of my time.  Even some of the hobbies I have get me worked up and upset, but I don’t know how to get away from it.

121,"So I’m 20 for reference, I was away with friends on vacation a couple of weeks back, and we were in this bar. I was pretty drunk and enjoying being away for a while so I got talking to literally anyone I could, and eventually got talking to this girl. Turns out she was 31 (although looked way younger), had a long-term boyfriend and everything else, so while I was attracted to her as we were talking, I obviously didn’t think that anything was gonna happen. My friends were all kind of off at other parts of the bar doing their own thing, and her friend was off flirting with random dudes, so i had nothing better to do than sit shooting the shit with her.

It quickly became really obvious to us that we got along insanely well. Like, to the point that we both told each other within like an hour that we had never really connected with someone that quickly. We were goofing around and dancing a lot, laughing at stupid shit, kept buying each other drinks and hanging around each other, but we were also having some pretty deep conversations where we were just bluntly honest with each other about so many different aspects of our lives, it just felt really comfortable for some reason, like I genuinely could be 100% open. 

It didn’t feel overtly sexual in any way; while we did talk about sex pretty deeply at one point, and I think there was a bit of mutual attraction there, it wasn’t like that. It genuinely felt like the kind of relationship in the movie Lost In Translation: there’s SOMETHING there that’s undeniable, and both sides know it, but there’s so much between them: the age gap, being at completely different stages of their lives, only having a limited amount of time together cause they’re in a different country, being committed to other relationships, etc. that it wouldn’t ever become anything at all in the ‘real world’. She did tell me if she had been 10 years younger, and her boyfriend wasn’t in the picture, she had no doubt that she’d have ended up with me instead, just from those few hours. It was kind of crazy, like as if we could have been soulmates in another life or something.

I had to leave early so we swapped names, promised to meet up again before our respective trips were over, and messaged each other a little while we were both away, but we never got the chance to see each other again; we both went back to the same bar we met, but missed each other by like an hour. I kind of felt like when I said bye to her in the bar that I wasn’t gonna see her again, and honestly as hilariously stupid as it sounds it was hard for me to leave her: we promised we’d be friends for life (lmfao) as I left, but I think we both knew that’s not gonna be something that actually happens.

Now I’m back home and have her number, but I doubt we’ll ever message each other again. It wouldn’t make sense and wouldn’t ever work. But while it’s bittersweet, I feel like our conversations that night helped us learn a lot of shit about ourselves, and honestly it showed me exactly what I want to be looking for in a potential partner; that instant connection we had, but with someone who’s at a point in their life where they’re available. It was one of the best, most life-affirming nights of my life in all honesty; it’s funny how you find such a deep human connection when you least expect it.",21Jan2020,1
122,"I'm a male in my 30s.  I live in an apartment.  I didn't want to get married or have kids and haven't done either.  It seems like life can sort of come to a halt if you go this route.  Friends either too busy with their families or too tired from work to come out to ""play"" as it were.  That's what really sucks, it feels like the playtime years are over, maybe that's immature because I'm older but it feels like nothing is fun anymore.  Everything is just another chore.  I decided to try volunteering at a homeless shelter to take some time off my hands and maybe boost my self esteem, but it didn't change anything.  I don't want to sound dramatic, I don't want to do anything dramatic, which is why I'm back to considering hanging myself in my closet.  I wouldn't want to leave a big mess and it seems like a decent way to go.  I had a friend kill himself when we were 18 so I know what it's like, it hurts but you get over it.  Same would go for anyone who knows me.  Don't hang out like we used to, family or friends.  And when we do it still feels like the best is over.

I don't know what to do.  I have a psychiatrist and I'm on meds, I know this isn't a side effect of anything it's just how I feel.  So I'm being looked after, I just feel like I'm done with life, like I had my time but now I'm trapped here.  The thought of nothing coming after death scares me even though it shouldn't.
