1,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got larger looking mainly around the cheeks and middle of face) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. 

Recently I went down to 11.3 again and jogged  but hardly any difference definitely but looks larger too. as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head and my body seems larger overall too. . It’s difficult to get below 11.3 stone even with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

◾️Black pants I wore a few months ago for work seem tighter and my legs look more longitudinal in them around the bottom half of legs. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting mostly too and it’s made me drop on the scale but can’t see a difference) I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it.  I was a few lbs more in 2018 and look thinner and thinner faced and clothes fitted better. 


◾️I’m down to 11.2 now and my face looks larger than ever and I was a lot thinner faced  when I was last that weight in 2018 so I don’t get why /: 

Can PM pics to show what I mean if that helps it will show my facial size difference",22Aug2020,1

4,"Let me preface what I'm about to say, in terms of my overall life, I've made significant progress. I'm much more stable mentally, financially, and emotionally. However, it terms of getting things done, I do not see nearly as much improvement as I would like to.

Maybe the issue stems from my comparison to other more successful individuals. I look at people like David Goggins, Joe Rogan, Steve Jobs, Will Smith, etc, not necessarily your typical rags to riches, but they made a whole lot out of a little. Then I compare their work ethic to mine and I feel like I couldn't match their worst days even on my best. It feels like I'm only able to generate motivation from outside sources whereas they can muster it up themselves. When I'm listening to Joe Rogan or reading David Goggins, I feel inspired and I go out there and put in some serious work. The problem is, I only put in that work for a few hours before I fall back down to my base line, waiting to be motivated again. 

I've made leaps in bounds in plenty of areas in my life over these past few years of self development, but my work ethic is arguably the most important and the one I see the least amount of growth in. It's a horrible mind-state to have but I feel like I'm kinda just stuck with it. Like it's never going to improve. And what good does all this new found stability in life offer me if I don't use this time to put in serious work and take some risks while I can afford for them not to pay off?

I just get this feeling like the people who are at the top were going to make it up there one way or the other just because of their persistence and dedication, and I feel like the millions of people who they motivate everyday are nothing more than spectators wishing they could have what they have. It feels so unobtainable. 

Although, I can't define exactly what it is that I feel is so unobtainable, there is no exact measurement for it, and maybe this feeling is just one of self-resent.

Sorry to rant, but I figured maybe somebody has been in the same situation before and could offer some insight.",22Aug2020,1
5,"I’m (22F) and Ive felt this depression of mine gradually get worse over the past 4 years. It’s gotten to the point I cant even recall who I used to be. I sleep away most days to simply just not have to deal with it. Months fly by and I feel like the world and my family around me is changing so fast. Yet I’m still whoever I was 4 years ago. I’m tired of being someone I’m not. I always put on this stupid fake act of happiness around my family or people. I try to joke around ALOT and make people laugh but I annoy myself when I catch what I’m doing. I know its all an act I’m putting on, but I just cant seem to stop myself. I guess I try to make them think I’m okay. My family seems to think I’m fine. So no one ever asks how I’m feeling. Truth is I prefer they don’t because I know I’d just break down in tears unable to even begin explaining how this depression has consumed my entire mental and physical health over the years. I dont know what I’m trying to ask really but I guess this is my last resort to getting some sort of answer.. thanks.",22Aug2020,1
6,The background is me playing Minecraft but the audio is me interviewing my girlfriend about her mental health and I’m really hoping it helps people get help . The problem is I don’t know where to post it so Reddit can see and give me feedback. Any ideas on where to post it?,22Aug2020,1
7,"
I don’t want to post my life story here, but basically my parents were emotionally abusive (my mom has said herself that she was abusive and has also admitted to gaslighting me) and they also ignored my declining mental health. I am currently temporarily out of that situation because i’m away at college, but I’m finding it very hard to feel like I am worth anything.

I look in the mirror and I see a girl who will never be loved. I see a girl who is ugly, and who looks a little too much like her dad. I see a girl who loves other people so much and would do anything for her friends, but who is expendable to everyone around her. 

I’m scared that my friends just think of me as “the girl who been depressed for five years” “or the girl who always has anxiety” or “the girl who is annoying” — even though I try my hardest to not annoy anyone with my family problems. I’m scared to talk to people. I’m scared that my history and current mental health issues will scare them off. They could just find another girl my age who doesn’t have a ton of problems, right? 

I try so freaking hard, y’all. I put myself last so I can make sure my friends know that they are loved and valued yet they don’t care about me at all. Am i just a lost cause? Too much to love? Will no one ever want someone like me? I’m scared. I don’t want to live out the rest of my life alone like I am right now.",22Aug2020,1
8,"I don't know if 'depressed' is the right word. Most of my sadness came from issues I could control completely, and have fixed but I was pathetically sad 24/7 and beginning to consider self harm so just sad isn't the right word. 


Watching that video after spending months climbing out of old habits really reminded me how amazing it is that I've begun to move on, and really pushed me to go forward more and more with making sure I keep myself happy.

Fuckin hell I can't really describe how much I'm happy and scared right now. Like I never want to go back and I feel so great compared to then. It just stuck with me holy shit",22Aug2020,1
10,"This is more of a rant post. Been smoking cannabis/pot/marijuana for a little while and for a little while mai my cause I heard it could help with the side effects of my medications of my medications and it did.  The title maybe a. duh but the same damn dealers who sell pot usually sometimes sell other things and can even push the people they sell to to try them. If it was just fucking legalized it would be way less likely. I have personally expirence this many of my dealers also have acid and MDMA among other shit they can get there hands on. You rarely see the point anymore but it’s still absurd to me when people bring it up. Most stoners thing anyone who goes beyond that is crazy and if you actually find a dealer who won’t push other shit on you they usually chill af. Anyways that’d my stupid rant call me a stupid stoner. 

TL;DR I smoke cannabis a bit to help with the side effect, dealers will push all there shit on you (welcome to capitalism?) so pot really isn’t a gateway especially if it was legalized",22Aug2020,1
11,"Today I decided to join reddit, fuck it I thought, nothing but advertisements corraling me towards it anyway. Figured I'd write this and see what happens. I have been aware that everything is meaningless. Fantasies concocted to give false purpose and a sense of keeping everything from erupting into hellfire and bloodshed. Every single thing in life, the words we speak, thoughts we have and shit we invent to ""push mankind forward"" is a fruitless attempt to control everyone and everything around them. No not the illuminati, that shits pointless too. When you truly sit back and realise that nothing you do matters and nothing anyone does affects you or can change anything about the most certain aspect of existence. We procreate, let them run free and die, rot into the ground and feed the cycles of nature. Looking around and listening to what people deem an important issue becomes mad people rambling and struggling to designate more ""goals"" or give more meaning. Theres no meaning to life, emotions are pointless and people are just husks that eat, breathe, wander and die. I'm more interested to see what happens when we die. Dont believe a magic man created this in 7 days or we came from fish. Its considered a cynics point of view but weirdly enough people can achieve contempt for their life and surroundings when they realise that everything was given a purpose by people. The economy, relationships, power, laws and territory. When words just become sounds made that some people appear to understand you can consider yourself at peace. Fuck it. Nobody will even pay attention.",22Aug2020,1
12,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Yeah, I can just save the posts through Reddit, but that’s not the point. Even if saving a video to my camera roll is redundant, it’s called the fuckin’ principle of the thing. I WANT MY AUDIO.",22Aug2020,1

""I was talking to friends, we were doing some school stuff. Close to the end of the call, I realized that is has been a while since I've played any game on my computer.

This made me sad, I have some time to play, but I don't find motivation to do so. Now this feeling is crumbling up inside me, like being crushed from the inside out, I am no longer happy, I haven't been for a good amount of time. 

I am worried I won't get an internship in time, but I also can't step up to find one more efficiently. After this, how am I gonna get an employment, I don't really know what I can and what I can't do, I don't even know who the fuck I am, how am I supposed to tell you? 

All these feelings are burning on my skin, travelling through the tip of my fingers and reaching your eyes from a simple screen... and then, this is all going back to inside my mind, building up with thoughts that are probably killing me.""",22Aug2020,1
14,"First off, I know it’s my fault, I was too clingy, overbearing, I have too many mental health issues that was taking too long to sort out (I’m on medication, I am trying to get counseling, but it’s taking time). So no one needs to tell me how terrible of a girlfriend I was. I just don’t know where to go from here. 

We were dating for a year, and it was one of the happiest years of my life. Unfortunately he was a busy person with work, school, family, and time consuming hobbies that kept him from coming to see me. I loved 2 hours away for university and I kept taking the bus to see him every chance I could. He came to visit me twice. Now that it’s summer I moved home and am only 30 minutes away, but since he’s had to take care of his 12 year old brother all day I have had to go to his house all the time. This wasn’t great for my anxiety but I pushed through since I wanted to see him. I couldn’t tell him how I really felt because if I did he’d get upset and cancel plans. His parents also didn’t let him see me sometimes, especially when it came to driving 2 hours to see me. He still lives with them so he has to respect them and I understand that. 

Again, I know it was my clinginess and inability to be happy on my own that destroyed this relationship. So where do I go from here? I just don’t know because this breakup has hurt so much that it feels like I can’t go on.",22Aug2020,1

My end goal is to eventually write a book series, but I'm wondering whether or not I should start shooting for that goal right now, or if I should just keep my writing as a hobby for the time being. I'm 19 years old and in college. I'm probably not going to have a lot of time for any hobbies. It also doesn't help that I was in a massive depressive slump for a few months, meaning that I haven't published anything to my website in a while. I feel like I need more experience before I start pursuing a career in this field. The only real issue holding me back is the issue of comparison. Seemingly, a lot of people around my age (late teens to mid-twenties) are doing a lot of creative work online and getting noticed. I can't help but feel like I'd be falling behind if I don't enter the field as soon as possible. It's an irrational thought, but it still worries me a little.",22Aug2020,1
18,"His kindness, sincerity, and helpful nature... 
I just wasn’t used to being treated that way.  I miss that feeling so much.  Such a stark contrast to what I was used to.  To be honest, I think it was part of the reason I ended my relationship. He sort of helped me realize how poorly I had been treated for so long. 

Maybe he was being “extra nice” just to me, but it doesn’t even matter why.  He was always so damn nice. I found myself completely drawn to him.  But now he’s gone, and I f*cking miss him!",22Aug2020,1

I seem like I have my shit together. I have my own place, have my own car, I’m debt free, have an emergency fund and a 401K at 25. Everyone that gets to know me seems to like me and enjoy my company. However:

I work a job I only tolerate M-F 9-5 and look forward to the weekends. Yet when the weekends comes, I can’t wait for Monday. 

I’m lonely, and most of the time I do nothing to fix it. When I do attempt dating sites, I get no matches.
I want the touch of another human, yet I think I might be asexual.
I want to be left alone. 

I have no passions. 
I have no drive. 
I have no opinions of my own. 
I have no goals. 
I never have. 

The only thing I do in my free time is surf reddit and YouTube or go for a drive. 

My self-confidence is low to nonexistent. 
I find myself ugly. 
I find myself boring. 
I have nothing to say, even to friends and family. 

I feel like I don’t even know my friends or family, despite knowing most for most of my life. 
I remember little to nothing about my childhood.  

I find that the life events I look forward to typically leave me disappointed when the time comes.

Doing usual son-dad stuff like helping with the yard, telling me I should get home earlier, etc. But lately our whole bond has gone down the drain over fucking petty politics. I've become interested in history and politics at schools, and I've of course developed opinions on the current situation, and obviously the presidential election. It used to be something I enjoyed reading about and discussing at schools. But now, with the election heating up, my Dad found out that my opinions differ from him. He insists that we watch the national news at dinner and yells at me about the news stories while I just sit there looking down at my plate waiting for it to be over. He tells me I'm an idiot, I'm wrong, and insults me until dinners over. Now instead of watching sports I stay in my room, where I can hear him alone downstairs, yelling at Biden and Trump in the TV. It really hurts to have my own dad scream at me over something petty. Is a fucking presidential election really more important than you and your son? I can't help feeling horrible now.",22Aug2020,1

31,"You know what's awesome about,being drunk? It gives you the confidence to talk about anything!

I had a couple of wine, both white and red, tasty! Anyway I always had a hard time let myself go with the flow, well really sometime it difficult to speak really really freely. Sometime my mind talk too much it annoying but when I'm drunk it quiet everything, all the voices! I feel like I can be my true self when I'm tipsy! 

I know its not the healthy thing blah blah
But sometime I love to let myself to appreciate the openness. I understand people being against drinking. Really I do. I grew up harsh as well I didn't post most of it in my history but I will eventually. But more to the point, I always have a hard time telling people close to me what's really on my mind or anything. But drinking is sometime an easy ice breaker, it may not be healthy but its a start none the less. You just have to coordinate the atmosphere just right. No distraction, just good light hearted music, keep anything negative away from you. Yeah go away negative we don't like you!!!! But always at the right time I loved the conversation I have with hubby! We are able to express ourselves happily without the logic of our mind interfering, honestly it make me happy, we are able to interwind easily with out my mind being overdramatic and whine about what we are thinking that could have the oh so terrible awkward after affect. While sober I constantly worry about my image in front of my husband, but while drunk, I'm a cool person who doesnt act like a dumbass when trying to,control every thoughts and voices that pass through my head. I hate the constant filtering out something that not even remotely bad. You just got to know how to explain, even if you screw up just take a couple step back and start over that simple.

Did I tell you I love being drunk sometime? Its okay as long as hubby remind me of my limit ill respect his concern and agree. Cuz lemme be honest I go overboard lmao

I love Reddit and you guys, your stories remind,me that its okay to have these sort of things and problems, y'all make me wanna thrive better.

33,"I'll start this by saying that I'm a bit of a desperate person for any kind of intimacy and that I'm into more mature women around 40-55 years old.  I was on tinder and saw a profile of a 52 year old women saying she was recently divorced and wanted to try a FWB type deal.  So I matched with her and we started talking.  Eventually we started emailing, and we traded some semi nude pics.  She said she had some ground rules that I had to agree to before we even met.  One was that I couldn't record anything while we were together which wasn't a problem for me at all.  Another was that I had to get verified on this dating site that would track conversations and shit for safety in case I turned out to be some bad person and wanted to hurt her. The last was that I just had to be discreet which again was no problem.  

Anyways she sent me a link to the site and it looked legit.  Normally I would have automatically googled the site just to see if any links show up saying it's a scam, but I was thinking with my dumbass dick.  She told me to click on the free part because it would still work for what she needed it to.  I made an account and then it asked me for my card info.  I thought that was a bit odd since I was doing the free thing but again I was thinking with the wrong head.  I entered my card and hit accept.  The website said my card was declined so I thought maybe I entered it wrong.  As I was checking to make sure the info was right I got an automated text warning of bank fraud.  It was trying to charge 40$ to my card.  This is where I finally started using my brain.  I responded to the text to get it to block the charge.  I finally googled if this was a scam and sure enough it was.  Apparently the way the site worked was that what you saw was not really what was happening.  

Luckily I got the charge blocked so I didn't lose any money but I did have to call my bank and since the card was compromised i have to get a new one....  I'm so fucking stupid.  So I guess moral of the story is, don't be a desperate simp like me.",22Aug2020,1
34,"to sum it all up, my mom is pretty religious but i am not (and i’m also very queer). it doesn’t help that we’re african either. i have lived the past 3/4 years with the thought that my mom will disown me when i tell her i’m not religious and queer and is the main reason i am depressed. 

although my depression isn’t as severe as it was in high school (thank god) it’s still shit. it was so bad back then that i seriously considered being getting kicked out and living in a homeless shelter. i even looked up super cheap housing in california and how to qualify. i am so ready for freedom but i’m no where near financial stability and i know how impossible it is to work out of poverty in america. 

my main problem is i’m so unmotivated to do the things i need to do to move out (my goal is to move to europe). i don’t have a job bc i’ve applied to so many places and have only ever worked at one of them. i need to pass classes to get my fafsa back but i missed the deadline to pay for classes and got kicked out of my class and i don’t even care. i’m not doing the things i need to because i’m just so unmotivated. when i think of my future i imagine myself as happy and free but i just can’t connect what i want and making it happen. my greatest fear is being even more depressed and suicidal and continuing to live this way. i tell myself what i want will happen but i don’t even act on it and before i know it time has passed but i’m still in the same place. 

i’ve already accepted that my mom will disown me when i move out and tell her my truth but i still live at home and she can tell i’ve distanced myself from her. i don’t want to regret not being close to her when i’m older and don’t have her in my life but it’ll be easier for me to leave if i’m as unattached as possible. 

and i think i need advice to just get over my lack of motivation and support and words of wisdom. i need advice about how to navigate my relationship with my mom and life advice in general.",22Aug2020,1

38,"A few months ago, on a separate account, I would spend about 8-12 hours a day on Reddit. I hardly ever got anything else done, including tasks related to school, work, and hobbies.

I used to think that Reddit was the greatest thing ever. I viewed Reddit users as so much ""smarter"" than the users on average social media sites. I thought that Reddit felt intellectual and that I was actually learning things from it. I would comment on posts quite often.

Some kinds of communities that I really enjoyed were those based on calling people out for doing something wrong or believing in something false, such as r/iamatotalpieceofshit , r/cringe , r/insanepeoplefacebook , r/forwardsfromgrandma , and so on. For some reason these were addictive to me. It was addictive to me to feel outraged.

I suppose I liked mocking people whose worldviews differed from my own. Most of the time, I would never be able to empathize or understand the other person's point of view. How can somebody be so stupid? Especially if they were offering a view that most of Reddit disagreed with. Couldn't they see how dumb they look disagreeing with the vast majority of people?

Something I noticed was that I was always in quite a bad mood, especially after going on a Reddit binge. Through all my commenting, I would get into quite a lot of internet fights on this site.

Then covid happened. Then George Floyd happened. Basically, a whole myriad or controversies came with 2020.

Because most of the focus was on these issues, I found myself fighting with other Reddit users more than ever. Whenever somebody would say something I thought to be erroneous, I just had to engage. I couldn't help myself. And I could never just end the argument or let it go.

Because these issues were so new, Reddit was sometimes divided, which is rare for a site that usually establishes one point of view and tends to only value said single point of view. As Reddit was fighting with itself so much, I began to notice misinformation more. I found, for example, many photos posted to purposefully incite outrage, photos that research found were either photoshopped or completely changed in meaning due to context that the posted failed to provide. 

I was stunned to figure out just how truly common such manipulative misinformation was. Only due to a little bit of polarization among the community was I able to realize this. Typically on Reddit, misinformation is allowed to slide so long as it supports their established consensus criteria.

One day, my account got suspended.

I had gotten into another one of these online arguments and said something which apparently broke some site-wide rule. While suspended, I could still scroll through the site, but I couldn't comment on anything, which was a big deal to me. 

In the three days that my account was suspended, I noticed a huge increase in my quality of life. I was so much calmer, less pessimistic.

What I reflected on during my time off Reddit is that, in many ways, the site only offers ""intellectual"" community on the surface. It is **rarely actually conducive to conversation.** Rather, it gives an **illusion of discourse** and **hinders any kind of actual dialogue.** This is because for every political, social, or scientific issue, the community here always establishes a consensus criteria on what is true and correct — and anybody who disagrees is downvoted into oblivion.

I used to be so brainwashed, so convinced by everything Reddit told me to believe. I would think lowly of anybody who had differing views, totally unable to comprehend how anybody could not see the world the same way.

Although most of my beliefs have remained, I now hold my reasons for believing them to much more scrutiny. I am less willing to be manipulated.

I used to think that only the ultra conservative right-wing were prone to hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance. And so, I was more likely to trust content that was left or liberal, like most of Reddit's posts. But I have since realized that cherry-picking and cognitive dissonance are common among all worldviews. People choose what they believe often based on identity, and then construct the narrative with the conclusion already set. And it seems that especially the left can be too self-righteous to view this as backwards or wrong.

When I was finally able to use Reddit again, I scrolled for a little bit, but after being off of it for just a few days, the **manipulative, highly politicized** nature of its content seemed more apparent to me. Digesting Reddit posts suddenly felt less appealing.

Ultimately, I had lost my craving for Reddit content. I deleted the app for a while, and now that it is redownloaded, I only go on the site if I am searching for something specific.

Now, when I go on Reddit, I can feel my brain start numbing. This used to be addictive to me, and would somewhat prevent me from having any kind of a life outside of my phone, but now I can't stand that feeling. As soon as I open Reddit. I immediately want to just close the app. 

I am much happier — and certainly more empathetic to other perspectives — now that I have seriously cut back on my Reddit usage. I have begun scaling back on all social media usage, and have seen additional benefits to that. I don't advocate for shutting oneself off from the world completely as in never recieving political information of any kind, but make no mistake: **engaging in echo chambers is not the same as being ""informed.""** Hold everything to scrutiny.

However I’m sick of hangovers, wasting my money and not living what I feel to my full potential. While I enjoy beer or a couple of glasses of wine, I don’t personally crave alcohol. Every time I try to give it up though the social pressures break me. I’ve always enjoyed drinking with my close friends and girlfriend (F33) but when I go to give up I always feel like I’m letting them down. It’s like they don’t know who this guy is and think maybe he’s not as much fun. It’s almost like I’ve offended them. My girlfriend is probably the worst. Every time I mention it or broach the conversation there’s almost a look of distain on her face, like we need alcohol and I’m being melodramatic! I love her but I am worried this might put a wedge in our relationship.

69,"Story short: Autism + brain injury = I can't say no to strangers when in person/ I can, but not if they keep pushing it. Even if the request is detrimental to myself. Even if I know it's probably wrong and don't want too. (This has long been established and known, It's not a new discovery.

Long story:
So early this week a guy turned up (don't know how we actually got talking) either way after him pushing for a good 10 mins, it led to me giving him £10 upfront to do some decorating and the rest to be given upon completion (note: I've had it drilled into me to only give cash upon completion) I didn't want to hand it over but felt as if I had to/ He guilted me into it saying he needed money to feed his kids. 

When he turned up to do the work things got out of hand, he hadn't come alone like planned and jumped right into saying hes going to start working on other things too that I didn't want, nor could afford, all while I was saying I didn't want it being done, and can't afford to pay for the other jobs. He just kept saying I can pay him at a later time. So I panicked. ..Cut somewhat short; while they had gone to fetch sheets, so paint doesn't get everywhere I went across the road to ask for help in the situation.. Not remembering his face I end up insulting the guy to his face...My neighbour calmed things down with him and later my mum went to explain things. (Turns out I'd used a insulting word, not knowing I shouldn't use it)

Since then I've seen him daily, he's ""Pushed"" (asks several times, gets what he wants, but then asks If I'm sure a dozen times afterwards) for different things.. most being money. I've now met his kids, given him a further £37 been encouraged into having Sunday dinner together and for us to be good friends. He's said he will do jobs for me since were friends, like cleaning gutters, fixing my fence and y'know.. doing the original painting thats not yet been done.

Well today turns out his Ex-boss learned of this ""friendship"" came to my house?! He warned me to not get involved, explaining hes a thief and will get me into trouble and to never let him inside my home, an if he turns up to call the police.

So yeah, thats been my week. It's partially being spineless, but mostly just Autism issues... but being a Vulnerable adult thought? What do you lot think",22Aug2020,1
70,"Hi. Sorry, but I need to vent somewhere. 

Last year my grandma died unexpectedly. It broke my heart because it felt like she and my grandpa were the only ones in my family who seemed to care about me. 

In May my grandpa had a stroke and had to be in the ICU for about 2 weeks. They also found out that his heart was damaged but surgery would be too dangerous. 
Then he was in a clinic where he should learn to walk and do normal things again. Unfortunately I couldn’t visit him due to COVID. But my parents knew that I wanted to. 
And even my mother knows since last week that he’s home. Even though my dad and her broke up 9 years ago. We’re now at 10 people who knew it but didn’t felt the need to tell me. 

Fast forward to today. I get a call from our tenant (yup, that‘s right not even a family member) that my grandpa is home since August 8th and that he needs me and I should come visit him to help him out. So I went straight to his place and helped him. He may be an old grumpy guy but he was still very glad to see me. 

He’s the only grandparent I have left. At least I know now that my family in fact doesn’t care for me. Otherwise someone would’ve told me right away or at least within the first week of him being back home.",22Aug2020,1

18-21  my Bachelors, where I stayed in my room for 12 hours a day missing  class, playing games and otherwise being frightened to interact with  people. The degree I studied, business, was something my parents picked  and thought I would do well in. I escaped with a passing mark.

23-24  Fast forward to grad school in Europe, where I turn up - with the  social skills of a closeted hikikomori/game addict. I socialize more  this time, have friends and meet the most beautiful girl I've met, and  we have one date, where, young and inexperienced, I pay for everything  at a bowling alley and nice restaurant, and she ends up stroking the arm  of another guy at a party. I end up depressed.  
I work in corporate  in a job related to my gradschool degree, but hate it so much I quit. I  rebel against my parents and tell them I will become a scientist, which  has been my passion. They say they will disown me, in response.

24-26  I go through my remaining years in Europe doing some amateur acting  groups, where I learn to break out of my shell. I grow as a person and  learn how to interact with others. I get some female attention so feel a  bit more confident about myself. However - the girls I meet and like  either have boyfriends or are incompatible (a rich ""yacht rich"" model,  or a careerwoman 11 years older than me - I am still doing a  Bachelor's).

26-27 Forced to go  back to Asia because of student visa expiring, I land in a totally  different culture - a small tropical island town.

Everyone my cousin talked to after that day told her it was nothing, it’s not going to count against him due to the age and blah blah blah. Low and behold, a few years later, my cousin has immigration appointments(already set from years before) and she is denied because her child has reports. Then she goes to the police department, turns out the file is open and my nephew is characterized as a sex offender. My cousin tried and tried and finally was able to contact the police officer and all he said was he was doing his job. How can this be fixed, at the time this incident occurred he was a non verbal child with Autism and only two years old! It’s not fair for him to have a life disadvantage like Autism but now this report following him for the rest of his life! What can be done?",22Aug2020,1

96,"I’m not sure how long this thread will be, but I’ve lost a few relationships due to me being obsessive. It’s one if the biggest issues for people dating online or talking over text a lot.

Being obsessive sucks for everyone and it becomes a cycle that gets worse and worse until you breakup. Obsession seems to stop them opening up to you and trusting you as well, so the breakup might be an indirect result of being obsessive- maybe they don’t like something that you did but they didn’t tell you because you’re obsessive. 

Disclaimer - There is a difference between being obsessive and focussing on that person -
In a good conversation, both you and your partner will reply fast and will focus on each other. If they are replying instantly, it’s fine for you to do the same because they clearly want to talk and put all their attention on you. Being obsessive is one-sided every day occurrence in which you are the one to always text first, text back instantly, and keep texting until they reply.

What can cause obsession-
Obsession seems to mostly be caused by either not satisfying / entertaining yourself enough or talking for your partner for hours everyday at the start of a relationship and trying to maintain that forever - the start of relationships are always amazing and your focus is always on them and their focus is always on you, but things change and you try to hold onto that and become more obsessive which hurts them more and more.

Ways of being obsessive - 
Some of the most common actions of being obsessive seem to be any of the following: texting back instantly, waiting for replies, thinking about and trying to find out what they’re doing, texting over and over until they reply, stalking their other social media platforms, asking their friends and family about them, you’re the one carrying the conversation, allowing them to become the only source of happiness and entertainment in your life.

No one likes obsession -
I always asked my partner about being obsessive and they said it’s totally okay and I’m not to worry. But if you feel like you’re being obsessive, you most likely are. If you’re getting anxious or paranoid about it, that’s not healthy and it needs to change. In the starts of relationships, you can talk for hours none stop, but you might lose focus of when that slows down and after a while, you’re not calling anymore but instead you’re being left on read and your relationship is deteriorating in front of you. 

You’re not alone with the problem of obsession -
I never realised how many people had trouble with being obsessive in a relationship, but so many of my friends have told me about how they were obsessive and how it has affected them. It’s okay to have personal or relationship issues, we’re all in the same boat (:

How &gt;&gt; NOT &lt;&lt; to deal with obsession -
‘Just get a hobby’ DOES NOT work for most people. This is such a broad answer that it can mean anything. DO NOT try your hardest to avoid and stop texting that person, this will make you more anxious and you will end up becoming more obsessive towards them. Instead, find another activity to take your mind off things.

Ways to deal with obsession -
Whenever you feel bad or anxious, just take a step back and breathe else you will get into a mess and annoy that person more by apologising and asking them if they still love you and if you’re being annoying or obsessive (which will annoy them). Whenever you feel anxious about texting them or waiting for a text, completely forget about that person and the conversation for the time being. How? It’s different for everyone. I watch Jim Carrey’s original stand up acts on YouTube and text all my contacts with ‘Hey’ Find something that you can really get immersed into which doesn’t involve that person. Maybe play a game with all your friends, maybe go outside. Just do something that makes you feel good and get so into it that you forget the anxious feelings and that person. 

Additional steps to take -
After a while, let them text you back first. After all, they love you and love your company so they will want to start the conversation. But don’t be scared if this takes a while - some people are stubborn and some people take a while to trust again.

Side notes -
Eventually, that person will be able to trust you again and not feel like they’re being stalked. They will text you first again and you will be able to have amazing time together again. But do NOT start obsessive habits again. It’s okay to have bad thoughts and get anxious over texting.

You can decide to sit on the couch and mope and cry and eat unhealthy, troll people online  doing nothing productive, and you will continue to spiral downwards and be a miserable son of a bitch.

Or you can go exercise, eat healthy, have positive social interactions, work on your finances, and be a better human to your fellow man and you will feel better about yourself.  You'll still have low days but your low days will be exponetially better than even your best days when you spent all your energy blaming everyone else.

When you do this suddenly other people start to notice.  You look and feel healthier, in shape, and people will feel your confidence from that.

&amp;#x200B;

You never had any real friends, because you don't have any healthy and productive hobbies. You could start doing more with your life. You could start reading more books. You can start working out. You could stop being a disappointment to yourself, your friends and family.

&amp;#x200B;

You have a friend who accepts you for who you are, and you keep rejecting him. You have siblings that never looked up to you to lead or advice them, because you don't even know who you are.

Is this REALLY this day and age's entertainment? Are we really going to deny that HUNGER is still a problem in some countries?

I commented that on her video and I got told I was wrong by like 4 people. I'm not saying food challenges are a waste and wrong, I just don't understand how people can lack compassion with the poor.

But, my last couple friendships I realized that I would rather be alone than have “friends” who talk badly of you when you leave a room. 

I cut off my recent friends a month before COVID Quarantine struck California. 
I have tried to make new friends on bumble but I find I hate those apps right now. 
I take myself out but, after losing the additional $600 allowance, only make $1000 a month and my rent to my mom is $400 and my car insurance is $350. I basically only have money for gas or a treat here and there if I decide I want ice cream or something. 

I can’t really go out to eat. I can’t go get food and have a picnic. I can hardly buy groceries. 

I live with my mom who, per my therapist, is abusive and (as most abusive relationships) weeks can be really awesome or she will be mad and I feel destroyed. That Day is today. 

I’m home alone. Been in bed all day. No one has called or texted me in months. I want to go out and have fun but then I remember I have no one to have fun with and I don’t have money/the luxury to afford to travel long distances (gas) or even go camping.

I've also had these thoughts like what if I killed myself? But I stop right there, I never think ahead of this. The thought about my parents come to my mind, because they need me, my younger brother has CP, so they have so many expectations from me, and they'd be devastated if something were to happen to me.

It wasn't a sense of what I ""should"" do or an anxiety. I wasn't tense. I cared about what I was doing, but in the sense that I had motivation to do the job well, not in the sense that I was worried about what I was doing. I wasn't pushing myself to do it in any way, and it was like there was an energy from inside me being expressed into action in the external world.

It comes down to two points:

1. We live in a world with almost 8 billion people now.

2. Have you ever seen something where you were like “If i lived in a time where that wasn’t invented, I totally would have come up with that myself!”

With so many people on the planet, all working towards their own goals, how long is there until we are completely depleted of original content?

How many different combinations of words can possibly be arranged in books, and be published before the resulting book is an exact duplicate of another that already exists?

How many different ways can we configure instruments and their sounds before any new song is then not “original?”

If a product is invented, that invention is now taken, and nobody else can do anything with it without it being either inspired by something else, or completely unoriginal.

Let's say someone invents the paperclip. Useful, right? Now let's say that I also had that idea, but I have to make it original because paperclips have already been invented. So I make paperclips of different sizes, colors, shapes...

What am i missing in my life? Why do i constantly get back to feeling like this? Do everyone feel like this? Am i being overdramatic?

I used to play roblox almost everyday with my friends a few years ago but gradually we stopped playing it because we grew older. But ive also gradually stopped playing videogames with them in general. Why? Did they change? Did i not get what i wanted out of those friendships? But i dont even know what i want from a friendship. Did i change? How did i change? What made me not want to talk to anyone anymore? I know i tried to avoid them for a while cuz i wanted to be friends with another guy. However, when i then became friends with him and he wanted me to play videogames with him and his other friends, i didnt want to. Just couldnt be bothered for some reason. I guess it might've been exhausting?

You might say ""try doing more things with your friends"" but yeah, i tried going to the movie theater with my friend once and sure, it was fun, but would i do it now? No. And idk why i dont want to put in the effort. See, i can say all i want that ""yeah sure ill try doing more thing with my friends"" but then i ask myself if i would be prepared to pick up the phone and ask any of my friends to do an activity, and the answer is usually no. Best case cenario, i manage to do some activity with one of my friends ONCE, and then go back to doing nothing again. 

This isnt specifically about my friends, its about everything. Everytime i try to learn a new skill, i give up halfway through. Everytime i try to create a new habit i usually stop doing it after a few days. I feel like a lazy piece of shit with no goals or dreams and will amount to nothing. I hate myself right now. And i also hate myself for self-pitying myself so much.

I really dont know why i felt the need to post this here but for some reason i did. You dont have to try and help me or anything but if you relate to any of this or, at least, have ANY clue why i feel like this feel free to reply i guess.",22Aug2020,1
