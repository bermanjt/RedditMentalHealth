The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

3,"So I have an sinus infection and I went to the hospital and everything to get check out. My doctor suggest an netti pot. I brought one, I read how to set it up but did not read that I could not use tap water. Anyways, I cleaned it with tap water and rinsed my sinus with tap water (courtesy of North Carolina) , then after the fact I finally see in a yellow box ""do not use unfiltered tap water"". So now I'm panicking and scared shitless, I ended up googling ""what happens when you use tap water with your netti pot"" the first thing I see it ""Woman dies from brain eating bug from tap water with netti pot"". I am in full anxiety mode right now, this sadly has been the only thing on my mind.

In the end, she got high marks with her partner. As for me, our report did not go well due to incomplete data in our report but thankfully our professor acknowledged our effort and given us a passing grade.

Now I always wondered how different things could have happened if ever I accepted her offer that day. I could have gotten that high marks too and MAYBE a romantic relationship could have blossomed between the two of us that time.

And I feel really lonely and wish I had some Muslim friends. I love my non-Muslim friends too, they’re like a second family to me. But there’s a familiar understanding of where you’re coming from  with having Muslim friends - there are things you don’t have to say or explain.",25Jun2020,1

Dora...Dora...Dora, was she still alive, after all I didn't know if she had survived the last time I was here. I kept walking for about 30 minutes, all of the sudden I run into the floriesians retreating, there were at least 500 of them. I figured the neanderthals were closing in so, i figured i would come with the floriesians. they started climbing up trees, crap they where going to find me.

 I see a hole in the ground. likely 300-400 ft away I run in and see them there denisovans i motion for a utility room and they point me to it, I grab some equipment and rush back and take a position.

18,"This could totally be normal, maybe I’m just reading everything wrong! Idk though for sure. So basically, I’ve noticed not every time, but every once in a while when I call my boyfriend, I’ll call several times and he won’t answer, but he will be snap chatting me and texting me right after and he won’t mention the fact that I called him. He won’t mention that he can’t talk or that he doesn’t want to. He doesn’t ask why it is that I called. He just goes about his day talking to me like normal kind of ignoring my call. Maybe it is because calling makes him uncomfortable? I have asked him that and he said it doesn’t though. I’m not sure. I’ll tell him basically what I said in this post, and he’ll just text a short “sorry.” Any type of confrontation, from what I’ve noticed, makes him uncomfortable. Talking about problems to him does too I think? He says it doesn’t so maybe it doesn’t. But every time I talk to him about problems he just shuts down and stops speaking. Over text, he just doesn’t reply for long periods of time throughout the day. Idk is this normal?",25Jun2020,1

The best news?


I built this particular one on The Ricky Gervais Show featuring Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington - all the transcripts I could find ;)

I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...

I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....

This one simply draws it's wealth of knowledge from a subsection of reddit posts, and is probably the most likely to beat the Turing test of all of them:

It is really strange and you wouldn't expect there to be any difference, but when the water falls into my mouth it tastes better.  Cleaners and more refreshing.  The bottle could be dirty but even when waterfalling it the water still passes over the potentially dirty part on the bottle.  I think it is because in there slight time its falling the water is aerating.

It makes the water way more refreshing and easier to drink.  You know sometimes when you have a cup of water and your sipping and sipping but it just seems endless so to speak.  This way it feels so much fresher, I want to drink it.

I kept sleeping without blankets even when I noticed that people here also use blankets because I didn't want to bother.

To which he just replies, screaming ‘fine I’ll handle it, bye!’ and hangs up.

He actually did handle it and that’s not my problem, although him screaming at me for no reason always upsets me. What upset me more tho is that my mom called him too and told him he could come over to our old house and use the pool, without asking me first if that’s okay. She tells me on the phone, as if it was nothing, just a little side info ‘oh yeah your dad is coming today’ which did not fit my plans at all because I had been planning for weeks now to celebrate a friends birthday today from 12-18h, which neither of them knew because no one bothered to ask me if I was free today, they just assumed I was which they constantly do.

&amp;#x200B;

its almost 3 am and my heart is full, i want to write about it before bed

last night my mom and i went to chipotle for some tacos. she sent me in to order and take out. from the moment i step into chipotle i feel anxiety some on. it starts with my heart speeding up, breath shortening, then the shaking. by the time it was my turn to order, i was in full blown panic mode. i could barely order by food, i wanted to pass out. i could tell the workers knew because they were looked at me with pity.. i dont blame them. i only ordered my moms food because i couldnt handle placing another order.

walking back to the car i was worried what my mom would say. ""could she tell im having anxiety?"" ""what if she asks about my food?"" ""shes going to think im such a loser"". as soon as i got into the car i just told her the truth and started crying. she felt my heart pounding and wanted to rush me to the hospital. but i just talked it out with her and from her voice i could tell she just wanted to take the pain away from me. we talked it through and my panic eventually faded away. she insisted i take the 2 tacos but we just split them. she wasnt mad at all about sharing the food.

some might be thinking this is naturally what a mother should do but not all do this. i know some parents who would get mad at their child or even insult them. my mom has sooo much patience and love for me. shes always encouraging me to talk to her about my depression. i dont really do it because that would be every day but i know she genuinely wants to help me. im so grateful to have her as a mom. sometimes i question if i want kids because idk if ill ever amount to her.",25Jun2020,1

Recently, I realized that those negative thoughts came to me because I allow those to affect me. It defeated me a lot of times. And I should be strong enough to fight it, and use the time for character development. Other people use their time to work out, meditate, start small business, and such. I know it is difficult to be strong in this situation, but it is for us to survive. I'm not saying this because I am privileged or what— tho I'm really not. In every difficult situation, we should not let it defeat us. All we have is ourselves, and yes, our loved ones too. We may feel certain negative emotions, but it will pass.

Of the many, MANY women I've dated, it just seems like I've screwed up in different ways on so many different dates.

I also just feel like I don't click with many people, and the ones that I do click with and have fun with ALWAYS turn me down eventually. They always end up citing reasons like ""You're a great guy but I'm not attracted you"" or ""not my type"" or even ""I need to work on myself"".

I was playing basketball with a bunch of people, we met up with a larger group and we were gonna get 2 big games going, before we warmed up and picked teams I went around the corner to go take a piss, the piss felt like it was taking hours and when I got back I missed out on picking teams and couldn't play.

Long story short of the dream, we met a girl that was cool, but I noticed he was taking a little bit too much interest in her. One day I caught them walking together holding hands. That showed him cheating on me. 

Waking up and evaluating my feelings, I realized that my first instinct wasn't to beat his ass and leave him. I wanted to win him back, I wanted that attention of his heart. I knew I was losing him and I needed to stop that. I was losing control and I needed it back. It was such a feeling of pain, panic, hope, and hopelessness. I hated the girl more than I hated him because who ruins someone's relationship like that?

I know it wasn't actual cheating, but I can understand why victims don't leave and why they fight for something that's disappearing if not already gone. I have a different sympathy now. 

I don't know what I'd do in real life, but I don't think I'd be how I thought before.",25Jun2020,1
50,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",25Jun2020,0

I also got a 65 on another one of my modules. The guy made the exam solid though so I was honestly expecting a lot worse.

56,"I have a hard time reaching out for help when I’m going through difficult times. 2020 has been a rough year for just about everyone. It feels like the world is upside down. That alone has been a lot. I personally have had a really rough month. I was planning to move into a house with my friend and we had spent a lot of energy packing, cleaning, organizing and painting. I was considered essential so I also was still working 40 hours a week on a skeleton staff, at a job that’s emotionally and physically taxing. A week before I was set to move, the house fell through. My apartment was already leased to someone else and all of my stuff was packed. I didn’t know where I was going to live in a week. I scrambled and found temporary housing for me and my three pets. 

Two days later, while at work I got a phone call from my sister who lives across the country. She informed me that our mother had died. I had a difficult relationship with my mother. We hadn’t talked in ten years. My sister was close to my mother. She was trying to become our mother’s caregiver and so this all hit her in a much more emotional manner. She asked me to come help. So beings I didn’t have a place to really live we decided I would move in with her and her fiancé. This all seemed fine. 

My friends graciously helped me finish packing up and cleaning my apartment. I was able to find temporary foster homes for my animals and within three days was flown out to be with my sister. I hadn’t seen her in four years. Living with my sister has been a challenge. We are having to get to know each other as adults and have much different lifestyles. I am living on a couch in the living room and have no space to process what is going on. I’m struggling with extreme anxiety and depression, and I have PTSD because of childhood trauma and abuse. I’m so overwhelmed and I want to get professional help, but I’m now unemployed, uninsured and displaced. I’ve wanted to maybe call a hotline, but due to the multiple levels of trauma and issues, I can’t decide who to call. I’ve reached out for support and advice on Facebook groups I’ve been part of for a while and I got suspended for that. Does anyone here have advice? I’ve been trying to do positive coping skills I’ve learned in therapy in the past, but it’s just getting worse and worse. 

TL;DR: My housing fell through, I scrambled to find temporary housing, but then got a call from my sister I hadn’t seen in four years that my estranged mother had died and my sister needed me to come home 3000 miles. I have severe PTSD and my mental health is declining. Need advice on how to talk to a mental health professional ASAP.",25Jun2020,1

So, today's date is 25/06/2020. This was the date given to me by so many doctors and nurses last year, that I'd be due to give birth to my little girl, who I'd planned to name Abigail, or Abby. I had this whole wild plan to be a kick ass single mum, because as young pregnancies often go, the dad was a douchebag and ran. I was going to raise her on video games and kindness, I was so looking forward to having silly traditions with her, like Sunday pancakes, or overdramatic bedtime stories. I couldn't wait to dress up this tiny person like all my favourite characters, and when she got old enough, show her them.

62,"What is with this whole ""man"" phenomenon that American civilization forces onto all male humans? Humans can do what makes them happy, but it's hard to understand when over 99% of male humans subscribe to the ""man"" thing. I assume it's cultural natural selection. The male humans that adopted that role were most likely to reproduce.

For example, an elderly customer randomly called me a ""young man"". I believe that is because of clothing choices that advertise adherence to the ""man"" spirit, even though I didn't choose to adhere. It's only because I was taught no other form of clothing and grooming. Even though it's just cotton and materials, clothing is a major part of how humans present a social spirit.

Many humans mistakenly believe the ""man"" thing is inherent to male humans. You're ""born a man"". If you have XY chromosomes, you're a ""handsome boy"" who grows into a ""handsome man"". But actually it's just an act and an appearance, no different from being emo, goth, skater, hippie, etc.",25Jun2020,1

I wanted that job so bad. The interview went so well. I needed to make this happen, it’s been months and i haven’t been eligible for unemployment during quarantine. I’m so stressed out.

68,"TL;DR: My fear of being vulnerable made me ruin a 1.5y relationship and now I'm devastated. Excuse my long post, I wanted to make sure I don't miss anything.

I was a single, attractive guy in the big city for about year and half. For the first time in my life (after being mostly a loser), I felt like I can actually choose the women in my life, an endless pool of women. I must have dated about 40 women in this period, and honestly, it really made me forget who I once was and what I really want. I developed this mindset of abundance, I became arrogant. I felt like I don't really need a woman in my life at all, and I can get away with giving them very little of me. They're all replaceable anyway. Combine this with severe traumas from my past relationships, which made me afraid of being vulnerable and attached, and what you get is a man who convinced himself that no woman should ever see his soft, warm, loving side.

This is where I was when I met my now-ex. She was younger and had this innocent, harmless vibe to her. She was super intelligent and ambitious (a med student), a compassionate and loving person, had a great sense of humour, and it didn't hurt that she was the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. She was the first one I decided to take seriously. We were together for a year and a half. She really did love me, she did things for me no one ever did. And deep down I knew that this was the woman I want to marry someday.

Unfortunately I couldn't get rid of my toxic attitude. While I was opening up, little by little, it was just too slow. She wanted us to talk more, meet more. She wanted me to be more involved with her friends and family. She wanted us to move in together, etc. Deep down I wanted those things too, I really did, but for some reason I couldn't get myself to give her what she wanted. I felt like I constantly have to be on guard, not giving her too much, not being vulnerable, not getting too attached because it can blow up in my face. Can't be a ""pleaser"" or a ""pushover"", have to be ""the man"". I convinced myself that I don't ""need"" this relationship. But this was a lie, a defence mechanism.

She's a non-confrontational type of person. She didn't want to upset me. So she put up with all of this. For the first 17 months I barely heard any complaint from her. I thought that I have more time to open up. But I didn't. She was unhappy, she felt like she loves me more than I love her. She felt like she deserves more (she does). All that resentment built up inside of her, and when it did come out it came out too strong. I felt like I was being attacked, I felt like she was nagging, I instinctively went on the defence. I couldn't see what she was really trying to tell me. After 17 months with no fighting at all, the last month was full of these sort of fights, where she would go ""crazy"" (in my eyes) over something trivial every few days. To me it looked like she was always looking for validation that I don't love her. It was nonstop. She just couldn't keep quiet about anything anymore. And then we broke up. It was almost mutual at that point. I remember telling myself, ""She's crazy, I don't really need this anyway"". It was almost like a relief.

But the truth is I really did miss her. I thought about her every day. After 2 weeks, enough was enough, I knew I had to reach out to her. I did and I showed her a more loving side of me, I told her how important she is to me, and that I wanted us to work, and that I wanted to give her more. She was very moved and surprised, she told me this several times, but she felt like she needed more time to think. So a day went by, and then another day, and another. I would call her every couple of days and suggest to meet. But she needed more time to process. Looking back, I should have just given her the time she needed.

But my old habits came back again and I got restless. I told her that she's putting me on hold and that's not cool, and she replied ""you're not on hold, you can do whatever you want"". ""Really? And if I want to be with another woman, is that cool?"". There was a long pause, after which she said ""if that's what you want"". This raised my suspicions (again, past traumas), I asked her if there's someone else. ""No... I did download dating apps again, but just talking"". Now I know that this is completely fair and that's what people do, but at the moment it infuriated me. Here I was, thinking about her for weeks, and she's on Tinder?! Hell no! I snapped and wrote her the meanest text, saying that I regret ever wasting time with her and implicitly suggested that she's a you-know-what. I blocked her on everything. This was a very sensitive spot for me.

At first I was OK. I was still angry for a few days, and it didn't allow me to think clearly. Then a few more days of trying to push the thoughts away. My best friend got diagnosed with cancer, and for some reason I asked myself ""if I had just a few weeks/days left, what would I regret the most?"". The answer was obvious to me, and I just broke down crying. I wrote her a long apology, explaining why I said those things and how deeply I regretted them. I told her that I still love her, and miss her so much, and if she feels the same, I hope that we can still make things work. She told me she must have read it 30 times, that she was both so happy and so sad to read it, and that unfortunately she can't go back.

I drove immediately to her house and asked her to come outside. We spent about an hour talking on the street at 3AM. Laughing, bringing up memories, even a bit of kissing. But she told me that she is so hurt from me, not just because of the awful things I've said, but also because of how I acted in the relationship. She said that I was impulsive. I tried my best to explain to her how I want things to change, but after a while she said goodbye and left. I sent flowers to her house the next day. I texted her and called her for days. She would always answer, she never ignored me, but she kept basically saying the same thing. That she understands, that she loves me and is always here for me, but she needs that I respect her decision.

I wrote her a very long letter (longer than this post), explaining everything from my point of view. I poured my soul into this letter. I apologized for everything. I told her what made me behave the ways that I did. I told her exactly how I see things differently now. How things will change. How much I love her and miss her. How I will make sure that it works. How I understand her point of view. I told her that I think she's the love of my life, and that I want everything with her, and that I will do everything to make her happy. I must have spent 5 hours writing this letter, after several weeks of self reflection. I have never said anything this honest to another human being in my life.

But it didn't make a difference. She said that she appreciates me now x1000 more than when we broke up, but at the end of the day, she doesn't feel like she can continue, she's too hurt, she doesn't think it'll work because she won't be able to forget what happened, she's also scared that it'll be the same way again, she doesn't really know what she'll be getting herself into with the ""new me"", she's scared of what will happen if it doesn't work again, etc. I'm ashamed of this, but the last time I saw her I eventually started crying in front of her. I started begging. I really felt like I was holding on to the most important thing in the world. I must have spent 2 weeks trying everything to get her back, from meeting her, calling her, texting her, writing letters, etc. Eventually I felt like I was starting to bother her, and she just feels sorry for me. She told me that she's worried about me. It feels so bad getting pity from the person who once loved you. That's when I knew I had to let her go before humiliating myself further.

It's really difficult for me to explain how miserable I am now, after 3 weeks of no contact. I don't think there's a single 10 minute window during the day when I don't think about her. It's all the time. I dream about her. I fall asleep thinking about her. I wake up and she's the first thing on my mind. I cry every day, a grown man, for weeks. Not just tears, but full ugly-snot-crying (pretty sure my neighbours can hear me). This happens multiple times a day. There's this physical pain which is just unbearable, like a huge void. I can't work, had to take several days off. I don't feel like doing anything. I went a few days without eating because I have no appetite. I've had breakups before, but I never felt like this. I've never felt this bad in my entire life, I even had to talk to my parents about it (we never talk about these sort of things) because I was hurting so bad and I just didn't know what else to do. I cried to my mom, man.

I started going to therapy for the first time. 6 sessions already, but I don't feel like it's helping. I'm trying to exercise every day, get some sun and nature, meet friends and family more, etc., but it all feels like pointless distractions. I don't really feel like doing any of it, and I don't feel like it's working. I tried talking to other girls too, but honestly I don't think I'll ever meet anyone that comes close to her. I keep thinking of how long it took me to find her and how lucky I was, it seems impossible that I will ever be as happy as I could have been with her, no matter what I do. The only thing that makes me feel a little bit better for a while, is having this false hope that maybe one day we'll get back together.

I keep telling myself, my birthday is 5 weeks away. Will she text me? Probably. If not, her birthday is just another 5 weeks away, I can text her. Maybe by then, she will heal a bit? Maybe she will miss me a bit? Just a ""happy birthday"", maybe I’ll ask how she’s been doing, maybe she’ll ask me the same, maybe I’ll ask her to get some coffee, maybe she’ll agree, maybe we’ll have a fun time just chatting and bantering and bringing up memories with maybe a little bit of touch and looks, nothing overtly romantic or sexual, we won't be talking about the breakup or anything sad like that, and then I’ll say goodbye and leave her with something to think about. Then maybe after a day or two I’ll ask if she wants to do it again sometime. Maybe she’ll say yes, and maybe we’ll get back together eventually. I know it’s so pathetic, and a longshot, and most likely never going to happen. But this is really the only thought that stops me from crying at the moment. And it's the only thing that drives me to improve myself at the moment.

I don't know why I can't let go of this. Objectively I know that I'm lucky in many ways. I'm young and healthy, I have a supporting family and friends, I have my dream job and my financials are in great shape, I'm good looking, I know how to talk to women, etc. But I feel like I can never be happy anymore. I feel like I will never be as happy as I could have been with her, nothing matters, no other woman will even come close, the memories will always hurt, etc. I can't shake off this feeling no matter how hard I try, I think that she will always be ""the one that got away"" and it will haunt me forever.

I’m honestly writing here because I am just so damn miserable, and I don't know how to handle this pain. I have to stop myself from texting her and humiliate myself further, almost every day. I’m not suicidal, never have been, never will be. It was always so strange to me that people feel like dying is the best option. Not to be dramatic, but I’m starting to understand the meaning of unbearable pain. There are moments where I wish I was dead because I just don't see a way out of this. I feel like I can't handle these feelings and I feel like it will continue for a very long time, if not forever.",25Jun2020,1

71,"I just gotta get this off my chest. I just recently found this subreddit and I got the feeling this is the right one to post my story on. (Also excuse my bad English, I’m not a native speaker) 
This happened to me just a few weeks ago. So to begin with, I am 17 and I still live at home with my parents. In my room there’s a trash can which I usually use to throw away paper, empty water bottles and other small stuff. Well lately I’ve had some bad taste in my mouth ( idk where it came from ) and since I have a sensitive stomach it sometimes makes me feel a bit sick if I swallow my own saliva. So instead of swallowing I decided to spit into the small trash bin in my room. This became a ritual over the next few months. And with that the bin slowly started to fill with spit, though you coulndt really see it on the bottom since I kept throwing away papers and empty water bottles into it. 
So one day my mom comes into my room with a cardboard box in which she wants to empty the papers and platic from my bin into. Well she takes the bin, turns it upside down and let’s It’s  contents drop into the cardboard box. When she picked up the box to carry it away, tons of apparently not yet dried saliva mixed with a few drops of Water, from the almost empty water bottles, started to drip out of the bottom of the cardboard box onto the floor. By the thickness of the stuff that came out between the flaps of the cardboard box my mother could most likely tell that it was not just water but something else. So there she stood in my room with this massive box fool of paper and spit, the day old drool slowly dripping out in big sticky drops onto the floor. And me just looking at her with other shock and embarrassment. 
I just looked at her and said “Oh I guess the water bottles from my trash bin weren’t completely empty”, but I could tell by the look on her face that She knew that it must have been some thing else. She just left the room with the box without saying anything and I got a towel to clean the sticky spit off my floor. 
So that was my story idk if it was that embarrassing but I guess it was a bit weird for sure. At leat it was just a spit basket and nut a cum basket I guess. Anyway congrats to anybody who made it to the end, you just waisted your precious time lol",25Jun2020,1

I **don’t** want a boyfriend to fix me - that’s not healthy. I mean sure I would t mind having someone who will be there for me every now and then, sure, but my mental health is my responsibility. I just want someone I can go do fun things with and spend time with and stuff. But again, no guy wants a girl who is this messed up.

75,"I just need to get this off my chest. I am depressed and in pain and I can't take it any more.

Every day I've had extreme anxiety over being enough. Usually it's stress over paying for college, and I hate that I have to rely on my parents for help with loans. Today my parents told me I might be the reason my youngest sibling can't go to college (I'm the oldest of four) because my parents will run out of money by the time he goes to school.

I work long hours every single day at a difficult job. It's not enough. I can't even find another job due to the virus. My savings aren't enough either. But every day I work myself raw at this job. But it's never enough.

All I want out of life is a cheap, used car, a cheap place to live, and a college degree. I'll never achieve any of it. It all costs too much. 

I spend the time when I'm not working helping to raise my three siblings. I do chores nonstop, I run errands nonstop, I make meals every day so my parents don't have to. Then I go to straight to work. And the cycle repeats every day. 

I don't feel any joy anymore. I had things that made me happy, but now they don't. Neither my friends or my boyfriend make me happy anymore. I just cry all night and start the process again the next day. The stress is too much to bear.

I hate being a burden. I hate that nothing I do matters. I hate being stuck in this cycle relentlessly. I wish I had succeeded in ending everything when I was 15, then at least my parents wouldn't have my burden anymore. They could afford to give my siblings everything they need, and they could pay their college in full.

86,"Ok, listen up, because I'm going to tell you exactly what to do, and then I'll cross my fingers that it'll work.

Ask yourself what kind of excuses you've made to keep chasing the girl. Let's break it down.

1. At some point you knew you liked this girl.

1. At some point, you made a move on her. If she knows you like her, it was a move. If you didn't do a very good job, it was a bad move, but that's besides the point.
1. You decided to keep chasing her after she didn't reciprocate.


Ok, so ask yourself, which excuses did you make for number 3. This is really important. Write it all out. Why did you think it was a good idea to keep chasing someone who wasn't interested.

All the reasons now. Even the most humiliating ones. Write that shit down. What comes next is the hard part:

All those reasons are wrong. There is no excuse for chasing a girl after you find out she isn't interested. It's beneath you. It wastes your time. Think of it like this: If you treat her any differently than a dude after she doesn't reciprocate, you can't be near her. That's the rule. She has to be a man to you. If you can treat her like she's a dude, there's no harm in associating with her. If you can't, tough shit, don't be around when she's around. If you have to make yourself scarce, make yourself scarce. Go find some other place to be. Put on loud music. Do whatever you need to do. Anyway, all of that doesn't help you now.

The key however is that list you wrote down. You must come to terms with the fact that every reason you wrote down was wrong, and you were being an idiot. I'm using harsh language because that's how I have to think of it; maybe you can be a little bit more mellow with yourself, who knows, but I could only take it seriously if I was very harsh with myself.

Ok. Now here's the crucial part. Write down why those excuses to keep chasing her were terrible. You should be able to puzzle it out. Now write a letter of forgiveness to yourself. You can address it in another persons name if you want. A father who isn't dissapointed in you, a mother who is proud of you, or a genuine letter to yourself. Explain all the things you need to say to yourself to understand that the mistakes you made are ok. That it is ok to be fallible and allow your emotions to impair your judgement. That you're a stand up person. That people like you and enjoy your company, regardless of whether you might act the fool on occasion when it comes to girls.

Read that letter every morning and every night. This is how you come to terms with it. You stop blaming yourself. You recognize that the only thing you did wrong was pursue this too far, and you forgive yourself for it, and you do that by reading that letter every day for a week, two times a day. Even if it doesn't feel real when you write it - even if it doesn't feel real the first 5 times you read it - you just need to trust me that eventually, you'll recognize that it is the truth. And then, you'll know you were a fool, but that you are no longer a fool. You'll know that you understand what went wrong. Whatever emotions may linger, you know they pull you into a bad place now. That they are bad for you. You have to fight them so you stick by your rules.

This is bitter medicine; especially admitting that it was all your own fault, and then forgiving yourself. But you have to be a man. If you don't take responsibility for your life - if you rely on women being kind to you and babying you? You are in for a world of hurt. They are not kind. They are every bit as ruthless as men. They take what they desire, just like a man would, and they don't look at the spilled milk with regrets. They assume you're man enough to not fall apart just because they ride the ding dong of one of your friends, because honestly, it's their vagina and they can do with it what they want. Can you imagine a dude not nailing a hottie he's crushing on just because her girl friend is crushing on him? I don't think so. He'd say, not everybody can be happy, and I'm looking out for number one.

But I'll tell you this: Before you man up and take responsibility for your own emotions - before you stop blaming others and start blaming yourself - you'll never be able to forgive yourself, and you'll keep feeling like an idiot. So do what I said. Write the damn lists and letters. Read them daily. Understand that you aren't a fool, you were just foolish. Move on.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

There are so many conflicting messages and thoughts on both sides. No one on either side admits their faults and chooses to highlight the others. I can’t compare the two because I have no fricken clue who’s in the right? Everyone thinks they’re on the right side and saving the country in their own way.

I miss her. It feels dumb to reminisce and feel so strongly about an 8th grade relationship. And I’m being pretty cringe, thinking about a two month relationship from when I was 14. But I don’t know I kind of feel that way. I think if we met each other now we would get along. She wasn’t always the nicest person but neither was I. I could’ve been more patient, a better listener and more supportive. I think she was somebody who I really enjoyed talking to. I if we were still friends now we could spend hours talking about stuff. Things that we were both interested in, our stances on moral and economic systems, music, current events stuff like that. As I type this, I want so badly to ask her about the Hong Kong protests, the BLM protests. I remember I was a pretty shit boyfriend. She started getting into KPop then, but I didn’t go for it. But she had tried the things I was interested in. If I could do it again I’d be a better partner, I’d listen to KPop with her, go to concerts, talk to her more. I wasn’t that kind of a person then, I was far rasher and far dumber. I wish I could have a second chance because honestly I’m terrified that she was my one chance and I blew it. I am terrified that never again will I look at somebody like I looked at her. I’m certain she doesn’t feel the way I do. Back then I didn’t really offer much. If I met the me from three years ago I would’ve hated him. I probably hate my current self too really. I just wish I could try it again. I remember back then I would say something often, “peaked in 8th grade”. It was a joke of course, the idea being that I was so happy then, how could I ever top this. It’s sad but sometimes I wonder how true it is. Rationally, I know it’s not. I’ve matured emotionally and intellectually. Soon I’ll be an adult and in college. But sometimes I can’t help but feel it’s true. Back then my grades were good, I was fit and I felt loved. Nowadays, my grades sting and I feel cripplingly lonely. It’s hard to disassociate these things from my self worth. It’s hard to look at my life now and really believe that I’m valuable. So I’m not really content. Maybe this isn’t really so much about her and it’s more about how I see myself right now. But then again, I haven’t really felt about anybody the way I did her. It wasn’t really about physical attraction with her. I thought she was beautiful but it really wasn’t it. I’ve felt attracted to good looking people before, but what I felt for her was different. I miss her. I miss feeling wanted. It’s easy to hear that things will get better, that your life will only improve. It’s harder to truly believe those words. I truly hope that in the future I will find somebody I want to be with, somebody I can look at and feel a bittersweet flutter in my heart.

98,"I have a job as flight crew right now but may lose it in a few months due to the pandemic. I told my friends I was considering going to vet tech school. I've always loved animals and it was a long ago childhood consideration. My current job (I don't hate it. Good benefits, liveable wage, and flexible scheduling) is in an unrelated field obviously. Anyone who knows anything about being a vet tech knows you barely make over minimum wage and do a ton of work. Definitely one of those career choices that you make because you love animals, not money. When I told my friends I was looking at programs and wanted input about which school to choose, they automatically were like, ""why not look into something else you're interested in?"" If I was interested in something else, I'd already be looking into it. Some friends gave a ""you can do so much better"" type vibe. They asked why not apply to vet school instead of vet tech. Even though I have a bio undergrad degree, I'd have to retake all the prerequisites and devote myself to way more schooling if I chose that path (2 years for vet tech program vs 4yrs for vet school + more for specialization and residency). There is a method to my madness. I want to ultimately work part time as a vet tech and part time at my current job(if I get furloughed, they'll invite me back.... eventually...) because I'm honestly not ready to give up flying voluntarily.

100,"So at the beginning of the whole corona virus thing, my family decided to adopt two Siamese kittens. As a college student home, and significantly less busy due to no in person classes and what not, I poured my heart and soul into those cats. They are two boys, both the last in their litter, and they are named Bento and Edamame. (Ben and Eddie for short). Eddie was quite sick when we got him, but pulled through like a trooper. On the 9th, they celebrated their six month birthday! These boys mean the world to me, and helped me get through quarantine. It’s hard to put into words how much I love them. And Siamese cats are really social and tend to bond to one another and a particular person. Eddie bonded with me since I nursed him back to health and Ben bonded with my mother. But nonetheless they had a really strong relationship with each other. 

Either way, we noticed that Bento started loosing weight and not being as active. He stopped eating yesterday entirely. I also went away on a trip with my boyfriend yesterday so I’m out of state. My mom took him in this morning and he was diagnosed with cancer, and they found a tumor the size of a softball in his abdomen. It grew so fast. He has two weeks at most, but they will be miserable, so we decided to put him down as soon as we can so he’s the most comfortable. But I won’t be there. And I feel really bad. I love him with all my heart and I can’t believe he’s going so soon. It’s for the best, I don’t want him to be in pain for the last few days of his life. He loves car rides and meeting new people, so when he goes in tomorrow he won’t have any idea that somethings wrong. My mom will be with him, and make sure he’s fine while he leaves. 

I’m glad we found out before anything got too out of hand, and that he doesn’t have to suffer more than necessary. But I’m mad at the world that he’s so sick and so young. No one deserves it, but a kitten? I don’t know. It’s unfair that he has to go through this, but there’s nothing we can do about it. I’ve accepted that, because to not let this happen would be to hurt him more, and that’s the last thing I want for him. 

He’s going to spend the rest of his life with my mom, his favorite person in the whole world, and getting all the cuddles and kisses she can get in. I’m glad about that. I’m glad he’s not going to suffer during his last day. 

But now, I’m worried about his brother. Eddie was sick his whole life and bento was there for him, like when it was obvious Eddie was uncomfortable, bento would cuddle him. It’s funny, sometimes when he can’t find his brother, Eddie starts yelling almost, like so loud, I didn’t know a kitten could be that loud. When Ben is tired, he sits on a stool in our kitchen and flicks his tail so Eddie doesn’t attack him but still has something to do. I can’t imagine one without the other. They are bonded, and the heart break and loneliness for Eddie is gonna be the hardest thing, I think. 

It’s best with this breed to have more than one, as if you aren’t home all day, everyday, they can keep each other company. They need that social interaction to be healthy. So we decided that Eddie will need another cat in the house.

I feel guilty, because I don’t want to replace Bento. Nothing could replace him.  He is such a big part of my family, and to replace him seems so heartless. But Eddie needs another cat. I’m working now and so are my parents, so he’s gonna be all alone all day. He’s going to need another cat to keep him company. We found another litter of Siamese cats in our neighborhood and are hoping to adopt one. I don’t want to replace bento, so I feel guilty for already having another kitten lined up. 

Since I think names are so important (and fun) I was thinking of names for the new kitten. I want to keep with the food theme and names that can be shortened as well. I was thinking Samgyeopsal, or korean pork belly. And calling him Sam. Or if it’s a girl Kimchi, and calling her Kim. 

I feel guilty for thinking about the other cat right now but to think only about Ben feels selfish. It’s best to put him down, and to keep him alive for my own emotional benefit is heartless and selfish. I can’t do that. So I can only think about what I can do to make my other cat more comfortable when his brother dies. 

It’s honestly helped me accept the situation to think about what I can do rather than dwell on something that I can’t fix. But I still feel guilty.

104,"I just want to say a few things here regarding my thanks for these stories coming out. The dota community has always struggled with treatment of women both in games and as talent in the scene. These stories coming out, especially those with regard to Tobi and GrandGrant, are drawing a lot of attention to the experience of women both in the scene and in wider social context.

There was a post made recently that thankfully did not gain traction that I want to address. The OP basically said that since these women may not have concrete evidence of what happened to them, they should be treated as false until concrete evidence comes forth, and that this should all be handled privately and involve the police. The issue with saying this is it dismisses the issues the scene has. The poster basically said that since these stories are not directly about the game itself, they had no place in the subreddit.

The thing that bothered me the most about what the poster said was about dealing with the emotional distress things like this cause. They said (I am paraphrasing here) there is no emotional healing that comes from these women sharing their stories. Yes, a psychologist (or therapist) can absolutely help with healing or coping with the emotional distress of things like this, but the way they phrased the entirety of their post makes it seem that this is the only option for emotional healing. It simply is not. If you allow this behavior to be perpetuated by not sharing your story, it can actively harm your own mental health.

I myself am a victim of sexual abuse. The event happened seven years ago, while I was drunk.  I really struggled to come to terms with everything, and have absolutely not dealt with it well. I previously had issues with emotional and mental health (including self harm), and this truly sent me spiraling. For a long time, I have had trust issues as well, mainly stemming from my father and how he has treated his all of his biological children post-divorce. After this happened to me, these issues were amplified to the extent that I have a severe reluctance to date at all, even now.

Here is my story:

This happened in spring quarter of my sophomore year of college, when I was 19. For context, I am a 6'3"" white man that knows of the advantages he has in life. My best friend at the time was a scene girl, for want of a better term. We are the same age, but was a freshman due to my starting college during my senior year of high school. She is the person I have trusted most for a long time. I was into her in a way, and I'm fairly certain she felt the same way given what happened.

I have never really been a person who goes to bigger parties, and this experience is likely the last I will ever have at one. I have been properly drunk once in my life, that being this occasion. Even feeling tipsy takes me back to this experience. I was drunk, I absolutely was into this girl. I trusted her with my life before this. Basically, and this is a bit reductionist, what happened was due to an inability on my part to say no. I felt I could not say no, nor push her off due to how society views men as victims of rape. There can easily be a thin line between being raped and committing an assault as a man in that situation. When it's your best friend doing it only makes it worse.

I tried to hang out with the friend group we were part of after this, but after a month I started pulling away. It's exceptionally hard to be a victim in a scenario that ends up with you still having to be around them. These friends still don't know why I left the group, and I'm really not sure if I have the strength to tell them about what happened. Part of this is because I don't really think she's a bad person, and I still like her in some ways. I desperately want to leave this behind me, but due to my previously existing mental health issues and trust issues, I feel like it isn't possible.

I ended up dropping out of college. I never told my parents the full reason, though part of it was a severe loss of interest in the subjects I previously wanted to study. It took me a few years to deal with the impact of this. I started taking classes at a local community college four years ago, but still could not handle the impact this event left. I got a job as a cook in late 2018 after enrolling in the culinary program at a local college, and this has helped me far more than any therapist I've ever seen. The girl I worked most closely with developed a decent work friendship, but I never *really* talked about myself. Our original chef de cuisine, before being fired, made a joke about self harm that ended up really hurting me, and I did hint about that having been part of my past, but I'm not sure if she really understood those hints. That is really the only thing I've said about myself and my past issues to pretty much everyone in my life outside the girl who assaulted me. 

I have shared absolutely none of this with my family. I have talked about it in therapy, but have made it clear that I don't want any of this to leave that scenario. This is likely the only time I will share any of this explicitly with anyone, including the self harm. It really helped me to hear these women's stories, and it has helped me realize that I should not be blaming myself for it.

Thank you if you've read this all. My DMs are open to anyone going through anything like this. You are not alone, and what happened to you is not your fault.

106,"I'm able to keep my health benefits through then, which is nice. It also works out because I get to focus on my college courses (summer college courses are a bitch) and I can enjoy the summer. I'll pick up a part-time job that won't interfere too much.

When my dad got home from work, I said that I hope his day was better than mine. He said he had a great day at work. Then I broke the news.

THEN, he got in a bad mood, he later yelled at my mom for ***MISPLACING*** a mother-fucking ***NEWSPAPER!*** Oh he makes me so mad sometimes. When we were younger and did dumb stuff or didn't listen, he used to yell at us. One day, when he came home, my sister and I noticed his car and we hid in our room and started crying because we didn't want him to yell at us. 

I forget if he did yell, but he walked in the room and said something. He walked out, and later opened the door, poked his head in and said ""No one should ever have to be afraid of their father.""

I can't remember if he apologized or what, but *I'll never forget that look of shame on his face*. God, I'm tearing up just thinking about it.

Dad's sitting out on the patio now. I hope he is feeling that same shame. My mom does everything for this family. Yes, my dad works and is making good money. My mom's work temporarily closed due to COVID. My mom cooks, cleans, makes his lunch that he takes to work, she pays the bills, she tends to her garden, she spends HOURS in her garden. She raised us three kids while my dad worked all day. She is the backbone of this household.

We honestly never used to see my dad when we were younger, it sometimes felt like we didn't have a dad.  Oh no, I'm crying again.

I started off this post about being furloughed, then it went into a spiel. 

I hope my dad apologizes. Thanks for reading.",25Jun2020,1
108,"Hey guys,

I just got out of a year long relationship and am having a difficult time coping. Does anyone have any personal resources they'd be willing to share to help distract myself or help realize I was in an unhealthy place? I realize the hurt is normal, but I can't stop having all these intrusive thoughts about the what if's. 

I wanted out of the relationship but now that I'm alone it's getting harder.",25Jun2020,1

111,From past experiences I learnt to be very self aware and to analyse my insecurities and problems etc as painful as it is it works today I was just thinking on why I want one of my friends approval so much. A little back story he was one of my best friends out of 3 they was me another girl and him we were all close but once we left school our relationship got a little strained we tried to meet up every now and then but nothing to crazy. now back to the main story I guess?  I have him on social media and I find whenever I post I always want him to watch my posts and hopefully one day actually pop up and say hey you look good let’s be friends again! And for a second I considered that I had feelings but I just laughed that away and today I just sat down and looked into why I want he’s approval so badly. The first and main reason is he was the first Male to be in my life to acknowledge and get to know me he’s the first Male I had a connection with (friendship wise) and the reason why I want he’s approval is because he’s second best to my dad...I’ll never get it from my dad but now I have this Male who I had a beautiful friendship with and in my head if I can get that friendship back or if he acknowledges my posts or tries to talk to me again he does what my dad won’t ever do. This is so weird to write but I hope you get what I’m saying? He’s friends with other girls who he barely spoke to in school and in my head it was always once I’m pretty enough he’ll acknowledge or once I am up to he’s standards he’ll see me again and like me and it was annoyingly painful to realise why I felt like that but I just wanted to let this out I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this so yeah. Sorry it’s so long but I didn’t know how to word this as so many things were going through my mind.,25Jun2020,1

113,"I'm not sure this is the forum to post in, but here goes.   
I've been watching a lot of Jordan Peterson's lectures of youtube, (I am not here to debate how you feel about him) and today I was listening, well re-listening, to his lecture on children and how they need to be socialized by a certain age and be taught to be likable and that often parents/people fail to socialize children by not giving them positive reinforcement when they do something good. They'll become upset with the child for his/her wrong behavior and then when the child does something good it is ignored, essentially teaching the child that there's no reward for good behavior. 

I was reflecting back into my own childhood and remembered a boy in my third grade class, Devon. He's always stuck with me because he and I shared the same birthday, but we couldn't be more different. I wouldn't say he was the class trouble-maker because he didn't really disrupt the class, but he was in trouble a lot. Mostly for defiance, not doing his work, sometimes being rude. He wasn't a pleasant child. I, however, was very quiet, obedient, studious, all the things that make a ""good"" student/child.

I remember my first day at the school; I was the new girl. everyone was seated, desks were put together into groups, and he was just standing in the coat closet visibly upset. I asked the teacher why he was there and she said something along the lines of, ""because he wants to be."" He wasn't in trouble, he had just taken it upon himself to retract from his classmates and stand in the closet, clearly upset over something. He had a frowning face with brows furrowed. And there are very few instances where I remember his face not being that way. 

As is typical, Devon was considered the bad kid. Nobody had anything good to say about him. I remember his mother being at school a few times, he protested her being there and she just said, very flatly, ""well apparently you don't know how to act so I have to be here."" I don't remember anything about his father but there's something in the back of my mind that makes me think he father was either not present at all or abusive. For some reason, my mind leans toward the latter. 

I remember adults speaking poorly of him. In one instance, the janitor that all the kids loved so much, directly contrasted Devon and I. I don't remember exactly what was said about me, but I remember vividly what was said about Devon.

""You know MundanelyCool will end up in great places. You know where Devon will end up? Behind bars."" And he mimicked holding two bars in front of him. 

And looking back now, that was an incredibly crappy thing to say. Although Devon wasn't present when he said that, he didn't say it out of concern, he said it to ridicule him and his behavior while simultaneously praising mine. Why would you make fun of a child for that? I supposed it's a matter of ignorance, not understanding his behavior wasn't out of nowhere. 

Devon wasn't a bad kid. He was a troubled kid. I'll never forget when we were sitting in groups in class during free time. Devon was either nearby or for some reason sitting with us as a group. He hadn't participated in anything with us until we reached a topic of conversation that peeked his interest. We brought up scary movies and how the movie Chucky was unrealistic. How could a 2 foot doll kill people? It didn't make sense. And Devon chimed in, ""yeah, if he was real, I could beat him up!"" He explained how he could kick one of our chairs across the room, and so he could definitely kick Chucky across the room. I don't remember him saying anything particularly disturbing, he talked to us normally, and participated in the conversation as a typical 9 year old. 

He was capable of socializing and being a ""good"" kid, but the adults in his life failed him. He was a child that was disturbed by something. No child should be as constantly upset as Devon was. Something was lacking in his life. And instead of trying to fulfill it, they expected him to fail and more than likely doomed him to fail.  I always wonder how he ended up. I've moved states since that time and don't remember his last name. Though I feel certain it probably isn't good, I hope it is. I hope he found someone that believed in him, that inspired him, and he overcame all the odds.",25Jun2020,1
114,"Honestly it's something you either are or aren't and more people than you'd like to believe are, just not all of them are honest to themselves...  
With all the racial tensions going on recently, I had to be honest to myself and admit that I have very racist tendencies. I think people are born with it, or develop racism early in life. What I'm trying to say is, that you can't just stop being a racist, if you are one.  
  
But we can choose. We can choose to tolerate people and respect them. We can choose to try our best to not treat people badly because of their skin colour or heritage etc.  
In the end we're all just people, and we should treat each other with respect and tolerance. Even if we don't like certain people based on their skin colour and ethnicity or heritage.",25Jun2020,1

In December 2019 I had a shave and went over again and again and again (stupid I know) with shave gel. The next day I had really bad hyperpigmentation and swollen face (also was brown too) and my nose went really red and oily too. the hyperpigmentation is now 98% gone and my face is a lot clearer again after 7 months but still   swollen every time I shave for days. But my nose and the area around it still very oily and grey oily under my eyes too and I can’t look at myself in reflections etc unless I cover the middle of my face with my hand. It’s that bad.the rest of my face is totally clear tho  Iv tried E45, SPF 20 moisturiser. Palmers cocoa butter helped with the hyperpigmentation.  Will this be rosecea? :/",25Jun2020,1
117,"1 year ago I was addicted to drugs, out of the ER, barely made the decision to keep living but in a terrible place tapering off benzos. My dog had just died and I blamed my laziness, lack of awareness in part. I had literally no money left, no friends, no plans and was living in my mom's barn apartment. 

For a long time I was bitter that people believed I could do more and that I needed to. I was frustrated at their expectations. It started with living with a friend again, surrounding myself with people and some competition. A huge revelation was how motivated I was not to seem like a sad piece of shit around old highschool friends. That was my anchor. It's vain but it got me started.

Today I attempted one of my more obscure goals. I had my mom teach me how to suture, do stitches. First aid is one of my excellence goals. May seem weird! But I want to be a renaissance man. Start with one thing at a time, and keep adding them. Don't rely on motivation and feeling good. It won't happen. Motivation from doing the thing FIRST, building a lil momentum and being invested will be the only way.

This year I’ve tried yoga, started two businesses, learned a language, reached out to new friends, made money, applied for jobs outside my expertise, followed a diet, quit video games, followed a strict ketogenic IF diet, put a lot of effort in at a CrossFit gym, lost 65 lbs, wrote poems and made art, opened up to people, approached and talked to girls, made plans for a trip to Italy on my own, and signed up for dancing classes (this one is really out of my comfort zone). I’m probably forgetting some.

Part of this is to brag a little, I don’t like to do it to people in real life. The other point is that if I can do it, crawl my way back from a deep hole with blood sweat and tears, you can too. I had nothing a year ago. I really believe in doing 1 new uncomfortable thing as soon as you can.

It really is hard to look at things a year from now. You’ll get frustrated at a lack of progress constantly. Just do the things, as many as you can, every day and build momentum. Hold onto the momentum for dear life. It may not be as soon as you like, but you will see results. Love yourself, and instill a culture of excellence into your head.",25Jun2020,1

119,"Hi,

I live in Ontario and have a tax free savings account with TD bank. I automatically deposit $200/week in a mutual fund dividend growth account that is spread across the Canadian economy (banks,energy etc)

My intention is to generate a decent amount of income from the dividends I am paid out down the road. 

My main concern is the fees I am being charged/will be charged in the long run.

Does TD offer fairly competitive rates or should I be investing my money elsewhere? 

Thanks in advance!",25Jun2020,1
