Parents HAVE to have a favorite child. I just don't see how it's possible to not.

And please be aware, I'm not saying this means they love their other children any less. I just think they're lying when they say ""we don't have a favorite"", but I do believe them when they say ""we love you all the same.""

I love my pets all the same, I still have a favorite 🤷🏼‍♀️😅",08Aug2020,1
2,"I’m male aged 30)
Around mid December 2019 I had a night shaving with a new Badger hair shave brush but everything else was the same.I shaved once as normal, then again and again ) when I put the shaving gel on a 2nd time I could feel it lightly burning on my cheeks etc. (Mainly the left side as that’s my better side etc) and I shaved over it agin and again. Afterwards for hours I could feel the left lower cheek smarting and felt really tight.
The next day I think I got what’s called ‘hyperpigmentation’ on my left side of cheeks, there was a shadow like discolouring all over the left side cheeks from the eye downwards, and my nose went red and shiny and oily. Now ever since I look af myslef from front I can’t, I look terribly haggard and work out even tho I’m not. The bloating and swelling of my once sharp jawline was gone.
It’s cleared up totally now since but  But the nose and cheeks next to it hasn’t at all. It’s red and shiny/oily  and makes me look haggard and worn out and fatter faced idk why.And my face looks fat now too. I thought it was weight gain but it’s not as I lost weight and still nothing. (I’ve weighed more and looked thinner faced) Iv tried all sorts of moisturisers For the red shiny nose etc and clays with minerals etc but nothing :/
Any advice?
Open to any questions etc
Edit; oh and the skin on my face looks brown under lighting in too",08Aug2020,1

\-Too many people hate biden.

\-Biden has a very shaky path to victory.

\-People still don't give shit about anything and will vote third party or some shit like that.  


\-And,of course his base will still vote for him.  


Maybe the democrats and biden should just give up and leave us and the country to our fate. There is no saving america. It's the truth.  


Now,any predictions on how trump will kill us? Nuclear war? letting COVID kill millions? Nazi America?  


We're fucked,there's no hope,and America is fucked.  


The damn world needs to just let us die and move the fuck on. We aren't worth it.  


Too many trump lovers,apathetic people and corrupt motherfuckers in this country.  


Maybe it's time for america to just...die and leave the world to itself...it'll be hard as fuck but the world can and will move on.

14,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",08Aug2020,1
15,"Dear Diary,
Hey this is my first ever entry. Idk how this works but imma just talk. So I had an epiphany yesterday after taking a hit out of my stizzy. I got a new cart called purple punch. I haven’t smoked for a couple of days. Before I knew it I hit a blinker. That was the biggest mistake ever holyyyy. I was ok for a bit. But later I started getting guilty about my life style. Which was games with friends and by myself and watching Netflix. I started doing push-ups out of nowhere. That got my heart pumping and decided I needed to lay down. Another fat mistake &gt;_&lt;. I laid down in bed with the sheets over me and I started thinking. I began making connections in my head like a cause and effect hierarchy chart. I started to see how there were 3 big things that were controlling my life: nic, weed, and video games. I felt like these three were the big things that kept me away from being happy. Addictions seemed to be big pillars in my life that led me to this point. It’s quarantine and I’m alone half the time and bored. So these things kept me focused. However, that fat blinker made me start to lose the perception of time and I got lost in my head. I kept thinking of myself playing games and watching Netflix on the couch as a cycle. A never ending cycle. Everyday and forever. I thought that if I had the motivation to try new and productive things this forever looping cycle would end. But my conscious told me that I couldn’t and I wasn’t strong enough. I started to think of the purpose of life and how pointless it is. We grow up doing things in a repetition. And when we grow older our routines would never change and just be slightly impacted by the new situation. It felt so pointless and I started to go insane. I was muttering to myself that life is a circle. A never ending circle. All my thoughts in my head led to one other thought and that thought to another thought. But in the end my thoughts led up to my original thought: life is a circle. And I had a lot of urges to kill myself.  I realized how powerful our brains are. Our conscience is a whole another galaxy in our heads. It’s also so malleable and fragile at the same time. The line between sanity and insanity is so tiny, paper-thin. Distractions keep us from being insane and that was a really sad thought I had. I was lost in my own consciousness and I couldn’t get out. I felt like I was living days in matters of minutes. I felt that the only way to escape was death. It felt like I was being enlightened understanding the meaning of life. Which was to live and to die and be gone from this world forever. Our conscience at least. I was in a loop that felt like it was making me more knowledgeable. At some point I felt like if I reached 100% I would know everything there is to life and would thus be boring. I was going insane I thought that if I got to 100% I would not be human anymore. While in this desperate situation I prayed to god. And prayed to help me. I was thinking of life as large chunks of pieces which are the past and the future. However I did not realize the other chunk: the present. The present is sometimes fun, bad, horrifying, good, or neutral. It was the only part of me I could control. I can’t control the future and I can’t change the past. The only thing I can change is the present. I realized that I need to live life to the fullest. I need to live in the present and not fear the future. Never procrastinate and never hold back because of my social anxiety. I can control the present. The future is unknown and terrifying but if I can control my present I can at least have some control in the past. I realized the past is already gone and it can’t hurt me no more if I don’t want it to. I decided I would live in the present and not fear the future but to prepare for it. And use the past as a reflection to my present decisions. So I lived my life today by not pushing any decisions to the future. Even the smallest things I did them right at the spot and I did not procrastinate. I made a schedule of my daily life in quarantine as a college student in summer vacation. I started working out, run, made my own meals, and had my own time praying to god. I tried to dabble in some study prepping for my second year. Now the day is almost over it’s time to have my time playing games and watching shows. I had such a productive day today and I am so proud. I want to live productive and even if life is really boring, I gotta live it cause this is the one life I got. I gotta make myself the best I can and do things that matter to me. I can’t push it back. I gotta do it now. I hope this mentality can persist into the future. I really pray to god I stop being a lazy ass and start doing and not pushing. This was my 19 year old epiphany living life pushing everything to he future. During my bad high I understood the core of my depression and how boring life is. It was scary but I think it changed my life. I was just ranting my thoughts and probably it won’t make sense in the future but I’m glad this happened to me.",08Aug2020,1
17,"I'm honestly kinda miserable.

I have no friends here, irl. My family treats my birthday like it's any regular day. My ex best friend and I stopped talking yesterday because I can't reciprocate his romantic feelings towards me. So I've been alone all day, in my room. Like everyday, due to this pandemic. But even once things are better, I'll probably still be in here alone because I don't know how to make friends. Three family members have died since march, the most recent one a couple days ago. 2020 is kinda relentless.

Part of the reason I feel I have no friends or anything is the fact I'm so emotionally unavailable. I spent  my 19th year of life trying to undo nearly a decade of abuse and trauma. Just to turn 20 and lose the one friend who talked to me every day. We would be talking and laughing right now if I were just able to love him back without fear.

idk. I kinda feel isolated from everyone, like no one can reach me to help me. And even if they could, I wouldn't know what to ask for. I just feel like the ""me"" I want to be is trapped right beneath the surface, weighed down by fears and anxieties and memories. And I just want to live. But no matter what I do, things always go bad. All my birthday does is remind me I have to fight to keep myself here for another year, and that I have no many more years to endure. No part of me ever wants any more of them.

Not even sure why I'm posting, other than getting some of this out of my head.

cheers.",08Aug2020,1
18,"I used to be an avid reader, but money became a huge issue. I don't have access to a library, and with each book I want being $12.00 minimum to order, it really slowed me down. For years I hardly read, and I came to really miss it. So I did my research and decided to get an Amazon Fire - it is amazing. I hate to say it, since I have fond memories of my NOOK color, but it's better. And the Kindle books are insanely inexpensive, most are about $5.00, no tax. I like it. I can read pretty much anywhere with ease, I don't have to worry about my books getting physically damaged...I do still love reading physical books more, though. I love the look and the feel and just having it in my hands, but it's not really feasible at this point to have that with every book I'd like. 

It's also nice that if I get a book I'm not crazy about, I only have $5.00 ebook and not a $15.00 paperback I regret buying.",08Aug2020,1
19,"Last September I moved out of my hometown to “The Big City” after graduating high school with shitty grades and got a job. I naively assumed that moving to a place where far more diversity exists, would change who I am - nope. It’s me who needed change. With some serious alone time and reflection on my childhood; How I was treated by my biological mother and foster family, how I was pulled into a pool of deceit and manipulation to pit myself against my father, the amount of neglect I was put through and put myself through - one day I stopped. I literally had an epiphany and asked myself “why do I believe in the things I do?” And from that day, that question forward, it didn’t stop. 

I reached out to my dad a few months ago, the first time I’ve talked to him in years and we caught up. The conversation was bumpy. He told me he was disappointed to see me on the same path he took when he moved to my country (he wished he’d gone to school instead of pursuing the labour industry), but was relieved to hear me reach out to him. Come this September, as I’m still eligible, I’ll be returning back to high school to re-do senior year with him. 

He keeps telling me to “look forward”. He knows that I’ve suffered, and when he reminds me to forget my past, I do. With him, I feel present, focused, at ease with myself. 

Ever since my epiphany, I question everything. My ethics, personality, behaviours, habits, existence, etc. More than that, I realize that I have the ability to reshape myself into who I want. And what I want is to be better, do better, learn as much as possible, and succeed. This is the first time in my life where I haven’t let my past determine my present or future.

This is different from nsfw nudity and adult content and different from even very dark stories on askreddit. It is incredibly graphic real world content that I think plenty of people find upsetting. 

I really hope reddit puts in not suitable for life tag and filter so that people like me can enjoy reddit without having to see extreme graphic real life violence and death.

On a side note some of the cultures around some subreddits around these seem to harbour really nasty and toxic attitudes around these sorts of events.

I’m hungry. I go upstairs and get my taco leftover from dinner. the hard shell is now soft and the beef is cold. the best part was that the lettuce was still crunchy. I decide to have some “dessert” after my “dinner” and I settle on cinnamon toast. I put the bread in the toaster and settle in to play subway surfers while I wait for my tasty snack to finish. it pops up. it’s burnt. oh well. I’ll just soak it in buttter. two gigantic slices of butter later, I see mold on the corner. no it’s not mold. yes it’s definitely mold. on my sweet little toast. I throw the piece of toast away. I check the rest of the bread for mold. it’s all bad. I still need something sweet. I’ll just make chocolate milk. I mix the chocolate and some milk in my favorite cup with my left hand while I multi task and try to play subway surfers with my right hand. it doesn’t work. my guy crashes into a subway.

42,"People will say that the most painful thing is giving birth, kicked in the groin. etc. Oh how wrong they are. Let me tell you all something, emotional pain tops it all. Let me explain what I'm talking about, Have you ever had a dream that just felt so real? Like nothing was out of place and it was normal? Then you fall in love in that dream just to wake up? It's that pain when you wake up.

I'm just a 17 year old who grew up in a rough family. I'm really anti social because of my parents, I don't know really how to talk to girls but I try, I'm not afraid of rejection but it still hurts a bit. 

Anyway, Last night I had the most surreal dream and I genuinely though that I was awake. I went to a friends house and hung out for a bit, The most beautiful girl walks in and introduces herself as a friend of my friend, She had curly, medium length hair, was about an inch shorter than me and the most gorgeous eyes. 

We locked eyes and I knew there was something there, and I knew she felt it too. We talked for what seemed like days, We had everything in common, I told her how beautiful she was and she blushed a bit before getting interrupted by our friend saying that there was a dance at the lake that night and that we should all go. I went home to get ready as they went their separate ways. I assume I got there about nine o' clock? Anyway, I was extremely nervous because I knew what I was about to do, I was going to ask her to dance. As I walked up to find her I felt someone hug me from behind, It was her.

I was blushing a bit then decided to go for it. Her eyes lit up in a spark of joy when I asked her. We proceeded to slow dance for hours on end. Never having this feeling of happiness before, I shed a tear. I didn't want this dance to end. Then with her head buried in my shoulder she said, ""I love you"".   All I could do was hold her tighter and smile. As I held her I told her, ""I love you too"". I closed my eyes and swayed with her. When I opened my eyes all I saw was my ceiling.

In that one moment my heart shattered. I jumped up to look around and confirm my fear, It was a dream. All I could do was cry, I mean bawling. I sat in my bed all morning just feeling like a husk, I had nothing anymore. No emotion, no thoughts, just... nothing. It got to the point where suicide entered my mind but I quickly dismissed the thought. I'll probably never dream about her again but I'll try.

45,"Sometimes I feel crazy because I live in the US in a state with a ton of cases, and still see people out in large groups, going to restaurant patios, posting photos in groups where no one has masks on. Since March 8 I have not been inside a single store. I’ve done curbside only on everything. The only person I see up close is my girlfriend who I live with. We are both lucky and get to work from home. I see friends rarely and when I do it’s from 6+ feet apart with masks. My girlfriend and I recently traveled to see my family but we all got tested first and we literally ate out of a cooler for two days, camped overnight, and peed by the side of the road the whole trip so we didn’t have to go to public bathrooms. 

I feel like this is the ethical thing to do — I don’t go to stores or see people because I don’t want to contribute to the spread of a deadly disease. I’m 25 and if I got this thing I’d likely be asymptomatic. So I’m staying home and doing my part like I’m supposed to.

It just feels like no one else is taking it seriously anymore. Today like seven people I know biked by my house in a big group. No one wearing masks. They were all so calm about it! My best friend in another state had a birthday party last night. Meanwhile I’m still doing the same stuff — quarantining every package I get for 24 hours before opening it, carrying hand sanitizer everywhere, all of it.

49,"I have a lot of problems in my life. My parents have always been worried about my fate due to me having anger issues, ADHD, autism, probably bipolar, and a history of depression.

Last Autumn I was really depressed so bad I had cut myself (I’m better now) which resulted in me missing nearly 3 months of school. I failed 3 of the core classes because of it. I went back to school and passed barely. I transferred to a different school because it was the school’s fault for me being depressed. When spring break ended it was quarantine, I had to do all of my classes on Google Classroom and to make up for the failed classes I had to do make-up work or else I would fail the 9th grade.
So I cheated on algebra because I knew I wasn’t going to graduate 9th grade if I didn’t and I didn’t want to fail because I was going to feel like a failure, because I know barely anything ever since they added letters to math which was in I think 6th grade. so when school starts in a week I have a feeling I’m going to get really depressed (plus I usually get depressed in the fall) due to me feeling like an idiot so I’ll feel like an idiot.

I barely passed my previous grades so I feel that if I keep pushing my luck it’ll run out and when it does I’ll get the most depressed than I ever was.

What I’m trying to say is that I feel that I’m too far behind for me to go to college and if I do I’ll mess it up with my disorders, and issues.

55,"A month ago, my English teacher committed suicide. 

My family has known him for over a decade; both my siblings had him as a teacher when they were in school and he had a major impact on me and a lot of people in my school as well. When I heard that he died I was devastated. I'm still in disbelief and I don't know really know how I should act or what to do. 

There have also been some people who didn't like him and treated his death like a joke. They said horrible things about him; I don't want to get too specific but they basically said that he ""deserved it"" and should ""burn in hell"". Whats been so hard is that some of those people were my friends.

Obviously I can't speak for their experience with him, but is that really how you should act when someone dies? Regardless of if they liked him or not they should've had the decency to not say things about someone who died.  

I don't know what to do anymore.",08Aug2020,1
56,"Unless something incredibly serious changed (We get into a pointless war, Trump lies about supporting my job etc) I will be voting for Trump.

First of all, I already know I'm going to get a lot of comments with 'orange man bad' (many with dissertations on why they believe so)

I've been listening to a lot of Tim Poole and Styx Hexenhammer and I am happy that I've finally caught on to the 'game' that's being played. Trump has an agenda. The media has an agenda. It's up to discern the truth from all parties involved.

Trump has vowed to save my job in the airline industry. If he goes back on that promise, I go back on my vote. I believe Trump will do better with the economy than Biden. I believe Biden will be a puppet for the far left democrats. I don't like puppets, and I don't respect them. I respect those that can be persuaded by alternate opinions but hold true to their values.

The far left has shown themselves to be liars and hypocrites. The media, in particular, is the worst of them all. They have a narrative, and they will stick to that narrative no matter what the truth actually is.

The most common way the media lies is by omitting facts. For example, during the George Ffloy protects/riots they media would always point out the things that make BLM look 'good' while omitting things that make BLM look 'bad'. The destruction of black owned businesses, the spread of Covid that affects primarily low-income black-owned neighborhoods, the burning buildings behind the reporters. They ignored all of that in order to show BLM as 'good.

Now, I support aspects of BLM. Racism is bad. Police reform is needed. I agree with these things. But skewing the facts in order to support the narrative is wrong.

I don't like Trump, but I respect him. He's an asshole, yes. He does things that I disagree with. But I look at his ACTIONS not his WORDS. His WORDS are meant to fight back against political correctness as well as fight back against the establishment democrats, establishment republicans and the mainstream media.

I SUPPORT his fight against China, who put 1,000,000 muslims/Uyghars in concentration camps (if you don't know about this you've been listening to too much MSM who won't inform you of actual issues). I SUPPORT him in fighting against the MSM. I SUPPORT him in wanting the best for America and is again interests outside of our country.

However, I don't support traditional Republican interests, like taking away a woman's right to choose to an abortion. For this reason, I will be voting for a Democrat Senator, as they have the right to veto the vote for Supreme Court Justice. I also support Climate Change reform, as well as Medicare reform.

But what our country needs for the next four years is someone like Trump. I actually like that he's politically incorrect. I'd prefer someone who 'tells it like it is' than someone who says sweet words than does who knows what behind the curtain. I support wearing a mask during this pandemic, I support the bailouts. I think in a national emergency the government is desperately needed, however I'\[m a libertarian on most stances.

So yes, I know this post won't make you vote for Trump. It doesn't matter to me. But at least know you understand me. And understanding the opposing argument is half the battle.

Take care. Let's all hope for the best for America, and the future for All.

57,"I have a friend who I will call john has a brother who I just don't like for many reasons. Just for context I have never met John, other than calls or face time we have never been face to face. One reason I don't like Johns brother (who will be called Jack) is very loud, now this wouldn't be a valid point if it wasn't for him refusing to stay quiet when asked by John, and even him him telling John to ""Shut the fuck up I cant hear!"", that alone would be enough for me to be pissed off, mainly since when in a call, I hear them slightly louder then normal. (For some reason cant be turned down) Also Jack would spew racially insensitive word like ""Nigger"" and ""faggot"" though to me saying those things are ok , as long not used in a racist way, or in the Hard R way, for example he said to John when John asked for him to be not so loud, he said ""Shut up dumb faggot!"". Another reason I just don't like him is because he tends to actually hit John, and pretty hard, that ALONE would make me beat the living shit out of him, but I am almost three days worth away from them, (If you were to drive on the highway) so its not really possible for me to help in anyway I know at least. Now if you were wondering why I feel confident in being able to beat this guy up is pretty simple, he is not only significantly shorter then me, (almost by an entire foot) but he is twins with john! So other then the height factor, and maybe some more muscle, he would be more on the lean side then anything, since I have seen John and josh, but I am more on the bulky side, since love to do wrestling and some other stuff. 

Anyway, this was just a rant, witch I tend to do alot, though maybe you can answer if you dislike him too? don't really care

59,"I'm sure we've all seen this, be it at school, in social life, or internet fight videos, yet I don't know what to call it in order to sum it up, clearly.

To put it simply, a bully approaches a victim and begins instigating a fight or immediately attacking them. There are people standing by, and whether or not they know either party in the fight, they're just watching from a distance, at times laughing or egging things on, and recording video.

Then, in these specific instances, the victim retaliates. Sometimes they put up enough of a fight to keep the bully from doing any damage, and other times they get the best of them and overpower the bully (knockout, wrestling lock, etc.).

What I'm getting at in all this is how it always seems that the crowd will turn on the victim as soon as they retaliate.

The spectators start complaining, or hysterically yelling (and it's not always because they're friends with the bully). Bystanders—who were content to stay back before—insert themselves into the struggle and restrain one or both of them like they give a shit. The bully might even have the nerve to slip in some response to being hit like ""yo, what the fuck did you hit me for, what's your problem?"" even though they started the whole thing (and I've rarely seen anyone call them on that flip-flop shit).

And this whole frustrating thing begins the moment that the target retaliates. It just feels like there's an absurd message here like ""*any asshole can pick on so-and-so with no consequences, but once so-and-so hits back, then they're wrong and they deserve to be slammed for defending themselves*.""

I know this doesn't happen all the time. And you can only get so much from a video or being a spectator, yourself, so there might be more to some of these instances than we can see for ourselves. I feel that I've seen it enough—and I've seen plenty of others talking about this same issue in other comment sections—that there might be some kind of word or term for it, hopefully a brief one that'll convey all of the facets of these instances, and neatly.",08Aug2020,1

62,"I just need to vent. 
So I’m 22 recently graduated college &amp; moved back in with my parents. We’ve lived in this house about 6 years now and there are so many piles of clutter in empty rooms. My parent’s lack of being proactive drives me NUTS. 
Our kitchen literally only has necessities so no place to sit. It’s as ugly as it was when we moved in &amp; they literally have not been able to decide on a layout for YEARS. It’s gotten to the point where there’s just clutter on the floor of the empty kitchen. 
Another example, my mom sold our living room couches because she wanted new ones. Fine, but it’s been 9 months since she sold them and cannot decide on furniture so the living room has also become a place full of clutter. 
The TV in the family room broke so they moved another one in front of the old one instead of de mounting and getting rid of it A YEAR AGO! It’s crazy because they also never want to buy things that I offer from Facebook or Craigslist because they NEED to have it new. And my dad is a literal construction worker who fixes other people’s homes for living but has not fixed his own. &amp; money is not an issue.

I know this might come off bratty to some but this lack of having a real home really bothers me. I made sure in college I bought furniture from anywhere and reupholstered it to fit the space to make it feel like home! I hate the empty spaces with clutter everywhere. Even more so because it’s embarrassing almost having people over in a house that looks like this that we’ve lived in for plenty of time.",08Aug2020,1

73,"For some background:

34male
16 years married
3 kids ( 7,2,1 )


Things never felt right from the beginning. She wanted to get married and pushed so hard. I was so young. I joined the military and we decided to be together and so we got married.

16 years later and I’m realizing that she’s not the ideal person I would want to be with. I’ve realized I’m extremely attracted to a certain trope of person, someone who is a communicator at heart and is someone who is more outgoing, goofy, and interesting.

The hard part is, I love my wife so much and am very attracted to her. We’ve built an amazing life together and we have 3 beautiful kids. We really have what most people would want. Our sex is also fantastic. We are extremely compatible sexually, which is awesome!

So it’s tough. I can be happy with her, but I kind of always know there is this really important things that’s missing for me. And it sucks bc it comes up in anxiety attacks for me. My wife is head over heels for me and I am her “one”. It’s a tough situation.

TLDR - married 16 years, realizing wife is not the person you should have married. Beautiful family though with 3 kids. It’s hard bc I feel something missing. Still love my wife and am happy, but sometimes get troublesome anxiety attacks lasting 2-3 days or more surrounding my feelings for her, typically trigger by another female with qualities that are really important to me, or other various love displays etc. wife is GREAT amazing person. Super sexy and very smart, great mother, tons of qualities.

Though if I leave, I’ll be devastated to lose my kids even part time. But if I stay I wonder if I’ll ever be consistently truly happy regarding our relationship.

Personally, I’m doing the best I’ve ever been, which is amazing. I just need to figure this out.

Really not sure what to do.

***Note

If I could solve the anxiety attacks, I’m not sure I would worry about all this too much. My wife has a lot of great qualities and we make a great team. We’ve made it 16 years :) it’s never going to be perfect. My wife has many qualities that are amazing. We both have a healthy personal, relationship balance, do very well financially, and have the same life path and goals. We get cruising along and I get these anxiety attacks that always make me feel like something is missing.

80,"Free will is the feeling of making decisions that don't depend on outside influences, i.e. causality existing everywhere on the universe except in our brains. Which is magical thinking and an extraordinary claim that has never been proven. Most people can't even articulate what it is.

Some people get desperate and think that if they mix one thing they don't understand (quantum physics) with another thing they can't even define (free will), then this will magically produce an explanation. Let's just put this weird thing to the other weird thing and they'll like each other, right?

But I don't have to go as far as considering that sort of thing, because even as an illusion, free will doesn't work very well, at least for me.

When I look deep inside myself, I can trace the causes for my thoughts. I'm feeling a bit depressed and melancholic, so I'm writing this. If I make a decision, I do it based on a feeling 90% of the time, which is influenced by my emotional state, which is influenced by a variety of factors including when I've eaten the last time. I'm not great at retroactively rationalizing emotional decisions, but some people are great at it. The other 10% are even less ""free"" since those are rational decisions, i.e. easily explained decisions based on facts. There are no decisions where I could have equally chosen another option *despite* my internal state at the time.

I couldn't even force it! If I have to choose A or B, literally with no difference between them, I'll still lean one way or the other based on my physical state.

And if we go all the way ""equal"", so I really don't care which one, down to some neuron firing because of quantum noise or something, that's not really a decision made by me and carries zero weight, since it's random. And whether it's truly random or just looks random for all intents and purposes, what's the difference?

By the way, I understand that on some level we have to pretend that free will is real, or our society doesn't work. But that's just how fucked up our existence is. Most of the time I'll continue to act as if free will was a thing, because it's built into our other great illusion - consciousness. So I'll continue to make ""decisions"", and all I have to do to feel like I'm in control is do something I don't enjoy once in a while and then ignore whatever led me to do it. Yay.",08Aug2020,1

“The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”

And i think that is precisely what Putin has managed to do.

Not only do the public have a very strong distrust of their government, but the country is also unstable. Militia's are popping up everywhere, the police are on a war path, the president is acting unconstitutionally, and the country is rife with disease.

This, all because Putin managed to get Trump into office. Somebody so obviously unqualified for the position, Corona simply being the straw that broke the camels back.

I'm interested to see how China and Russia are going to capitalise on this. Because its the perfect opportunity to bring America down, or atleast overtake it in terms of power. 

Obviously Americans will deny this until they're blue in the face, very similarly to how many brits will deny their empire is coming to an end.

But the truth is right there in front of us. All we can do is sit and watch.",08Aug2020,1

96,"On July 10, after a two-week period of intense pressure, the Reddit administration took action against several kink-based subreddits that were deemed to be too offensive, banning most, while quarantining a few, including the r/Rapekink group of subreddits. Specifically, the subreddits were accused of promoting hatred and violence against women, with r/Rapekink additionally accused of promoting rape, and the Reddit administration was accused of and portrayed as going out of their way to support these things by virtue of leaving such subreddits operational.

We, the moderator team of r/Rapekink, would like to take this opportunity to refute these accusations, defend the practice of consenting kink in general, defend our subreddit specifically, and defend the Reddit administration against such outrageous hyperbole.

Before that, we would like to acknowledge the pressure the Reddit administration has been placed under recently regarding a variety of controversial subreddits, that they do have every right to decide what content belongs on Reddit, and to express our appreciation for the leeway that has been shown to us in allowing us to operate on Reddit both currently and in the period leading up to the present.

We know and understand that for outside observers, heavy kink and BDSM, consenting verbal and physical abuse, rape roleplay, and rape-themed pornography can look like expressions of genuine abuse and misogyny. However, it’s important to point out that many subreddits engaged in such themes have been primarily based upon self-posts from the women themselves, many of them photo-verified (as provided for by the individual subreddits). As for pornography, the abuses within that industry are becoming better known, but it is still fundamentally produced with consenting performers, especially with scenes where the high level of portrayed violence is acknowledged and planned from the start. Also, any assumption that rape and sexual violence themed pornography, whether filmed, drawn, or prose, is consumed solely by men, would be a significant error.

There appears to be a fundamental assumption from those opposed to these subreddits that the women participating are being abused, and no one in their right mind would willingly choose to partake in such kinks. This view, while being deemed as feminism by some, is incredibly sexist, patronizing, infantilizing, and outright demeaning to women, as it completely disregards their desires. The goal here seems to be to protect these women not just from toxic men, but from themselves, in fact denying these women their agency while claiming to be preserving or restoring it.

The calls to remove these types of subreddits sent the message that the kinks, fetishes and fantasies of these women are wrong, and therefore also that there’s something wrong with the women themselves. And yet, a fundamental basis of kink and BDSM is consent, safety, and the recognition that these are roleplays and fantasies being acted out. Kinky people largely have a firm grasp on the difference between the fantasy world they play in and the real world outside of that play, while the groups opposed to free expressions of kink apparently cannot comprehend this difference.

As such, we strongly believe in Reddit as a site for the exchange of all manner of ideas and interests, and that casting blame on the administrators for the active presence of ideas and interests that some may dislike or disagree with is completely disingenuous. Nobody is forced to look at subreddits for topics they have no interest in. Nobody is compelled to be exposed to ""NSFW"" subject matter that is well contained and managed within individual subreddits by their moderator teams. Groups that exist on Reddit for the sole purpose of manipulating the administrators to the service of their own causes are the real danger to free exchange and open expression of ideas and interests on Reddit.

As for the r/Rapekink subreddits themselves, we are and have always been acutely aware that they deal with a highly controversial topic, namely, the enjoyment and fantasy of rape. In fact, the pursuit of something that by definition is unwanted. We have long been accused of supporting and promoting rape, but nothing could be further from the truth. Considering the circumstances, we think it’s important to reiterate that fetishes and kinks are not representative of our moral values. In order words, while we get aroused by the concept of rape, though fantasies, consenting roleplay, vicariously, and other methods, we also recognize it as the abhorrent crime that it is. Seeking the rape experience for ourselves in no way includes wanting it to happen for anybody else, nor we do trivialize the trauma that rape causes to a great many people. This dichotomy is a source of stress and guilt for many people that find themselves having this kink, prior to the discovery of an accepting community of others like themselves.

To that end, the r/Rapekink subreddit exists as a safe space for people who are aroused by being in or having been in the victim role of sexual assault and abuse, simulated or otherwise. It is a supportive environment where they are able to post and converse about their thoughts, experiences, and questions without being judged, shamed, or harassed. Our moderator team has endeavored to ensure that these people and this topic are treated with the respect and maturity they deserve, albeit with various degrees of kink expression when appropriate. We have a long and complex ruleset that is vigorously enforced in order to maintain this.

We present this as a contrast to other places, indeed even other subreddits, where these people, mostly women, are insulted, demeaned, or invalidated for their personal experiences and sexual needs. Many of these women have expressed great relief and gratitude to find in our subreddit a place where they can open up and speak freely regarding such a delicate topic. Indeed, we have been tremendously shaped just by seeing what they need to talk about when given a chance.

In fact, a lot of our content relating to active pursuits of a ""rape victim"" experience through various means has been largely overshadowed by this support role that emerged fairly early on. Though it was perhaps surprising, it is a role we have fully embraced as we have seen the positive impact it can have on a certain portion of sexual trauma survivors.

For survivors of actual sexual trauma, there are numerous, not widely known but nevertheless well-documented reasons why they might develop this kink. (An overview of these, such as repetition compulsion and trauma bonding, can be found in our wiki/FAQ, with a long list of supporting literature.) As traumatic as their rape had been, it can be incredibly hard for them to reconcile their rape, the unwanted physical arousal/orgasm they felt during, and their new fantasies, leaving them with feelings of shame, guilt, and self-hate. For them, it can be a source of great relief to find out that their urges and desires aren’t wrong, and that they are not alone dealing with similar feelings. To be clear, this is about accepting how their minds are best able to cope with the terrible thing that happened to them, and in no way is an attempt to excuse or condone the actions of their rapists.

Additionally, it is known that victims are helped by talking about their trauma, even if they themselves aren’t turned on by it, and our subreddit is a place that allows people to share their stories freely. We’ve even seen a few instances of survivors that preferred to share in our subreddit instead of a more traditional support subreddit, because they didn’t want to be treated like a typical traumatized victim with PTSD, or took solace in the knowledge that some people enjoyed their tale even if they themselves did not.

For those without a history of sexual trauma, the idea is similar. It can be hard to reconcile the logical truth that rape is an awful crime that has lasting impacts on a victim, while at the same time fantasizing about it happening to themselves, due to whatever natural submissive or thrill-seeking aspects they possess. Again, in this case, the subreddit allows for these people to recognize that their fantasies need not be a source of shame, and that there isn’t anything wrong with them. And for those who just enjoy sharing their sexual prowess with others, the subreddit is a judgement-free place to do so, unlike other, more general topic subreddits.

It is true that in service of our subject matter and members, we operate some subreddits on the side that involve more of a pure kink expression of this topic, and even an attempt to expose and better understand the diametric opposite, the non-kink motivations behind genuine rapists. However, our primary driving force is this support and destigmatizing aspect for survivors that have developed this kink, and the hopes of slowly but surely gaining wider recognition that this is in fact a thing that not only occurs, but occurs with some regularity. We believe that our unexpectedly rapid growth on Reddit is a testament that this is an idea whose time has come, and that there are more such sexual trauma survivors in need of this form of support than any of us might have predicted. Multiple therapy researchers looking to explore this have used us as a resource, and performed interviews with our members, to further the academic study of this phenomenon that ""rape kink"" can be a normal, healthy, and even healing response to sexual trauma. We have hopes that this will be an exciting and emerging new recognition in the profession therapy world in the coming years.

As for our quarantine status, though the ancillary effects it has on us are disappointing, and the blatantly false accusations that led to it are infuriating, we certainly do understand and even somewhat agree that our subject matter is potentially shocking, offensive, triggering, etc., and best not stumbled upon inadvertently. We only wish for those that need us to find us, and those who do not to leave us in peace.

Thank you.",08Aug2020,1
97,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

98,"There's so much jealousy in this world. How would you react if your significant other messages or calls their ex. How do you get over it. How do you manage to maintain your self esteem to a level that prevents you from doing anything to yourself. How do you manage to do it with a person, when it's already hard to do on your own. How do you know your person will never cheat on you. How do you live in the insecurity of never knowing whether your partner even likes you anymore or not. How would you know if you're driving them insane to the point that cheating on you fulfills their ego. What do you do when you have no one to talk to when you're down. When all you want to do is to stare at a wall for hours upon hours with no end in sight. How do you even begin to explain such a thing to them.

101,"So I've made a few posts recently about extreme debt, extreme depression, and a lot of thoughts of suicide. And at this point I feel like the darkest part of things have passed. Though I am still worried about relapsing again. 

I remember reading the darkly dreaming Dexter novel and there's a reference to his dark passenger. The idea is that he carries a darkness within him that he cannot not really talk to but observe and be aware of its own influence on his actions. In many ways I feel the same because when I'm having the darkest of thoughts I feel like I have to be afraid of myself. It is though if I let my guard down this dark passenger in me will take the ultimate action.

I've been an appointment with the doctor to see if I can get an upgrade to the end of the press instead of been taking. I think this will help. I'm moving back home soon and will be staying there for quite a while. More than just trying to get back in my feet financially I realize that I need to take time to recover mentally. I've been reading about a few different things and it seems clear to me that I experienced some type of extreme emotional abuse either from a person I was close to in a relationship or possibly from a family member parent or just people in general who I've been around.

While I can definitely think of relationships in which I have suffered abuse I don't feel like they're the root cause of this feeling. I feel like I am seeking out people who I know will take advantage of me because that's what I feel like deserve.

I'm still very afraid. This isn't the first time I've had dark episodes of it definitely won't be the last. I need to try and find a professional to talk to and work out these feelings. Even if that means I have to admit to someone that I have had active and very real thoughts of suicide.

In every post I've made there have been misleading details about where I'm from my friends my family specifics on my situation. This is done to hide my actual identity in case someone I know might actually find this information.

One thing that I allowed of myself to be shown here is my username: SomewhereOver1939. This is a reference to The Wizard of Oz a movie from 1939. A movie I cherish.

- Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. 


- Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass at her desk. so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'oh Its ok I understand' (in a nice way) and she went quiet as she carried on  written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses).  

- A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll stay in contact yby email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got a job.",08Aug2020,1

137,"My family has owned a fine dining italian restaurant since before i was born. Most all of my childhood memories are in that restaurant. Everyday after school i’d go do my homework at the bar, i’d follow my dad around the kitchen and help with little things like making salads, and i will never forget making my first pizza at 4 years old. Whenever it stormed really bad and we lost power my family would go and sleep on the floor in the dining room — it was always a safe space. It was always somewhere for us to go, something for us to do, something that needed constant watering and attention. It’s been my family’s livelihood for my entire existence. It’s kept my belly full as well as my heart. It’s my father’s lifelong work and it’s made me respect him sooo much after 30 years of being there to cook for 14+ hours a day. I don’t know who i’d be without this restaurant. It’s shaped me in ways that i couldn’t possibly explain over a reddit post. It’s made me confident, brave, not scared of a little heat, and i’ve built incredible relationships with a staff that i’ve been so lucky to work with for so long. 

I started taking it seriously when i was about 15. I was a busgirl at first. And then i was a hostess. And when i got a little older i became a server. I wasn’t very good at that one, especially after spilling red wine on one-too-many older women and embarrassing myself beyond compare. I realized at 18 or so, that like my father, i was a cook. I’m 24 now and i’ve been cooking alongside my dad everyday since i realized i had a knack for it. It’s been beautiful, exhausting, exhilarating, very mentally and emotionally taxing — just an overall whirlwind of emotions every single day. I even made the crazy decision to drop out of college to run the restaurant full-time. I love it though. I love working with my family. I love making people happy and seeing them enjoy the food we work so hard to make. 

Tonight is our last shift ever. Things were going so well over the holidays this past winter but ever since covid hit, it’s been a different story. We had to close to the public for 3 months. And since we’ve been open with limited occupancy, we’re not pulling in those great numbers that we once were. We can no longer afford the rent at our building and had to make the tough decision to close our doors for good. But besides that, it’s time. My parents are in their 60’s. My dad can’t do it anymore. His health is starting to drastically fail because of all the years being constantly on his feet. and he doesn’t want me to have the same life that he did, never being able to give any part of life besides work real attention. My mom and dad are ready to retire and i don’t blame them. 

I’m nervous about tonight. After all these years, this very well might be the last restaurant shift i ever work. I don’t know what the future holds for me, but i don’t think i have any interest continuing my cooking career elsewhere. I decided that without the restaurant, there’s not much keeping me in our town so in October i’m going to take a big risk and move across the country. I’m terrified. I’ve been terrified every day leading up to today. It’s hard to imagine what life is going to be like for me after we close our doors tonight. I’ve just never known anything else. 

I thought it might feel good to tell this story to some faceless strangers. If you read this far, thank you. 

Please continue to support your locally-owned restaurants. The families who own them put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into running them. Tip your servers well. Thank the chefs if you run into them. Enjoy good food for the rest of your life and eat it with passion. Cheers and buon appetito.",08Aug2020,1
138,"Hello everyone.

I'm 21 and used to always do right things such as attending all of my classes (otherwise I worry if I don't), behave and never be naughty, etc. 

A few months/years later, I've been feeling negative towards myself when I did this and would feel impressed from other people who do what they want. I felt like I wish I was them. 

I moved out of my parent's house to my university accommodation and I always do what is right instead of what I want to do. 

For example, I would try to sleep early when I wish to sleep anytime I want. I feel immidiately frustrated if I did what was right. Should I do what I really want (of course still obide by the accommodation rules)?

Thank you.",08Aug2020,1
140,"18 Male and gay, but from a very conservative and primitive place, where gays aren't accepted.

I'm starting to fall in love with one of my friends. He's beautiful and nice and... he's perfect, I tell you. He's not conservative and has no problem with the LGBT community. He's so calm and soothing to be around with, truly soulmate material. 

I have a theory that he may be gay, as well. However, even if he were, *nothing would ever happen.* Since I can't ever know for sure if he is gay, I can't make any move, because if I do and he's not gay, it would probably ruin our friendship. And if he's gay, he probably thinks the same. Meaning that even if we're both gay, no one can confess. Which makes me really sad. 

Also, even if he is gay, I seriously doubt he's interested in me. Mostly sure he isn't. Which adds on the pain, as well. 

Now listen, I've fallen in love once before with a guy (a now ex-friend), and it hurt me so much, it's unbelievable. It lasted 2 years, both years spent in pain. But, mind you, he was homophobic and just reeked of toxic masculinity, but he looked really good and was actually nice, hence why I fell in love. Now, in this case, when I'm in love with this really nice person who's not homophobic, is actually different from other men around here and is just himself, it hurts me even more! Probably because I believe that I have a chance with him, but know that it mustn't happen.

143,"I've had a pretty up and down past with relationships since my first one when I was 17 (I'm now 23). I've been cheated on twice, had an ex-girlfriend hack my Instagram and read all my messages, and I'm also a survivor of domestic abuse from an ex who was struggling with addiction and I consider myself incredibly lucky to still be alive at the moment. I've done my very best over the months and/or years since these relationships have ended to practice forgiveness and find peace in the growth I've managed to manifest, but obviously all of these experiences lead to emotional baggage.

Back in May, after being cheated on for a second time just a couple months prior, I decided (in my lockdown induced boredom) to download Tinder and see what it was all about. I got talking to a number of girls but one in particular stood out, we had a phone call then a few zoom dates and when it was safe to do so we met up. She was instantly understanding of everything I'd been through, she made me feel like I was able to open up to her without feeling any shame or embarrassment. She'd never been on a date, in a relationship or even kissed somebody before meeting me and struggles with anxiety, but I'm just so happy that I was the one she chose to have those experiences with. So we'd been going out on dates for the last couple months, we've met each other's friends and I have met some of her family and today I decided to finally ask her to be my girlfriend, she said yes!

I'm really optimistic about the future and I'm looking forward to making memories with a girl who I just think the world of and see so much beauty in, she's so sensitive, thoughtful and empathetic and we get on extremely well. After a tough time in relationships I'm so delighted and I feel so positive tonight!",08Aug2020,1

My wife and I are completely heartbroken watching her deteriorate.  Granted, she’s not in pain, but anytime she can get up from a laying position has been a reason to cheer.  It sucks to know we can’t do anything for her aside from making her as comfortable as possible.  We’ve been buying her favorite food, challah bread, to get her excited enough to get up on her own.

I thought I could handle this news but I should have known better.  I have a really hard time saying goodbye to most things that I’ve grown up with.  I’ve been a hot mess and I wish I could be more stoic for my wife who’s equally devastated.  

whenever something comes to an end, it is  just a reminder of the passage of time.  It gets me all existential and emotional.  It’s hard not to think of my wife and kids aging and dying, when watching my dog like this.  She’s our baby.

Please help protect the vulnerable populations of Pike County. The school board members who made this decision have zero regard for the lives of the students, faculty, staff, and their families. Please help this go viral, they think they can do this because they won’t get as much attention as large cities and have less people to be made accountable to. There are too many lives at stake, and already a lack of resources to begin with, forget if there is a spike in cases. There is no way a school that has graduating classes of 400-600 students won’t be a hot bed of infection. As one of the larger employers in the area, this will have catastrophic effects. I have a parent that works here and many friends and their families either work for the district or send their children to school there. All we are asking for is to keep people safe. Stop politicizing the virus.

153,"Suspected for a while. She'd been coming home late, not texting to say where she was, the usual kaboodle.

Over the just few weeks she'd spent a lot of time texting one guy in particular, let's call him Jon.

Anyway, we went on a trip, driving up from the south of England to the northern tip of Scotland. She was texting him and being off with me all day.

We arrive at our cabin and she made a comment about how the spare room had two beds and maybe we should sleep separately. Odd for a married couple 🤷🏻‍♂️

The next morning I took her off into Inverness as she was due to run a marathon.  Saw her to the start line, agreed a time for me to pick her up several hours later.

I went back to the cabin and decided I needed to confront whether my suspicions were correct.

Logged into her Facebook account they her laptop (I've never snooped on someone's account before or since)

Confirmed my suspicions, she'd been sleeping with him for some time, making jokes at my expense, going on about how she couldn't wait to get back from our trip and see him etc etc.

I made my mind up, packed all my shit, emptied our holiday funds into my account and fucked off. Left my wedding ring on the bedside table.  

I made the decision to just go there and then, no interest in hearing her excuses / arguing etc. My wife was dead to me from that moment.

Several hours later as I was passing Edinburgh she called me in a panic.

When I hadn't appeared at the marathon finish line she had gotten herself back to the cabin, found me missing and my ring gone.

She was all lost and scared down the phone to me, I just told her I'd found out what was happening.  Told her I was selling our home and we were done.

She wasn't a bad person, but she was inmature in a lot of senses which led to stupid arguments and even myself getting insulted and disrespected while I never disrespected her.

When it was over I was devastated, I kind of still am but I got to realize I don't miss HER, I miss having a connection with someone, I miss having someone to talk to at late nights, or someone who tells me about her day, who nags me when I've yet not eaten, or who playfully jokes around with me. All those things should be in a loving relationship, so I don't miss my ex, I miss having a relationship.

How do I know I don't miss her? Basically we still get to spend time together, but I used to make her my priority, now I'd rather just watch a movie instead of talk to her, she's not as fun once you see her with normal eyes instead of loving one tbh...
