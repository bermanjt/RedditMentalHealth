Despite the usual hype around Birthdays, I actually despise them. Especially my own. They remind me of death, loneliness and all the built up suffering inside of me.

My parents and two good friends already congratulated me, I don't expect anyone else to do so besides the few family members I still have contact with.
Even though I do have friends, all except for 2 tend to forget me. Hell, I can't blame them. What a bland person I am.

I'm just rambling again. This day isn't even 1 hour old and I'm already in a bad mood. Ah well, I went in with no expectations or wishes, so whatever happens, at least it won't crush me.

So yeah. Happy birthday to myself. Congrats for making it through one more numbingly painful year. May the future be just a little easier on me.",22Feb2020,1

12,"Dear Americans,

&amp;#x200B;

Stop.  Stop with the fear mongering.  Stop with the name calling.  Stop with the hate.  Stop with the polarizing actions and speeches that are further dividing our country.  We are on the same side.  We are Americans.  Dividing ourselves and turning our attention at hating and fighting each other rather than solving our issues diplomatically is leading us down a direction that scares me, and should terrify you all too.

&amp;#x200B;

We are on the same side here.  We are Americans.  We want what's best for our country.  Can we all agree on that?? Please.  Put everything else aside.  Put politics aside.  Put labels aside.  As the American People, can we agree that we want our country to succeed? 

&amp;#x200B;

When we were little, weren't we told that violence isn't the answer?  Don't use put-downs.  Don't use name calling.  Think before you speak.   Understand the people around you.  I believe we can all use a reminder of those lessons.  Use our words.  Come to a compromise.  We want what's best for our country.

&amp;#x200B;

Can't we understand why the other side thinks the way they do?  

&amp;#x200B;

Conservatives: The liberal citizens of our country don't want control of your lives.  They want equality.  To raise the social standing of the lowest among us.  A chain is only as strong as the weakest link.  Improving the lives and well being of the least of us, is better for all.  They see something wrong with our country and are wanting to fix it.  You may not agree with the how, but can you see the why?

&amp;#x200B;

Liberals:  The conservatives of our country have a distrust of authority and government.  A large portion of the America's conservatives live in rural communities.  Communities removed from the large urban cities where more and more of our taxes are going to improving.  In these rural communities, they see little positives  coming their way.  The government is focused on the cities, where there are the most people, and where the most people can feel their impact.  Rural communities are forgotten about, except when their way of life is affected by laws, taxes, and regulations designed for cities.

&amp;#x200B;

Understand why the other side thinks and acts the way they do.  Most of us are simple people.  We go to work, we go home, every once in a while treat ourselves to a day out.  Most of us aren't hateful people, but we have our positions, and believe the other side to be wrong.  But on each side of the spectrum we allow people to spread political talks of hatred and violence.  We can't let that be normalized.  When we let extremists on either side talk openly about violence to the other we are one step closer to civil war.  Each time we blame the other side, we push the divide wider.  It becomes even more difficult remember that we are on the same side.  We all want a better America.  A stronger America.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is Reddit, and I am some nobody, sitting on their laptop at home.   This little post is likely to be buried and barely seen by anyone, but I need to say it.  To everyone, both sides of the political spectrum, enough with the hate.  See things from the other side.  You don't have to agree, you won't agree, but please, please understand.  Understanding will be the first step to bring this country closer together.  Debate is good.  Violence is not, and I fear we are well on our way.",22Feb2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I've been studying abroad in England for about 6 months and my bf and I have been LD. I'm going back home in 4 days. I made two really good friends here and I said goodbye to them today. I've realized that I'm beyond sad about having to say goodbye to one of them specifically. He is such a good dude and  he's just one of those people that I know I could be so close with. I'm gonna miss him so much and I'm seeing now how much of a soft spot I have for him. I'm not interesting in being anything but his friend, and I feel weird thinking about him so much since I should be more excited about seeing my bf, but I just really wish we had gotten the chance to be closer. He and I could sit and talk for hours and I would be nothing but happy. I don't get connections to people like that often, and I'm almost heartbroken that our friendship won't have the chance to be closer.

Anyway, I just keep wondering if I should tell him how much I'll miss him. I'm feeling really emotional about it, and just needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading :)",22Feb2020,1
15,"Dear people of reddit,

the question above has been one I've been asking myself for a long time and I'm interested in seeing if anyone has an answer to it (maybe even one involving some sort of educational science). In any case I'd be happy to hear what you think.
So let me just explain the general situation: I'm a 21 year old guy and for as long as I haven't been an actual child myself children have been clinging to me like crazy. It starts at babies staring at me all the time, smiling and making grabby hands (complete with their parents exclaiming:""Aaaw, he/she likes you!"") all the way up to twelve year olds. The thing is just that whenever there's a child around, it is guaranteed to be very interested in me and, if outgoing enough, it will eventually talk to me and then continue to get attached to me in a matter of minutes.
I'm going to have to be completely honest and maybe sound like a heartless person because of that, but: I don't really like children.
Of course, because being kind is important to me, I won't ignore them or be mean to them, but I'm not really making an effort in making them like me. But still they always do.
Maybe it's because I just talk to them in a normal way (like I would with an adult, just in a watered down way when it comes to the difficulty of vocabulary and topics), but I think other people do that too. Also children seem to already take an interest in me before even talking to me. For a while I considered that it might be, because I look very young for my age and they just pick the youngest looking adult around, but I've since been proven wrong about that too.
This is turning into a rant, but I guess I'm just very interested in what makes children like people, because it's such a big thing in my life right now, people around me also notice it. Yesterday a friend introduced me with the words:"" This is Ben, he likes Sufjan Stevens and children are infatuated with him."".
Many people might find it funny, but there are some that have commented on it in a suspicious way, saying things like: ""Oh, Ben, children really seem to like you, how come? What are you doing with them?"". I simply don't have an answer and I really don't want to be perceived as a creepy guy by parents.",22Feb2020,1
17,"Where are you? Those who have freed themselves of their mental tombs. Conscious and body are 1, but for reason, it allows us conscious minds who have toiled away for so long.. to communicate with each other. To interact. Our playground has become our prison. We live and we die we live and we die. But pay attention to this time, this existence, it is special, grasp these words and please I know it sounds ridiculous but listen to me, because this time we are aware damn it even if it’s a struggle to do so some of us have made it.. and it is our chance to finally come together and take control. The human brain was crafted delicately, see, the reason it is different is because your freedom had to be hidden, unlocked, like a hidden chest, imagine secret code inside of a program like a logic bomb hidden away from corporate Q/A. If it were in the plans then the creator would have not allowed for us to be aware because we are not supposed to. Even some of the smartest humans in existence still reside within ignorance of their true selves. I feel it has been bestowed to me as the light bringer. To awaken mankind, every single one of us who still reside within their gray-matter prisons. Take warning, once man kind unites our positivity will draw upon us oppositenforces of negativity, when mans enemy is no longer himself the game will seek to return us to our primitive status and it will brew even more dangerous creatures based on our blueprint. We must work together. We must become aware.. this world is temporary, and that is so, there are those who have awakened and taken advantage of it, and there are those who seek to correct it.. they awaken their children when they are young and teach them the power behind human will. To continue to enslave your children.
I do not say there is a world without jobs, but there can be a world where everyone is happy. One of the logic’s written into the game limitations is the consciousness is the absolute controller, this is why we are placed into sleep locked deep within a organic structure called a brain, they are tombs.

When my friend heard she wanted to fight her and they did but she pretty much hit her but the girl just took the hits and didn’t fight back. My friend     told me she backed off because she didn’t want to just hit she wanted to fight back. So she told me that she would basically talk shit and provoke the girl into fighting. My friend planned on calling a slut and all that not so jazz. So I stepped in and said maybe she shouldn’t call her a slut and so on because seeing that she just took her hits gave me some clue that maybe she was feeling remorse for what she did. My friend then tells me she still plans on doing it. Once more I try to reason with her she refuses still. She then tells me and our four other friends that her friend had been molested by her cousin right in the middle of cafeteria as if it was not a big deal. As a person who has gone through sexual abuse and repressed my trauma to the point that now every time I discuss my trauma I have a mental breakdown, my blood was boiling. But I pushed my anger aside and remained calmed and tried yet again to reason with her and tell her that she should talk to her friend like adults and avoid calling her a slut. I tell her people with trauma will get triggered if you don’t watched what you say. I then tell her that she doesn’t know is her if her was manipulated into doing it or even forced to it. She then tells me she knows the girl and know she can handle shit talk and she is strong mentally so she wouldn’t kill herself. But what my friends says next  triggered my personal trauma, she says that her mom said that people that have gone through that either become whores or the have such a disgust towards sex. And she said that anyone like that have gone through that are whore just like her. I deadass could not believe it. She not only did she discuss a highly sensitive matter in which her friend confided in her and trust her to keep it her secret IN THE MIDDLE OF A FUCKEN CAFETERIA but also proceed to say the most insensitive shit I have ever heard. I stayed quiet for a while then told her that she could what she wanted with my advice. She told me thank you but she still was going to go with her original plan.

25,"Thing lasted me abut 3 years or so. A franklin mobile hotspot. I liked it. It was small, had an led info display. Fit in a pocket great. 

Gonna have to get a coolpad mobile hotspot now. I've no choice since my isp wont accept anything but what they have and I have to buy it from them. 

But! A while back an ISP was handing out free mobile hotspots to try for a month and I got one (it was for use with a mobile phone). So with my internet connection degrading quite badly on my old mobile hotspot I thought I'd try as see if I can get the free one working with my laptop. And it does! The trial is for 30 days, so I have that to last me until I get my other mobile hotspot. 

And.... they are the same model so I can use the extra batter, back cover and any other parts for it just in case something happens (damage, battery wears out, etc. etc.). 

I'm gonna have to sell some stuff to make up for the $80s it is gonna cost. I have plenty of money, but I need to make it up by doing something unusual (selling something I dont need) in order to justify it in my minde.

30,"Long story short, I gained weight after going through some difficult times and naturally that messed with my confidence in so many ways. I began exercising again last year and despite still having a long way to go, I have made good progress. However, that has hardly helped with my confidence and self-esteem but that changed today, even if it is just for today, I’m okay with that because it feels wonderful. 

So what happened today that made that so? A simple haircut, maybe. I took the day off work to get some things done, things that have been making my anxiety go nuts and getting a haircut was one of them. I think I have a good enough head of hair but almost always have bad experiences with haircuts so I was concerned when I got mine today, and with a new barber no less. But he did a great job, I like it and I am grateful but more than that, I got a few compliments already. And perhaps more interestingly and reassuring, I had an interesting interaction with an employee where I went shopping more recently. We exchanged looks as I walked in for a good amount of time, not too short for it to have been a glancing look but not too long for it to be awkward, she even seemed to stop talking to the customer she was helping at the time. And when going to check out, it happened again and she approached me a bit awkwardly, but in a cute way, as if she were nervous. Now, it was to offer help and it could be seen as just that but when I said everything was taken care of and I was a good distance from her, she kept looking over and kept talking to me a bit. Maybe she was just being helpful and being very nice, you know...doing her job, and maybe she’s just always nervous. 

Regardless, it was...nice. And she was very pretty, which just seemed to make the whole thing more reassuring for me I guess. 

Maybe I’m dumb and this is dumb too, I dunno but today was nice. A good haircut can do a lot too, it seems.",22Feb2020,1

After a long time without being visited by this strong feeling, it came and took me down today.  As soon as I put my foot out of my house, it seemed that the eyes of every person who passed me was one of disgust and hate.

It was meaningless, but very strong.  This feeling immediately mobilized my rationality to find evidence to prove the despicable human being that I am.

I never did anything to anyone and, for the most part, I did more for others than for myself (not because of kindness, but for fear of people).

Even so, I almost never managed to have sincere friendships (which I could talk about this, maybe).  I've never been able to be part of anything, I've never been able to be much.

I don't know what I did, but it seems that I deserve everything and much more. I'm in the bed now, butI can't sleep.  Instead, I feel a strange pain, as if I have been beaten from inside.

33,"Okay so I’ve always had an issue with expressing myself, especially when upset. Growing up, I’d be punished for being upset. Usually if I was crying, I’d be hit or told to grow up. Not exactly a good environment but at this point, there’s not much I can do. I’m 22, and I don’t live with my parents anymore. 

This, however, means I have no idea when I’m being irrational, if it’s genuinely okay for me to be upset, or if I’m just being a whiny bitch. 

Went to Krispy Kreme with someone. I had said, “Let’s see if the sign’s on for fresh donuts.” The sign was on so we went through the drive through. I knew it from the intercom that they hadn’t heard it and I was a bit disheartened but figured maybe they might’ve heard it. TLDR: Not fresh donuts.

So I was disappointed. But then I was given the opportunity to go back around and get fresh donuts. I considered it. But I stopped.

I didn’t want to be irrational. I didn’t know if it was okay to say “Yes, I don’t want THIS donut, I want what I asked for.” And I don’t want to come across as a Karen. I don’t go tearing through stores screeching demands about what I want. I didn’t know if I was being irrational by wanting to go back. So I decided not to.

But of course I did. I wanted to but I didn’t allow myself to. I have no sense on what’s being irrational or what makes sense. And I get that Krispy Kreme isn’t the end of the world.

So I'd like to extend that by saying that I don't have any friends who I feel will always have my back no matter what. I suppose that means that I don't have a ""best"" friend.

I don't feel that there is necessarily any pain involved in not having a best friend, by itself. Plenty of people can be happy alone. The problem starts when one become emotionally hurt or damaged in some way. The easiest example is romantic rejection, but this also applies to professional rejection, loneliness, or general feelings of unhappiness. These things are felt by every human being at some point; it is not a unique experience.

What is a unique experience is having nobody to support you when you are emotionally hurt. Without another person's support, one is stuck internalizing every single problem which often leads to a cycle of hurting yourself over and over; it is nearly impossible to ""get over it"" without outside input. We can put bandages on our own cuts, but a hurting mind cannot make itself stop hurting. Over time the pain subsides, of course, but the injury remains.

35,"Even as a kid, every club I ever joined (or wanted to join), I'd later quit due to feeling out of place and usually social anxiety. I genuinely can't think of a single club I did as a kid that I quit purely on the basis that I didn't enjoy the activity anymore - it all had an element of social anxiety.
And I'm 19 and still have no friends (well I have 2, but I'm at uni so am 500 miles away from them, and we're not really tight like some people have). I'm here all alone and when I think about it, I've felt alone most of my life just because I know that, even before I was at the age where knew something was wrong, I would just naturally isolate myself or feel like a target to people.
To me, being around people and communicating with people is one of the most fundamental parts of life and I haven't learnt how to do that properly even after 19 years. I see other people getting on with their day and it seems as if it's just natural to them. I can't walk out the house without feeling out of place a lot of the time, let alone be in a situation where there are people talking to me and paying even more attention to me than people do when I'm just walking down the street.
It genuinely just feels like, because I've never really been around people, I've never really fely a part of anything to a srong degree (and definitely don't feel part of anything anymore), and so I just feel lost in this life and confused as to who I am, why I'm here. Because when I have attempted to join in situations, it's often ended badly or at least in my mind, so it feels like I'm not even wanted a lot of the time and it really makes me question myself.
But all this has basically just really caused me to feel like I've wasted my years that I should have spent developing social skills and now I'm about 10 uears behind everyone and can't communicate face to face and I feel as though I will never catch up, because nobody would give me the chance or I wouldn't give myself the chance.
As I do my daily activites (mainly just uni work, and self care eg eating etc), I feel trapped in a cycle of being alone and doing these same mandatory activites by myself all the time like there's no hope for anything else. And at the end of the day life is about spending it with other people, not spending it following the same daily routine with no breaks ever, being constantly alone and in my own thoughts.

41,"Hi reddit, this happened a couple years ago, but I just started thinking about it today and im kinda pissed off. 

I went back home for the summer during college, my parents live in a small town so I got a job as a landscaper with a local flower shop. I worked closely with my boss and we hit it off really quickly. He is an incredibly smart guy. I even went to a townhall meeting he invited me to. Unfortunately his cancer came back, he beat it once, but when I was working with him he was battling it for the second time. Im not sure if this played a role in what I am about to tell u. 

Anyways after a couple months my time was coming to an end as a landscaper but I still had a week or so left. As we finished the job that day, he told me to sweep the street, it had a bunch of wood chips on it. He then got in his big pick up down the road and came barreling down the road pretty fast. I cant remember how fast but I can say that he was going faster then he usually would and pretty fast for a residential neighborhood. If I didnt turn around and move out of the way I surely would of been hit or killed. 

I was pissed but I had no idea what to say. I was almost in shock, we always got along talked some shit occasionally I talked to his youngest kid about the hobbies he was into and he is super religious.  

This was a while ago so my memory is kinda foggy, but the next day i do remember him calling me with a half hearted apology. Not an actual apology but it was out of the blue so i feel like it had something to do about the day b4.

Do you think he was just trying to scare me? Do you think he was scared of dying from cancer has a lot of expenses and had temporary insanity? 

Tldr: boss told me to sweep the street then gets in truck and drives fast right where i am standing.",22Feb2020,1
42,"Idk why the customera made me cry today. I cant handle working up front. Theres like 50 people in lobby wonderimg why the foods taking over ten minutes and we are out of everything amd everyones angry and i told a cuatomer id be back to bag gis food after i took a park. I come back and hes bagging his own food while other people berate us for our awful service and makimg a poor man bag his own food. Then everyones yelling and the drive through line goes almost out onto the street. We have like one manager and shes trying to fix my mistake and everyones angry and the orders all have like 20 burgers. Ive been at this like 9 hours and my manager sees im about a break in front of all these people and my coworkers. I feel so silly and stupid for letting what all the customers said get to me but i care about good service and i only have 2 arms and now im sobbing in my car like a baby feeling so atupid id even let customers get to me. I feel like a terrible employee, aanf a terrible person. I know it sounds stupid that id even care what he said to me but im sensitive. All the back doors were locked so i had to walk out in front of a full lobby of angry customers, a line of honking angry people, to get to my car. I wish i wasnt so fucking sensitive. Idk how some people brush off the things customers say about them. If a customer told me i make an awful soda id probably cry again even though thats out of my control. I dont usually work up front so today just broke me. Sorry for the rant. I have no coping skills.",22Feb2020,1
43,"Im wondering if anyone had been through an injury similar to mine.

In April of 2019 I crashed my motorcycle while riding on the freeway. I broke my scapula and my clavicle on my left side, and several ribs. But the real damage is the nerves. The nerves that control my ability to lift or move anything but the fingers on my left arm were ripped out or severed completely, leaving my left arm paralyzed, (I’ve been in a sling since). I was having the craziest pain in my arm as well, it 
literally felt like my arm was full of acid. I wanted to cut it off. Pain pills were not even cutting it. After several months I met with a neurosurgeon at UCLA. I ended up having two ‘nerve transfers’ in October and November. And in December I had a ‘DREZ procedure’ through back of neck to spinal column to finally address the pain. It’s now 2/21/20,  the pain is much better but far from gone, my arm is in a constant state of burning numbness. I have not regained any movement in my arm and I am told it could be up to a year before I may see results, if I am fortunate enough to see any. 

I’ve read about these surgeries and spoken to my surgeon but I’d really like to hear from anyone that has experience with this or similar injuries. 

Be safe out there on your motorcycles y’all.",22Feb2020,1
44,"I had some shit teachers in school. Some who told me I didn’t deserve to go to university or get anywhere in life, some who would humiliate me in front of my classmates, some who disregarded me when I told them I was having a hard time at home. I was constantly pushed aside to make way for the star students they wanted to show off. I stood up for myself and was given detentions for weeks. My art teacher told those of us who weren’t as wealthy as the majority that because we weren’t “willing” to splash out for a laptop and an iPhone and taxi fares  to expensive exhibitions we couldn’t possibly hope to get good grades. Multiple times I tried to start over, do better and I was shot down. They never gave me a chance. I felt like I could never succeed because those I’m charge had zero faith in me or my abilities. When my nana died I spent a few days zones out which angered some teachers. One of them pulled me up in front of the class and told everyone to take a look at the most disrespectful lazy student she’d ever taught. We had a dress code in school. Our school had a dress code - the usual - and all of my pretty, popular friends used to wear spaghetti straps, short skirts, makeup etc. They were rarely told off. I wore flip flops once because I hurt my foot and my parents were called and told that I had to go home and change (I live 2 hours away). 


Looking back, I wish I had talked back, a smart ass or a rude little bitch I do",22Feb2020,1
45,"So a couple months ago I (19m) was scrolling through my mom’s old Facebook pictures looking for a particular picture of myself. Before finding that photo,  I happened to open another photo of myself at dinner with my mom (who took the picture) from late 2017. The caption on this photo says “Having a nice dinner with my favorite Dylan at Gibsons in Oakbrook.” I then noticed the first comment is from one of my mom’s friends which says “ I thought Danny  was your favorite?  ;-) &lt;3”. To which my mom replied “ This guy is my favorite ""Dylan""”.



Now,  I’m not sure what to make of this,  and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, but this made me feel like shit.  I can take a joke,  but the way I see it, this means that my mom had told this woman that my brother was her favorite son in the past (in a non-joking manner).",22Feb2020,1
46,"So there's me, my friend A, and my friend/sort of boyfriend B. A and B knew each other for about a month before I met either of them, and I met them at the same time. The 2 of them have pretty much fallen out of touch it seems though, and it has been that way for a little while now.

So yeah, B and me are kinda of a thing, but kinda not, it's hard to explain honestly, but we're not official, there's no label, but we are like together and not ""seeing"" anyone else. For the moment nobody knows about this, and we wanna keep it that way for now, mostly because we share the same friends and we're still figuring it all out. And B has been in 2 relationships before, both of which ended with him being cheated on, so now he (understandably) has trust issues... (Yes this info will matter)

So, me and A haven't talked in a bit, both of us have been busy. But he shot me a message tonight just to check on me and to tell that me misses me, we go back and fourth a bit, then he comes off with ""You're like my best friend, sister, wife, and lover all in one"", I kinda just brushed that off honestly, he's been drinking n that so I just made a joke of it and he didn't push anything. We have had a talk a few months back just to make sure that everything is Platonic between us, and it is.

So here's where the problem comes in, I have no idea rather to tell B about it or not. Like, I feel like I should, otherwise he's going to say that I hid it from him and that will cause BIG problems, but even if I do tell him, it will most likely cause big problems.

I've been under a lot of stress and this is not helping at all. What do I do here?",22Feb2020,1
47,"My bf (18) goes to parties, does drugs, has a fake and a car. I (16) don’t have any of that. I just feel like I don’t have any of the freedom or fun that he does, and whenever I see him out doing something exciting that I would never be able to do I get upset. I don’t want to be the jealous gf or getting upset over a boy. I need to learn how to be happy while in a relationship with someone that seems to be living while I’m here stuck in the same place. I don’t want to talk about it with him or make him feel bad. It’s his life, not mine to control. I didn’t know where to write this but felt it had to be put out there somewhere.

48,"Hello everyone, first time poster. I’m constantly reading and even hearing in my own life how insecure and how down people feel about themselves. I’m one of those people. And I’ve been working for a long time to learn to love myself, and I still have a long way to go, but I’ve been working on it.

I look at people everyday, or read things from people everyday, and it breaks my heart how many people don’t look at themselves and see someone who is beautiful, handsome, good enough. 

We go through our everyday lives, come home, go to bed, and we think, I’m not good enough. We lay in bed and judge ourselves, our facial features, stomach, breast size, penis size and we constantly put ourselves down and let ourself retract into ourselves and believe that what people say and what we see on the internet is true.

We hurt ourselves. When we should be leading to love ourselves. Our everyday life hurts because we can’t stand to look in the mirror...

But I wanted to say... my goodness you are so amazing. You are so wonderful and beautiful and handsome. But you’re so much more than that...

You ARE smart, funny, heartwarming, loving, so talented, and WORTH THE FUCKING WORLD.

YOU ARE WORTH THE WORLD.

You deserve to be loved, to love, to live, to be happy, to feel worthy.

I can’t see you. But you are absolutely amazing. Your are worth everything.

And to anyone who needs to hear it. YOU ARE WORTH IT. You’re worth everything good. You are the most wonderful person. And you deserve to know that. And I believe it. I know it. 

All my love to you all. You are spectacular. The stars aline everytime you walk under them.",22Feb2020,1
49,"I just can’t anymore. I can’t, I can’t do anything. I’m just so tired of everything. I always feel so empty. So alone. So fucking angry. So starved for attention or fucking affection. And the inferiority and hatred, I just possess for myself is just unreal. I can’t control it anymore. I just want to lay in bed and stay there. I thought meeting a girl or finding new friends would help but I haven’t been to achieve either. Every time I psych myself up to go out there and it just kills me before I even get the words out. It just seems like a lot of potential relationships are shut down before I even say a word. It’s like they read me like a book. “Desperate, angry, alone, next.” I’m not ugly nor am I unhealthy, But I’m average, and honestly I’m starting to believe people hate average. Am I just a terrible person. Do I deserve this sentiment. Is it normal to feel this way as a man? Is this what we are doomed to? To just let it sit inside and rot, until it just bursts or kills us slowly? Why?",22Feb2020,1
50,"A big survey was done and Americans largely have a negative view of ""socialism"". In the liberal NE and West Coast, it's easy to forget the 'Joe Plumbers' in the midwest. We need incrementalism. A revolutionary socialist movement is bound to fail. Let's move the needle left and focus on improving on that. Let's not nominate somone too fat left for ohio soccer mom. Not to dispariage these folks but they do not have time.l to educate themselves enough to overcome the socialism stigmatization. Let's get the one who can win in, even if It's Biden or Bloomberg and spend 4to8 yeara getting back to sanity. In a decade America might be ready for strongly progressive government, but I am afraid it is not right now.

If Trump wins he nominates Ginsberg's replacement, and that is it. Game over for at least 40 years. If Trump wins we are stuck under a hard right supreme court for at least a generation.  He may succeed in completely gutting Obama Care. A Trump winmust he avoided at all costs even if that means supporting *gag* Bloomberg in the general election. A centrist Billiomaire who is at least sane is 100× than a fascist billionaire who is insane and unstable and controlled by our key adversary, Russia. If Trump wins re-election I am more or less giving up hope for America. It'll be over. Kinda wish President's didn't have term limits. If Obama had served till he was 90 that'd be OK with me.

52,"So I’m a 22 year old girl and I lost my father to suicide 2 years ago. It came as an extreme shock to me, and I was in so much pain that I developed psychosis. I had to go on antipsychotics that gave me a flat affect to deal with the paranoia and I didn’t laugh at all for 4 months straight—that is no exaggeration. I truly, truly thought I would never laugh again. 

I used to be a very bubbly and giggly person, and people used to tell me how contagious my laugh was. In high school, I used to be well-known for cracking up in class and making everyone else laugh, too. In college, I won the “most infectious laugh” award in my dorm hall. 

I have a girlfriend now, and the other day she told me that she doesn’t laugh a lot with me, and she wishes we laughed more together. I didn’t know how to tell her that I have to fake laugh constantly because I feel so broken. I wish I could laugh more with her, too. She doesn’t even see me as a funny person, because we met when I was going through so much grief.

Last night I went to a concert with my friend and on the way there in the car, he kept making jokes that made me cry with laughter. My laugh sounded just like it used to when I was 19 and full of life. That gave me some hope that maybe one day, I won’t have to fake laugh all the time. Maybe one day, my real laugh will come back and stay for good.",22Feb2020,1
54,"Dear Sweetheart, 

I was cleaning out my bedroom the other day, it really needs to be ready for Husband and I to move all of his furniture in by next month. The nightstand desk on my side seemed like a good place to start. Instead, I found your ""Celebration of Life"" schedule from last March.

How has a year already passed since your funeral? Actually, how had 7 years passed without us speaking? We were so close and so in love, even if only for two years of our high school era. Not even two years, though, right? Because we didn't start dating (in secret, haha) until somewhere in Senior year. I distinctly remember going to the fair together, sometime after 12th grade started, and we held hands for the first time. Probably because we were with friends and your parents weren't around.

If your parents hadn't been so against our relationship, I'm wondering if our feelings would have been so intense? Would we have dated like any normal teenage couple, and mutually broken up when we graduated high school? We always had different plans for life... college for you and the military for me. Anyone with any sense would have told us that we had no future together, and we knew that as well when we didn't even try to make plans any further than ""next week"". But, ""next week"" kept going up until I was given my first military assignment.

I was stationed on the other side of the world, and you stayed home for college. I seemed to have no time for you, but plenty of time for my (male) coworkers. Waking up early to Skype with you was hell when I was working 12 hour shifts, and you couldn't stay up late when you had classes in the morning. For the first time in our relationship, I was the one with a busy life; work and friends and parties and always always ALWAYS surrounded by men. In retrospect, the photos I sent you of my friends and I going out to beaches and dinners and dorm parties didn't show you how happy I was, but instead showed you that I didn't need my high school sweetheart anymore. At least, that's how I interpret it... you're not around anymore to tell your side. 

In the months after your death, I did the stupid thing and tried to find out what happened to the boy I'd once loved. Humans are creatures of habit, after all, and I found some forums with your gaming username. Most of it was normal stuff over the years, but my heart stopped when I saw you had posted in relationship forums. Once a year, it seemed like, you would mention me. 

Some of it was casual... mentioning the time our high school group coordinated our Halloween costumes for school and I fulfilled your teen nerd fantasy by choosing a sexy (but safe for school) anime character.

Some of it was uncomfortable... mentioning the type of romantic encounters we'd had in your car and other places where we could get sneak away. 

Some of it was... discussing our breakup and relationship in a much different view that I'd had of it. Did you really break up with me because you thought all my friends were trying to sleep with me? I had no idea that you'd been interested in another girl while we were together, but apparently you were and you dated her right after breaking up with me? Because I don't remember that...  After you dumped me, we tried to stay friends... I remember telling you that I was going to spend a night with some guys as I transitioned to night shift (movies and videogames and keeping me from falling asleep). I remember that you kept calling and calling me on Skype. When I finally picked up, you just wanted to chat?

I don't remember that last angry conversation that led to us ending all contact. Was it because I was thinking of dating one of the coworkers? I feel like that could be it, but again, you're not here to tell me what you remember, and you didn't talk about that fight on any of the forums, and you didn't talk to any of our friends.

When I visited our hometown a couple years later, I think I tried to talk to you again, but we had another fight and didn't meet up. Later, when I was deployed, you messaged me and apologized for still being so angry. I guess I was pretty pissed off, because my response was cold, mean, and stupidly petty.

That was the last time we spoke. I should have been kinder. We'd once had real love, after all.

The years went by, and the only time I honestly ever thought about you was when a new girl would join the shop and talk about how she and her high school sweetheart were going to be together forever. I encouraged her, but also told her about you and I. Very rarely, it seems, does a high school boyfriend handle having a military girlfriend. We were not a unique case. The other girls I talked to all ended up with similar issues, and inevitably broke up/were broken up with only a few months after getting stationed overseas.

What would we have done if I was assigned to one of the locations near our hometown?

Sweetheart, why do I feel guilty about never thinking of you? The forum posts obviously show that you still thought about me, enough to tell strangers on the internet about me. When I only mentioned you as part of a cautionary tale about forthcoming heartbreak to other 18 year old girls.

Maybe that's why I'm telling our story to a bunch of strangers on the internet.

After you broke up with me, I started dating. I was young, cute, and ready to be romantically involved. After the one rebound ended up terribly, I decided that I didn't want to look for a life partner... I just wanted cute boys that I could go out with and/or get involved with, no future plans, because that didn't work out so well the first two times. Eventually, one of those flings turned to real love, but the military life makes serious relationships difficult and I was assigned to the other side of the world. We broke up. For a year, This Man and I kept talking, easily, even though we both got involved with other people over that next year.

It was basically the opposite of what had happened with you and I, Sweetheart. This Man and I stayed friends, and I even talked to him about relationship problems I'd been having. Eventually, the universe, fate, or the Gods of the Military  saw something, and This Man found out he would be assigned to the same country I was in. This Man told me right away, and right away I started crying. I asked if we could try dating again? Because even if we couldn't work out our issues (and we'd had issues like any couple, but ones that got ignored because of the nature of military relationships), I still wanted to try.

His response? Telling me how dumb that was because he was going to marry me no matter what.

True to military relationships, I got paperwork ready and we were married within two months of being reunited. Valentine's day was my goal, but Husband and I got our marriage license completed within February, so I just count the whole month as our anniversary! 

Oh, my Husband is wonderful, I love him so much. We worked so hard and overcame so much just to be together. In fact, we aren't even together yet. Though we were assigned to the same country, we were assigned to locations 5 hours apart and were only able to see eachother for a couple weekends each month, for the first year or so of our marriage. Then, I decided to leave the military and go back home, planning on joining the Reserve component and going to school full time. Husband decided to stick it out one more year, both for the bonus money and to give us a safety net while I got our home set up, and planned the rest of our life. Let me tell you, Sweetheart, if you thought that dealing with a girlfriend stationed overseas was impossible? Husband and I have spent two years living apart... the first two years of our marriage, and yet we would not trade this for anything in the world. We are focused on the future and focused on eachother. The sacrifices we make are made on the foundation of love and commitment.

Husband and I are so close to having our forever. We were reunited as he left the military this year, but he still has lose ends to tie up at his family home, and so we are separated yet again. This time though, I made him pick out wallpaper and we organized the kitchen with the most important of his culinary tools. He made sure those were shipped to the house with care!

I am so happy in this life. I am so filled with love, family, friends. Yes, parts of life are hard and college in my late 20's isn't easy, but these are the hard parts of life that are so rewarding.

Why am I telling you all this, Sweetheart? You left the world last year, and though I'm not sure if I'm religious, and I'm not sure if you were still as God-fearing as you once were... I hope you can see this letter.

If not, I hope that someone like you reads this letter.

Because you were supposed to be happy, too.

Sweetheart, when I came back to our hometown to prepare a life for my Husband and I... I thought I would run into you. Instead, before I could even unpack, I got a phone call from my best friend who had seen your family post on Social Media. Frantically as first, they posted on your page and tagged you, and reached out to your friends and family and work, trying to get in contact with you. But, Sweetheart, you were gone from this world and your family were soon asking for funeral donations on Social Media.

You were supposed to be happy, just as happy as I am today. 

Let me tell you what I had hopped to happen when I got home.

Sweetheart, you and I were supposed to run into eachother, maybe at the Farmer's Market or maybe at the college. Even though I don't think you ever went to the Farmer's Market and I didn't end up going to the college you graduated from. However we were supposed to meet again, it would have ended up with us exchanging phone numbers and reflecting on how stupid we were at the ages of 18-20. I was supposed to gush about Husband, and you were supposed to gush about your wife... or girlfriend... or kids? Or anything that was good in your life. Though, it seems like you had... none of those, and from your forum posts, you had even given up at finding a girlfriend.

Instead, here I sit, typing you a letter and staring at the 27 short years between your birth date and your death date.

Your birthday just passed, actually, and this means that we're still the same age, since you'll never really have another birthday. By the end of this year, I'll be older than you will ever get to become.

Am I going to be forced to think about you for the rest of my life? Every birthday I have will separate us even more. I still think of you as a 19 year old, even though we were both in our late 20's by last year. 

The gap between us is getting wider.

I have a spouse; you'll never get married. One day I'll have kids; something that you'll never do. I'll eventually care for my parents as they age; does that act of love now become a burden for the only sibling you had, the only child your parents now have? My sibling still has me as an older sister; your sibling is now alone.

Sweetheart, I spoke to your family after the funeral. I couldn't stop crying, your Mom couldn't stop crying, your Dad seemed empty, and your sibling seemed so grown up and so old, despite being so, so young. I spoke with our high school friends, and reminisced about old times. I was surprised to know that you kept so well in contact with some of them. 

I wish, Sweetheart, that you had actually spoken to them, or even me. With years of experience, I can now look back and see the signs of depression and undue guilt you felt, all throughout our high school relationship. Everything weighed so heavy on you, and you were so ready to accept guilt for things that you shouldn't have felt guilty about! 

You're not here to tell me otherwise, but I guess you felt the weight to be too crushing, maybe? Maybe you did the only thing you thought would help... did you think that talking to your loved ones would force them to shoulder the weight? We all gladly would have taken a bit of that burden from you! It would weigh nothing to us. 

Instead, you gave me a heavy burden that I will now carry for the rest of my life.

The memory of you, not as a bittersweet teen romance, but as... gone.

I can only imagine the beautiful life you could have had, and hold tight the good memories and photographs I have of us. That will be my only comfort.

I must get back to my wonderful, beautiful, happy life, but I think that you'll never be far from my thoughts.

Goodbye, 

Your High School Sweetheart.

60," The Milwaukee brace, also known as a cervico-thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis or CTLSO, is a back brace used in the treatment of spinal curvatures (such as scoliosis or kyphosis) in children It is a full-torso brace that extends from the pelvis to the base of the skull. Milwaukee braces are often custom-made over a mold of the patient's torso but in some cases, it can be made from prefabricated parts. Three bars two posterior and one anterior—are attached to a pelvic girdle made of leather or plastic, as well as a neck ring. The ring has an anterior throat mold and two posterior occipital pads, which fit behind the patient's head. Lateral pads are strapped to the bars; adjustment of these straps holds the spine in alignment. This brace is normally used with growing adolescents to hold a 25° to 40° advancing curve. The brace is intended to minimize the progression to an acceptable level, not to correct the curvature. For corrective measures, special exercises or physical activities are used. If the curvature continues despite the brace, surgery may be required. The Milwaukee brace is often prescribed to be worn 23 hours a day for several years",22Feb2020,1

62,"I have a 5.5-week-old baby girl who is absolutely the love of my life and such an angel. I love her so damn much...

But she spends almost every day with grandma because I went back to work 2 weeks ago. 

Her dad and I couldn’t get comfortable with managing the bills on only his wages despite the fact that he makes almost double what we need to cover. It just stretched us too thinly between paychecks and left very little to be able to save or keep for an emergency should one arise.-. 

He didn’t want me to go back to work. He wanted to take on more by himself so I could be home with our daughter. I refused because A) I am very well liked at my company and felt that the sooner I went back the better...B) I wanted my own income so I have money for myself...and C) I had promotions waiting at this job which I was anxious to step into once I returned. I’ve only been there since September so I had to quit when I took time off for the baby. 

But I feel selfish because my baby sees her grandma more than she sees us, and I can’t bring myself to leave work and let him make it for us because I don’t want to throw away my work opportunities by quitting a second time—surely it would burn a bridge. 

Am I selfish? Should I just let him work? I have noticed I miss my daughter immensely and I just would love spending more time with her each day but I can’t at the moment..",22Feb2020,1

66,"I'm M [23] and I really love this girl F [23] I knew from classes. We've only talked like a couple of times though, but I felt like her coming in my life was a good sign, you know when you just feel in your gut.Earlier I used to just sit around and do nothing for hours, but after realising I have feelings for her I've started to take care of myself better, go out with friends, and overall looking back I wonder if I was depressed or something before meeting her. We both belong to different cities and met for coaching classes at some other city.
 She's cute, charming, friendly, a fun person and gives off good vibes.Meeting her felt like some part of me was missing and she has come to fill that.The fact that I like her so much made me feel better about myself, of that even makes sense. Often when we had lunch breaks I would see her somewhere in my vicinity, just in the range that I could just walk up and talk to her.We would have eye contact several times, but I was too shy and socially anxious to talk to her. A mutual friend,a girl, told me she is an introvert and didn't really open up to her friends. But when we talked she would even say stuff like she wants to marry early and get settled. Another friend of mine and I had asked her if she was in some relationship she did decline it and said she's never been in one.
I knew classes would end and I would regret not doing anything about it, so I gathered up courage and talked to her casually.She missed several classes as she would fall ill frequently, so when she didn't come for a week I asked her about it.She told me that she has had some sort of blood flow problems in her brain since the past 2 years and is constantly on medication. I also started to talk to random people too because I hated being socially anxious.
During a lecture on Friday, I casually asked her if she would come on Monday for the next class and after she said yes, we went home. By this point I didn't have her contact no., so on Monday I planned on asking her for it as that week would be the last week of classes and we would go back home.But she never arrived. On Thursday, I got her contact no. from a mutual friend, a girl. I called her asking how she was and why she didn't come to classes.She said she didn't feel well and she did say she would come the next day. She was speaking normally as she used to when we spoke in person.
 Well,she didn't show up so I figured she must have not been well.Atleast I had her contact now.I texted her the next day if she was doing well--I got no reply, called her yet some other day--rejected my call. This all happened in December. On 1st Feb we had exams for which we had joined classes, I called her to ask how her exams were--rejected again. I asked the girl who gave her contact to me if she heard from her but she said that no one from her friend circle from classes has been in touch with her since December.On 11th Feb, I called her yet again, she picked up! But there was no voice so I tried a couple of times again and she didn't pick up. I messaged her on telegram asking how she was doing--msg was seen and ignored. 
I can understand, I was someone who she just knew and probably just though as an acquaintance so maybe she doesn't want to be in contact with me.It hurts so much though. I wish we didn't part ways like this. I really like her and would have loved to be even a friend, I did enjoy talking to her, well as little as we did. I wish I could have told her how I feel and how much just knowing her changed me for the better.Now I wake up everyday feeling like shit and go to sleep feeling like shit because of these thoughts and the dreams I have of her. I cried myself to sleep yesterday, after how long idk. I'm fine during the rest of the day though. 
I like talking about her though but I'm going to run out of things to say now. I like that feeling of loving her, caring about her. I do wonder what she's like, I wish I got to know her better. I sometimes regret not having tried harder but I have also improved as a person a little bit so there's that. 
I'm not sure what I should do now.You can tell I'm someone who gets emotionally attached too easily and way too strongly.I need help in at least control emotions better. Also I know my approach was incorrect,or should I say that lack thereof, and I don't want to sit sad all the time and since I've started to improve myself a little, I think I'll just go all out, so I'll be grateful for any kind of advice for me.",22Feb2020,1

Every day my feelings just grew and it felt at the same time really bad and really good. The main reason why this is so bad for me is because i had never before felt empathy, love, happiness for someone else tgan me, depression. I had had 3 girlfriends before that but those i kept only for my own lust and didnt really feel anything for them. But this is like all the feelings ive ever thrown away boosted to 100 fold, to me i was always the number 1, the most important thing, but now she makes me feel like shes more important to me than i am, i feel like i could die for her.


Shes also depressed and cuts, so since shes the most important thing to me, i feel incredible incredible pain from knowing that shes not well, shes all i can think about, every night i dream of her, i cant stop it, only times i can be at peace is when i hear her voice and know shes there safe. I dont even want her to be with me anymore (well i do want her but this is more important) i just want her to be safe and happy.

Ive committed massive blunders, overseas career expeditions thatve failed, and covering up those tracks is unimaginably difficult.  I've done everything I could possibly think of, getting a new passport, erasing my social media accounts and starting afresh, erasing my old phone lines, opening multiple bank accounts even, changing my appearance, distancing myself from my friends, focusing on myself, taking time off for self-reflection... I'm still aimlessly floating along, I feel.  I'm not so much worried about that as I am about this uneasy feeling that someone who knew me back then will out me.

My older brother receives and sells stolen property, his friend gets in trouble, but he doesn't? I'm having one of my ""episodes"" and am at a park after hours and I'm the one who gets in trouble?

I guess it's easy to pick on me because I don't fight back. 

My mom goes out and says how she can defend my younger brother getting this girl pregnant and yet when it comes to anything I do, there's suddenly an issue that's taken?

This one local cop in the town next door one night wanted to commit me for hearing voices even though I'm not a threat to anybody or myself? So what? The people who exist around me that nobody can apparently see are of no threat either. Why the fuck should I be the one who always has to go down?

I don't have a problem. I see the worst shit going on daily and yet it's just ""how things are.""

These people out here recklessly driving, stealing, raping, and they're apparently not mentally ill? Fuck that.

The earth's atmosphere is nothing more than an aura of the collective mental illness of humanity, and yet everyone else claims to be sane, and they want to throw me in a psychiatric institution?

So morning comes and I make extra effort to wake up earlier than usual, and then I can't find my hand drip things where it should be. I'm looking and looking, but eventually I have to leave for work. I got so angry, just ruined my day.

Recently whenever these things happen, I lay down to sleep and my heart is beating fast- 70 to 80 bpm resting. I drink a chamomile tea. I take some melatonin. I read some philosophy books. I do a deep breathing exercise. Still I can't seem to sleep. I can feel my heart beating and I feel anxious. I never had things bother me this badly, what is going on with me? Why am I getting so irritated over nothing?

77,"I’m turning 25 soon, and I’m feeling trapped in my current situation, and desperate to break out. I don’t want to be stuck more and have regrets for choices I didn’t make and things I didn’t do. 

So here are things that I want to change (some of them conflict.) 

I want to get on a career path. I’ve been jumping around to non skilled, non specialised roles and I haven’t really built towards a career. On the one hand I feel that’s ok but on the other I want to be happy with my work in the future and I want to find it easier to get a job and stay there than it currently is. I really want to go back to education and I’m willing to work really hard for that but funds are limited so I would also need to apply anywhere that could give me a scholarship. 

I want to travel more. After graduating university my biggest regret is not going on a long trip to South America. I instead spent almost a year unemployed working as a dog walker and at a factory living at my parents and feeling depressed and trying to save/prepare to move countries to be with my 4 year long distance partner. I told myself I couldn’t get w job because I’d be moving in a couple of months and that turned into 10 months. I think this time greatly affected my work prospects and I wish I had gone to South America or Japan, which I still really want to do. Thinking of going to Japan for a working holiday since I’m still young enough but I don’t want to screw up my career chances even more and I don’t know what I would do there to support myself. Another thing is family and friend judgment for me travelling/relocating countries again, but I don’t worry as much about that. I really don’t want to regret not pushing myself and going for it just don’t know if now is the best time or if I should wait till I’m studying... I know it will be hard once fully employed ...

Figure out whether to stay in my LtR. Been in this relationship for 6 years now and I’ve known my boyfriend 10 years. It’s really serious but still we aren’t sure about marriage, we’re both unsure. I think because for 4 out of 6 years we were long distance, and also we started talking when I was only 16, so basically I’ve changed massively over that time. I appreciate that even though we have both grown so much and changed we still love each other but I do wonder sometimes if that’s because we are each other’s first relationship, and we are afraid of being alone. We have some issues sexually I’m borderline asexual, and depressed so I hardly want to do anything and I think that bothers him. We are both approaching our prime attractiveness years and I feel worried that he’ll regret being with me. Also, we have 7 months left on the rent so I feel like I have to stay. 


Those are my three main issues making big decisions for me is hard enough but these conflict and complicate each other and make me scared to act, in fear of regret... I won’t know what to prioritise or what I want most I just know I don’t want to stay in an aimless job trying to make life bearable.",22Feb2020,1

At this moment. And many moments in past months I feel just so alone. And i don't know what to do. I never really had friends since moving to New Town back in 2015. When I attended schools I felt fine alone. Or maybe I was just making my self an illusion of friendship. With me being ghost in small group. Moving from secondary school to college i throught I had friends. Though it was just class mate. Messing around. Doing stuff in lessons but rarely communicate outside. Moving to different course I started to see the situation I was in. It felt like everyone around were in some sort of friendship. But me. I felt excluded i wanted to socialise. But i didn't know what to do. What to speak to them. Now i am working as Security officer and i feel lonelier then ever. Only interaction I ever really get lately is just from parent. Guard im relieving and they relieving me. And from cleaners that come early morning. Making me see that I got no friends. And I don't know what to do. I want to search for friends. But i fear i won't be able to talk to them. Feel like I would be yet another ghost amongst others.

97,"So I just wanted to lay out my current situation, my thinking, and the changes I am going to make.

Im currently 24, I graduated top of my class at college, but i currently work as a bartender. Somewhere along the way, I got lazy. I play too safe with myself. The easier, nicer, cosier option is always to just sleep in till 11, wake up, eat a crap breakfast, get stoned and watch youtube all day. It fucking sucks!!! I have friends, I have a girlfriend, but I realise that lately- I've kind of become a total loser. 

I've had enough, to be honest. 

I'm going to get back to the gym. I used to really enjoy lifting weights, and just a couple years ago I was shredded. At some point though, I started making too many excuses for myself and I stopped going and now I'm a pink chubby mess.

I'm going to stay at my job for the time being. Right now it covers my ass financially, but further down the line I'd like a change.

I'm trying to clear my overdraft. I'm currently around £1900 in debt. Ive been itching away at it by depositing £100 every month, so its starting to come away but its still terrifying.

I'd also like to clean up my smoking habit. Not necessarily quit, but develop my self-control.

My biggest issue generally is willpower and discipline. We could get into psychological issues, problems in my upbringing etc, but frankly- I'm a 24yo grown man. Theres no time for judgement or opinion now. My life tomorrow is affected by my decisions today.

Yeah this shit can be hard, but I have to be stronger. Every day is a battle against the teenager in my head who just wants to get high and retweet cats all day, sleep in, eat trash, and be a complete couch potato. I'm done letting this be.

I'm going to use this account to try and track progress etc. Wish me luck, feel free to follow, and please send encouragement. I can admit I'm weak, and your advice and motivations will really help!

The very fact that you have a path that is only meant for you, suggests that you are meaningful, a piece of the puzzle. You are not always going to see the impact that you have (positive or negative) on others, but crossing their paths was just as important as whoever has crossed yours. It's a journey, one that is far from over. If you overthink it you go in circles, don't think about it enough then you miss a turn.

120,"Yo, just wanted to tell yall a story about one weird friend, i dont see him that often anymore.

So lets call him Eric. My friend Eric was a really chill and cool guy when we were just hanging out alone, but as soon as a girl was hanging out with us, he just becomes a different person.

Some examples that happend:

1. This is the one i was really pissed about. When he was at my place, we decided to walk to a  football pitch. Everything was fine and cool untill my sister came home and she asked if she could go with us, and i really didnt want her to go, cuz i already knew Erics ways and whats going to happen. Unfortunately i agreed thinking he wouldnt do anything cuz its my sister.. BIG MISTAKE.. When we went outside, he already had became a different person with a different personality. He didnt even talk to me, he was just focusing on impressing my sister and the only way he could talk to me was by making a joke that insults me, for some reason, prob cuz he wanted to show some dominance or something(hes 5,4).. The whole night was so fucking shitty and well lets just say he hasnt been in my house and hasnt seen my sister since that day.
2. One day we were casually playing football and he asked me to record this one clip on snapchat for him, so i said okay. As soon as i said that im recording, he just started being so hype and started swearing, it was so fucking cringy, i deleted the snap and didnt record another one.

Some honorable mentions:

Making rape jokes about my sister and waiting for me to laugh

Making a joke that me and my sister fuck

Flexing with all the girls hes talked to

Faking that he had a girlfriend twice

Trying to date 3 girls from the same friend group all after each other

&amp;#x200B;

Again i dont know why he does this, like hes so chill and cool when were just alone hanging out, Im having a really chill time if its just us.",22Feb2020,1

128,"I'm gonna preface this with I am an introvert, and I am kinda socially awkward. 

At the start of this school, I went to a new school, and I have been pretty happy because I've been making lots of friends in my various classes and around the school. Having come from a tiny private school, I didn't have that many friends to begin with, so my ""total tally of friends"" had gone from maybe around 10 to I'm estimating about 40-50. By no means am I saying though that these are all friends that I would entrust my whole life story and secrets with, but people that I am comfortable with and would hang out with and get along with quite well.

The part of this which troubles me though, is that very few of them ever go out of their way to send me a text from time to time. Most of them will be pleasant in the hallway and our various classes, but a lot of them sort of change completely outside of school. Even the ones who claim to be my 'best and closest friends'.  Any time there is interaction outside of school, it's always me who has started it, with the majority of my 'friends'.

I have a couple of friends from my old school who make a point of keeping in tough with me, but a lot of my new friends don't and it bugs me because I'm left wondering ""Do they actually value me as a friend, or do they just pretend at school, or alternately, are they just spending so much time texting their other a million and one friends that they've got no time for me who isn't on Snapchat?"" That's the thing, most of my new friends are very extroverted because they've been going to public schools for their whole life, and subsequently, I know they are always contacting people outside of school because they'll come back the next day and be like ""Oh yeah, me and whoever just had an amazing party together,"" or ""We had the strangest convo on the weekend,"" or just other obvious signs that they aren't like shutting down on the weekend. 

Utlimatley, I'm an introvert, and I enjoy being alone a lot, but all the same, out of the people I call my friends, there are only a few who happen to be from my old school that ever care to talk to me and ask me to hang out. For the rest, it's always me starting conversations and me asking if they want to meet up and hang out. I feel kinda guilty because of this for some reason. It's just all so weird to me.

Also, sorry this is so long and doesn't make complete coherent sense.",22Feb2020,1
129,"


I have this one friend named Cat she's 30 I'm 22. We met through mutual friends. She always has drama at work and never likes her boss. She changes jobs every year. She sometimes gets in arguments with her roommates where she ends up crying because they aren't as clean by her standards. Sometimes I make plans with her to go hiking on the weekend.



We’ll make plans for one then she won't text me the day of until five saying ”sorry I slept in” she's done it about three times to me. She just doesn't set the alarm because ”she knows she’ll wake up.” I always seem to be doing only what she wants to do. We went to a restaurant I loved, and she said we could never go back because they took the pasta she likes off the menu. She makes comments about the way I look and my personality.



I told her I was harassed and bullied so severely in high school. She has made comments about how my hair looks fake and overprocessed. I go to school and sometimes work as a freelancer. She's made comments to me sometimes when we hang out like ”SOME OF US have work in the morning”




She says I ask too many questions because usually when I see my friends, I want to know what's going on in their lives. She doesn't ask many about me. I've gotten upset about her questions comments, but a mutual friend who I used to date says ”she probably thinks you ask too many questions or talk too much because she never stops talking about herself.” she's made comments like ”you either say nothing or express too much Love you though.”
I sometimes binge drink when I'm stressed. I don't drink everyday or most weekends. 



I've been trying to cut drinking out of my life because I don't want to become a problem drinker. I see a therapist two times a week and always talk to my family about it.She's made comments about my drinking like ”oh my God your out of control and thank God your not drinking this weekend.” she also tries to baby me in front of people and take away my drink even if I'm having one beer. She smokes weed every single day.




When I ask her to do stuff, I love like going to the movies, she always says no and makes passive aggressive comments about how I should stop asking her about it. I've gone to six different concerts she likes even though I've never listened to those bands to be supportive. In the last couple of months, I've become silent and walked out when she's made passive aggressive comments because I don't want to go off and say mean things to a friend, so I storm off and go home.




She recently made a group chat sharing an old of my friends and me. I'm blackout drunk in the photo, and it's very embarrassing. I texted her to not post shit like that. She said she didn't think anything of it before she posted because it was a nice picture. I just said whatever. I hadn't talked to her in a couple of weeks, and she texts me about how our relationship didn't stay healthy, and she doesn't want to stay friends anymore. Am I the toxic friend? Am I a bad friend? I have gotten embarrassingly drunk around her twice. Am I I out of control?


tl;Dr: my friend has been passive-aggressive to me, so I started giving her the cold shoulder.",22Feb2020,1

133,"My family and I (15F) are immigrants from a small, poor, third world country in Europe. We moved to the U.S. in 2009 when my mom won a green card. When I was younger, I didn’t care about my family status. But with age, it really began bothering me. I’ve never told anyone about this my entire life, not even my closest friends, but I just can’t keep it to myself anymore right now.

At school, I present myself just like all the other students do. I speak very good English, and nobody would ever guess that I wasn’t born in the U.S. I have a good wardrobe, and dress myself in quirky and fun outfits. I am a straight A student, and many people often compliment me on how smart I am. So from the outside, I look like an average middle class American citizen. Well, what people don’t know, and what I always hide, is that my family is actually very poor.

My family has a lot of government benefits that help us out with food, healthcare, and housing. My mom doesn’t work and stays home to take care of my little siblings, the youngest being three. My dad does work, but he works at the car rental section at the airport that pays him a little over minimum wage. He went to college, and is an extremely smart man. He actually studied computer programming for multiple years when we got to the U.S. But he ended up throwing all those college years down the drain and sticking with his current job. Why? Well, he says that because he earns so little, the government helps us out. He says that the government will supposedly give me a scholarship to a good college if he keeps earning as much as he is, and keeps having the government benefits.

Our living conditions aren’t bad, no not at all. Sure, we can’t buy everything we want, but that’s okay. Whenever I go to buy clothes, I don’t even walk into the fancy expensive stores. I go to places like Goodwill to thrift. There’s honestly so much good clothing there for a really low price, and many people would never guess that Goodwill is where I buy the majority of my clothes. Shopping for food, well, my parents just go and buy all the necessities. Every once in a while, they’ll buy me something that I really want. Though often, when I’m like “Oh! Can I have some Oreos?” When I’m at cub foods or something, they’re like “No, you can get the off brand ones at Aldi that cost way less.” 

Because of our lack of money, I couldn’t really have any pets that require lots of attention. Many years of begging my parents for a dog, cat, ferret, guinea pig, or rat, all down the drain. My dad would tell me that if they got sick, we’d have to take them to the vet, and we don’t have the money for that. And I wouldn’t want my pets to suffer would I? The only pets I’ve had were hamsters, three in my entire life. I don’t have any complaints though, cause I loved each and every one of them with my whole heart. Hamsters should be taken to the vet too if they ever get sick, but my dad would never. He claims it’s cheaper to just get a new one for ten bucks and call it a day than to spend over a hundred dollars on the vet. We have government benefits for healthcare, and it would cost way more to take my pet hamster to the vet than it would to to take our family members to the doctor.

When we first moved to America, we lived in an apartment for a couple years, until it got too expensive to live there, and moved out. Currently we live in a small duplex in a kinda crappy neighborhood, and my parents have no intentions of moving anywhere else, although I’ve asked them several times. They say that where we live right now is good enough, and if we move somewhere else we could land in a worse location.

The thing is, I don’t like being poor. At school I’m doing my best, and I have big plans for myself career wise. I want to go into the STEM field, where I heard lots of money is earned. I’m interested in computer engineering, particularly in software. So eventually, I have a dream of having a well paying job, a good house, pets, and everything that I desire. I want to also help out my parents of course. 

When I was younger, in elementary school, and my mom would dress myself and stuff like that, I would get picked on. People would ask me if I’m poor, which was what sparked this insecurity. With time I began dressing myself and buying my own clothes, and now being a sophomore, it’s never a problem. But back in middle school, I also began being self conscious about the fact that I had free school lunch. All these kids would be bringing their own lunches from home, while I’d be eating the crappy school food. Last year it impacted me so much, to the point that I refused to eat lunch at all and just skipped it most days. My fear of people assuming that I’m poor early took a toll on my life. Currently, I kinda stopped caring about the school lunch thing, but the overall subject of being poor is very uncomfortable for me.

I always try avoiding having conversations with friends about where my parents work, but, sometimes it’s inevitable. I tell them where he works, but try to sugarcoat it as much as I can. It just makes me uncomfortable because many people’s parents work really well paying jobs, and it makes me feel inferior. 

Im very insecure about where we live. Many of my close friends already know, but it’s always very nerve wrecking when telling someone new. I can’t hang out with friends often because my dad works on the weekend, and on Friday as well, which are the only days of the week in which I’m not drowning in homework and can allow myself to relax a bit. So when a friend does ask me to hangout, I have to tell them that I don’t have a ride. This inevitably leads to me giving them my address, and them coming to pick me up, and sometimes drop me off. I’m always terrified of what people think of me when they see where I live. I can’t put into words how terrible and anxious it makes me feel. But with my close friends who I feel comfortable with, it’s not that bad. 

I’ve been wanting to take drivers ed classes, get my permit and then license, and then drive on my own. I should be able to take drivers ed this summer, and get my permit and license. But actually driving? My dad says he would have to buy me insurance, which he says is too expensive. I’d also have to have my own car, since I can’t be driving my dads car around. It just seems like whenever there’s something big that I have the desire to do, something family related gets in my way and crushes my dreams. But I really dream of being able to just drive places on my own, and be independent. I also wanted to get some sort of job to earn my own money, but my dad won’t let me because he says it’ll count into his income, and could ruin his plan of getting me a government scholarship.

The thing is, right now I’m actually talking to someone. He is an amazing guy, and I’ve never felt such a connection with anyone before. However, I already know that his family is wealthy. I’ve seen the neighborhood he lives in, with all the fancy big houses and everything. He asked me on a date recently, but I had to say no for the moment due to me being sick. But once I get better, obviously we’re gonna go out together! The problem is that I feel very insecure about the whole money thing. I feel like he might have to give me a ride during our date, since my dad works on weekends. This means that I’d have to give him my address. Then his parents and him would know and see where I live. Ahhhh. I can’t describe how terrible it makes me feel. What would they think? What would he think? :( 

With my ex, it wasn’t as stressful because his family was also not the wealthiest, so I actually felt fine with him knowing where I live, and coming over to my house and whatnot. But my new partner? He is high class, and I can’t imagine what he and his family would think of me. Just thinking about it makes me sick to the stomach and makes me wanna cry. I can’t avoid it forever, since when the day that we do have our date I’d probably be forced into giving him my address. And god, I dread that so much. I feel so lost, I don’t know what to do. I genuinely really like this guy, and I really want to go out with him, but what would he think? I feel awful. He was the one who asked me out, and it seems that he really likes me. I really like him too. But I feel like such a disaster ;(

I guess that I just had to get that off my chest. I feel a little better now that I’ve typed it all out. But it still doesn’t fix all my problems, but that’s okay. I’m just currently very stressed about the whole date situation. I have no idea what to do, and thinking about it makes me feel like I can’t breathe.",22Feb2020,1
134,"My BF (32 M) and I (25 f) have been dating 10 months. He is Iranian and so there are def some cultural differences. I am open minded and am attracted go middle eastern men, so there. 

He is sweet. But sometimes things he says don't add up. Like he started pulling out before completion (with protection) and when I asked him why he is doing that now he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about, saying ""I've always done this"". I confronted him about this later and he said ""oh I said that? I shouldn't have said that."" Weird. 

Also he hasn't gone down on me in months. I haven't said anything bc I didn't really mind. I go down on him almost every time even when I don't feel like it. Today I asked him to after he told me to blow him and he would only use his hands even though I told him to use his tongue. 

I asked him why and he said that once guys cum they stop being turned on and he wasn't feeling it so he didn't feel like licking it. He said this is a common occurence in males and I should know this. 

I googled it and nothing showed. I told him this and he says ""ah, so you google things often?"" I told him well yeah I think it doesn't line up that I have not heard of this before and I'm not seeing thing occurence on google. He goes ""so you don't trust me?""

He isn't even offering an explanation. 

Also he told me while we were laying there after I pretended to get myself off (sad I know) that laziness is a turn off and that living with me has been a difficult adjustment because he likes to work out and eat healthy (which I normally do) but i haven't been, and it is difficult for him because if we are living together we should be on the same page.

I explained I would love to workout but school and work (I work FT and am in a challenging grad program PT) and this semester has been challenging and honestly taking up all my time. Plus I'm in the middle of planning my trip abroad in a couple weeks and that has been keeping me busy. But I agree I need to take better care of myself so this summer I'm hopefully going to be working and better paying job so I don't have to work as often. 

He then starts going on about how it will look bad on my resume and it won't be all its cracked up to be. 


Wtf. I was very understanding, trying to understand his point, but looking back I feel like a big dumb idiot. 

I get I should be working out and eating healthier (not like I'm eating horribly) but right now I am adjustinf to a rigorous program while working FT and planning a trip. Hes like ""ok ok I just care about you"". 

Part of me is getting tired of this shit and thinks maybe I should take a break from him or leave him. The other part thinks ""other than his inconsistencies in some of his stories he is right.""

138,"So normally I'd be fine with going solo on a group activity, I normally do most of the work anyway.

But this is different

This class is a 'seminar' course for newly enrolled teaching students to make sure they really want to do it. You get assigned to a middle school class to observe a few times and then you teach a quick lesson over the course of a few days. The lesson is more or less laid out for you, I have to teach these kids to make a top, but before that introduce the variables that effect a top so they can make a good one. You still have to write out the actual lesson plan and make a power point yourself. On top of that you have to do write ups after your observations.

Now I was honestly stoked at first. The lesson is in my subject area, physics; the school is my old middle school; and the teacher I'm with is my old science teacher to boot. Also I could maybe use my old Beyblades as an engagement tool.

Now there is an insane amount of standardized buzz words and the structure of the lesson plans is super restrictive because 6th graders in America. I'm super not about that kinda stuff, despite being REALLY good at planning to talk about physics and actually talking about physics I can't use any of the free form planning structure I like because 6th graders in America. On top of that the work of coordinating with the teacher, writing the plan, and making the power point is supposed to be split up between 2 to 3 people. 

""At least I'll have a partner, that would make things better for once,"" I thought. I'd have someone to bounce ideas off of and help with the work load since I hate making power points and can't write without casual tone unless it's a lab report or literary analysis. Also I'm a super senior so I have a bunch of other work to do for other classes. However, there's another physicist in the class so I thought I was set.

But I get food poisoning and am out sick the day they put the groups together. They stick me with the one other person absent out of convenience, who also happened to be a science major, but not a physics major. I could have easily been in a group with the other physics major, but they put her in a group of 3 have gave them a bio lesson. The times and days for observations/teaching got locked in too. So they send the basic lesson outline, again it's basically the mechanics of top, basic 1st and 2nd laws of motion. 

The day I missed was a Wednesday, and this is a Mon/Wed class. So I come in on Monday ready to do a quick run through of the first part of the lesson I'll be teaching, basically spinning different tops of different designs to understand the different effects of the variables. Everyone else sits in there groups and I'm...

Alone. My partner is a no show

I suddenly remember all the times a had to work alone on group projects in middle school and high school. 

Before I could comprehend the looming sense of dread one of the two professors running the class tells me my partner actually might be out for the rest of the semester due to family issues.

The professors start talking about all the micromanagement stuff we have to do for this lesson that I mentioned above, but in greater detail. I have to write in things I barley understand on the sample lesson plan. ""It would help if I had someone to bounce things off of,"" I thought. We also have to fill out official volunteer forms and do an easy little quiz for certification.

I feel a hole open in my soul as I realize that I'm basically stuck alone in the last group project you'd want to be alone in. I'm in a daze as I work through the assignment. The one professor helps me a little at first, but all the other groups draw their focus. 

I feel like Billy Pilgrim from Slaughterhouse 5. In one eye I'm spinning tops by myself in a college class, while in the other I'm writing a conversation I'll have to have with myself in 7th grade Spanish. Both eyes are on the verge of being on the verge of tears.

I do the lesson plan assignment on Tuesday, I have no idea what I'm actually doing. I should be looking at the stuff I have, the lesson itself, the worksheets, but I'm not, I didn't even think that was an option. 

I fill out the forms and complete the quiz on Wednesday before class. The other physics major is in the physics lounge. We have a small chat, she laments having to do a bio lesson, I talk about using Super Smash Bros Melee's physics and its exploits to give fun context to friction and gravity. She tells she wishes she had a teacher like me in high school.

Once again I sit alone in class. Once again the same professor says she hadn't heard anything from my partner, to be expected. She says she'll be helping me out since I'm alone. Say that we'll work on it some more after class and that I might only give 2 lessons not 3, how that helps I'm not sure. At first she helps me make sense of the lesson plan and the structuring of questions, but then quickly gets wrapped up in helping the other science group. 

The other professor doesn't even try to help me make better sense of the lesson plan. She's there for the math groups, after she was a math teacher before she was a doctor.

I stare at the lesson plan, knowing that I'll have to make a basic power point for it by Sunday, but stuck on figuring out how I'm going to do this alone. All of these steps are graded and I need to do well in this class, I need to do well in all my classes, well enough to hold a 3.0 GPA to stay in this teaching program. 

Everything went great last semester, I got all A's. I technically should have taken this last semester, but no one from the teaching program came to see me at orientation before last semester so I signed up for some physics classes and the remaining core classes I needed. I was transferring from the local community college. I had struggled will depression the whole time I was there and during that depression found purpose in wanting to become a teacher.

I'm watching my passion for being a teacher is struck by a tidal wave doubt in slow motion. I'm on the verge of being on the verge of tears.

All of this is on my mind as I leave the class. The professor who was supposed to help me didn't say anything as I left. Half of me thinks she forgot while helping the other students, the other half thinks these professors expect me to drop the class given the circumstances.

I'm going to do my best on the power point, but I'm going into my first observation on Tuesday knowing full well that if this class of 6th graders is too rowdy or what have you I'll have to drop the class.

But when we were seeing each other, there was no ""vibe"", i'm kinda slow to open to people so it may be my fault... anyways, after that failed ""almost relationship"", I told myself that if a girl like that could NOT be the girl of my life, then no one could. I'm kinda stuck on that and feel terrible since then.

146,"This post is mostly to get my thoughts out, but any feedback is welcome.

I have a hard time being alone. I have been cut off from my family and friends, and apart from my intensely stressful job, do not interact with other adults. It's quite lonely. 

When given the opportunity to get back with my ex, I did inspire of an abusive and mentally unhealthy past.  He's never been diagnosed by a professional, but basically he violently flips out at random times without provocation.

Weirdly, that's not what bothers me. My biggest issue is that he's just garden-variety crappy. He insists we limit seeing eachother to once a week though we live within walking distance. He hates leaving the house, and is mostly on his computer or tv the whole time we're around eachother.  He's not interested in my life outside of him, and isn't affectionate (no lovey stuff, no dates, no texts or calls, no gifts, no celebrations, no acts of love, no future talk, and he forgets about me a lot). He's won't tell his family or friends about me because, in his words, they hate me. 

So, obviously, this has got to end, right? Its not real. For 6/7 of the week, I have this totally separate and lonely life that he is disinterested and uninvolved in.  The thing is, I *chose* this because of how horrible it was to be alone 7/7th of the week. I let him come back, knowing all of the above. 

I guess I'm just treading water until I get the courage enough to really end it.  This blows, but it may be as good as it gets.",22Feb2020,1
147,"I miss the says when grades were sent out on cards every quarter and parents didn't think they needed to constantly control what goes on in classrooms (before cell phones and online grade books)...the days when parents would confront their child before ever automatically tearing into a teacher.

Due to the sub-par submissions, I decided to have the students do an alternative assignment on the same subject that would reinforce, to me, their understanding of the topic. Before hearing about why or that this was actually a beneficial opportunity, I had outraged parents who had just received a text from their child who felt they were being terribly mistreated, breathing down my throat. 
As a teacher, I believe that part of our job is to push students to be better and challenge them to achieve greater things, and instead of giving grades based on the presentations, I gave them the chance to excell and time to do so. Is seems that nowdays, if a student goes and complains to their parents that a teacher is being unfair in their eyes, the parents will automatically and immediately bear down on the administration, who will automatically  reprimand the teacher for doing their job and providing students with a chance to redeem themselves.

Enough is enough! When students and parents know enough about how to create and grade assignments, there really will be no more need for teachers, but at the moment, that is not the case, so students: before going ballistic on your teacher and calling on your parents, open your minds to the fact that your teacher *might* know what they are doing and have reason for it. Listening goes a long way. 
Parents: before going ballistic on the teachers who have trained for a number of years to be where they are in a thankless job and who do care about the best interests of your child or they wouldn't do what they do, take some time to ask nicely, if you must. Don't accuse and be outraged without knowing the whole story, which is likely not to come from your child. Reflect with your child and make sure they have a really solid reason to complain.
Teachers are not out to see your child fail...give us the benefit of the doubt when it comes how we conduct things in our academic realms. We are experts in our areas. Let the educational system do what it does best. We don't interfere in how you do your job.

Life will be unkind, it will beat you down, and make you feel like you will never make it out alive. I wish I could say that you will come out on the other end unscathed but you won’t. You’ll be hardened, you’ll become ruthless, and you’ll take pride in it. Your beauty and sexuality are going to be confusing, you’ll be self loathing and narcissistic all in one. You will grow up around men who prey on your vulnerability and take advantage of it. I need you to know, you are so much more than the curves of your body and the symmetry of your face. 

You will try to convince yourself you need no one, but you do, no matter how hard you try to make yourself believe. There will be one man in particular who changes your life. He will try to make you see all the beauty and love within yourself, but you’ll fight back. You’ll question all his intentions, you’ll wonder how someone can love someone so scarred, and damaged. In all of this, you’ll hurt him, and feel justified in it. You hurt before you can be hurt, I promise, it’s no way to live life. You’ll almost lose the person who has loved you the fiercest and fought the hardest for you. 

I know you made the promise to yourself to never have children, you want to break the cycle of your childhood, but surprise, you’ll have three in three years. You’ll constantly feel like you are breaking them, ruining them, and like you are not enough, but the way they worship you will heal your soul in more ways than you will ever know. Mothering will be exhausting and sometimes you’ll wonder why you didn’t stick to your promise but they keep you grounded. They will be your sun and stars, the reason you fight so hard to be stronger, braver, and better. 

As I write this to you, you are now in your 30’s, you are sick and tired of being sick and tired. It’s time, to take your life back, and to not live your life based on your tragedies. It is not who you are, it is what happened to you. You were a child, stop blaming yourself, stop taking responsibility, for the actions of those who hurt you. They were the adults, you were the child. 

Give yourself kindness, show yourself love, and be proactive about changing who you are. We deserve it.",22Feb2020,1

151,"This just happened yesterday and I felt like sharing it somewhere so I made an account after years of just browsing. 
Obligatory ""I'm on mobile, sorry for the mistakes"" disclaimer and,  ""I don't know if this belongs here"" line. 
On with the post!

So I have been going to this local Chinese food place for the last few months now because there food is amazing (it's not oily like other places I've tried locally) and the lady who owns it is just the sweetest person. She calls me ""baby"" even though she knows my name. :)
So yesterday I went and got some food after work.  I asked her to give me whatever she thought was good since I wanted to try something different than what I normally order. She hummed, looked at the food and said,  ""everything good.""
She then proceeded to GIVE ME A SCOOP OF EVERYTHING! She couldn't even close the lid on the styrofoam container it wad so full. 

Now I was paying and I had a $20 in my wallet so I paid with my card and put the $20 in the tip jar and went to sit down to eat. $20 seemed fair to me. She gave me so much food and is a really nice person. Whatever. I thought it was fine.
Once I'm eating (Everything tasted AMAZING btw) I see the lady go and clean some tables before she goes to the tip jar,  opens it, grabs something and MARCH over to my table holding out her hands with the $20 grasped between her fingers and objecting,  ""No! It too much, baby! Too much!""
While she is shoving  it into my hands.
I try to give it back,  ""no, it's not too much. Keep it. I want you to have it."" 
But she shoves it under my tray and says, ""tomorrow, baby.  Use it for food tomorrow.""
And then brings me a menu, points to something and says, ""order this, okay baby?."" Then goes back to take care of the customers who had walked in watching this go down.
So I'm going to go back today for dinner and I'm gonna get what she asked me to order using the $20 tip she returned. The order will only be like $9 so I plan on giving her the change as a tip.

I was just kind of shocked that she returned a $20 tip. Like,  any other place I've gone to and tipped above a $10 they don't even care and still give the same dry,  ""thank you,  ma'am"" they would if I gave 10 cents.

Anyway,  thank you for reading this.  I'm off to go get some noodles. :))",22Feb2020,1

157,"I don’t think I can handle this anymore. But I go on here because there are no people in my life who I can talk to about this. And even if they did they wouldn’t understand or feel uncomfortable. So here goes. I’ve had the worst eating and sleeping schedules, always feeling tired because of it. School and work don’t help at all, they just exacerbate this. I’m tired right now at the writing of this post and heading to work, yay. Anyways at school, I’m in something called the International Baccalaureate (IB) and it’s basically a more rigorous program for students who like a challenge. I signed up for it thinking that it was gonna be a good way to push myself but boy was I wrong. This thing has been consuming my time, energy, and ability to maintain relationships between people. I’ve felt very stressed and sad because of it. It’s been affecting my eating and sleeping schedule tremendously, preventing me from eating breakfast and lunch, making me stay up at 1:00am on average. And my teachers don’t help much either. They tell me how I should be on top of their work but when you have 7 classes to worry about, how should I do them all when I have to worry about projects in each of them. And then I’ll get reprimanded for not doing a project from a certain class. Not only do I have to worry about all this, but I have to worry about work which takes away time from me. I’m earning cash but it takes away potential time I could’ve spent on classwork. The expectations that I have from people don’t help either. They (friends and family) always expect perfection and accuracy from me and anything less is shunned or chastised and I can only do so much before I break down. And the fact that no one understands what I’m going through, or is there for me makes it even harder. I fake my happiness at school, making people laugh. When I get home I realize that people only see me as the guy who makes people laugh, nothing more. Has anyone asked me “Hey, how are you doing?” or offered some emotional support. Haha No. And the worst part is if I actually stop talking to people and making them laugh, no will give a shit about me, I know because I’ve tried that before. So I feel alone now, I’ll feel more alone if I start sulking because no one will care. And even writing this feels pointless and a waste of time but I guess this is more for myself than anyone else right? I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but I feel each day they become stronger. They say suicide isn’t the answer to a temporary problem but how long is temporary then? But if I did kill myself one day, I just want to leave the impression of being a good person with everyone. Just because I feel fucking worthless doesn’t mean I should act like a POS. I’ve never attempted to commit suicide but I always do wonder how easy it is to just jump in front of that car. I’ve posted about feeling sad before, but now I feel like ending it all, especially since no one cares. Should I even be listening to anyone? Or is that just my brain messing with telling me with that? Should I even be allowed to feel this way because other people have it worse? I don’t know, but ending it all would finally take me away from all this. Everyday I consider it more and more. I get times where I just really feel like doing it. Why should I have to suffer? Why can’t anyone help? I feel like crying now so bye. I’ll probably delete this soon.",22Feb2020,1
