0,"\[Disclaimer\] The important part I want to note and be seen most is at the ""\*"" icon towards the bottom.

**\[tl/dr\]** \- Like many others I have some social anxiety. I'm also a bit of a people pleaser and could have stronger boundaries for myself. I have it most bad for the fear of bothering others. I'm too afraid to text first or initiate conversations because of fear of annoying. Can you relate or help me?  

I wouldn't say I'm a people pleaser to the point of it being too much of a bad thing, because I'm not afraid to be assertive, say no, disagree, speak-up, or hold my own ...nor am I afraid of confrontation; but I do however know that I'm hyper-sensitive to other people' emotions, feelings, and experiences when interacting with me. 

I make it a point to listen carefully and be polite; and when I'm in a group and notice someone is being spoken-over or under-heard, I smoothly let them know that I heard them and will secretly manipulate and control the group in a way to allow them the chance to talk and be heard. I will also laugh at a joke or comment that others didn't hear to make the other person feel better. I'm also known in my friend circle and as commented on by others as ""the listener,"" because I will devote undivided attention to others when they're venting to me about their problems, thoughts, or experiences. I'm a great listener because I remember details really well that even the person who said them won't remember telling me ...anyways  

In addition, I'm quite a helpful person and will go out of my way to help someone in need whether it be favors or a listening ear. I like to help others, not only because of selfish pride, reputation, or image, but because I'd like to be helped myself in that situation and I care for other people (for the most part.) At times though, it can get irritating and annoying when you're constantly being asked for help or being subject to a bunch of drama and being the shoulder to cry on when you want time for yourself. 

**\*** **The thing I want to point out mostly is:** I get really anxious when calling someone or texting them (first.) I'm always worried that I'm annoying them and bothering them for texting them, talking to them, or trying to get a hold of them. I always fear that it is an inconvenient time or boring/annoying conversation for the recipient - and I can never tell for sure if they're being nice or genuinely enjoying the talk. For this reason and because of my anxiety, I'm usually very brief in texting or calls I initiate first - actually, I rarely ever text first, obviously especially not around typical dinner times or bed times for people. I also make sure my conversation is entertaining or important. I know people that will text anything at anytime - should I be more like that person or nah?  

Overall, I feel that my ways are negatively affecting my social skills and self boundaries. I do these things because of empathy, because I know that I don't like being spoken-over, under-heard, un-helped, not having someone to vent to, or being annoyed by boring text conversations when I'm busy doing other things. I'm actually very introverted and reclusive myself. 

Should I open up more? Should I be bolder and more careless and less picky about my interactions? Should I rather text first more often about what I want to say or is on my mind rather than not texting at all because of fear? Or are my worries and actions a normal part of navigating the social world?",20Apr2020,1

10,"I've made posts about this before and some of you may have seen it. If not I'll fill you in. My mom told me and my two sisters that if we clean the house she'll buy us Animal Crossing. I was super excited to finally play it, and I didn't really mind sharing. My sisters, however, did, and that book was quickly closed. Normally I would have moved on if my mom just never even mentioned getting it, but the fact she committed to buying it made me think there was still a chance, if not for the three of us, then for myself. A few days later I tried convincing my sisters again before following through with this, and was once again met with ""it's a single player game, we won't be able to agree on things."" So now my only chance to ever play this was to try and get it for myself. Selfish, I know, I'm not usually like this, but I was determined. After all, they did say it's a single player game, and I'm the one who asked for the switch as a family gift, and I'm the only one who really plays on it, so I have the higher ground. Negotiating with my parents is tough, and I didn't want my sisters butting in, so I had to find the perfect time to pop the question. It was as if it was my destiny. The eldest sister left for the day, and my other sister was in the shower, and my parents were in a good mood after eating lunch. I had kinda already accepted that it could flop, but it was my last opportunity. I offered a deal they couldn't refuse. I said I would but it with my own money, and clean the entire kitchen as well as keep the floor tidy and do dishes. It went amazingly well, and on top of that, my mom mentioned she hadn't yet got me a birthday present and would buy it with her money anyways, and only made me have to tidy floors and put up dishes! Everything was perfect, but..... what will I tell my sisters? I'm not in the wrong, I followed by their rules but it feels like I betrayed them. I feel like if we get into another fight my mom will call off the deal. It COULD be a secret, but then again what if they try to buy it themselves with their money, not knowing I already have it, and they get super pissed. My mom ordered it this morning, my sisters still don't know, and it's coming on Thursday. What do I do? Eventually they'll find out somehow and they'll get into a huge argument with my parents about how they love me more than them, even though they could've pulled off the same stunt.

11,"So for years now the world has been living with the light shining down on the USA like its the greatest thing ever, the best movies, the best army, the best people on the planet, screaming MURICA!! Whenever possible, like its the one thing everyone in the world wished they could be; living as an american.

Time after time in so many videos, pictures, memes, shows ect... it has always been shoved down the rest of the worlds throats that ""america is the center of attention and they are the best"".

Then this pandemic hits and its like this giant shell armor that the USA has been living under was suddenly lifted and exposed to be a very weak and fragile thing the entire time.

Politicians making billions of sick people, selling stocks, profiting off the situation, throwing its people under the bus, stepping on heads to get to the top.

The american population has been thrown to the mercy of its corrupt politicians and those politicians are currently giving its people the ""balls deep anal ritual"" and thats not the worst part about it.

The worst part is that the american population will complain, but they will also keep taking it and keep dying from negligence from its leaders without ever actually making them take accountability for their actions.

This coming from a country with so many guns and advocating for ""freedom"" im surprised the american people will let themselves just be played like this - but i guess its easier to hide behind fast food and a shitty stimulus check while the big corporations take the tax payers money and laugh their asses off at the rest of its population know they wont do anything about it.

Im just very happy to not be living in the USA right now, because i would be beyond pissed with the way its leader has been profiting off the situation and making it worse, instead of being there for the people and trying to help.

To all my american neighbors, i truly truly truly wish you guys the best and you definitely deserve better, i hope you can all pull through this with the real american values you all know and grew up with - and not this bullshit corrupt politician clown rodeo that has been feeding y'all.

I love you guys and im rooting for the middle class/poor population. You guys got this; not your president.",20Apr2020,1
12,"&amp;#x200B;

So being a human being, it’s completely natural to have flaws of some kind, everyone has something wrong with them. For me, some of the things that I think and do would shatter my relationships with everyone I know. I’ll list a few and go as in-depth as I can.

One of, if not the main thing that I am most worried about is my obsession with death and murder. Now, I know a few people who have a morbid curiosity about death and watch videos of people dying in stuff like movies and shows occasionally. But with me, I actively watch videos of people being cut up, gunned down, burned alive, for fun. Watching people being killed or tortured gives me a slight sense of relaxation, and I’ve often fantasised about being in a Bonnie &amp; Clyde situation where I murder people with a person who accepts me for my flaws. Since I’ve kept it in for so long, I’ve resorted to cutting myself, for the feeling of cutting myself, and if my parents found out about all this shit, I fear they’d send me to some Christian camp or an insane asylum.

Another, much less morbid thing is that I am afraid of coming out to my parents as bisexual. Coming out always is a scary and significant part of someone’s life, and many families support their children when they do. However, my parents are hardcore Christians. They believe that homosexuality is purely a convoluted sexual desire and that I would go to hell for even thinking of being with the same sex. I’ve already told a few of my cousins, who aren’t disgusted by it, and they support me fully. I feel like if I told my parents, they would disown me or have me meet with the pastor of the church to rid me of the “sin” and have a desire for the opposite sex. And if they kicked me out, I wouldn’t know where to go or how to keep going.

Now with this next one, it isn’t as secret or dark as the other two, but it still affects me negatively. I don’t really feel any love toward anyone. Almost my entire family would probably hate me if I mentioned all the things before but with this, it would seal the deal. Throughout my life, I haven’t really felt any attraction toward anyone that I know. If someone asked me “Hey, do you love your family?” I would respond no because I just don’t feel like I have truly “loved” anyone. I view the relationship with my family as more of a “friend” relationship than full-on love. Last summer, I was pressured into asking a girl whom I was friends with, out. And after I did, I realized that since I’ve never felt attraction towards anyone, I would be alone for the rest of my life, and those thoughts developed into me being obsessed about finding or receiving love, to the point where I would lie to people about being depressed, anorexic, and suicidal, just so I could have someone care for me. I still feel lonely from time to time, and I feel like I’m on an endless trek to hopefully find someone who I can truly love for the first time. Who accepts me for who I am, who won’t ridicule and abandon.

As of now, I’m struggling with the dilemma of just telling my friends about the death obsession and the other lesser things that I deal with so that I can rid my soul of the locked chest and hopefully be free.",20Apr2020,1
13,"Art art art. It’s the main thing I really cared about. I just had this big focus to improve myself and get better at art.

I beat my long term depression, finally became an optimistic person, slowly getting better at socializing, and finally started to love myself. Once I move out soon it’ll all only be uphill from there, so with most of my self improvement out of the way... I’m not so focused on myself anymore...

It’s slowly been building up before now, liking girls again, wanting sex. I still had those periods where I’m like “nah, I don’t really need them”. But now those wants just exploded like I dived headfirst back into puberty.

I’m nervous around girls again, I keep checking out girls way more than I usually do, and boy oh boy does a relationship sound amazing right now.

But I spent so long ironing out my flaws, that I have zero idea on how to get a girlfriend outside of Tinder. If I were in college, maybe it’d be simpler, but since I’m not and the worlds on pause. I can’t do anything, I can’t even try to ask girls out and learn from my mistakes. And I’m trying my hardest not to go for the cute girls at work, it’s tempting, but I know that causes drama even if it’s just retail.

Ugh damn it, I didn’t realize just how alone I was till now. 

Especially with the girl I thought I had something with for months telling me that we were friends. Big misunderstanding I guess, but it really felt like we were something you know. Always flirting, going to sleep on the phone with each other, talking about stuff long distance partners would talk about like what we’d do when we were together.

Ho boy, if I wasn’t so iffy about relationships, I could be dating right now, if I didn’t think sex was gross for a while, I’d have a FWB at least to help me calm down. But no, I screwed up every chance I’ve had. So many girls that legitimately liked me and I turned away because I was too scared to jump into a relationship.

16,"  I’m a guy. Iv been working voluntary in a charity shop and there was an older lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam me and Sam  were tagging clothes about 10ft apart ...anyway they were asking how old we were: 

🔹Sue: I’m 48

◾️Sam: *bubbly points up to the air* I’m 31

🔹Sue: *looks over at me* how old are you? 

🔸Me:what? Oh... 29

🔹◾️Sue and Sam : *act surprised* awwwww are yer!?

🔹Sue: when yer birthday?

🔸Me: November 30th 

◾️Sam: *bubbly points up again*  mines 21st

🔹Sue:  oh close birthdays eh....gonna have a litttle birthday bash? *laughing a little*

◾️Sam: (very seriously and abruptly reacts)

reply and quite loud too) (could have been an ewwww) she said it acting all ‘la Di da’ ( snobby) but she’s usually always been really pleasant with me in a friendly person way. And I’m usually very quiet.

She stinks really bad too so the audacity from her to act like that especially that ppl in there rip her behind her back for it yet she stands there very up herself.

17,"As a child I was very smart, like smarter than anyone my age or even anyone few years older, I remember many things like being able to solve any math question the teacher gave us ( my teacher even kept giving me questions on topics that she didn't cover yet for fun and she was always amazed that I always did solve them) and for example a math table in the second grade that we were supposed to fell with the results of the simple equations , after three equations I ended up finding a pattern between the answers(the boxes) and the teacher was shocked when I completed it in no time, I remember having a great imagination and a great ability to memorize anything ( when I was in the first grade my english teacher asked me to read a paragraph but she got busy talking to another teacher for like two minutes, and when she came back to me I had memorized it and read it with the book closed)  and I also memorized anything I heard like a phone number a guy gave at a reception near me or a song I only listened to it once, I remember having imaginary friends that I think with them and visualize and it was so fun, and I was so interested in any knowledge, I liked learning anything in general. There are many stories that I now remember and I'm surprised of how smart I was for my age.


Then at about 13 years old a friend of mine came to me and started talking to me about sex and porn and told me how to masturbate and that it feels great, I  was prepubescent of course and I tried it again and again like so many times a day and after that my grades started to fall and I was not aware of what I'm doing, I lost interest in science and knowledge and was addicted to porn and masturbating, after that years came by and I  have grown up but I always feel that I lost it I lost what I had, I always search for a connection between masturbating as a child and losing brain sells or something, I feel that I could have been a great man with multiple degrees or something, instead I'm currently struggling to finish my business degree after 3 major changes and a lot of failed courses, I feel that I'm dumber than I'm supposed to be and if there is a way to straighten things up and sharpening my mind and motivate myself to go on with my degree and return to be passionate about sciences and things and to work for a bright future please tell me.

It’s not that they don’t do ANYTHING back but they are giving back in a different way than you want or expect. 

I feel like I have a hard time being grateful. I feel like my efforts I give to people are thoughtful and just genuine. 

I plan things and I don’t do last minute stuff because I genuinely care about people so much that I think about their birthday or an event so much and I just want to make it perfect for them. If that makes sense. 

When I really want to make someone feel special, I’ll go above and beyond for them. Or I’ll get them something super thoughtful or I’ll plan a thoughtful surprise. Or just always being there for someone.

34,"After 35 years of marriage to my mom, I accidentally caught my dad cheating with someone he and my mom knew from high school.  I was updating his phone and “she” text him unfolding days of anger, disbelief and investigation... the internet is a beautiful thing.  I found out he had been doing this for nearly a year.  Everything I found was pretty devastating.

The unexpected part and reason for this post is what happened next.  I always saw my dad as an honorable man, respected him and believed in him to do the right thing.  After I investigated and had hard facts, my brother and I asked him to meet with us to talk.  We asked him to tell mom in the next couple of days what he had been doing.  He said he would and told us mom meant the world to him.  

Apparently he was sweating bullets at home and could not get himself to have the talk.  Mom called me saying she was worried about dad. Then he text me asking to meet him, I did.  He was upset I had involved my brother and thought he and I were going to “work things out.” I was not about to hide this from my mother. He then said he feared for my mom’s health and for that reason he would not be telling her about the infidelity. He reassured me from that point on he would be an outstanding husband and he would focus on that.  I told him that was not what we had agreed to do and if he didn’t man up, all my brothers and I would talk to mom. At this point he basically said he did not care what we (his kids) thought of him, everyone makes mistakes and he would learn from this.  THEN he said he realized he had “created a bomb” but we would be responsible for “lighting the fuse” by telling mom and the consequences would be our responsibility.  

At this point I was fuming.  He would not take responsibility for his actions and man up.  I wanted to punch him in the face right there and then.  I was beyond devastated and ultimately crushed by the thought that this man is my father.

He was given 24 hours to man up and talk to his wife or I would do it for him along with my brothers.  He complied, all hell broke lose, etc.. and we all dealt with  it as best we could.

From that point on I can’t help but see him differently.  I feel sad and disappointed that the man I admired for 35+ years is not who I thought he was.  My mother lost a husband that day and I lost my father.  Whenever I see him I’m respectful but I no longer feel anything for him.  Am I exaggerating?  I don’t expect anything from him anymore and I don’t know how to put the thought of “losing my father” behind me.

54,"I've been through shit.

My father was abusive and my mother manipulative. Since I was 16 I worked my ass off in jobs my dad got for me and they took more then half of their money for their own shit. Drugs, alcohol and cigarettes.

On bad days I went to school with clothes smelling like weed or tobacco. I still have scars on my shoulder from glass shards my dad threw me on and I remember the day my mom told me how worthless my success in school was so I would work harder on my job to get more money.

With 17 I started to deal drugs to get more money for myself. My parents didn't know about it. Well a friend of mine dealt them, I was the delivery guy.

It were small amounts of money. 50 to 90 bucks each order. Then my friend got an order for weed worth of 300.

That day on I became Christian and belive that this was my Guardian angel.

A girl two years older than me gave me the money and took the drugs. I later got a call from an unknown number. My friend and partner gave my phone number to the girl who bought the weed.

This was stupid but I was 17 and my friend too. We didn't think about it.

Eventually I started dating this girl. She liked my bad boy attitude. Drug dealing, going against the law, wearing all black and gray. She loved me, and I loved her.

With nineteen the same girl beged me to stop dealing drugs because she was pregnant. I didn't listen and go tuned for two years even after having a great job.

With 21 my second son was on the way. We had serious issues in our relationship, and I had trust issues because my partner just send me to someone  with the wrong pills. I thought that my second son wasn't mine.

I was on the verge of breaking up with her and running away.

I just remember how she one night laid down next to me on the couch and cried. That she didn't want to loose me. That it was my child and that she could never cheat on me.

With 22 my second son was born and he was mine. The looks said it all, a DNA test confirmed it. I believed her but she insisted.

My job boomed. The company I worked for finally showed their products on a trade fair. This lead to an explosive customer income and I got a raise. I became the head of my department. I felt proud. I stopped dealing drugs.

Today I woke up with a rind on my Ringfinger with my wifes name engraved on it. I stood up without waking her up and went out do do some sports.

I came home at 7 am. I looked in the mirror and smiled. I am a married father. I have a successful job and live a good life.

It all changed when she came into my life. I didn't deserve her. She didn't deserve this roller-coaster, but she never left, she stayed with me and begged me not to leave.

I broke down in the bathroom. My wife had to beg a broke drug dealer not to leave her. She studied, she had success from the minute she was born. She had good parents and was a 10/10 in looks. She could be a model or an actress. 

I cried thinking about how someone like her begged me not to leave.

I felt like shit.

I have other types of love in my life. Maybe I’m just not supposed to have romantic love in this lifetime. Not everyone does. 

I’m like averagely attractive. People have been interested in me. But nothings been real. Like REALLY real. 

I don’t even want to have sex anymore because I hate doing it knowing the other person doesn’t give a fuck about me. Which sucks cause I want to have sex but not with someone who doesn’t care. 

When people are interested in me, it’s almost always exclusively for sex. I don’t even understand why. I don’t give off that vibe. I don’t act sexual outside of intimate relationships.

(This is my first time posting and my first time ever really using reddit, so please bare with me.)


Ever since quarantine and social distancing started, me and my friends for around 5-7 years have fought over a big misunderstanding.

Basically my 2 ex-friends didn’t approve of me liking our mutual friend’s ex-crush. Even though I talked to our mutual friend if it would be alright for me to pursue her former crush, she supported me and gave me her best wishes. However my two (now former) friends told me to not believe what she said since it’ll hurt her ego. So when our mutual friend came up to me about her problems, she opened up on how she was disappointed in me for not telling her about how I could possibly like her former crush sooner and later on, mentioned my former friend’s name in disappointment. I took that as an opportunity to ask her if what they said about her was true (since I really didn’t want to hurt her feelings and wanted to really make sure). I did tell her beforehand that I didn’t mention them and what they said out of spite or whatsoever, I just wanted to know if that’s how she would feel (since they knew her so well as much I did). I realized that what I said hurt her and I kinda regretted saying it (even if I didn’t mean to hurt anyone).

Don’t get me wrong, I did realize the gravity of my words once I said it, so I did say sorry. I know people might say that I should’ve just trusted her, and you all have a valid point. I could’ve just let them say what they wanted to say and just trust her word. But I didn’t, because of the fact that I was worried that what they said might’ve been how she really felt. I know maybe telling her wasn’t really the optimal choice, but at the moment, I felt like I wanted to be honest and know where everybody stood in the situation, most especially my friend’s feelings towards her former crush. 

Eventually, I told one of my former friends about me telling our mutual friend about what they said since I wanted to reaffirm them that our mutual friend is okay with it and that what they said about her ego and feelings won’t get hurt. However, it became some misunderstanding that apparently, I wanted to cause drama wherein they thought that I wanted our mutual friend to confront them about they said about her and her ego (TAKE NOTE: these ex-friends of mine REALLY value our mutual friend’s judgment on them... It’s always been like this since high school... unhealthy I know). 

Ex-friend 1 and I talked, and I said sorry for everything that might’ve offended them and we were okay (but things changed when ex-friend 1 talked to ex-friend 2). 

Apparently ex-friend 2 asked for info from our mutual friend about our conversation beforehand, and because our mutual friend can be neutral, she said things in a “as-a-matter-of-fact way” (she left out personal stuff she told me since mutual friend said so herself that she trusts me more than she trusts ex-friend 2). And because of what she said and how much she left out, ex-friend 2 thought I lied about my intentions, that I said what they told me so that I can apparently get our mutual friend to look at them in a bad light or as the “bad guys”. Which was never even my intention in the first place!

Basically both of my former friends were talking and thinking that I conspired for our mutual friend to basically hate them. And I’m really hurt and so frustrated by it. We’re growing up, we’re no longer in high school... yet why does it feel like we never left? 

I know I’m not perfect, and I know that I could’ve just kept quiet. Maybe some things are truly better off unsaid. Yet at the time, I really wanted to be an honest person, with no spite towards anyone. It just hurts me how the people I thought who knew me the most, can see me as someone I’m not.

This hasn’t been the first time they misunderstood me and my actions, and heck, maybe this was a sign that they’re toxic friends? I just felt like I gave so much love to them, didn’t get mad at them for misunderstanding me and gave them the benefit of the doubt for many times already, yet only for them to take it for granted when they wanted to. 

Now both of them have not talked to me, they unfollowed me and I just decided to deactivate since this problem + more personal stuff have been really affecting my mental health. As for my mutual friend, I know she technically didn’t do anything wrong, but I decided that maybe it’s best if I just didn’t talk to her too (I will talk to her again eventually) to avoid further misunderstandings. I know it’s unfair that I’m probably not talking to her, I feel bad about it too, but I feel like if I’m not comfortable talking to her, knowing that she’s talking to them... Idk I might suddenly say something that could cause an issue unintentionally (TAKE NOTE 2: me and my mutual friend also had a big falling out in high school, but we slowly repaired that since the beginning of college almost 2 years ago. I started to trust her again recently but this issue is making me feel like I can’t trust anyone).

If you read this far, THANK YOU. I just really wanted to get this off my chest. And if anyone could give me any kind of advice, it would be very much appreciated.",20Apr2020,1
67,"It’s not like I’m gonna pin up a picture of covid-19 and curse at it every time I tuck in, I can’t control viruses.

I’m 15, and lately I’ve been working on myself quite often, becoming more independent. About a year ago, I had a petty fight with a best friend over a silly ex, and I also had to bid farewell to the rest of his friend group. After that, I swore not to get close to anyone too much. I half expected that. Being someone who latches on and off friend groups quickly. Didn’t seem to matter even though they were the ones up to that point whom I’d spent the longest with. Luckily I had two trustworthy friends who picked me up into their group. I guess you could say I liked them, they were nerdy and introverted (&lt;3 you guys btw) and they were adding an odd number to the group. For the remainder of the school year (Gr. 9 to present Gr. 10) I fit in really well. I used to be introverted, I played video games every hour in those days. Even with my electric behaviour I guess you could say I stuck in well with them. For now, I thought.

(Short tearing up break) 

During the grade 9 farewell it might have been one of my favourite days ever. They treated me like a human, and when I asked them about why they even keep me around one of them I didn’t know much said he felt like I fit in. It yanked my heart a bit to say the least. I keep a photo of them in a frame on my desk. 

In this time my family haven’t been doing too well financially. My dad got paid off from his work probably two weeks before corona became serious (he’s above 65) and naturally employers probably just dumped his resumes. When my parents told me they had decided to move to penticton, (B.C.) where our vacation house was I midway through the conversation put on my shoes and went out the door. 

I just started running. 

Some people were outside due to the mice weather and everyone staying inside, but I didn’t really care. I felt like I was in a trance so I kept going. I must have ran for an hour and a half until I stopped at my school. So many memories went through my head during that time so I just sat on the playground for another hour. Obviously I was being a little over dramatic so I went home. My family was upstairs so I just went to bed. 

Im moving to Penticton in a month, (I’m here just now) and my friends are getting a little suspicious of my distant behaviour. I wouldn’t mind moving on, I still talk to them now but I’ve kept this secret from them for so long. The hard part is just that I wouldn’t mind doing this to myself, I can’t stand doing it to them who’ve 
never done anything to me but change me.",20Apr2020,1
68,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.

I love photography and writing but part of me is like, do I really wanna put in work to maybe not make anything come from it and just be struggling my entire life? And then in turn, end up just absolutely hating and resenting two things I absolutely love doing without the pressure that comes with it all? I know that sounds so pessimistic and maybe even a bit lazy on my end, but I just want a secure job. I again, hate to say that, because I’ve always said I want to be my own boss as well. I feel stuck in this mundane, day to day bullshit. I hate working for assholes. Right now it’s been nice because of the time off from Corona and I don’t wake up feeling absolutely miserable. I feel like if I just had stability in my life it would make things feel so much better. I don’t even need to be rich, I truly just want stability and to be able to buy nice things, travel a few times out of the year, possibly a work from home type of gig for that kind of freedom, maybe just post up on a beach or in the Rockies with a laptop, who knows. I just want to  truly take care of myself financially but also not have a job I’ll hate. I’m sick of living paycheck to paycheck but part of me feels stuck bc it’s like “Do I follow society, go back to school, end up working for some asshole and end up hating my job even though I’ve got money?” Or “Do I just risk it all for my passions?

I’ve strongly considered web development or some kind of coding job, but I feel I’m not smart enough for those either. They’re intriguing to me though. Idk, just need to get that out I guess and see who else maybe felt like this. We live in the golden age of technology right now and it’s like what is one to do with all of these options?",20Apr2020,1
81," 

&gt;I  think my brother is a sociopath, he's 13. He constantly says he's the   absolute greatest. The smartest person to step in his school. He's   impulsive and has stabbed people with pencils and sent a boy to the ER   as he slammed his head in a wall. He never felt bad for any of it. I   told him my friends ex tried to kill herself. He said I would've said   try again. He's beat students with sticks. Threatened to kill them and   much darker things like cutting their skin off and making them a coat.   He can also be charming and is actually gifted. He has manipulated   people, ruined relationships, etc. One time a boy was copying my brother   on a test, so my brother convinced him to spend 100+ dollars and made   him lose it all.  
&gt;  
&gt;He  managed to lie to my mom about his relationship with  a girl  completely, he managed to convince my mom that they were  talking. That  same day he threatened to kill her. Lying comes easy to  him. He even  mocked a girl about her suicidal attempts and mocked  another about her  dead sister. He keeps files on people in the schools  to know their  weakness. He is emotionless really, at our dads funeral he  didn't shed  one tear. None. He's obsessed with power and money. His  girlfriend  broke up with him and didn't feel a thing.  
&gt;  
&gt;He  tried to date a  girl to steal her popularity and even started sports  to ""blend in"" so  he can become popular and manipulate people easier.  He's smart probably  has an IQ or 130+. All of his teachers love him. He  doesn't like people.  A guy was talking bad about him. So he told me  he's currently  planning  to convince the guys girlfriend to break up  with him. Then get with  her, sleep with her and send him a pic. He  already convinced the girl to  breakup with him by eavesdropping and  finding his Snapchat password,  also finding out he was cheating. So he  managed to give it to the guy's  girlfriend in a way that wasn't so  obvious.",20Apr2020,1

84,"Life has just been so stressful lately. I recently moved to the UK as part of the U.S military and it's my first base. I got married over Christmas time but I've only actually seen my wife for 3 and a half weeks worth of time since September when I went to basic. I got to my base right before UK lockdown happened and I'm not really working right now. My wife was originally supposed to come with me in June when she finished up schooling and I thought I'd be fine until then because I'd just make friends that I work with. Well now the only in person social interaction I get is a couple hours for a week once a month when I go into work which is only with my supervisor who I can't seem to really make a personal connection with anyway. I don't want to say I'm depressed but I just feel really down in the dumps.

One good thing I've had is that I was able to move out of the hotel I was staying in and into my actual apartment/flat. It's a really nice one too. It's right across from a town center and it has heated floors, built appliances, big outdoor balcony, and just a penthouse type vibe. It really is a nice place but it's just me here by myself. I drink most nights. I don't get blackout drunk but I definitely put on a good buzz until I go to sleep. 

Now recently I've even picked up smoking cigarettes. In the past I've been on and off with vapes. I've went from having a really nice mod for almost a year then I got rid of it and a year later I picked up juuling and stopped after a few months. So nicotine is something I've always dabbled with but never found it hard to break the addiction. But this is the first time I've bought cigarettes and it's the only option I had because all the vape shops are closed and when I went in the UK gas station I didn't even see where they sold any vapes. Maybe I just didn't look hard enough. But I get nervous in public stores alone because everyone is British and I'm American and not everyone here likes Americans. I'm not proud of smoking but I don't know what else to do to take the edge off.

I'm a big PC gamer but my PC is stuck in shipment right now because the private UK courier service the military is using to ship my PC is not operating with Coronavirus. So I have nothing to do but play my switch (which gets old fast) and watch Netflix (which binge watching random series is also not really my thing.) 

My wife is actually finishing up school early and since it's all online she could come right now but US passport service isn't really operating either. Her passport was supposed to be done processing after 6-8 weeks and this is week 5 but on the website it said there's going to be significant delays. It really hurts to know a little booklet is the only thing keeping her away from me.

We've also been arguing quite a bit lately. Our phone conversations have become pretty bland and a lot of times we hang up after getting into an argument about literally anything. It's always small stuff and it's not relationship threatening, but the time apart is really just starting to put its strain.

I don't know what to do. Everyone I talk to is just saying ""you just got to wait it out"" and I hate that. Although, I know it's just the harsh reality. I guess atleast I able to get us a nice place and actually get WiFi hooked up during the pandemic. Socially I feel alone. Things really feel like a rock bottom for me. I'm young so I don't know much to compare too but right now this is just very tough. The feeling that there is just nothing I can do to fix this or to get my wife here any faster just really eats at me. I wish there was something I could do to improve my situation",20Apr2020,1

87,"I find this whole coronavirus pandemic to be liberating from the daily misery. Intellectually I can see the depth and gravity of the situation that others must feel and hope this resolves soon, especially for the kids and elderly parents, but I am unphased on my own behalf.

I have a job where I feel like I am wasting away, and I am glad that my office gets to work from home. I am able to cram and do more in less time, and instead of being at an office 9 hours a day, I finish my work in 4 hours. Then, I go do homework for my online classes and work out. I feel so free, and have a sense of control over my own schedule.

I've also turned antisocial since breaking up with my ex after he was conscripted into the military of his country. It was as if he died and there wasn't any closure. It was a year ago and I've never been the same after. I wake up in the afternoon and just sit back with coffee, and then when it's night time around 8pm I drive to the office. Nobody is there thanks to the shutdown, but it's a nice office with bright lights and a wide desk. After doing my work for a couple hours, I use that space to draw. It's a really good set up for that, and I haven't been able to draw for a while. Just being alone in all that space, drawing away into the night. Being alone with my thoughts. My ex and I used to draw together.

The pandemic will probably resolve soon, but part of me wishes that this will go on as long as possible. I don't want to go back to a normal work schedule. I don't want to have to see anyone, I like the isolation, the space, the nights alone.",20Apr2020,1

92,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.

96,"My parents threw me out about a month ago and I since moved in with my girlfriend and her parents. my girlfriend's mom told me I should live with them until me and my girlfriend have enough money to live on our own. I was super grateful to have a place to stay because with coronavirus it would of been hard to travel out of state to find shelter with family. The only two things she's asked me in return was 600 a month rent combined between me and my girlfriend, and even then she told us if we can't pay it for any reason she wouldn't mind. The other was we wait 2-3 months before we share the same bed, and after 1 month her mom said it was OK for us to sleep in the same bed. She even came to me one day and told me I should have sex with her daughter.

My GF's mom has also helped me get onto unemployment, she helped me get medicaid, currently she's trying to get me on disability. I've never had anybody before try to help me through processes like this. I've also known her parents were planning to buy a house this summer.

98,"How so? Well first let me say that my family and I have been fortunate enough have everything we need, and we don't have to worry about bills at this time. I don't mean to come across as insensitive to the problems many other people are having right now, and my heart goes out to the many, many people who have opposing economic situations right now. This is what makes me appreciate my blessings even more. My my wife and son have jobs that allow them to telework, and all I have to do is wake up and wait for my monthly retirement annuity and Social Security deposits. Everything else has simply been a matter of masks; being careful where I go and shopping different grocery stores to make sure we have what we want and need... and I managed to stock up on toilet paper just before it got crazy out there. These are all reasons why I decided to make a donation to our local food bank, and it probably won't be the last. We also need to help homeless people out on the street when possible (while also feeling confident that they are really people in need as opposed to the multitude of lazy panhandlers and scammers out there).

This entire pandemic episode has also provided me with yet another blessing. I've had a lot of time to think and reflect on my blessings and my life in general. It has given me time to tap into another level of self-awareness, understanding and insight in terms of what makes me think the way I do and feel the way I feel about certain people, events and certain aspects of life. In the process of thinking as well as communicating with others online, it helped me grow to some degree. Certain thoughts, ideals and ideologies changed to some degree while others simply remained the same because *that's who I am*... and I'm good with that. This is not to say that some future epiphany won't occur, but I know that God has His time set in terms of what will be revealed to us ABOUT us and when... and that timing mechanism has been preset in the way we were made as individuals, and awakenings are a gradual lifelong process.

99,"On April Fools Day I was working from home.  We have a 9 year old son who is obviously home from school now, and this was before they started online learning.  My wife texted me an article that said the Colorado governor passed an executive order that all K-12 grade kids would have to repeat their grade.  Honestly I bought it at first and showed my son the article and he legit got pissed off, thinking he was going to have to go through 3rd grade again.  Not gonna lie I was pretty pissed too.  Then I realized what day it was and told my son it had to be an April Fool's joke.  He was still not amused.  

A couple of days go by and I'm off work sitting at the table with my son, when all of the sudden I hear the loud wail of the city's emergency siren.  It's a clear blue beautiful day so I'm thinking, there's no tornado, wtf is going on?  I look at my phone to see if it was testing time for the siren and it was like 4:16 or something,  and I know they only test it at an even hour.  I'm waiting for one of those emergency texts that they push out, wondering if this was it, the end if the world.   With perfect timing, my wife comes home from work.  We are both confused and worried something serious was going down.  The whole time my kid is sitting there acting confused with us.  Then after a few minutes of us freaking out, he pulls his hands from under the table and has the Nintendo Switch in his hands with YouTube pulled up playing the siren as loud as can be.

Corn pops is the perfect cereal example since it all wants to float to the top and leaves no cereal down at the bottom with the milk. The cereal is round enough that it all crowds together an wont let all of it float to the top because of the smaller bowl top opening. 

I have been using the bottoms of 2 liter soda bottles as single-use throwaway bowls so I could make use of them again after the soda is gone and so I don't have to wash a traditional bowl. I can just  toss it out.

108,"I'm 23 now, just finished University.

I'd had no problems excelling an all-rounder life till High school. I don't remember how much of a procrastinator I was but all talents like music, dance, art, 3D visualizations, and academia like university level Physics, chem, maths all came naturally to me. I have been able to study/get shit done really well with immense density at the last moment under extreme pressure most of my life, but now any amount of stress doesn't get me moving.

Then I started becoming a master-procrastinator in University, did a double major in Physics +Mechanical Engineering. Got frustrated by both, grades took a free fall, didn't care. I became interested in CS and AI and then started an eternal regret about choosing the wrong majors and baggage degrees and went into probably what was depression for 1-2 years until I got interested in psychedelics and that pulled me out somewhat by showing me the beauty and the gift of life. But I am still an academic failure, with close to zero opportunities remaining for further studies in my preferred field and moving to a better country.

What has remained always is my Extreme tolerance for impending failure, a passive don't care attitude towards myself and I suppose a sense of entitlement which leads me to believe that I should have had an glimmering bright academic career, from which I'm far.

A sense of detachment from Self (watching myself destroy my life), the World (watching the stupid happen, especially my country being a shit-show) , and life in general (the meaninglessness and chaos, yet the detail of suffering) has taken me over. It's not like I don't care, I've been meaning to do something great for humanity if I can contribute towards Artificial General Intelligence, brain machine interfaces etc, things that Musk has been up to lately. Or at-least just play music, travel the world and play with dogs. I've been suicidal through my university years. Now I do have a job in AI which I'll be joining in July and there's this ongoing lockdown/break.

I am disinterested in pursuing any of my aforementioned hobbies, any new knowledge that might be very necessary (like for my upcoming Job, that requires an immense amount of life-time studying starting a few years earlier). Extreme laziness and lethargy. I just lie down all day, watch Youtube or scroll endlessly through memes on Instagram. I don't need an instrument through which I can waste time, it's my greatest and by far most practiced skill now. I'm becoming better at wasting my life away every day. I've zero motivation or self-drive

I'm just **scared of myself** and my life ahead. Whether I'll be able to live through the pain I'll likely continue to cause myself. I don't know if I should go get tested somewhere for ADHD, I can't focus now on reading even one sentence. My mind **repels** anything that I'm supposed to be doing, it's rebellious. Part of it might also be a result of my Dad's NPD (extreme narcissism and me getting punished all my childhood for mostly worthless reasons) and my upbringing that scares me from doing anything less than perfect. I am probably afraid of failing at life, hence I don't even bother trying. I maybe, don't want to die, which I think will happen soon by my own virtue if I continue this path.

I never call my family, I have abandoned friends, I'm 31 and I worked only 4 days (it was too hard). 

I dropped out from the 3rd year of my bachelor, because I thought I would be so great I picked a hard project, and was too proud to seek help, while wasting the teacher's time. 

I betrayed my best friend to go with his girlfriend, and failed at it, because she'd rather be emotionally abused than be mine. 

I am slightly misogynistic, slightly racist, I can't meet someone without thinking I am the better person. 

I am holier-than-you, I have no TV and I hate series because they're stupid, I try to read literature but I often think it's not worth my time because I feel superior to the writer. I've been vegetarian and I thought it made me ethically superior. 

I have used a lot of drugs, all of them, and I have encouraged people to take drugs. Maybe from that usage I'm now on disability for schizophrenia.

I can't read replies to what I write because everyone hates me and whatever I say. I tried everything, and I'm always hated. 

Worse than that, I'm not even hated, I'm boring, and people tell me I'm like a child despite all my best efforts. 

I want to be a leader, not for the greater good, but to feel better about myself. 

I only try to seduce beautiful women, and I fail at it, because they can sense I am patronizing. 

They are like children to me, because they can't write, and I judge that, because I'm feeling very clever about my writing, even though it's never popular. 

I have painted around ten drawings, and I think they're greater than Mona Lisa, because it is more ""humanly pure"".

Often times I put myself in a state of vulnerability, so that people abuse it, so that I can feel better than them, and push them into regrets. 

I thought Harry Potter was plain stupid and not worth my time, but I have enjoyed Twilight, because I like vampires, because I identify as being superhuman. 

I always wanted to be superhuman, and people feel bad when they're around me, because I try my best to be the best, and they hate it, because I am unmatched. 

I pushed Trump to be elected by arguing everywhere in his interest, even though I am not even American, and didn't read his ideas. 

Despite this, I condemn Americans to have elected him, just because they enjoyed the bullying, and they expected him to bring them wealth, while we're in a climate emergency, and he should never have been elected. I pushed them into regret.

We took a trip to my home country recently and it felt so good to be loved, to have people smile at me and for my family to enjoy my company. Of course, we're back and now in lockdown.

What I noticed is that my life isn't much different with the lockdown. I've withdrawn from the locals because I'm depressed and don't want to lie about my life.

121,"Im a 21 year old woman and I haven’t had a close friend that I could confide in for over 2 years (except my boyfriend, who I owe so much to. But I mean a close friendship, one that isn’t romantic). 

I make friends mainly through proximity since I’m so shy. Usually from my job. But I’ve had 3 jobs in the past 2 years where I was the youngest person by a large margin. All of my other friends that I made at older jobs have all dwindled, aside from one girl that I casually text, but we don’t feel close. 

I just feel like I’m not worthy of having such close friendships, like I don’t deserve it. All of my friends in high school all wronged me in some way and I forgave them for it, just for the friendship to fizzle our eventually. 

I wish someone would contact me and ask how I’m doing, for once. No one but my boyfriend seems to truly care about how I’m feeling. Maybe I’m just overbearing and as soon as someone shows interest, I overload them with my crap. 

Overall, I just wish someone valued me enough to want to spend time with me in their casual time. Go out to eat or play a video game together without me feeling like I’m annoying them.

I don’t enjoy spending time with them for this reason, that and I get a little bored being around them for some reason that I don’t understand. Secondly, when I’m around friends I put on kind of an emotional mask. I act happy, although i think I feel slightly more happy around people it’s not to any great extent. I think I choose to be around people sometimes just for the fear of missing out on teenage memories. I read situations and then decide how to act, it’s not a very fluid thing. I spent most of my childhood with very little friends. That is until my junior year of high school when I became a social butterfly.

this is it, this is the answer to life, the universe, and everything. the answer to life, the universe, and everything, is sausage massages. everything boils down to that.

The fact is men are primarily motivated to work by obtaining the affections of women. This is proven not only by looking at the bottom end of the spectrum (men dropping out) but at the top end (wealthy/famous/powerful people risking their careers, reputations and wealth just for a single sexual act).

Ugh its so gross. I can't stand to think that everything that exists in civilization was made by some gross smelly man who works hard so he can sausage it up. see that Taco Bell? Exists because of a man who wanted to become a rich CEO so he can sausage it up with several hot girls. Every male college student is just trying to get a high paying job so he can secure himself a secure warm hole to massage his sausage in for the rest of his life

138,"Being at a college grade reading level in second grade, I was placed in accelerated classes at a young age. At that age, it meant nothing to me. I home-schooled for a couple years, through most of middle school. It meant nothing then either. Due to extenuating circumstances, I was moved into my alternate parents home and re-entered public school.At 15 I took the test, and found that I scored in the 1 percentile. Meaning, my average IQ was higher than 99% of other test takers. For about a year, it felt good. Then it didn't.By this time I had already experimented with stimulants, sedatives, alcohol, pot and psychedelics. I had already began experimenting with my sexuality. I had already developed behavioral issues: depression, anxiety, and the typical shit. I'd already understood Einstein, Hawking, Planck, String Theory, and all the typical shit. I'd already taken the dive into theology: Gnosticism, Buddhism, Taoism, Satanism(s), Rosicrucianism, Wicca, and all of the typical. bull. shit.By 18 I realized that being an outlier is more textbook than being in the curve. I concluded that having a high IQ is a pathology.People like me struggle with sleep their entire lives; even our dreams are too vivid, too out of control. We don't sleep, so we get sick more often. We take more calculated risks (not more risks, ""calculated risks""), so we experiment more with drugs and sex and stunts. In fact, we're usually hyper-sexual. We're most likely emotionally stunted, so more likely to develop compounding mental illnesses, and all in all more driven towards suicide, or just an early death. We're more likely to break the law. We're more likely to be antinatalist. We're lonely, so more drugs, and more sex. We're lonely as fuck. Because not only is it basically a language barrier for neurotypical folk, but 9/10 times we hate each other, too. Have you ever seen a MENSA forum? It's chaos. It's terrible. Geniuses are some of the dumbest people I've ever met.I'm very freshly 23 now, and the realization that having a high IQ means more trouble than capability has likely saved my life. I use the ""textbook"" statistics against my percentile as a warning label, and do my best to steer clear of the shit. I'm not an unattractive person, but I'm still incredibly lonely. Sex is hollow, groups are hollow, conversation is hollow...I do better financially and academically than most my age, but my IQ still has nothing to show for itself. At this point, it might mean more than nothing, but it's just the worst of me. I still have no idea what I'm doing; I don't have a purpose, or any real wisdom to share. Yet I know I can't turn my head off. I know I hate my own cognizance, and that I can't stand it when people call me smart. I loath not being able to carry on a conversation without it becoming metacognitive. I despise my mind for making it so impossible to just. be. there.

So, here it is. The list of cons for IQ goes on and on, but here's my take on it: I silently laugh at those who revel in their own intellect. Perhaps the teratoma of their consciousness has yet to push against the envelope of their heart and mind, so they still stand  and hop on this creeping plague of ""intelligence."" Or they suspend their disbelief, and cling to whatever unreality of their choosing, to anchor themselves and their ego. I promise you people, don't try to be ""smart."" Don't even wish you were ""smarter."" Try to be nice. Be nicer. It means so, so much more. Fuck an IQ - at the end of the day, Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligence makes WAY more sense anyway. A high IQ means nothing but shit. Fuck it.",20Apr2020,1

149,"I'm not sure how much detail to add, but this happened back in July 2016. I was home alone with my older brother and he woke me up to go to Olympia Einkaufszentrum (Olympia Mall in Munich). At first I hesitated since he just woke me up, but I decided to go with him.

We first went to McDonald's across the street to grab some breakfast and then we went to the Game Stop in the mall because he wanted to buy some game (Fifa, I think). So he buys his game and we go outside since he wanted to smoke a cigarette and then we saw it. The people across the street were jumping from the McDonald's balcony and my brother joked that they all saw some rare Pokemon on Pokemon GO and then we heard the first gunshot.

It was weird. I didn't REALIZE that it WAS a gunshot but I just started instinctually running. We went down the escalator and then back into the mall from an underground entrance. Inside the mall we ran alongside basically everyone to the back exit. It was only around there that I actually realized that it was a shooting. I don't remember how many gunshots were fired but the last one I heard was when we exited and even so far away I could still smell the gunpowder.

After that we basically kept going forward until a woman who could speak German better flagged a car for us who drove us to a tram stop.

I didn't see anyone get shot and luckily didn't develop any sort of PTSD from it. Guns and gunshots still don't ""trigger"" anything inside me and I'm not scared of my dad's pistol.

However my brother lost his first friend in Germany in that shooting. He NEVER cries but my mom says that when they visited the memorial put up for the victims she saw him cry for the first time since he was basically a baby.

Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Maybe.” 

The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.” The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.

154,"I just want to rant about some thoughts I had due to COVID-19. I know the people suffering the most are the people that had/have the virus. I would choose my health above everything else. But that doesn't mean that other people are not suffering as well. I have been trying to talk to some people I know, but their approach on the subject really makes me wanna close up to myself and not talk again.

**""Come on, you are not the only one suffering now""**: Why the fuck should that make me feel better? What do you fucking expect me to feel or think after that? Like ""Yeeeeeeah, great a lot of people are suffering now, that is great news!""? Guess what. When someone is feeling depressed about a situation, this doesn't help at all. I really wish I was the only one suffering from this and everyone else was ok. The whole situation is so fucked up.

**""Others have it worse than you, so don't complain""**: Bad situations are not a fucking competition. Just because there are people suffering more than me, doesn't mean that I don't have the right to complain. I know I have my health, I know my family is ok, but I fucking suffer too. I won't have money to eat in 2 to max 3 months, but ok I will eat positivity, right? I will pay my rent and bills with good thoughts and the satisfaction that I am not suffering as much as others. 

**""I am here for you, ask me anything and I'll do it""**: Don't fucking say that phrase, if you are not really there to hear someone. I am sick of wanting to talk to people and shutting me down with cliche phrases and changing subject. I am not gonna ask you money, if that's what you are afraid ""friend"", don't worry. I just wanna talk to someone. How hard can it be for you to shut up and listen to me? I know you cannot stop the virus or whatever. Sometimes people just wanna talk. Just get it all out of their system.

**""We are in this together, don't worry. It will be over soon""**: I would be inspirational as well, if I had my mother giving me money or I still had my job or was loaded. That cliche shit means nothing to me coming from certain people. We are in this together? No. NO. NO. We all experience this shit, yeah, but from different places. I am down there drowning in the shit and you are up in the bleachers watching. Is this what being together means? 

**""Think positive, we have been in situations worse than that""**: FYI I am from Greece. Greece was already in a shitty situation before the virus hit, so it just made things miserable. I had only a part time job (shitty money, but it was better than having zero euros in my account), from which I was fired because the business couldn't handle the expenses. The last years have been hell. I was never able to save money for an emergency. I barely made ends meet. And that situation fucked me up. Me mental health was so damaged. I cannot think positive now. I fucking told a friend that I had suicidal thoughts again and the only thing I heard was ""Come one, don't feel down, be positive. This will end"". How about FUCK YOU? Is this positive enough for you? I haven't asked money from anyone. I don't feel ok asking for money and not knowing when I will be able to return them. All I ask is listening to me.

When I was younger, I was never allowed to get a job. Even right now, my mother really hates the idea of my sisters and I working. She only wants us to study and graduate from college.

But the truth be told, I'm scared to go outside. I get panic attacks by just thinking about going to a job interview. I'm afraid that if I actually get a job I'll be terrible at it. I'm afraid of disappointing my boss, my clients, my family. I hate the idea of being a failure (which I already am) but I can't force myself to try new things anymore.

She says yeah he’s really busy and I’m adding more to his plate (my job) and Defends the hell out of him. Almost annoyed. She said she talks to some of his candidates and I should too.

My Minecraft world helped me remember again. I’m not looking for attention and I don’t want people to go after me. I just wanted to find a way to get everything off of my chest today without causing self harm ending me back into the mental hospital. Happy 4/20 to everyone have a nice day :).,20Apr2020,1
173,"Me and my first cousin were chilling playing xbox all morning. I had a hundred and fifty dollars in my wallet set by the TV. I go to the bathroom and I don't even bother checking my wallet because hey this is my little bro, why would he steal from me? But around noon he gets up and says he's gonna score and blaze me up. And he dips. And whaddya know my wallet is empty. 

So I track this lil bastard down and pull him out of his car and took everything out of his pockets, and choked him from behind. Asked him what happened to my money. He tells me that I'm tripping and he had his own money. People are outside watching and I look bad here. I give him the benefit of the doubt and gave him the money and phone back. 

But I couldn't let it go and go to the only gas station in town and ask if my cuz came through with a hundred dollar bill and fifty. Cashier says yeah he paid for gas with a bill. What the fuck. This was all today. That was all the money I had. But he left a shitty bluetooth speaker and a T shirt I can't fit so I got that going I guess. 

After being pissed all day, I'm kind of sad now. Like I was down with this guy 1000% since we were in diapers. I went to jail for this guy when I was 18 because we're family. Got into scraps because he'd rip someone off and they'd wanna beat him up. He's a small guy. When I pulled him out of the car I must've looked like a big ogre choking a child when I pulled him out of the car. 


But yeah. I feel pretty bummed out now. First time I ever got fucked over by someone I trusted. I'm sure we'll be cool again in the future but I'll never trust him again. 

Stealing is just lame bro. Thank yall for coming to my TED Talk.",20Apr2020,1
174,It wasn’t even hard I just didn’t study properly. I feel so stupid I hate myself I’ve been crying since I finished it. I procrastinated and definitely got a 10 or 20%. I’m probably gonna fail the class. I won’t be able to graduate and I’ll have to retake it. I hate myself. I’m seriously so fucking stupid. I wanna kill myself,20Apr2020,1
175,"I lost both my jobs because of Covid so of course I needed to go get a new one and become a cashier at a grocery store. Today was my second day cashiering and I did such a bad job. I’m slow, I cut my thumb open, my knuckle started bleeding today from being cut on a bone sticking out of a piece of steak, I have various paper cuts, and there was a couple of older men that were being rude to me. I’m exhausted.",20Apr2020,1

This morning, i have turned on my Laptop and started writing my Master thesis. This master thesis almost ruined my life but atleast my first draft of Chapter 1 is complete.",20Apr2020,1

178,"Dear diary,

Had a positive day today, scrolled through my tinder and realised actually some of these girls seem easy to get along with so sent a few messages saying “hello” to kick things off.

The thought of her didn’t cross my mind once even though I thought it would have done at some point during the day.

Ordered myself an original Xbox with a few games. Mostly platforming games but still am looking forward to it arriving.",20Apr2020,1
