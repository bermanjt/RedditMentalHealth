1,"Hi guys! This is going to be such a long read. I kinda wanna know if anyone has any suggestions on how to motivate myself to exercise where the main motivation is not weight.

For a big part of my life, especially in my teens, I kinda had a love-hate relationship with exercise. I always associated exercise with losing weight and starving myself because when I was a lot younger (as in primary school age), whenever my parents get me to exercise, they'd either get me to vomit my food first or scold me for not having curves. Also, whenever I exercise not for weight loss related reasons, my parents will berate me for it, saying I'm harming myself and making me ruin my future body because ""excercise for being healthy is just gonna make you fat"".

I also refrain from exercising for non-weight-loss related reasons because my parents would tell me not to do it because I'm bad at it since I was a lazy baby and I'm just embarassing myself.

It doesn't help that my sister also turns it into a competition of ""who can exercise more and lose more weight in a week"" and also has problems with starving herself to lose weight (thankfully she's over that). So that was why started associating exercise with losing weight.

By the end of this year, after losing contact with my mom, it finally clicked to me I may not have hated exercise so much if only my parents stopped associating exercise with numbers on a scale, vomiting out my food, berating me and making exercise inclusive to only situps which I hate because the up and down movements make me dizzy. I'd probably also enjoy it a lot more if they stop telling me I am bad at moving my body and I'm gonna embarass myself if I do. 

So I decided that I want to give exercising another go and I want to commit to it this time but I don't wanna start torturing myself by saying ""I have to do this because you need a sexy body or no one will want you"" or ""I have to do this to get to the lowest number in the scale""

How do you guys think I should disassociate exercising with weight loss and associate it with something else if anything? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",28Nov2020,1
2,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 21 year old college student with anxiety (I suppose that is the case for a lot of 21 year old college students). I’m currently doing online school at home, living with my family. I’m not very active. I do not exercise regularly. I mostly just sit at my desk, study all day, eat meals, relax, and go to sleep. 

I’ve been really scared and anxious during this pandemic. It’s been so tough to deal with people and my own thoughts. I feel like I’m the black sheep among my family and friends in terms of taking all COVID precautions seriously. I do all that I can to keep  my family safe. They seem to be on board with taking proper precautions, but make exceptions for extended family. I assume they believe they can only get the virus from strangers.

We eat out regularly, basically every day. Lunch is almost always fast food or some other type of take out food. My family uses the “we don’t have time to make lunch. It’s easier to just eat out” card to excuse our unhealthy habit. I’m guilty of using that excuse as well. I’m a little more health conscious than my family and want to make a change in my diet, but I find it very hard to do it in a household that looks at diets as “just eat and stop starving yourself” and “oh he’s on a diet again, only eating one slice of pizza this time.”

I’m sorry, I have a lot to say, but I’ll get to the point. I want to change my diet and become healthier. This is especially crucial now. I don’t want to put all the blame on my family because a lot of my decisions stem from my own problems. This pandemic has really made me think about my personal health. The last time I went to the doctor, I was told I have very high blood pressure. I believe it was 140-150 ish (over a number that I forgot because I don’t know how those readings are reported). I also don’t go to the doctor regularly. I imagine my blood pressure is worse now. I wonder if I’m high risk if I contract the virus. I assume my family is in the same boat, yet they don’t go to the doctor either so who knows. 

When I lived alone on internship or for in person school, I ate healthier and was more active. I feel judged every time I try to live like this at home. I have loving parents, but I feel the most pressure from them.

I would love some advice. Am I high risk? Is my family high risk?

I know that was a lot. I have so much to spill as I don’t really talk to anybody about it. I’m sure I rambled and was all over the place with this post, but I hope it was enough to understand my situation.

Thank you all! And if anyone needs someone to talk to with similar problems or anything regarding living in this pandemic, I would love to chat.",28Nov2020,1

I've always regarded myself as having extreme mental fortitude in the face of adverse situations. I've made it through hell and back several times, and always came out on top stronger than before.

I'm in a somewhat complex situation here though, it's wearing on me in ways that I haven't experienced before. To be frank, I'm somewhat shook. 

About 3 weeks ago my mother passed away. It wasn't exactly expected but her heart condition took a turn for the worse, and that was it. She was 68. I was an only child, and we were very close; it hit me pretty hard. I've never cried that much in my life.

In late July she had a procedure to try and stop an aneurysm, some sort of sleeve. It didn't go too well and left her unable to walk or function very much. There were clots, her legs were enormously swollen; it wasn't  pretty and she required help with just about everything.

Fortunately, two days before her surgery, I had an accident and sliced through a tendon in my thumb which resulted in me being out of work from July up until a week ago. I am an electrician so being in a hard cast put a hard stop to being able to work. Very thankful to even have a job to return to. As a result, in the few months prior to my mothers death, I was able to go my folks house every day and help make meals, just spend time talking, clean up, etc. They only live about 15 minutes away.

During the same time frame, my Dad(72) began showing some signs of Dementia.  He began to lose the ability to recall any recent events, use the phone, or even make food to eat. For the last year or so he's been having some issues, this year it's really starting to accelerate though. A few  weeks before Mom died, I promised her I would take care of Dad and that she doesn't need to worry. I could see a weight lift off of her  shoulders.

At this point my wife and I have talked and decided we need to move in with Dad as soon as everything is straightened out legally/financially. Its only 3 bedrooms, and somewhat outdated, but I think if we can finish the basement it could work out. 

After mom passed, I went to an estate lawyer and quickly had to relieve him of  his service as I realized it was something we could not afford. I am currently handling the probate myself.

Between taking care of Dad daily, handling my Mom's estate, being a dad and husband myself, diving head first into forensic accounting and taking over all of my parents finances, running on fumes financially, mourning the death of my mother, watching my father slowly slip away, and working full time as an electrician, I am absolutely freaking spent. 

Advice, critique, criticism, kind words, whatever; I need it. Give me the strength to see this through and come out on top.",28Nov2020,1
4,"As a person I have always liked the idea of being the most authentic and honest person I can be, regardless of how others feel. Meaning I often say things people might be offended by or strongly disagree with.

A lot of our thoughts and opinions often come from other people whether we think about it or not. This doesn’t necessarily mean we don’t truly share the same opinion but it does mean there are likely times in everyones life where we are essentially “acting” when we are in conversations with people. Whether to impress someone, maintain social status, etc. 

With that being said, I wanted to ask the question and see if anyone here has any idea how to really tell when someone is being authentic not only to others, but to themselves. How do we know when we *truly* believe in the opinions we’ve formed over our lifetime? On top of that, when we do realize that not everything that comes out of our mouth is what we believe in entirely, how do we find a way to dig deep enough and think deep enough to know what it is we really believe to be true? All in all, how does someone know when they are being entirely authentic in conversation? Is it even entirely possible?

Forgive me if this is a confusing question/topic to discuss I really don’t know how to word my questions any better so hopefully this makes sense to someone.",28Nov2020,1

Every time I hear a story about a fatal infant or toddler illness, or when my wife gets in a car to go somewhere and I think about car accidents I just spiral down this terrible rabbit hole of imagining that happening to one of them.  

Even though my parents are now in their late 60’s I dread the day one of them goes because I know the survivor will be an absolute wreck... they’re my parents so of course I love them to bits but I feel like I personally would be able to move on eventually but if my mom were to die tomorrow my dad would be an empty shell and I don’t know how he would ever survive. Literally and emotionally he depends on her so much he would be lost without her. 

Death is a part of life and ironically I think if it were to actually happen in the moment I would find a way to move on... but I spend more time dreading it when I should just be enjoying the time I have with them!

We are long distance on separate continents, and it was manageable before Covid but tricky, and now it's just not doable at all.  Beyond that, he's 32 and just going back to school, a sort of pre-course so he can apply to college with better scores than high school.  He works nights at a grocery store, which he hates, which is why he is going back to school.  But he will be in school for another few years to get his degree.  He doesn't want to move to my country anymore (I thought I had him convinced until he saw how we fell apart during Covid), and I don't want to move to his country.  I thought maybe we could move to a third country, but I have realized I just don't want to do that either.  I want to be here near my family. 

I know this is not the relationship for me.  I'm going to be 32 next month and I would like to be married and have kids.  I have a masters with a pretty solid career going here now.  I just can't help but feel sad about the idea of ending it.  He's so sweet and kind to me, always supportive and patient.  I know most men aren't that nice thoughtful like he is.  He sends me little gifts and flowers just because he knows I'll like them, always remembers to ask me about things that are going on, tries to help me with problems, everything like that.  But he lives a 6 hour flight away from me.

There is no other time like now, we are forever changing.
Ever expanding.
Regardless of past, the future is irrelevant.
We cannot know the future, and the past is already over.
This is the point.
The point of living.
The point of searching.
The point of celebration.
The point of freedom.
This is the moment.  The only moment you’ll ever get.
You will never get this moment back, and each one must be.
The overwhelming task at hand, we cannot look away.
Anxiety and Depression keep you bound to the emptiness.
Do not turn away from the burning in your heart.
Do not oppress the flame. 
Do not cower from its love.
This is your essence, this is the passion you contain.
Do not flicker or sway with the wind, but hold your heat deep in your chest.
Days will pass and seasons change, but you will keep on.
Time is man’s worst enemy, and the calvary has gone.
With time, even the strongest men fail.
Time does not discriminate, nor is it biased in any way.
Time continues forward.  
Humans are the only species known for time travel.
WE float in and out of consciousness.
Stream back to our childhood, reminisce the past.
People cling to the demons of their childhood.

First Generation to grow up too fast, because of technology. 
Children 2.0, entertaining and fully automated.

Just keep us distracted, just a little longer.  We’ll deal with our problems tomorrow.

Like the Mermaid we are singing now, and living life, or trying to, at least.

Just keep your shit together.  I’m pretty sure that’s the point.
As you point to yourself in the mirror, wishing you were different.
Compared to back then, I guess you are.  Change is good, they say.
No matter the amount of change that comes, you can’t get back the moments.
Those were the times, and just like that time is gone.
We blink our eyes and wake up on the other side of 30.
Where did my 20’s go, and how far away high school seems.
We are the longing generation, just waiting for the sitcom parents to show up.
Waiting on that perfect holiday, just like in the movies.  
Waiting on the perfect life.  Waiting while it passes us by.
Suddenly, you’ve missed the point.
You can never go back, no matter how far back your mind travels.  
You can replay that moment in your head everyday.
Focus and obsess on that moment, just that one.  
Maybe, just another moment.  
Today.  Right now.  This is all you have, this moment right now.
Remember, you are here, right now.
You, and the desires within yourself matter.
When you forget that, you forget to move forward.
The longer you stay, the colder your heart becomes.
Bitterness, depression, and anxiety overcome, and you are left asking…
What’s the Point?
The point is…
Live Right Now and Find YOUR purpose.

What kind of person do you want to be?
What do you want to do?

GOD DAMN YOU REPTILIAN!"" Everybody simply walked by him, ignoring him. He was an annoyance, but harmless, shouting into the air.


As the bum was ranting about 5g waves turning his piss green a man happened to be walking by, giving him an ear. ""What the fuck? 5g won't turn your piss green."" he thought to himself. The man decided to give the bum his full attention and observed him, with the intruige and disgust of watching two clown cars collide with each other. The man thought he should share this spectacle, so he waved to another man passing by and told him to watch for a second.


""THE SEWERS CONNECT ALL OUR SHIT TOGETHER. YOU'VE TOUCHED SHITS WITH EVERYONE IN THIS CITY AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.""


Soon a small crowd formed around the bum consisting of all manner of people. Whether the bum noticed or not is unclear. His rants ranged from offensive to disgusting to mundane and stupid.


""THE JEWS ARE HIDING RADIO ANTENNAS UNDER THOSE HATS. THE JEWISH SATELLITE MATRIX CONNECTS THEM ALL TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY THEY ALL DRESS THE SAME.""


""That's horrible"" yelled a woman in the crowd.


""We ought to do something about this bum!"" another added.


The crowd grew angry and eventually, a large pedestal was built and the bum placed atop it. That way, the entire city could see and hear him. And, air their own feelings about him.


The crowd doubled in size shortly. Filled with booing, anger, and shouting at the bum that now stood tall among them.


""That guy is an asshole!""


""Fuck that bum!""


""We will not stand for this kind of behavior!""

A month after that, a small bump appeared on my face where the x-ray happened. This was the first bump I could not remove with all my force from my face, I thought it might be cancer,, but I had to wait to see.
I read recently a few months ago that x-rays can give you cancer so I used qigong to think of how cancer theerapy would feel and I felt it. Three days later, the bump fell off of my face! It was smoothed immediately.
It had been there for 3 years, so it was a sore at first but has slowly healed. There is a slight scar still but it might heal. I am planning to get a real cancer screening as soon as possible to confirm it and make sure it isn't anywhere else in me.
It feels a lot better and I had an aggressive pimple breakout immediately afterwards, which is a known side effect of cancer therapy. It s more broken out now,, I want to wait to post pics.

 I hope this will help others because qigong has been known to cure cancer in China.

I’ve tried tinder and bumble. Constantly. I’m always on those stupid fucking apps but don’t get any likes. I don’t have any pictures of myself at all because I’m so self conscious of my looks. 

My sense of humor is my best part of my personality imo but it will scare away girls. I like vulgar jokes but I can’t be like that right away. 

I don’t think I’ll ever get a girlfriend or a hookup. I can’t even imagine myself with a girl because I tell myself I don’t deserve anyone at all and I probably don’t. Why do I even try I deserve to be alone. I’m so fucking frustrated. And no I’m not an incel.",28Nov2020,1

I've always been a shy introverted person. But I have a lot of close friends... Well used to. And I've always been a person to have very few friends, but very close ones. And I don't have any friends anymore. That's why my old friendships are so meaningful.

I just can seem to get over them. I still constantly think about old friend and think to myself... Why don't we hangout anymore? I mean, were the same people, we didn't have any falling out or anything. I even took it upon myself to reach out to all my old friends and it seems like they moved on. Most didn't respond,and got a response from 2 of them. One seemed he like he didn't even want to talk.

Idk. Im just bummed out that these old friends don't see it the way I do.

41,"The more I think about it the more weird I find it.

Grew up abused. It wasn’t your typical type of abuse but more of a resentment type. The thing is, it wasn’t anything I had done or anything like that, it was those “thoughts” not sure how to describe em. But the ways your culture thinks. 

Pretty much what I’m talking about is, I’m Mexican. There’s all types of Mexicans, there’s black Mexicans, white Mexicans, native Mexicans etc. “Mexican” isn’t a race but more of a combination of different ones. I, my family comes from the more native type of Mexicans. White skin is really sought after and admired. Having pale skin gives the person kinda an “edge”? It’s considered more attractive which I think is bull crap. 

Anyways, my family is all really dark, I turned up the opposite which got a lot of attention and resentment from my own family and that’s how the abuse started. I grew resentment against my culture and made an active effort to distance myself from it.

I changed my name partially because of my parents, the distancing and me just not liking it. Over time I’ve found that this name really doesn’t mean anything.. I’ve thought back to my birth name and again, it doesn’t mean anything to me. Not my first name nor my surname, it’s literally just a sort of title. Tbh I didn’t like the name I changed it to, been thinking about changing it again and I’ve just looked online for first names I might like then for last names I just loook for any that goes well with the first name. 

But yep.. weird.",28Nov2020,1
42,"When I(24F) was 12, I spent a lot of time on habbo hotel since it was pretty cool back then, I was a pretty quiet and well behaved kid so my parents, who were in their 50's and not too familiarized with the internet didn't really supervised me much when I was on the computer cause they trusted me and had always told me to be careful, I met a guy who back then was 24-25, we started talking and became friends, I had always been a really precocious child so I guess talking to me was easy to him.  


We eventually started getting romantically involved when I was around 14-15, he was a nerdy introverted socially awkward guy who was a virgin and so was I so I considered him my best friend.  


When I was 15 he decided to come visit me (he lived 5 hours away from me) since his sister was coming to my city to a convention and we decided to meet for the first time, my parents, who were unaware of him till now, were not happy at all but decided to accept as long as they were with us the whole time, we met at a Chilis and then we brought him back to the hotel he was staying at and went home, he left the next day.  


I eventually realized how big the age gap was and how wrong it was and broke things off with him and blocked him, I also got a boyfriend my age who lived in my city, when he somehow found out he managed to message me from a different number telling me he loved me and missed me, I ignored him and that was the last time I spoke with him.  


The reason why I'm still unsure if I was a victim or not: He never made any sexual advances on me, he never tried to kiss me or act inapropiate with me, I know what he did was gross and when I look at 12 year olds I see children, but I'm not sure if he was aware of it.",28Nov2020,1

So me and my girlfriend, we are currently in a long distance relationship. We are both currently trying to get our lives together, and have plans of one day moving in with each other. Everything in our relationship is pretty damn good from my point of view. But the one thing I just can’t seem to shake off is just how much I overthink about everything.

Not a day doesn’t go by where I don’t think of something like she’s gonna leave me, I’m not good enough for her, maybe she’s talking to other guy, what if I’m being to emotional, so on so forth. Every time something like this does come up, I do end up telling her because it really bothers me and I end up getting depressed about it. However I can’t seem to shake the fact that when we text, after a certain time period I just get this anxious feeling. Same goes with everything I overthink. Today was no different, and we had a long talk about it, and after telling her it did make me feel better. But after she went to bed, I was scrolling through her social media (probably shouldn’t of) and it had me second guessing if she really is telling the truth, or if there’s stuff she just doesn’t wanna share or tell me. 

So I guess what I’m trying to ask is, if you were in my shoes with a issue like this what would you do? Am I in the wrong? Am I just overthinking to much or are these thoughts valid?",28Nov2020,1

My life used to be so different. I had friends I had a girlfriend and I was happy. Then everything changed because my family couldn’t afford to live where we used to so we had to move to some small town with nothing. I only got a week to go to school before we got sent home because of COVID and I barely got to talk to anyone in my classes. I had never had to go to a new school on my life and it was hard for me to have talks with anyone other than a awkward chat. I’m a social person, but now I feel like a completely different person. Now most of my time is spent playing video games or trying to stick to a workout schedule with little motivation to try at anything most days are already half wasted by me waking up at noon because I stay up late at night doing things like this. Now I try to talk to my friends back home as I helplessly watch our friend group crumble, inevitably leaving me alone to watch my high school years go by as the guy with nobody to hang out with. I usually got good grades but now they’re slipping due to my lack of motivation and all my parents are saying is that if I don’t like where I live I need to do good in school and move out when I’m older which is completely skipping over to fact that I wanted to spend my high school years back home with my friends. They also keep saying that this place is better than our old home but their relationship seems to keep getting worse. The fact that I am stuck here for life watching my old self disappear is crushing and I feel myself tearing up as I finally tell myself to people other than my parents that don’t really care really crushes my spirit.

Got my doc to finally prescribe a course of steroids (despite my being diabetic) in hope of getting this thing under control. PT starts Monday. Started the steroids Friday afternoon. 

So what would make the week complete?

More pain? 

Friday evening I am lying on the couch, feeling pretty comfortable (pain lvl 2). My CGM tells me my sugar is spiking, not surprising because of steroids. So I carefully get up like I always do. And some demon thinks it's funny to metaphorically stab me directly in the spine. 

Worst pain I have ever had, eclipsing the time in '79 when I fell off my bike on cinders and the doc had to literally scrub my arm. Pain level 10 unlocked. The leg and hip as usual but really strong directly in the back this time, no extra charge sir.

I yelp, hobble to the bedroom, swallow a Norco and lie down, try to find a tolerable position, fail to find any. I yell to my wife for an icepack. She brings it. The pain is now about 9.6. The ice pack does not help. We decide to go to the ER.

I am hyperventilating, feels like 2 breaths a second though it's probably only a quarter of that. Wife is driving very fast, keeps telling me to slow my breathing and I can't. We are both terrified that I've somehow injured that cursed L4-L5 disc beyond healing. We get to the ER. She brings me a wheelchair, I'm afraid that I can't even sit in it but I manage. I'm still pretty panicked but my breathing is slowing and tbh I'm at pain 8.5 now. We check in, they do a perfunctory vitals check (pulse ox and temp only), and tell me to wait.

Pain is definitely dropping, Norco is definitely working. We watch the Colbert show and it is hysterical.

Two hours pass.

My wife asks the desk when I'm going to get a proper triage. She's told the wait is now five hours... they don't have time to explain whether they mean I have five hours from now, or just three, because she says we're leaving and going to another ER.

In the car we try to figure out what's next. She asks if I still need the ER tonight or if it can wait til morning. I agree that my pain is conttolled now, about a 5, and this no longer feels like an emergency. So we go home and fall apart.

70,"hello reddit, i'm here because I cant make up my mind about how to think of the situation.

i'm a male (23) and my girlfriend (22) have been together for almost four years now. We are currently in the middle of a fight due to me following a girl on Instagram that she doesn't like, we both use social media pretty avidly (both photographers and I run a small skate brand) so its not out of the norm for me to follow 1 girl out of the 500 people i do follow. But she found out i was following her right before thanksgiving and instantly decided to give me the silent treatment and anytime she did look at me she would basically roll her eyes or give me a stare of disappointment. Although this is a girl I have met Irl the only time i have actually talked to her it was because i had skateboarded with her boyfriend before and we more so talked about her relationship. Besides i don't want to cheat because i feel guilty with every move i make anyways so if i cheated i would mentally be an absolute wreck before her even finding out. And also her relationship before mine ended because her ex cheated on her with a girl online. She says that she just cant trust me and she is in disbelief that i thought for a second that she did trust me and that it would be okay for me to have any contact with another woman whatsoever but i'm just an idiot and thought wrong. The only thing she has on me that i have done in our relationship is catching me watching porn, which if i'm being honest here that has been a problem of mine since before our relationship and from what i've gathered, stems from being shown porn at such a young age and being sexually assaulted at 8, but thats another story. I'm not trying to justify me watching porn because thats a big reason why she does not trust me at all, I've actually been doing really good at not watching any though i've been working super hard to fight it and i'm proud of myself for staying focused and on track, but i can't share any of this with her because even just talking about it gets her upset and vengeful towards me. The times we have tried to talk about me watching porn it's ended with me on the verge of suicide because i feel that she does not offer me a place of comfort to discuss about it and instead i feel judged for everything i'm trying to work through and i'm too embarrassed  to talk to any friends about it.  So anyways i think its important to state that i am naturally the kind of person who likes to go out and do and see things and experience the world and she enjoys to just sit at home watching her favorite youtube videos so we are very different in that sense, but thats another reason why she thinks i am cheating. because i go out skating with friends, trying to connect with people to start my own business, working on art, going out shooting photos. I am far too passionate about the things i love to do to blow them off to go cheat so i'm in a way sort of offended that she thinks that i just go out with other girls and lie about what i do everyday, she keeps calling me a liar and if i tell her i'm not lying then ""i'm just trying to defend myself"" and to her thats a big indication that i am indeed lying. Which like yes of course i'm defending myself what am i going to do agree with her just so she feels right?  I'm starting to think of the option of breaking up with her but we are kind of tied together because we share a car (which i own and paid for,) we have an apartment, two cats, and she has kind of been set up to completely rely on me and i try to encourage her to be more reliable for herself but she just doesn't get it. I'm not worried about me if it comes to the point of breaking up because i'm going to pack my car and head west like i've always wanted to, i just worry about her because even though we are going through this i still love and care for her so i don't want to screw her over at all. i know this is a lot to unpack reddit but i need your advice on this situation. its almost too much for me to handle all alone.",28Nov2020,1

TL;DR I am afraid that face-to-face time will be a thing of the past. Schools, jobs, and shopping have already changed how we socialize. ☹️



As much as I don’t like people sometimes (...most times?), I miss being around people. I have a feeling that the way we interact with each other will be way different now.

Even after vaccines come out and it’s years down the road, will A) certain things even be popular anymore (movie theaters, comedy shows, anything with an audience) or B) anyone actually WANT to be around that many people again? 

Schools may find kids learn better taking class online (I don’t know, I’m just throwing stuff out there). What if 5 years from now only a few schools are around (let’s say for parents who don’t have another option) and 80% of kids around the world have school online? It becomes the “norm” and anyone who actually went to a school with other students will be “ancient”. 

Shopping used to be done in person but more and more people are ordering things online and getting them delivered almost as quick as driving themselves. Teens would go to the mall with no money and just hang out because of whatever reason...I actually don’t know why that was a thing. 

More and more jobs are finding they can actually be done remotely. It may be beneficial to some companies who no longer have to worry about renting a space big enough for 5,000. Especially when  employees can do the same thing at their own home. 

Maybe I’m just over thinking it (which is entirely possible) but I feel like the way we socialize with each other is coming to an end. If we don’t have a reason to leave the house, will we ever the house?",28Nov2020,1
75,"*For the past one year, I've been facing constant rejections for my job applications.*  
***Yesterday these thoughts just flowed through me that made me feel better***\*.\*  
*And I want to share them here for all those constantly facing rejections in their life.*  
(**Its got a happy ending!**)

When more and more rejections keep coming, you continue questioning every bit about yourself, your notions, ideas, as a person who you are, what you believe in, your processes, methods, etc. Someone like me, would critically analyze down to every molecule or atom in their mind and body.  
That: 'Am I doing it right? Am I living life the way its meant to be lived or the way its needed? Why does nothing work out? What is this constant rejections teaching me?'

Such critical questioning sometimes make you break down the romantic notions and dreams you build about life and that you just desperately hope to at least survive. That's all.  
You just hope you make it through the bare minimum and survive while the grand plans in life that you make, get washed away by the tears of constant rejection along with the other elaborate ideas, dreams, wishes and hopes.

Every rejection further only dents your confidence you have about your professional skills. Fear of further future rejection is accentuated by a constant reminder that a lack of job to grow and to showcase your skills, will make your skills rusty.

You keep telling yourself: ""This too shall pass"" and hear the echo ""…with no end in sight…"". You continue to ask yourself, where is it going wrong?  
You are very curious about seeking more knowledge and understand how things work in your field.  
You constantly update yourself with the happenings.  
You help people who reach out for your for help without any expectations, those who you personally know, as well as those you don't.  
You do it because you believe in making yourself helpful to others when they sincerely need and reach out, and take out time for them, in principle, without any expectations of karmic rewards.

And you continue to do this while you are taking care of your own mental health.

You're working on yourself. Perhaps you keep telling yourself to be kinder to yourself but these worries don't allow you to be that way.

You are consistent in your healing practices and journaling but it still feels a little painful to get more rejections at the end of the day.

And you find it hard to fall asleep. Everyday.

And despite all this, surprisingly, you still somehow wake up and are naturally happy and still continue doing all that you can.  
Because, you think that you figured out how to be happy: you've learnt to slowly come out of the trap of Conditional happiness.

Even though all these rejections keep pulling you back, you still want to move ahead.

In the process, you've learnt to love yourself.  
You're doing well.  
Keep going.",28Nov2020,1
76,"Most of my peers are married and I feel that they're are way ahead in their emotional journey in their life. I'm still finding it hard to hold small promises to myself in my relationships (to self).   
I'm happy for them, although I'm finding in increasingly a little difficult to feel a connection with them.

Sometimes, I feel left behind when I see my peers having healthy family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and connect with people generally on a personal level, while my trauma induced trust issues make me sabotage every possible relationship that comes my way. 

While I'm not trying to compare, I cannot help but see them and question the quality of my own life and perception towards relationships.   
Even though I'm happy to see this progress (whatever it is right now) and look forward to making myself get better over time, sometimes when many other things don't seem to be going well, life feels a little dry. 

People in your age group did not experience life/childhood altering painful or traumatic experiences absolutely had an advantage over you.   
Your brain was focused on survival, while they were free to grow and develop. You may feel left behind but you were doing your best to survive. 

You might still be learning how to thrive in your relationships with others, personally and professionally.   
You might still be learning to hold a steady job. You might still be learning how to best care for yourself.

I was young I didn't know any better and I was depressed and was tired of having my lesbian friend at the moment hammer me with bs I didnt need to hear when I was just trying to get off my feet. I was alone I didnt have good friends around and the only one I deemed ok always told me horrible things. that would make me feel worse. so I just stayed home. I didnt know anywhere else to go I had a group of girls I knew as friends to keep me company but it always ended up with me either smoking or drinking. this was in my early 20's from age 21- 24  I had a few girlfriends but my head was never in the right place it fucked everything up for me even more. I hated myself until I broke up with the last one I had and stayed single ever since.  im 29 now still live at home worked for my father for a couple of years from age 26 to now to fix things. never spoke to anyone from my past again until recently the one I liked as a person female friend came back into my life and shed some light on me. and made me realize I was doing things the wrong way ad it made me reorganize my head. im pissed I kept fucking up in college and having to work mediocre jobs to pay for classes that felt like I was being insulted. atm,28Nov2020,1
81,"i have, for the longest time, heard stories and even experienced how an individual may identify with characters they come across in fictional novels or films or tv shows. for a while they might even become like the character (dressing up like them or picking up their mannerisms) - until they later find a new one to relate to.

this might sound vague, but here goes: i understand that the world around us shapes who we are as people, and parts of it remain in us, but how does someone who immerses themselves in these stories and identify with characters regularly find the difference and figure out who they really are?

95,"So I just want your opinions on this.

I have a full-time corporate job and make pretty good money. I could afford to rent a nice apartment on my own. I currently live with my boyfriend of 2 years in his apartment.

He works full -time (8-10 hours a day) for his parents, and their way of paying him is letting him live in one of the apartments they own for free. They also send him like $50 to $100 a week, so he can buy groceries. I guess it's nice of them, but he generates a lot of income for them, and they don't even spend 5% of it on him. I know that he will inherit these things eventually, but not for another 20 years or more, and if it weren't for him, they would need to actually hire someone to do what he does and pay them an actual salary.

Next month they are moving out of their current house, and want us to move into it. I'm kind of uncomfortable with this because I'll be living in someone's house, it won't feel like my own place. Of course, I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to live somewhere for pretty much free, but I just don't know if it's worth it. The place is very dated, it's a 100 yo house that hasn't been renovated in over 20 years. The parents want to leave everything there, from furniture to bedding to silverware. I don't want it. I already know I can't put any of my money into (some much needed) renovations, and my boyfriend thinks that we don't need to change a thing. 

I decided to compromise and agree to leave everything as is, the only thing I wanted to do is to re-do the living room. It's very dark and old-fashioned (dark brown chesterfield couches, ""antique"" furniture, not ideal for a young couple). The parents agreed to take the living room furniture with them and put it in their basement. 

 I set aside around $3,000-$4,000 for a new couch, coffee table, rug, and all of that, so I could feel like the place is at least a little ""me"". 

I talked to my boyfriend, and he offered to get one of the little coffee tables, it was $160 (on sale for $120 on Black Friday) which was nice, but his parents would have had to be the ones to buy it since he has no real income. They said no, and told him to keep their current coffee table because ""it's still good"". It's not an issue for me to buy it, but ""they don't think it's a good idea"". 

I feel like this was my breaking point, it's hard to date someone who's an adult and can't even buy a small coffee table. And I don't love the idea of living in his parents' home, since they're all clearly very attached to the place, and will be getting mad at me for touching/changing anything (and I really don't want to live there long-term the way it is now).

I've talked to my boyfriend about all these issues multiple times, and he just tells me not to worry and that it will be ""our place"".

I feel bad, but if I don't move in there it will be weird to continue dating, and I love him and don't want to break up, but this whole situation is starting to take a toll on me.

Sometimes I second guess their love for me. We argue constantly over little things but honestly it’s got to the point where I don’t speak to them. I live with thrm but I eat upstairs and stay in my room most of the time. They’re just so draining to be with I just get moaned at n every time I see them it’s another argument.

They also hardly let me go out and if they do they moan about it. My mum has anxiety where she can’t do certain things and it’s impossible to get her help at the moment but when I was younger I went through the same thing n just got laughed at by her she did get me help from a doctor but after a long time n by then it was me tht helped myself. Now that it’s her she wants my help but she is draining me n that sounds bad but I can’t tell u how much she puts it on and I’m not just saying tht.

Tired to the point that I lack the motivation to work. I'm apathetic about everything, don't care about life or death, and I just want to sleep and never wake up.  What I hate is that I know that after a few hours, maybe a night of sleep, I'll be back to normal only for it to flare back up sometime later.

If you treat one person *better* than another person just simply because they are part of a certain group, you’re discriminating against the second person. 

It doesn’t matter if you’re ‘nice’ to both of them, or ‘rude’ to both of them. If you treat one group better than another solely based on that they are part of that group, that’s discrimination. You don’t have to be committing hate crimes to be discriminatory, you don’t need to be evil to be discriminatory, you don’t need to be a blatant asshole to be discriminatory. 

Sometimes humans are discriminatory without even realizing that we are. Discrimination is the biased treatment of different categories of people. 

In my opinion we would be able to break down our societal walls and form actual bridges so much faster if we could just acknowledged this, and stop demonizing it (but not condone it, more so just accepting this as what it is); that way we could ***ACTUALLY*** work on understanding why this happens, how to stop it happening in the newer generations, and stop outcasting people simply for not understanding. 

Before you go off in the comments let me say this: hate crimes ARE real, and they should NOT be taken lightly. But I believe that this isolation we have put between groups simply because some people haven’t had the resources externally and internally to understand what discriminatory behaviors are, has been a key factor in breeding this actual *hate* that some people feel. 

Humans don’t like unknown variables, we’ve been like that for centuries, so why the actual fuck are people who claim to be activists for whatever cause they are apart of trying to forcibly throw people into unknown situations and then gasping when they react with ignorance and hate (which is just another type of fear)? Activism should bring groups together, not separate them.

104,"My boyfriend's mind absolutely shattered this past week. The past year he became a daily user of weed, combined with his emotional trauma PTSD that he never sought therapy for, and deeper delving into conspiracy theories of all kinds. I have another thread on this account where you can see how our relationship was being negatively affected by this.

My heart is racing. We were all alone here in Canada, he moved to be here with me, after being in a long distance relationship. You can see in my profile how our relationship dynamic deteriorated due to his weed usage.

The few months before, his PTSD got the better of him, all he could talk about was his trauma. Our daily conversations were that. I did my best to listen to him, to ask him to forgive himself, but he never broke the cycle of regret, self-loathing and painful memories.

His psychotic episode started bubbling up on friday, when a painful repressed memory came back, which shattered his sexual identity and his view of the world. He cried for 3 days straight. After months of trying to help him, dealing with his weed consumption, and generally helping him because he is a severely co-dependent person, I told him I no longer wished to be with him. I went to a friend's house that day because my logic was that I needed fresh air and to see a friendly face, and that he needed that too.

After I came back, he was talking i short, disconnected sentences. His brother who is a psychologist contacted me shortly after and explained to me that what he was going through was a psychotic episode and needed to go to the ER. So I took him. During all this my boyfriend changed his mind. He wants therapy, now he wants help. I am so happy he was finally saying the words.

He stayed in the ER overnight and I went home. He kept calling me from a nurse's phone, that everyone was laughing at him, that he didn't need to be there, that he wanted to home. He manages to sound lucid when he needs to, and somehow left the hospital without a psychiatric evaluation, just a prescription for risperdol and seroquel.

So  I had to bring him back home. Yesterday I explained to him that he needs to go back, that these medications are strong, with terrible side effects and that we need to treat this very carefully. The stress of this must have triggered another episode, so he disconnected from reality.

This time I didn't let him leave, I stayed with him as he was talking to the doctor, he kept trying to tell the staff that he just wanted some fresh air, that I was the one who was crazy. He finally told me to fuck off, that I am a leech and a parasite, that I smother him. Today he is a closed psychiatric unit, and will be there for a few days.

I feel anxious, guilty and terrible. I have spoken to his family to let them know I think he needs to go back to the US. Even though I am no longer his girlfriend I will help him with all this. I feel guilty, that it's my fault that he is in this situation, that maybe he really is ok and I wrongly put him in. His family and my friends are assuring me I did the right thing, but this hurts so much.

This whole year he was smoking  weed everyday while sinking hours into videogames or conspiracy podcasts. He was also self-medicating with it as a means to cope with his PTSD and trauma. After all this, I hope he goes back to being the funny, kind guy I once knew and fell in love with. I really do wish him all the best, but he sought the wrong solutions to very painful and deep problems.

114,"When your kidneys are healthy, they remove fluid from your blood.  As you progress through kidney failure, your kidneys remove less and less fluid from your blood, until they entirely stop removing any.  How much you pee keeps decreasing until you don't pee at all.  My joke is that you become a member of the Nopi Culture.  But it's not funny, because total cessation of kidney function means that you're always tired, and can need to lie down to rest every half an hour.  That has to do with hemoglobin, a component of your red blood cells.  With kidney failure your hemoglobin can really crash and make you feel like you spend three-quarters of your day trying to sleep in order to get some rest.

Hemodialysis really helps with these problems.  They hook you up to a machine that cleans your blood in a way similar to how kidneys do it, and also removes excess fluid from your blood.  In the early stages of kidney failure, you have dialysis three times a week, every second day twice and then every third day once.  Over time it becomes necessary to do that five times a week. There might even be a point in time when you need dialysis seven days a week, but I haven't gotten to that point.

Hemodialysis is for three or four hours at a time.  So here are the gross facts I promised in my header.

About two and a half to three hours into a four-hour session, you start to burp and fart like crazy.  That's because excess fluid had built up in your stomach and intestines.  Water is removed from your intestines by the small intestine, which has a bigger diameter than your large intestine but is much shorter.  No, it doesn't make any sense, but that's how it is.  The small intestine knows whether to remove water from its own interior by balance of water pressure inside and outside it.  As your kidneys fail to remove water, the water pressure on the outside of your small intestine becomes the same as or greater as the water pressure inside your small intestine.  At that point, unless you're smart enough to cut off your drinking and consumption of some foods (such as ice cream, jello, and yogurt), you start filling up your small intestine with fluid, and that fluid gets backed up in your large intestine and your stomach.  Both passing gas and burping is inhibited by being waterlogged.  As dialysis removes fluid from your blood, your large intestine starts to dry out the contents of your gut.  All that gas that has been inhibited from leaving your body by the excess fluids in your gut ends up coming out BOTH ends.  Dialysis makes you a storage device for dissolved gas with a valve that's sporadically overactive.

What's even more gross is that you have to sit down to pee even if you're a guy, and chances are you're going to poo because your feces is wet.  If you have a hard cough you have to clench your anus to avoid pooping your pants.  The stools look normal, with maybe a smaller diameter than you're used to, but bizarrely the fact that you urinate a lot less means that you're a lot readier to shit yourself at any moment.

I'm exhausted from being depressed and fighting through it, never having fun, everything I try to do being met with great compliments but never finding a community, from being the only one I know who's into anything I love, from thinking about how to get through the days and all the self improvement stuff, trying to force myself to eat well and not let the depression be an excuse to let everything fall apart since I know I'm a very jubilant person at heart, the constant being in your head with no one to talk to. I'm just fucking exhausted.

I'm slowly moving from depression into some sort of numb acceptance simply because this depression is totally unsustainable, but I'm just fucking mentally exhausted, and it sounds silly, but I didn't really realize why until just now.",28Nov2020,1
120,"In less than three months all my personal confidence has been stripped. I never thought I was particularly good at anything but I was starting to find my confidence... Now that's all gone. I always knew you were out of my league but I accepted that you wanted to be with me because I was starting to believe in myself. 

You are far more intelligent than I am. You are more well read and educated. You speak at least four languages better than I speak my native tongue. You are an amazing, incredible woman and I was humbled you'd chose me. 

Now I know it's only a matter of time before your frustration with my ignorance grows intolerable. You've put up with me so well but you've shown me that even what confidence I had was deluded. I used to think of myself as intelligent, clever and even funny sometimes. Now I know I'm just a pretty face and a nice body. I know now that any talk of my potential was just lies. 

All I am is eye candy and that's all I'll ever be. Even still, I know I could never hope to do better than you. So, now I will be seen and not heard. I will assume I am in the wrong when we disagree. I will keep my gaze low and my voice soft because asserting myself would only drive you away. 

You're teaching me to accept my place and not overstep my boundaries and for that, I thank you. If my delusional state continues, I'll lose everything, including you. I don't know what I am anymore but I still want you.",28Nov2020,1
