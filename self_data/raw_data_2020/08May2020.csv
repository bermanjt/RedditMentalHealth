0,"Sorry if this is nerdy but hear me out. These are 4 (relatively) simple and elegant equations that describe *all* electromagnetic effects as we know them. I'm talking about every single circuit you can think of; from the electric power network that our current (no pun intended) society is built upon, to the digital circuits in the device that you're reading this on. And not only circuits, they predict the existence and describe the behaviour of electromagnetic waves (light, radio waves, wifi, x-rays just to name a few) created via electricity. We're talking about all the telecommunication we enjoy including wifi, cellular service, bluetooth and even fiber optics. 

What's amazing is that you'd expect all these different things to each require peculiar equations or theories to explain them, yet 4 concise equations capture everything with amazing robustness. What's even more amazing is that these equations were formulated and published between 1861 - 1864 and electromagnetic waves predicted by these equations were only demonstrated about 25 years later By Heinrich Hertz. Imagine a theory so comprehensive that it can predict phenomena before they are even demonstrated in reality.

Famous physicist Albert Einstein said that his work was inspired by that of Maxwell and his formulation of electromagnetics. When he was asked if he stood on the shoulders of Newton concerning his revolutionary theory of relativity and gravity, Einstein replied ""No. On the shoulders of Maxwell.""  Maxwell is indubitably the most significant physicist coming after Newton and before Einstein.

I just needed somewhere to express my appreciation for these equations and the scientist that composed them. 

If anyone is interested, here are the [equations](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/maxeq.html).

And here is a short biography of [Maxwell](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Clerk-Maxwell).

1,"I just need to write this because it was just so weird. I just remember feeling weak in my dream, someone sat me down and told me they were concerned that I might have it. I didn’t believe it and right after she said that a wave of heat ran through my body and i could hardly see or move. You could hear her say “oh god” and distance herself. I felt so bad because there was a group of people there I thought I contaminated. This is when I started having bad fevers in the dream. That’s all I remember, needless to say I thought it was real and it was pretty scary. Scary times, man.",08May2020,1

We would go as often as possible with friends and family just because everyone could eat. Even if one person couldn't pay, they could still eat because we would help chip in. Lots of good times and long talks were had there. Literally never a bad day whenever we would have the fattest salad possible or make a really stupid looking ice cream thing.

7,"I moved to where I live now back in 2017, and while I've made inroads to making some friends, to a lot of people I know and consider a friend, I feel like I'm not wanted around, I'm treated with kids gloves, that most people lie to my face, or that I'm a creepy weirdo that no one wants to hang out with. I'm not a bad looking person, I'm actually quite friendly and want to get along with everyone, but I'm socially awkward and I've made mistakes and faux pases in the past that I feel others unfairly hold against me without my knowledge. I really wish everyone I know would just tell me to my face what they really think about me, even if some of it really hurts, just so I know who to invest into and who to just not bother with anymore. Sometimes I feel like just moving back to my hometown and starting over again, but then I get caught up with the few friends I actually DO have, who DO have my back, and actually like and enjoy my company and friendship and not wanting to leave them just yet. But most of the time I feel very alone, and not wanted around.

Basically, I'm paranoid that too many people I know are politie to my face, hiding how they really feel, instead of just telling me to fuck off.",08May2020,1
8,"7 years ago, a high school acquaintance of mine died in a tragic quad accident. He was 15. It was a horrible, freak accident. He has a twin brother who is now 22. I just learned today he overdosed and passed away. 

Twin brothers are both dead from separate tragic deaths. I can’t even imagine how their parents must feel. 

Well, I saw on Facebook that this woman (someone from the community?) posted that she is arranging a drive by vigil to give support to the parents. 

I kinda got sick to my stomach? I feel like that is so inappropriate. I understand she might mean well but they just lost another child. I personally wouldn’t want a parade of cars outside my house when I’m mourning my son.",08May2020,1

10,"He was such a good boy, he was always there for us.

About a month ago in a vet visit we found out he had anemia, started treating it. Two weeks ago he stopped eating and was always laying down not doing anything and throwing up. We took him to the vet on Monday.

The doctor was such a sweetheart. She was always sending me pictures and videos of him, and she stayed with him into the night. She sent me photos of him at 5 P.M. I can not even begin to thank her for what she did to him.

He passed away today. He wasn't in pain, his liver just went and he fought so hard to keep going. The doctor said she didn't even know where he was pulling the strength to fight. Such a good boy.

I hit my credit limit and had my hours cut, I am struggling a bit, but I will manage. The only thing that sucks is that my birthday is 10 days from now, and I will not even have a way to celebrate.

Funny thing is that I also lost my cat around this time of year, 2 years ago. Was also in a very similar situation, incredibly lonely, and this just broke me.

14,"When i used to be in 5th standard i used to have an Art teacher. She was the worst teacher I ever had. I used to be really good at art. If not good but atleast good enough. We used to have an art book where left side of the page were the paintings printed and we had to copy the same exact thing on the right side. Once we had to make galaxy painting.  I had tried my best. It looked nice. All my friends loved it. I think it was the best work for me at that time. I went to her to get it graded. She looked at it. Took her red pen and crosses the entire thing. My heart just fucking sank right their. I said ""what are you doing?"" She said ""it's not like the painting on the left"". I said ""it's a galaxy ma'am, you really think every colour and brush stroke is gonna match??"" She said ""well if you try..."" 

The annoying thing was that my painiting wasn't even totally different, the annoying thing was that she didn't even appreciate it, the infuriating thing was that their was no fucking place for creativity in her Art class!! How dare she cut out my painiting. I tried to argue with her but obviously didn't won cuz i was way to young to have that much courage. At the end she just said ""try again next time and show it to me in the next class"". I cried that day. Took a week. Made all the painitings in my book as I wanted it to be. Next class I went upto her. Gave my book and never sat into her class for the entire year. Good thing she left the school next year. 

I hated her. She made me insecure about my creativity. All the teachers who supress a kid's way of thinking and want everything to look perfect....seriously fuck you! Hate it when school always say to ""embrace your inner self"" but at the end wants you to write a 500 word essay on a topic you have zero interest in.",08May2020,1

16,"I've spent a bit over a year trying the whole 'At the end of the day, note things your grateful for' thing... I'm terrible at it. 

I really struggle to come up with one thing a day, and it's depressing. I know my life's not bad enough that it should be that hard. I know I have a good life, a good job, a great girlfriend, plenty that others don't have. 

I don't know why its so hard! I think it's some kind of ego thing, I feel like I can't be grateful for things I myself do or cause to happen.... But is that a fair conceit?

Am I letting my pride get in the way of being grateful?

I'll give you some examples: 

I live in Hawaii, it's gorgeous weather over here pretty much every day. I should be grateful for it, but I choose to live here, I moved here from the northeast US, abd it was hard, I was broke but I made it work. I could choose not to live here, or I could have never come, how can I be grateful for it if I made it happen?

It's the same with work... If I have a good day, or something particularly great happens related to my job, I don't feel like I can be grateful for it because I earned the position in an interview, I closed the sale that day, or built a relationship that caused whatever I'm happy about to happen, so why would I thank my stars or my luck that it happened, it seems like I should thank me, which I don't want to do I just want to be grateful to the universe or whatever

Can I be grateful for something I did/accomplished? It doesn't feel like I can be.

The easiest times I've had feeling grateful is with things I 100 % don't control....

Running into an old colleague I hadn't seen in ages, or having a surprise good meal, finding a 10er in my pants pocket, a full moon or a nice sunset, etc. Serendipitous things. 

But those aren't every day things. I'm trying to grow my gratitude to be grateful for other things, at least one a day, and I don't think I'm doing it, gang. 

Any help/advice/discussion is GREATLY appreciated, I have no issues with that at all.",08May2020,1
17,"And today she says shes going to delete it. Why? Because she found herself waking up at 7am and thought she'd have a look around on there for a bit before starting her day.

18,"Since I was a kid, I always wanted to be the one who tells my playmates what to do. I always wanna be in control. During high school, I pretended to be shy and introverted for months and did my best and maintained being the topper of the class. I did it for attention. At home, I play the piano very loud and always played the fastest pieces, needless to say, for attention. I live in wanting attention all the time. I want people to adore my talent and outside beauty. It went on for years until I reached college. I spent most of the time flirting online and actually stopped caring about school. I studied biology btw and although it was hard, I did it for my great sense of entitlement. Long story short, I pretended to have mental illness. I studied how schizophrenic people act and behave and I imitated it. I was put on meds I remember it was abilify an antipsychotic drug. I dropped out of college and spent the rest of my year being watched and taken care of. 

So basically, I drank multiple tablets at once and stopped taking them all at one. All I wanted that time was to lie in bed and have people treat me like I'm a special and important person. Months later, I started feeling actually ill and the worst was I suspected everyone who talks are puposedly trying to annoy me. My sister became my main enemy and I always thought she's attacking me Everytime she speaks. I didn't know I could become a real psycho by doing that stupid mistake. It went on and I lost my sense of identity and always felt like I was being controlled by someone else why I watched myself moved and talked. Good thing is that I'm not in that bad... It's a little manageable at times I guess.

It's a compulsion I can't shrug off. I always want a freaking ATTENTION. No one believes me no more... I got kicked out and guess what... I'm still acting childish and wanting attention all the time. I want this to stop but I also don't.",08May2020,1
19,"I feel a little shy posting this but also euphoric and I want to share my happiness. 

I have a ""crush"" I suppose, I mean we both really love each other a lot a lot... but due to living halfway across the world from each other of course we cannot be together.

Anyways he told me out of the blue ""yesterday"" was his birthday and I was like, ""What!! you didn't even tell me and I missed it."" But him being in a time zone 6 or so hours ahead he was like, ""Well where you are it's still today"" so in a way I technically didnt miss it so i was glad :') 

I asked if he did anything for his birthday. I know recently his parents got a divorce, he mentioned because of the divorce as well as because of COVID-19, he didnt celebrate. He said he didnt really care much. And that just knowing me and talking to me was enough of a gift (cheesy, I know, but I love that sentimental stuff lol) 

But still I felt kinda bad that he didnt even get to celebrate at least with his family at home or anything. So I sent him a video of me singing happy birthday to him and drew a little homemade birthday card for him. I drew a little soccerball/football because he likes to play and drew a little cartoon face of him wearing a party hat and confetti. And lots of hearts. He was really happy about it. I probably sound like I'm 12 years old but I dont care I was happy that he was happy and he deserves a happy birthday!!!!

anyways no real point to this post other than me just wanting to share my love

The worse thing is that there's only ever one donut with vanilla icing without filling and then I'm stuck without any good donuts. All the other ones are chocolate and I've never been a big fan of chocolate flavored things.

But, I realized something. When I get to college, or at least old enough to get a job, I can buy a dozen donuts, from Dunkin Donuts, and they'll be whatever flavor I want. I could get a dozen strawberry icing donuts, with rainbow sprinkles, and eat them all myself. Nobody would be able to stop me since I would basically be alone.

Larger, more immediate, and/or repeated rewards are **needed** to sustain motivation. Ultimately, the pursuit of those pleasurable rewards can become a potent form of self-medication.""

I've noticed a few days ago that this feeling comes back. Feelings of sudden emptiness are striking me from time to time. I have ADHD, and it's extremely connected to need for stimulation. It's almost like diabetics need insulin. We need adrenaline and dopamine to feel good. I can't stop this process so easily. A few days ago I felt it for the first time after a few weeks being fine, and now I am feeling this again. It's just matter of time when more severe boredom and emptiness will strike me. I know myself so well, and I know how it works. It always starts from feeling a bit empty after someething, and if it's not alleviated it keeps progressing and causing many unpleasant symptoms, like, doing something risky to alleviate that, emotional outbursts, impulsivity, mental and physical tiredness. 

I noticed I started eating a bit more recently than I used to it. Yesterday I ate 4 litres of ice cream. My brother said, I am constantly seeing like you are going to and fro with a new portion of ice cream xD That's right. When I ate one portion, I kept going to take another one, and it was 10 portions in  one day alltogether haha xD Not something to be proud of, but you know, that's fucking awesome.

In the past there was a time when I ate 5 big packages of cheetos in one day.

 It's also a clear sign it comming. Usually food is the first ""option"" to alleviate that. When we are hyperfocused, energized and fixated on something, we tend to eat much less, but when there is the flipside we tend to have problems with overeating. 

Soon I will start taking new meds for ADHD with dopamine, so I hope it will help. I am not afraid of anything in my life except for this empty feeling. I know how to go through these ""empty"" episodes, but it always scary. I don't know how normal people feel emptiness, but with ADHD it looks like:

* Apathy, feels like nothing matters, nothing is important that much
* You are scared of this empty feeling, it's extremely uncomfortable and you try took for something to alleviate that. Usually it's everything what gives dopamine. It might be food, risky behavior, doing something new without proper calculation, buying, browsing porn sites more often xD, things that give adrenaline. running etc.
* Actually now I don't care about writing this here, but I will force myself to type it. GODDDD, today I will have to do some paper work, and feel too lazy to even think about it. But have to find some energy and motivate myself to focus on it!

Luckily I have found things that help me with these episodes to some extent. It's to focus on some goals, things I want to achieve, daydream positively about them, it will keep driving me and motivating me. Try to find new music, and of course just be positive. I will start taking some meds with dopamine, maybe even today, so will be fine.

Now my mood is very decent, so ít's still fine. But it sucks, because I need to do some paper work today, but actually now I want to dance,.

27,"With recent events that have taken hold, and the people being more open than usual, I have been constantly thinking about leaving the country. For good. With the young man getting shot just for running and DEFENDING HIMSELF! I'm a woman, but these people look like me. They have darker skin and have goals and dreams. They don't ask to be treated like animals to be slaughtered, or criminals to be questioned. THEY'RE PEOPLE! 

I have been thinking, ever since I came back to the US, how I was treated outside of the US. I was treated like a decent person. Like a human. Like someone with a personality and more than just a color of skin. I know other countries have their issues, but I'm tired of the color of my skin being the main reason people judge me. I'm tired of it. I just want to feel like I'm a person man. Just a normal person who doesn't have to put on a gigantic act so I can be semi-respected by people who don't respect me in their heads. 

So as of yesterday, I started my long term goal of moving out of the US. Out of the country I served. Out somewhere else where I can feel safe, where I don't have a marker placed on my head because of my skin. I know this might get downvoted but idc.

29,"I'm gonna make this as short as possible, but that's not usually my strong suit, so bear with me. The bolded bits are the main points.

**Context:** Parents got divorced back in '17, the year I graduated high school. My dad met and got engaged to someone new all within the span of like, 6 months (after taking maybe 9 off between separation and meeting this new woman). She's very kind, her kids are great, no complaints there. 

My mum was very abusive growing up (emotionally/physically/alcoholic - so the works, basically) but she has since done a 180 I literally didn't think was possible for anyone before I saw her do it -- which looking back now, is kind of embarrassingly naive of me, but when it's all you've known your whole life and you're attending AA meetings with your mum at 14, the world is pretty bleak that way. Post-divorce, her and I became genuinely very close and I have a newfound appreciation and love for her. I still keep an eye out for old behaviours, but she's been on a huge upward trajectory the past 4-5 years, with certainly no complaints from me. 

**TL;DR: My dad, who I used to be close with pre- my parents getting divorced, is emotionally distant and I barely speak to him anymore.** ***Post-*****divorce, I've discovered he actually has a huge ego, is emotionally distant, can see** ***no*** **wrong with himself, and has a huge ""alpha male"" complex, while resolutely pretending he** ***doesn't*** **have an ""alpha male"" complex and is** ***so much better*** **than other men because of this (so, ya know, alpha male complex).** He hasn't changed at all post-divorce (see: can see no wrong with himself) and I have trouble feeling like myself around him because in all honesty, with no change to his ways in sight, I am constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop, and waiting for the cycle to be repeated since he is living in his own little egotistical systematic mind bullshit that *cannot* diagnose its own flaws. And if the divorce of his wife of almost 30 years, if the gradual estrangement of his daughter who he used to be very close to not even 5 years ago, if losing his job and becoming broke (which is a whole other can of worms) ...if these things aren't enough to shake him, what the fuck is?

I sound like my mother talking about him, but I see what she sees. I wish I'd never known anything about what goes on between my parents (and that's honestly more his doing than hers, historically speaking, though both are guilty of over-sharing). **TL;DR: But he is** ***contractually*** **obligated to pay for almost everything of mine (divorce contract). My food, school, housing. So I feel like a complete, total,** ***idiot*** **fucking brat for complaining. But he tends to hold these things over my head and use them in the occasional arguments we have and is otherwise...aloof. But I feel fucking crazy, like it's just me that sees it, so I talk to my mother, and my grandfather, who both reaffirm me that no, I'm not, he's controlling and he's egotistical and acts like a child, but I feel like they forget that he's also my** ***father*** **(and they** ***gotta*** **be biased, no?)*****.*** **And I know that he tries hard to be a good dad, which hurts so badly to think about, but he just cannot admit his fault in anything, holds things over my head, and has controlling tendencies.** The not-changing is what gets me the most. The rest of my life has moved on, improved exponentially, but he remains stagnant and set in his ways and I'm terrified of the cycle just...continuing. Of his new fiancé waking up one day and seeing what my mother saw, seeing what I see, seeing that all his merits are just cover-ups for his flaws and a need to be seen a certain way and leaving him and my life being uprooted again just when it's supposed to start and I have all this ambition and all this drive and all this *opportunity.* 

So I don't know what to think anymore, but my PTSD is seriously acting up being at home from university now (where, by the way, I'm doing fucking *great* and am *damn* proud of myself for it, not that he seems to really care to get to know me or understand me anymore) and I haven't felt this depressed since 2017 but I cannot afford, *literally cannot afford,* to be depressed right now.

But because of this coronavirus, I feel like the recognition isn’t special anymore. Our university gave a good consideration to the students. They gave high grades that made almost every student in our college graduate with honors. Even those who didn’t really work hard for it, they will now also get the product of what I’ve been working hard for so long.

I get that this is an achivement for me because I don't go to a school that's a prep school. (I go to a charter school that basically focuses on getting kids to go to a trade school or community college after their graduate; nothing wrong but it's not like competitive or anything if anyone gets what I'm trying to say.) I basically did this all on my own and I guess that's cool.

but I kind of regret it, you know? I feel older then my peers who just seem a lot more carefree then me and have had a lot of time to do shit in their life. Sometimes my friends from middle school say shit and it just makes me feel older because I can't relate anymore.

39,"I’ve known my best friend since 2nd or 3rd grade (both of us don’t remember at this point) and it wasn’t till the 4th grade did I realize I had a crush on her. I have difficulty expressing my emotions and telling people how I feel to this day so admitting a crush, especially to my best friend who I’ve known most my life, It isn’t easy.

We’re both about to become 18 within a year, and we both have lived relatively shy lives so relationships aren’t common between us, heck I have never been in one. And during this whole time, I’ve felt so lonely and wanting something more with someone and this crush with her, It was hard. 

And it wasn’t till recently that I talked to someone else I’m close with about it, and they told me that I probably shouldn’t go for it since she’s my best friend and I don’t wanna ruin my friendship with her, and you know what, they’re right. I don’t ever wanna lose them through some breakup and let things become awkward between us. I never want to lose them like that. 

So my plan, at some point after this whole pandemic blows over anyways, is admit my experience with my crush towards her and how I don’t wanna possibly ruin our friendship that I value too much (hopefully without having an anxiety attack mid-confession). Then after that, put myself out there and find the perfect one for me while at the same time try and become the perfect one for someone out there.

49,"Oh, I'm an incel? It's not because 80% of consumer spending is done by women who turn the waterways of Asia crimson with carcinogenic dye with their insatiable hunger for things that are discounted by 30% at H&amp;M, nor is it the fact that they all work services because their brain structure means their IQ clusters heavily towards the mean, and it certainly isn't because they perpetuate incredibly destructive single motherhood by voting for the state to pay them for existing so they don't have to deal with icky annoying beta providers. My lived experience of a junkie single mother who ditched a guy for getting a chronic illness and couldn't budget 15 minutes into the future isn't representative of anything at all and I need to see a professional gaslighter instead of pay attention to literally the same disaster that is western women unfolding around me constantly. No, it's because I haven't stuck my penis in a vagina. That's it. I hate women because they won't let me have sex with them.

What does this logic suggest? When somebody is a racist everyone gangs up on them and tries to say they live in a gated community with no experience with black people so they don't know anything about what they're actually like. You think X country or group of people sucks? Have you ever actually met one? And as for women, the genius psychoanalysts of reddit believe having any negative feelings about a gender of people who contribute nothing, not even a TFR of 2.1 anymore, is because you can't put your dingleberry inside them.

If women are as normal and great and smart and funny and quirky and interesting and insightful and ""half of humanity brooo"" as people say they are, why on Earth would anyone but the most sexually frustrated man on the planet HATE them for not being allowed into the axe wound between their legs? There would have to be literally no other reason to like women other than the hole between their legs, no redeeming qualities except their vaginas

51,"So my parents had their 25th wedding anniversary, pretty big deal and they decided to go to Fiji, leaving on a Friday and coming back the following Wednesday. This was in my last year of High School, right at the end of the school year, 1 day after the last End-Of-Year Exam. I had never thrown a party before, but I decided, fuck it, I won't get a chance like this ever again. My parents had made it clear to me that it was fine if I had a few people over (I had a regular friend group of about 8 people) but no more than 15, no questions asked. I have semi strict Christian parents that didn't party when they were younger and aren't afraid to hand out punishments to me and my brother. So I invited 50ish people.

I had my best mate come over to help set up and party-proof my house (I have a relatively small house but a big outside area). I'm talking fairy-lights strung up high, all the way around my house and deck, a phat sub woofer and tweeters from my music friends, a free keg from my mate who works at a bar, enough chicken wings to feed hungry party-goers, typical things you need for a party etc. etc.  
I made sure that this party was going to be a good one.

At around 8:00, My closer friend group shows up for pre-drinks and to start getting the music and atmosphere going. Then around 9:00, People start showing up. First the sports boys and their girlfriends, then the tribe of popular girls, then my friends from out of town who wanted to be there to have a good time, and the other randoms showed up scattered between everyone. All was going well. Vibe was near perfect, people were starting to get into the drink, people were dancing, laughing, playing beer-pong and Kings Cup, etc..  
At around 9:45 my stoner friends show up with a big baggie of devil's lettuce and plant themselves on the beanbags outside by my fire-pit (a round fireplace that people can sit around, about the size of a coffee table) and begin to sesh. Through-out the next hour, about 90% of the party proceeds to get absolutely shitfaced, and the other 10% get baked in my beanbags and eat all of the chicken wings that we have.

I am walking around, visiting my mates in each ""group"" that has kinda formed around the party. I return to the outside deck to see how the keg is going and low and behold, my best mate, has passed out on the floor in the middle of the group, with people still trying to put beer into his cup(s), which are now taped to his hands. After drawing all over his face and removing his shirt and pants, someone suggest taping him to a chair, which the group very quickly gets to work on. I leave and walk around to see what else is happening. I go inside for a bit, dance, drink more, and then have a bit of a joint with my mates outside. After chilling a little with them I go over to my driveway to see; A) Someone putting a baseball bat (presumably from one of the drinking games) through someone's car window.  
B) My passed out friend, taped to his chair, now on top of said car, and C) a drunken crowd cheering as the home-run-hitter, takes a bow. (It was his car, and he had done it thinking it was someone elses)

The party antics go on for the rest of the night.

Cue 1:00am.   
Amidst the weed, booze and chicken wings, my phone rings.  
One of my friends, lets call him ""steve"", who was staying sober, had left a little while ago to drive one of our passed out friends home because his parents were super strict and wanted him to come home after the party that night, and Steve had snuck him into his house without his parents seeing him.  
I pick up the phone and its Steve:

""Bro, there's cops at the top of your driveway."" (I live down a long driveway that goes down a hill)

Now, I live in New Zealand where weed is illegal and the drinking age is 18. There were a few people who were 17 at the party. Already risking it by throwing a party in secret from my parents, this was the last thing I wanted to hear on the phone.  
Now, my property backs up onto a neighbor's property, who's driveway is a little further down the road from mine, which provided the perfect getaway route for all the party goers. Party stops and everyone hauls ass over to my neighbor's property, jumping the fence and bolting to their cars down the road.

TURNS OUT, the cops were called on a noise complaint about us, but coincidentally, the neighbors at the top of my driveway were having a small party themselves. The cops went to them, thinking it was us, and just told them to keep the noise down and then left. By then, I had already killed the music (thanks to the phone call) and the cops, didn't hear us further down the driveway. By some stupid luck, I was saved. Steve came down the driveway after the cops left, and a small group of us that stayed (mostly my closer friends) finished the night with a couple of cocktails and a game of drunked truth or dare, which with our good moods after not getting busted, was very, very fun.

Fast Forward 1 week

My parents are home and we have my aunt and uncle and grandparents over cause my parents are showing them the photos they took over in Fiji, some nice beach photos, where they were staying, the tourism stuff they did etc..  
At some point my grandad goes ""well! you must have had fun while your parents were gone!"", to which my mum goes ""yes he had a few friends over, but nothing big.""

I had not told my mum I had anyone over.

I look over at her in shock horror. Seeing my (to her, confused looking) face she elaborated; ""I had his uncle come over to check on him, just to make sure he didn't burn the house down hahah""

My uncle, sitting across from me with the biggest grin on his face, had come down my driveway the night of the party, stopped just short of where we could see him, and had see EVERYTHING. Except, instead of telling my parents that I had a wild party of 50 people which had drugs, excessive alcohol, vandalizing, and cops being called, told my parents that I had a few people over for pizza and a movie.

I apologise in advance for possible mistakes or typos, I'm not a native English speaker.

As a kid I was kind of an impressive quick learner and my skills were expecially good in writing. I would write poems by the age of 7! I came across some old homework of mine and I was impressed: I wouldn't be able to write like that now that I am 27.

So I've always liked writing personal thoughts and letters, it was a way to be friends with myself. 

At some point though I realised that my mother used to read all this personal stuff I wrote, beind my back. I started feeling a sense of shame every time I'd try to write cause I just couldn't be myself anymore now that I knew she was reading and judging me every time.

 I was open about wanting to become a writer and my parents always descoraged me, telling me I should first find a real job. I am thankful that I did, this was good advice. My mom though would straight up want me to stop reading books. I was reading 30 books per month and this was helping me a lot, 'cause I didn't have any real connection with the kids of my age. 

I love my parents very much and for one reason or the other I always thought they're right, having spent much more time than me on this planet must have thought them something, right?

Now: it's a long time that I can't write. Or even read a book from the beginning to the end without feeling kind of heavy. 

Writing triggers a deep sense of shame and suffering inside me and I just can't go past the one page. I can't read what I've already written cause I can't deal with the amount of shame I feel.

I wonder if anyone has felt or still feels the same.

74,"Do not know if this is right section to put this in but recommend me I could post in for support, self hate and mental issues. 

Last night I was talked to by one of my parents almost at 1:30am about my spending in eating out than at home. I’ve had body issues about myself since I was in 140s and now that I gotten bigger, my father and oldest brother( 19) is only only that shows concern sometimes. 

He read through most of my purchases I’ve made recently and is concerned for my health and well being. 

Last night, I probably cried till almost 4:00am and thought about going downstairs at one point to grab a knife and cut myself but I never do it anyhow. I’ve had occasional thoughts of this before. 

I can’t bring myself to do it but it hurts me to think this way occasionally or if I feel hurt or need to lay in bed to do bring comfort for myself to calm down. 

I do not like to have these self hurt thoughts but sometimes I feel like it’s a solution for me even though I don’t wish to.

I am a emotional person, grew up that way in the household and so I bring self hate on myself and overthink too much. I easily bawl myself thinking even my own body image and how far I lost progress after leaving sports and gaining weight. 

When the gyms were open I was self conscious about walking past others seeing my body and having social anxiety not belonging there since most people on gym looked good. I felt left out. I would suck in my stomach during sports meets in tight unis or in public.

I emotionally eat and just eat to eat knowing it is unhealthy for me. I’ll not eat most of the morning in late evening and drink coffee or something to suppress my hunger. 

Most bad part is seeing your parents reaction that their daughter wants to sometimes conflict self harm because I am thought as not ideal beach body girl that was in her 140s years ago.

76," *We all go through some tough times in life, that’s just life. It can’t always be a bed of roses. However life is what you make it. By staying positive through the bad times as well as the good can make all the difference. It also gets you through the tough times with a smile.*  
 *But the big question is “****how do you stay positive when things get tough****?”. Staying upbeat at times like this is the last thing on your mind, but it should be the first, you need to think positively now more than ever. The key to staying positive is to take your mind off your problems and worries and re-energizing your mind, this is especially true when you are having a bad day and you feel sorry for yourself and want to sit down and cry.*  
*Here are some excellent tips for keeping a positive outlook in life no matter what’s going around you.*  
*• If you find yourself around those who are negative then break free from them, negativity has a way of passing from person to person and they will drag you down with them.*

I want to take a risk and get my story out so people can familiarise themselves with me and look at my book as an inspiration.

93,"
I realized I will mostly likely never get a job as a literature professor, and that a PhD in English would be highly impractical and a waste of time. Not because I discovered I didn’t like research or teaching as much as I thought, or wasn’t as good as I thought, but instead because of the state of higher education and the academic job market and waning confidence in my ability to succeed. 

I’m pretty heartbroken by this realization. Becoming a professor has been a dream of mine since high school. Like many students I have fallen totally in love with literature and the life of the mind. I’ve become almost obsessed. 

At times, I feel unsuited to be anything other than a scholar, as though I were built for the academy as opposed to the real world but I understand that life is not all play and most people have to do things they do not really like to get by, even professors, whose jobs are far less idea than I’m making them sound. I also know and need to remind myself constantly that even though I won’t achieve my dream of becoming a professor, it is a luxury to even be able to have that dream. I am trying to be grateful for my incredible education even though it will not land me to dream job.

What advice would you give to a student if she told you this? It sounds stupid but for some reason it is hard to even write this out without crying. I feel a little like a loser. The idea of delegating my literary passion to “hobby” terrifies me. I didn’t realize how much my ego plays into all of this but I’d have a hard time working around Professors, say in a university library or as a department assistant, without feeling painfully inferior, inadequate. In any other position I wouldn’t mind being a subordinate in the least, I don’t know why it would be so hard in academia.",08May2020,1
94,"facebook is great for looking up people from your past and checking in on them. most of the time you get to see that they are doing well... sometimes you find out they are struggling or... well... dead. but at least you get a little closure. one of my favorite things to do is to look up old flings and see how they are doing. i get to see them happy with their family and living life without putting any sort of strain on their relationship by actually talking to them. i know that sounds kind of weird but sometimes late at night its comforting to see that they are well.

i will tell you one type of person you shouldn't look up - assholes. every once in a while i will bump into an asshole from my distant past on facebook. sometimes i stumble upon them accidentally. sometimes i look them up on purpose because i'm a fucking idiot that doesn't learn from my past experiances of looking up asshole.

every. single. time. i look up an asshole from my past they are doing extremely well. now, when i say asshole, i don't mean someone i didn't get along with or didn't like. i am talking about true garbage people that lie and cheat their way through life and deserve a big dose of karma. some of these people are real honest to god rapists.

every. single. fucking. one. has a great life. they have a spouse that is a complete knockout, their kids are little angels, nice big house and solid career that pays well. maybe shit isn't so great behind the scenes but it doesn't matter because they still have all the things i've tried so hard to find. it just blows me away. one of them ended up being a professional athlete with a seven figure contract. it makes me feel like frank grimes from the simpsons. i do my best to be a good person, always do the right thing, work really hard but none of that shit really matters. the gods don't care about that stuff, i don't think.

We kinda stood there a few seconds and then went back to what we were doing. When finished I went to my car and noticed he was in a work van next to me.

97,"I'm ground crew at Swedens largest airport, ARN, and I haven't been there in two months. As ground crew I handle luggage, cargo, check the planes when they arrive, plug in ground power e.t.c. The labour is harsh on the body, the hours are wierd and I had to commute two hours every day. It's the best and most fun job I've ever had. I got to be outside, drive fun vehicles, trucks with 8 carriages after it, and it was a heavy job that made me feel really good physically. Every plane we took care of felt like a great accomplishment when we were finished. It made me happy when I managed to localize luggage that wasn't were it was supposed to be, knowing that I probably just saved someone's holiday from starting out really shitty. The pay was really good. I had long breaks where I could just chill on a couch or talk shit with my colleagues. And working around planes is pretty cool. 

I even miss the commute. At 4 o clock in the morning, the buses are practically empty, and I could read or listen to podcasts while the sun was rising outside the window. It was me-time. Before I went home, I often grabbed a smoothie or a coffee from the McDonalds in the public area of the airport.

I haven't been there in months and it really sucks. I have no idea when and if I can start working again. I dont get paid. The days are blurring together, my sleep schedule is fucked and I dont eat enough. I just sit on my couch, watch endless Netflix, and take occasional walks with my cat.

*** I have stacked the Testosterone on two separate times for 3 months with 200mg Trenbolone Enanthate a week (strength)

***I am a sex addict as well. Anything for instant gratification 

•Some Background:

I have always been an addict and addiction has ruled my life. My usage is at the point I’m afraid help won’t be possible, especially neurologically, but still holding out hope. I would be very surprised if I don’t have neurotoxicity or severe liver and hormone damage. I have pushed the human body about as far as it can go in my short 31 years. I’m honestly surprised my body hasn’t shut down. If you saw me you would think I was in terrific shape but I’m scared that inside it’s a whole different story. 

I have severe ADHD, depression, anxiety and hypersensitivity. After doing some research I believe I have covert narcissistic tendencies too, although I do feel empathy and remorse. I have always been popular socially as I am outgoing, funny, and people genuinely enjoy being around me. I’m not a “bad drunk” or whatever, I know how and love to have a good time. Unfortunately, being fun and partying is what my identity has been wrapped up in. It has me always feeling the need to be “on”. 

I’ve somehow been able to keep up the appearance of functionality and actually have a beautiful girlfriend and high social status but afraid my time is running out. I have lived life in the fast lane and have seen and experienced things a lot of people never will. I always knew there was a time coming when the ride would have to end, even though I told myself I was invincible. That time has come and I need help but I need the RIGHT help. 

I’ve been to and completed rehab twice(stayed relatively clean for a year after the first time in 2013) and they say to addicts that “your addiction/situation isn’t special or different from any other addict’s” but that’s just not true IMO. I have a pretty crazy/different life story and there are a lot of details I haven’t gotten into. I really think I would be a great case study for addiction and the toll it takes on a body, especially the long term effects of a lot of these newer mainstream/popular drugs like MDMA/Ecstasy and legal drugs such as Phenibut and Kratom. 

My main purpose of this post is to get feedback on how you think I should go about getting the proper help. Feel free to remind me how dumb/stupid/careless I’ve been, but please give feedback or anything else along with it. I’m a hardcore addict down to my very core, and have luckily managed to avoid prison and death to this point. Im very fortunate so coming here looking for any suggestions or thoughts on my situation and how I could go about seeking real answers and help would be so much appreciated. 

Thank you in advance to those who have read my ramble and to those who reply. Need more details or have any questions feel free to ask me.",08May2020,1
105,"So I’ve been saving up to build a computer for a while now. I recently started working two jobs and I have the money for it now. But as soon as I got all the money together my dad came out of nowhere and said I needed to fix our car’s side mirror first. He has never brought it up until I talked about buying the computer. So that was pretty frustrating.

I broke the mirror when it GRAZED our EMPTY recycling bin. It pretty much took the whole thing off. But it was still attached for the most part.

Me and my dad estimated that it would cost about 100 to reattach a side mirror. However the actual cost is about 700 dollars... including paint.

So now he’s making me pay for the 700 dollar mirror first... it has been duct taped and works fine as is, it won’t fall. This is damn near the cost of the computer. 

And the ICING on top is the fuckers at the car dealership had to open up the car for god knows what reason and now the breaks need fixed according to them. And the cost of that is 250. How is fixing the brakes (which they obviously tampered with) less expensive then reattaching a mirror...

My whole body felt super unbalanced. I was super dizzy. My body temp started rising and falling and I was sweating (but I realize now that that was from panicking). I had no clue what was going on. 

I stumbled out from my bedroom (mostly so I wouldn’t shit my bed from fear and confusion) to the hallway and just looked at the walls as they just moved around and spun. My whole world was just a Ferris wheel. 

Terrified, I hobbled to my parents room and talked to my mom about what was happening. She just told me to calm down and sit straight for a minute or two. That helped a ton. 

I got a glass of water, got back to my mom and talked to her and told her this story. 

I read up a little and it said that vertigo is caused when something funky happens in your ears and your ear fluids start groovin so your body gets loose haha. That’s an extreme oversimplification of it but that’s the gist. I do have some pretty sensitive ears tbf so I don’t really put it above me but I also think it was caused by me sitting on my bed at that super odd angle.

108,"Hi folks! Who knew I would ever be writing a reddit post asking for advice about my pretty good life. Long story short, I’m highly educated, employed, and in a long term relationship. You would think all these things would keep me boundlessly joyful, but I’m slipping into a weird time in my life. 

I hate my job. I don’t feel appreciated and even though I work from home now, I still wake up every morning dreading the start of the day. Sometimes on the brink of tears. I’ll even get anxiety during the day thinking about how many more hours I have to work and I’ll feel like I just want to burst out of my skin. With COVID-19, there are a lot of hiring freezes so I feel pretty trapped in this job.  

I’ve also just got a general sort of melancholy, existential crisis thing going on. I will be with friends or even with my partner and I’ll act engaged and happy but almost every single day is tinged with sadness. One of the saddest days I had was when I graduated with my Masters. The whole day I smiled and hugged family and friends but inside I felt terrible, incomplete, and sad. This degree was supposed to bring me immense pride and I felt like a charlatan. My family thinks I have it all together, that I’m a huge success, but I’m really just a fucking actor, a liar. Sort of a ghost. It’s exhausting pretending to be this perfect person. 

I feel like I’ll never have the life that I imagined for myself. When I was younger I imagined myself traveling and learning and writing and growing. But now it’s hard to even take the 2 month old nail polish off my toes or clean my shower or take out the trash. I feel like I am letting my younger self down. Everyday is the exact same and nothing different ever happens to me. I hardly feel passionate about anything anymore.

I am always hesitant to say I’m depressed. I’ve seen how clinically depressed people are and I am far from that. Although I feel that ongoing sadness running in the background, I can still be functional in my normal life. I’ve been to counseling before and that helped some, but it also made me revisit some painful things from my past. It would sometimes make me feel worse to go to counseling and to talk about these negative emotions. My partner is aware of these issues and has supported me immensely, but people can’t fix other people. You have to fix yourself. 

Has anyone else felt like this? How did you kick it? Is this normal? Either way I just needed to get this out!",08May2020,1

115," I've been in a private school all my life and I hate it. My teachers destroyed my self esteem and they give you a dumb amount of homework. They expect so much from you. I have pretty good grades and close friends but what makes this so miserable is how much money they take from us and the TEACHERS ESPECIALLY. My english teacher made everything so miserable. She always had this smug look on her face when we did something wrong and she gets pissed off so easily. She's so simple- minded and it seems like were never right. She says stuff like if you have a questions don't be afraid to ask and when we ask she gets sort of annoyed? Also, for some reason she really liked this student that was that typical student that tells the teacher about turning in the homework, always asking questions (even though there pretty stupid sometimes), SNITCHING, and u get the idea. Sorry if my grammar is god awful I just wanted to rant about how much private schools suck. I've never in my life hated someone so much that I wished she's just disappear. Now that were in quarantine and we have to do zooms, she has even less patience. She gets angry at us if something goes wrong bc she sucks at technology. During a school party everyone was having a good time and eating and all that stuff. But then that teacher got angry that people were to close to the sides of the room and that we should be dancing (even though were eating) She kept on ruining the mood every time she would say "" you need to dance if you want another school party"" The teachers can't even do anything bc she's good at her ""job."" A good teacher can make u want to learn but she just made me hate english and literature so much. Everytime i had class with her I wish she'd just have a heart attack. One thing she does alot is going through every student saying either YOU DON'T PARTICIPATE or you participate (which would usually be like 3-4 people. I don't know anyone who likes this teacher. One time when we were suppose to have a lil party where we can eat, drink, and dance. But instead she made her homeroom class have a class with her when ALL the other grades were having fun. The party was only like 15 mins and nobody stopped her from doing that. Not the principle. not the teachers, no one. I feel bad for that homeroom class but next year I'm going to be that shitty teacher's homeroom. I just hope that she leaves because she doesn't like my class. One time she said to me I dont know whats wrong with you. She said this because my first year with her she was really fake nice and I returned that by being fake nice as well.

116,"I'm not usually like this, but I got so desperate that it controlled me. I really wanted a game that me and my siblings wanted but we had to co-op to play it. Understandably, my sisters declined once they learned that because it's a game that is supposed to be personalised to one person. And so the five stages of grief started. First there was denial, I thought it wasn't over yet and I could still convince my siblings. After I was again denied, second came anger, and I got angry at them for being selfish (??? This all seems so dumb now). Then came bargaining, except it stopped here. I was still angry at them for some reason so I somehow came to the conclusion of ""if we can't cooperate then I'll just get it for myself"". I waited until they couldn't hear and then I convinced my mom to get the game for me. I thought, ""Hooray! I did it! If I can keep it a secret then nobody will get mad!"". Of course it did though, because they overheard a convo between me and my mom 2 weeks later (today, May 8th) and understandably got mad, because I betrayed them. They were more mad that they were never told what was happening. This is when it all dawned on me. I finally, two weeks later, had an epiphany of what the fuck I was doing. Out of desperation, I manipulated my mother behind my siblings backs and then kept it a secret because although I knew what I was doing was wrong, I was too much of a coward to say anything because I was afraid they'll hate me (which, by the way, they have all the right to hate me). On top of that, before I apologized I TOLD MY MOTHER TO APOLOGIZE FIRST. When my siblings figured out what was going on, my mom tried to defend me because she misunderstood what was happening. My mom thought they were getting mad out of jealousy (which they kinda were, but it was mainly because everything was kept a secret), so my mom got pissed at them and told them that she had got plenty of things for them, and tried to say their anger was irrational. I was upset at her, but more at myself. After lunch she tried to cheer me up and say it wasn't my fault, which I quickly disproved. She said she was sorry and I rudely replied ""Why don't you go tell them that?"" I HAD THE *NERVE* TO SAY THAT, FULL WELL KNOWING I WAS THE ONE AT FAULT. I had to apologize over DISCORD because I'm such a fucking coward (I didn't want to barge in on my sister because she was in a bad mood, understandably). I'm fine with my sister, but my mom is still upset with me for hurting her feelings. NONE OF THEM EVEN KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. I PUT MY MOM IN THAT SITUATION BECAUSE I MANIPULATED HER INTO BUYING A DAMN GAME FOR ME. I PURPOSELY DIDNT ACKNOWLEDGE MY SIBLINGS BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT HER TO THINK ABOUT THAT. I'M SUCH A BAD FUCKING PERSON. I FUCKED UP MY FAMILY BECAUSE I WANTED A DAMN GAME.",08May2020,1

I made a meme a few days ago, which I thought was hilarious. You probably won't have seen it on reddit as it barely got a hundred upvotes between my crossposts and what not. Am I disappointed by that, a little. I'm not here to advertise the meme or ask for upvotes so I'll not link it, but if you really wanted to find it, search reddit for ""Is Thor a jedi"", it'll come up.

Anyway, after I shared it on my facebook, I saw lots of friends liking it and asking if they were allowed to share it so I decided to reverse google image search. And lo and behold it's on 9gag despite me never posting it there. There's even some tweets with folk crediting 9gag. That unto itself is a little bit frustrating, but okay, I get it, people steal stuff from the internet all the time...doesn't mean I can't be irked by it. What really gets to me is that it has over 7k likes/upvotes on 9gag. Part of me is like ""awesome, over seven thousand people like something I did"", but I'm also like ""it would have been nice to get that in reddit karma or at the very least be credited for it or something"". Not like I had to go through several scenes of films to get all the images I needed. I'm a little bitter. I'm currently scowling at 9gag.

I'm just bitter. And I will continue to be bitter!

On the plus side, it's interesting to see where one image is spreading.",08May2020,1
119,"I sound so stupid and bratty like, so many problems in so many people's lives and here i am complaining bc im a jealous petty little shit. I hate this whenever we need to show our work in uni(online now) i always feel bad when someone epse presents something far better than mine. I want to tear mine down, why cant i be more creative? Why cant i do something that will impress people? Why cant i be the best at something? I dont have anything else im relatively good at so why cant i be the best?

I feel so embarassed when i have to show mine, what i get its never ""wow this looks amazing good job!"", its always ""wow. You did what was asked, next."" Im crying and i get angry like im a child throwing a tantrum. I hate this.

I feel so bad for feeling this way, i know someone is gonna say it, but i'll do it for you ""bitch this is stupid why did you post about something so idiotic? There people with actual issues here and there you are complaining about not being the best Wah wah you little baby why dont you stop wasting oxygen, there people actually dying youre not important"" i know all of this, im sorry for wasting your time , im sorry.",08May2020,1
120," 

I want to ""put myself out there"" to make friends and widen my one-person social circle. It's very difficult for me to make strong friendships and I usually am putting in a lot more effort than the other person. The other person most likely already has their solid friend group or best friend and are typically not interested in being my friend.

But let's say I do something alone or show up somewhere alone to ""put myself out there"" if I make a friendly comment or something generic ""wow that xyz was really xyz haha!"" Then they will usually politely nod or politely laugh/respond and turn back to their friends and I'm left standing there not sure where to look or what to do.",08May2020,1

122,"i never meant to fall in love with you. 

you were just a boy from a small town in texas that i met through a dumb lip sync app. 

i wonder...if i didn’t love you would i hurt still?

would i still feel like my heart was being ripped out every time i heard your name or would it just be another name that i bury in the back of my mind and forget about until reminded. 

would i feel like my head was going to explode every time i tried to type the short form of thank you?

it’s shatters my heart just with the thought of saying “ty” 

just like you shattered me.",08May2020,1
