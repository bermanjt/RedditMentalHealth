I know I'd be judged by my friends if I told them I'm doing this, so I'm posting this here since I just want to tell someone how excited I feel.

So I met this guy online a while ago, and we briefly dated for a bit. Everything was perfect, I liked him so much, and he was already planning on moving to my city for work, but covid delayed it by a few months. He suddenly started acting really coldly towards me, treated me poorly, and we started talking less. Soon after, I talked to him about it and he broke up with me. He said he still had feelings towards me but didn't want me to hold out on him. It was strange he would say this considering we would be seeing each other soon. Well, he moved here and my friends found him on dating apps, and he has shown no intention of wanting to meet up with me.

Well, it's been a year since I've liked him and I feel dumb for even having feelings for him still which is why I haven't told anyone what I've been doing. I'm not fat, but a little chubby, so I've been fasting to try to look stunning for when I ask him to hang out. I want to have some common sense and not pursue a relationship with him due to how he has treated me, but I want to show him me, and impress him. Deep down I know it's stupid for wasting my time thinking about and putting effort into someone who has treated me poorly, but I guess it's a form of validation that I am seeking. When I reach my goal weight, my plan is to get drunk and ask him. Wish me luck! I am almost at my goal weight, and I feel amazing so even if he doesn't want to hang out, at least I'm looking the best I have in years.",04Nov2020,1

4,"I don't mean to sound melodramatic. I am an American, and I still believe that it has many unique qualities that make it a beautiful and free country. It is still a great place to live. I like living in the united States, and all the freedoms and liberties that come with it.

But I don't love it. Not anymore.

What I have seen in my country in the past years has been disgusting. The past 4 years especially, but even prior to that, the amount of propaganda and denial used to hide our flaws is unacceptable. It didn't start with Donald Trump. It didn't start with Obama. It didn't even the Patriot Act after 9/11. It started when Americans collectively decided they were the greatest country on Earth and always would be.

Believe me, there may have been a time when that was true. But the world has changed, and we no longer hold the moral high ground. This streak of fascism and xenophobia I have seen recently is a direct result of a national culture which no longer considers themselves capable of evil. A lack of multiculturalism in schools has left America horribly isolationist, and that stagnation is taking a heavy toll. Countries worldwide have longer, better lives with more equity and responsibility from every citizen.

When COVID-19 struck, America refused to prepare. When we suffered for that, and mass graves were built in New York, we insisted that we did the best we could. We didn't, and today we still aren't. Of course, how would we know if no one bothers to look past the flags to see countries thriving in spite of the virus?

I grew up believing America was beautiful. My loyalty to the flag was second only to God. But now I'm 18, and I can see past the rose glasses at a nation with countless problems and a population too blind to fix them. It breaks my heart to see the nation this way. Tears well up in my eyes every time I see another uninformed voter on the news.

So I'm leaving. I'm working with a consulate and hope to immigrate to Norway permanently. It has been difficult, as you can imagine, especially with the difference in coronavirus cases, but I am determined, and I intend to be on Norwegian soil sometime next year. I've already studied much of the language, and I'm getting pretty good at it. I've researched schooling, medicine, criminal and civil law, property rights and values, cultural quirks and taboos, and the local democratic system, so I'm not going in blind. Still, I will look back west as a somber observer, horribly saddened to see the great beacon of liberty, which once stood on the highest hill, rust and corrode from neglect.

I will not be voting during the 2020 election. Not because I am lazy or busy. Not because I think the candidates are the same. It's because I will not be here for the next 4 years, and I cannot justify participating in a democracy that does not affect me. In my mind, I am already headed to Norway, and while I am tempted to support my candidate, I cannot do so in good conscience. 

I hope my fellow Americans, who either cannot leave the borders or simply haven't given up as I have, will bring back the country I read about as a child. Not literally, as there were clearly problems with inequality from the beginning, but the spirit behind it. I miss the nation that would fight fight for the rights of the common man. I miss the brave men and women who would stand against injustice, no matter how powerful it may seem. I pray that, one day, we will have a president who pits their country over theirself, and acts in accordance to what is right rather than what is popular. I want a man or woman on the seat of the oval office not because they fought for it, but because they deserved it.

Until then, I will be watching from the shores of Bergen. I wish you well, fellow Americans. I'm sorry I couldn't stay to help.

So, so sorry...",04Nov2020,1

7,"She is Eons known

Decades heard

Seconds seen for her word

There is nothing shown

What love is become

For the patience of centuries forgotten

We are more now than ever before

Something seen and unsure

Others defy what is fact

This is not question

When what we know by memory

Is in fact

I have heard her name

Silence among the dead

Raging rivers seething

Without question I love her

Through grace and being

She is more than something

She is amazing

A heart among minds

Questioning trust thrust into light

Is she my everything as once was thought

Was there a greater bullet bought

Without doubt unforgotten

Her voice an echo begotten

Will I hear her again this way

Passing night into day

All time forgotten for the moment

With her lips do the oceans cease movement

She is pure unrelenting beauty

The one that confuses me

Through confusion diffuses me

A cure for what abuses me

Heroin to empty veins

Something more than pain

She is more than a name",04Nov2020,1

10,"My living situation is the main cause of my sadness, exhaustion, and inability to work or enjoy just about anything. A few months ago, I (26F) got a pay cut at my remote job, and couldn’t live on my own anymore. I reached out to family and they suggested I move into my cousin’s (20M) rental home until I get back on my feet. My cousin lives in his parents’ rental and he happened to need roommates too. The timing worked out. I wasn’t very excited about this but it was the only option I had, so.... thousands of dollars later, I officially made the several-hour move. 

When I got here, I was immediately coerced into signing a lease by his parents. After all, I was “becoming a legal tenant, and they were legally the property owners”. But I DID NOT expect a lease. Nobody told me I should expect one. This was spun as an informal, temporary agreement. And quite honest wouldn’t have moved had I known I’d be forced to live here for 12 months. When the lease was placed in front of me, I had two choices: sign it or don’t. Well, I had nowhere else to go, I’d just spent my last pennies on the move here, so I signed it. 

It’s been 4 months and I hate living with my cousin. He is aggressive and pushy and is openly racist. He doesn’t respect my boundaries, like when I ask if we can stop talking about politics. He invaded my personal space when I’m cooking or working or have friends over (which is rare). He made me put everything in my name, so when electric and internet are due, I have to put withdraw from my money until he’s ready to pay his half. It was extremely sneaky of him but I know it was on purpose. 

I never leave my room. I spend most of my days just crying and sitting in the dark. I hardly see the sun anymore because my room is the basement, and I avoid going upstairs at all costs, because I don’t want to cross paths with my cousin. The hours mix together and I sometimes go to bed at 7pm, other times 4am. Working is hard. I can’t focus on doing good work. I am exhausted and sad all the time. It’s 7:22pm right now and I am so dead inside that I’ll just go to bed. I had planned to go treat myself to a milkshake after dinner but I can’t bring myself to get out of bed. 

I’ve asked about breaking the lease and moving out. My pay went back to normal and I don’t have to stay here anymore to make ends meet. But his parents (and mine) all say I can’t leave because I signed a lease. They also don’t understand why I want to leave since “it’s such a good deal here.” For my own mental health, I need to get the fuck out of here, but I’m legally tied to stay. I’ve tried finding sub letters but nobody wants to live with my cousin because he’s a white suprematist and is very open about it (plus has InfoWars posters, Trump flags, Blue Lives Matter signs). He’s also a pig to live with and never ever cleans up after himself. I essentially pay to be his maid despite many talks and discussions, and nobody else is interested in paying this much money to do the same thing.  

I’m so fucking sad being here. 4 months down, 8 to go. Well, I don’t even know if I can last that long. I’m scared what being here for 8 months more will do to me. I’m scared I’ll fall into a deeper pit and find it hard to come back out.",04Nov2020,1

13,"I was asked to run for our local school board as a write-in candidate. It’s a pretty contentious race as there are two other write-in candidates. There are 4 spots open and 3 incumbents on the ballot. The 4th spot will go to one of the write-ins.

It’s been an incredible experience. I got so much support. I had easily 20 volunteers that made calls, texted people, passed out fliers, and held signs outside of polling locations. I got to meet with a state senator. It’s been a really surreal and humbling experience.

Now I’m so excited and anxious to find out the results. It’s likely we won’t know until tomorrow because they have to be hand counted. I’m also very anxious about the national elections. So I’be got very mixed feelings. This is a huge election with record breaking turnout. Businesses boarding up in anticipation of civil unrest. The president barricading himself.

Gory visions played out before my eyes.

That stupid dog stopped multiple times in the street and nearly got hit each time, but somehow managed to make it across alive and whole and her owner caught up to her on the other side. I've never been more relieved in my life. That made me realize something.

I've spent 24 years going from different stages of isolation, from social in elementary when I was bullied all eight years, to highschool where I put myself in a toxic relationship to cope with the lonliness, making it even worse, to post secondary where my size (tall) and face (depressed) make people think I'm trying to avoid them even when I try and casually make friends or acquaintances. And then fucking covid, where isolation became mandatory. I have no childhood friends, my  ""best friend"" of ten years have been criticizing me non stop since the start regardless of whether they do the same things and when I defend myself or try and confront them at a different time I'm deflecting and being immature. I haven't remembered it was my birthday until mid evening for almost eight years, and  the few friends I had would throw parties for eachother and forget to invite me. Despite what you'd think and what my face shows I don't just outwardly exude depression and bitterness. I try as hard as I can to be a genuinely nice person, I try to empathize and see both sides of a situation even when I'm in disagreement with someone. I've changed how I talk, how I act and even something as specific as how I retell events, just because my ""friends"" would just not believe me from the start. They explained it was my excited nature and how I talked. So I fucking changed how I talked just so someone would trust me that I'm not trying to just pull random things out of my ass.

Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England, wrote this magnificent response:

""A few things spring to mind.

Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem.

For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace - all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.

So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump’s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing - not once, ever.

I don’t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility - for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.

But with Trump, it’s a fact. He doesn’t even seem to understand what a joke is - his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.

Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.

And scarily, he doesn’t just talk in crude, witless insults - he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.

There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It’s all surface.

Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.

Well, we don’t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.

And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.

Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.

He’s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.

He’s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.

And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.

That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.

There are unspoken rules to this stuff - the Queensberry rules of basic decency - and he breaks them all. He punches downwards - which a gentleman should, would, could never do - and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless - and he kicks them when they are down.

So the fact that a significant minority - perhaps a third - of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think 'Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy’ is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:
* Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.
* You don't need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.

This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.

After all, it’s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.

God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.

He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart.

In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws - he would make a Trump.

And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish:

'My God… what… have… I… created?

If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.""",04Nov2020,1

That anyone can look past his childish Twitter taunts and see maturity, or his abhorrent mocking of people with disabilities and see statesmanship, or his long history of sexist and misogynistic comments and behaviors and see a Christian, or his repeated attempts to disrupt democracy and see an American, is completely beyond me. He is literally a monstrous person, a disgusting, depraved, dim-witted, dictatorial douchebag. These are objective facts that he demonstrates every day. I hope he loses in a landslide and gets tried for the next twenty years for all of his legitimate crimes.

The fact that people aren’t even trying to change hearts and minds is evidence that nobody ACTUALLY cares about people’s rights, or fascism, or any of the things people claim to care about. The only reason trump still has support is because the left is so fucking toxic to anyone that isn’t on the left. It’s like someone being in an abusive relationship, but instead of trying to help you just say “LOL YOU JUST GOT BEAT BY YOUR HUSBAND LOLLLLLLLL”.

Trump single-handedly did the Triangular Slave Trade; hell he was the guy Trump bought the slaves from. Trump also beheaded a French teacher for disrespecting Mohammad, and blamed it on wholesome Muslimerinos. All the blood diamonds are produced by Trump. He was the guy who cut Congolese workers hands off because they did not meet his supply. Trump chased Kyyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha with a skateboard and beat him up and snatched his rifle, and used it to kill Jacob Blake.

Trump personally snitched on Anne Frank to Trump. The Jim Crow laws were passed by Trump, as well as the war on drugs. The partition of India was Trump's fault, as well as the resulting Kashmir issue. He also starred in the Cuban missile crisis and started the cold war. During the Russian Revolution, the peasants understood that Nikolai II's family was innocent, and would offer them a chance to leave, but Trump massacred them. Trump tried his best but failed in preventing the American and French Revolutions, but he got back at them by causing the Reign of Terror. Trump tortured Louis XVI's son and forced him into saying that he had sex with his mother and aunt, and promptly guillotined them. Trump invented pineapple-pizza and Tofu-Chicken. He was the guy who snitched on Alan Turing, revealing that he was gay. The judge felt that such a respected professor could be sent away with a slap on the wrist, but Trump rigged the jury and sentenced him to hormonal therapy.

58,"The problem I see with voting in politicians is that people put too much weight on what a federal government can do for people. I got into politics a 15 years ago and since going through multiple phases, I've come to the conclusion that most of the problems people have comes down to local problems.

As much as people want to virtue signal over what kind of person wins, the biggest problems in people's lives normally starts with their self. There shouldn't be an external person who comes in and saves you from issues in your life. Normally if you have health problems you go to a doctor, money issues you learn how to make a business and find success. But this excessive demand for a single person to do the impossible task of changing the life of 350 million people and put such a heavy reliance on that has been more toxic to the general public than anything else.

 When I gone over political platforms, it's simply big government vs big government in the US. There's not much of a difference between parties other than the party color and slogans. You can talk about personality traits and soft traits like social perception, but there's not a big difference between the philosophies of those people put reliance on.

To me I think most Americans are insane to believe that all their issues can be solved on the basis of putting a figurehead in charge. They're a figurehead! It doesn't really change people's day to day lives and the feeling of a lack of control comes from a lot of personal problems. 8 years in a lifetime is nothing. This century whether Americans like it or not is moving toward a position where America is not in charge of the world, and life goes on. Whether it be Trump, Biden, Harris, Pence, you name it America has been on a steady decline because of this reliance on government and not the values it was founded on.

The biggest problem of America is fiat currency and central banking, and between 2021-2026 you're going to have a big issue with the US dollar. Not the politicians.",04Nov2020,1

All the men I encounter just seem to be completely sexual, scary &amp; perverted, too sex driven for my liking. 

I’m not into women either, I’ve tried to date girls my age, but I just can’t do the whole ‘sex’ thing, or being close and physical. Also, I’m not really into them. They are pretty, but women, just aren’t my thing. 

It actually makes me upset sometimes. I feel as I won’t get over this bridge and I’ll be alone &amp; grow old/die alone. lol. 

And What makes it worse is My family comparing me everybody else I know, as everybody else has a loving partner, big family, or both.

My mom spoke to me once or twice already about finding a “Good Man” but honestly, the thought just terrifies me. 

I’m afraid of being alone, but I’m so afraid to get close with somebody,— Hell, I can’t even hug somebody let alone shake their hand, because that’s just how I am.

I’m not even sure if I can even be ‘sexual’. I am unsure wether or not that’s a possibility.

She followed me home and I took her in and fed her she was clearly very hungry so I figured she'd been lost a few days.

I asked around at work and eventually put up a sign saying I found a lost cat on the second day.

Admittedly I was getting attached, she was very friendly and loved being pet. I've never had a pet of my own, I've taken care of and I've loved my family's pets but I never had one myself and after buying litter and food it felt like I was caring for my own pet.

Admittedly I felt like just taking down the signs I put up and keeping her but I knew that wouldn't be right and as much as I cared for the cat i hadn't given her a name yet as to not be too attached in case someone called.

Well tonight when I was getting ready for the night shift someone called about the cat and I had asked them to describe her and they did so perfectly. Naturally I gave her back but I feel bad for missing her.

More often than not in elections, we are forced to choose between 2 evils and it is difficult - if not impossible - to truly tell which one is better or what the outcomes will actually be with each option. This is why I don’t begrudge anyone their choice and I hope you all will respect mine. 


In the current election, I wasn’t actually looking at the candidates themselves. I was looking at who they lift up around them. I personally hate the climate that divides everyone and puts us against each other - it’s disgusting, at the end of the day, there isn’t a winning team and a losing team, there is one president for all Americans. However, when I look at the Democratic Party and those that Biden holds up and supports, they all seem so radical to me. They seem so close to completely unreasonable with insane policies that have devastating consequences. When I look at who Trump supports, I see less of that.

Like the title says, a year ago today I (28F) was sleeping on the floor of a less than 300sq ft (including bathroom, kitchen, and closet) studio apartment in Texas. I slept on a dirty mattress topper. I lived with a former coworker and his girlfriend, and their three cats.

My long term relationship had just ended (genuinely believed he was the man I was going to marry), and due to circumstances I’d rather not discuss, I had to move out immediately. I want to emphasize there was no bad blood; it was just what happened. I still love him dearly. 

I had lost my job. I’d been getting incredibly tired and lethargic for seemingly no reason. My doctors ended up finding out I had developed hypothyroidism...2 weeks after being fired for being a lazy employee. Earlier than year I discovered I was on the spectrum, which after living two decades having no idea was a lot. I was falling apart incredibly quickly. Living there, out of 3 suitcases.

Fast forward to today: I live in a house with my two best friends in California. My bedroom alone is the size of that same studio apartment. I found some passions that I’m still learning to pursue. My life isn’t perfect, but I’ve really come so far.

91,"I'm a high school freshman. I got into high school this year. Without wasting any time let's get to the story.  So it all started a few months ago. There was this girl I liked for over 9 months. She was in the same grade as me and had the same birthday as me. She was a nice girl. She was beautiful, had a kind personality and most importantly was just a good person overall. I mean if I wanted to date her, I knew I had to compete with many other boys. I mean I'm not that good looking and I can't afford to spend tons of cash on a girl. I won't call myself ugly either. I'm average in almost everything. So I had given up a few months ago and stopped texting her because talking to her knowing that I'll never date her was a bit hard to accept. Call me a looser if you want but what else should I have done? So she one night texted me on her own. It surprised me to say the least. She was very friendly. I mean she always was but this time she was way more friendly. Like she was asking me all sort of questions and if I were even a little late to reply, she would call me out for replying late. I never ignore anyone. Like I'm never late to reply unless I'm busy or talking to many people at the same time. And I was like a few second too late to see her texts. So a few weeks went on, we started talking again and became good friends again. So one day she texts me telling me to check out a song in her profile. I went and did just that. She listens to K-pop, C-pop and watches Chinese and Korean dramas. So the song was about a girl falling in love with a guy and then stalking the shit outta him. The lyrics said how she had fallen hopelessly in love with him and stuff. The last line being ""So now you know, I have fallen in love with you!"" I didn't take that as a hint because she might have just wanted me to know how good of a song that was. I didn't stand out among her friends so I thought ""Oh boy what level of friendzone is this?"" I mean I have inferiority complex and it nearly crippled my social life but thanks to my best friend I regained my footing but the complex is there. So there was a link to her profile. It allowed people to sent anonymous texts to her. So I thought just let me get this off my back and confess. So I did. In the confessing I stated how introverted and shy I was and nothing else in English. The last line I wrote was ""Skyatte kura sai!"" which is a Japanese sentence that means ""Please go out with me!"" I was a weeb and watched many many animes. And I knew for sure she wouldn't know it was me because she doen't watch Japanese drama. Or so I thought. This was a week ago. I know people in the comment is gonna call me a looser, simp and so on but what could I have done at that moment? I have problems communicating and I'm a shy person. So after 6 days she saw the text and instantly figured out it was me. She confronted me. This is how our conversation went. I didn't try to hide it because I was confidant that she would not know what the last line meant.  It didn't cross my mind that even if she didn't know what that meant, there were many other ways for her to find out that it was me and what the line meant. The confession was like shouting something from a top of a hill thinking nobody will hear you. And even if they do hear you, they won't understand you. Oh yeah, one more thing, I am not sharing the screenshots because I enjoy typing a lot more and hope it doesn't bother anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Did you write this?

Me"" Yes. But how did you know?

Her: No need to be shy, you can tell me anything.

Me: Good to know but there's nothing of that importance I want to share with you rn. 

Her: It's ok. You know, you've made me very happy just now. The last line really surprised me and also made me happy.

Me: Umm do you know what that means?

Her"" Why won't I? It means ""Please go out with me!"" 

ME"" Oh no....you weren't supposed to find out...how did you figure out it was me anyway?

Her: You know only two of my friends watch anime. One of their id is deactivated and the other one is you.

Me: But how do you know what that means? 

Her: I also started watching Japanese drama too so ofc ik what that means.

Me: Oh hope this doesn't complicate things.

Her: About my answer to your confession, it's yes. Obviously Id love to go out with you. And it's good that i found out. The next time we meet I'd love to go out with you!

P.s: I moved to a different city for a while and we weren't able to meet up and hang out more than a few times.

The moment I realized that she found out my hands started shaking, my heart started beating at the speed of sound and my face turned white. My mom was calling me for dinner and walked into my room but when she saw my face turned pale she said ""Are you alright? You can eat later if you want. Or do you want to order some pizza?"" I assured her I was fine and stuff and then calmed myself down and then told my crush how I liked her for such a long time and stuff. I got carried away and told her how shocked and scared I got when she found out. Like I spilled most of the details like an idiot but it did phase her but not too much. She was like ""For now let's try to me more free with each other and let's not leave each other at seen anymore. Let's start from here"" I was happy that things might go well but boy would that be the day. After that she became more and more inactive. She started replying late. Her being inactive is not something new but after that confession, it was a bit weird to do that. Sometimes she logged in Instagram or Messenger, shared some posts in her story feed and then logged out. I confronted her of it and she said she isn't active as usual and sometimes she logs in and just posts something in her story feed. But she did talk to me even during online classes which should be a good sign. I told my female best friend everything and she was like ""Maybe she's not interested. Or maybe just buys cause as long as I have known her she's been busy with studies and work."" I didn't mean to be too clingy but unfortunately I had too much free time and I found it hard to study after a long day if classes so I downloaded DMC 4 SE and started playing as Vergil to prepare myself for DMC 5 SE. So one day I was simply talking to my best of friends and I finally told them everything and they were slightly confused too but my best friend suggested I should post everything on this sub reddit.

I don't know if this is because I'm an emotional masochist or if I'm searching for the ""truth"" or something, but since I was little I would always search for stuff like ""your dreams can't come true"" or ""you can't succeed"" or ""the world is shit"" and crap like that.

I'm not even American, I live in Italy, and I still care about American politics more than anyone else, and it kind of makes me depressed.

I'm currently going through a bit of a down phase in my life, and I'm scared that this will make me even sadder.

96,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

Americans, why do you think so many people in the world do the impossible to get to the United States? Purely by chance? No, it's because in the U.S. there are opportunities that you take for granted that often don't exist in the rest of the world. Why do some people take risks to cross the border? Why do some people spend years studying, trying to have an excelent academic achievements to have the slim chance of applying to a master's degree at U.S. universities? Why do they think that most of the companies that are changing the world are in the United States? Why do you think so many Latino voters fear socialism?

Americans, you don't value what you have, I tell you this from my heart. You don't know what lack of freedom and real oppression really is. When you really experience it, that's when you want to leave your country, not because of the results of an election. Please read about the rest of the world, inform yourself, visit Latin America and see with your own eyes, it's not sweden utopia. Have you ever stopped shaving to save up money for food? I guess not.

on the one hand he was scaring the fuck out of people telling them that taxes will skyrocket for everyone, the economy will turn to dust, covid will get worse, everyone will be forced to get at least one abortion and umm... christmas will be canceled.

on the other hand, he is saying that if he is voted in there will be jobs and money and the economy will boom and a vaccine and so many other great things that he can't even mention right now.

Maybe none of that will happen, and everything will be sunshine and rainbows. This is all so disappointing. Trump and republicans are disappointing. Biden and the democrat establishment is disappointing. 

Know what, we should just split the US into different countries. Let the southern states form a new confederate state and pleasure themselves to bigoted views and racism.
Let the northeast break off and do their thing. Texas becomes its own country. The west, excluding california becomes separate countries. 

Its so disappointing.

112,"So was recently reading some information on Death, I just have some thoughts and theories I just needed to write down. Not something you can bring up over coffee.

I was on browsing  reddit and found a old thread and some people where stating they assumed it was like being blacked out. Like, your there and then nothing and then waking up. Almost, as if your mind went on pause mode.  No memory or grasp of time, just gone.

Now when I tried to think of this it felt scary at first but then I really tried to imagine it and I started  to feel more comfortable.  However, after thinking more and more on this I just cant see the planet as a whole being so resourceful with everything having a place, plan or system.  To think we have this ability for nothing seems like a lot for the planet/universe/life to waste for nothing.  

Lets say over time, geckos learned/changed there body to drop their tail against predators and escape . They then grow a new one and a new one etc..... So, for us to have evolved and have the ability to think and have free will was made for a reason, right??

So for me to understand being blacked out I compared what I feel when i go to sleep.  Every time I have been blacked out and woke up, It did not ever feel the same as sleeping. So, my theory of being blacked out your brain/consciousness is still working behind the scene we just don't comprehend it.

But then i remembered all the Near Death Experience's people have and then I try to think how and why is that a thing. So when i just look at the Human Body as just another organism on this planet .  Mother nature is very good about recycling and making things run smoothly. Now we look at our bodies, when our bodies get injured or sick our bodies , with out us doing anything start fighting and trying to heal our selves.  

I have then read and watched some things on DMT, that when our body is dying it releases DMT and then this is what people associate with the NDE.  Now lets assume this is true and our body prepares our mind/Soul/consciousness for the next chapter of our life?

Now you might say what about people who have head trauma or gun shot to the head.  As I said before our body is very well designed and  maintained and maybe can tell/sense when the body is done and shutting down.  As this happens and depending on how fast the dying process is this is how fast the DMT is released.  Now with a Gun shot to the head, lets say as the bullet starts entering the head, the body knows and begins releasing this DMT.  This would happen so fast our mind can not comprehend with knowing time as we use it. Imagine it being slowed down to where as soon as that bullet touched skull the body is already in a DMT Trip. Now lets imagine this is what people see and this is actually our Soul/consciousness  transitioning into  the afterlife. 

Lets also imagine if this is your first life and your soul is actually being built/developed as we grow and learn.  As a baby we don't really have much thought or memory. Earliest memory i can remember was around 5 or 6.  I really don't have much more than a few memories up until about 14/15 years old. This is where i can recall a lot o memories. Like our mind is built not to remember this time alive, but it has to be for a reason.

Now this is where i couldn't tell you anymore, I  have never done DMT and plan to some day. 

I still couldn't explain the Paranormal stuff

I have several positions at my business that are pretty exclusive hires that are for a teenager's first job, or just young people who live with mom/dad etc, that paying them $15/hr is going to kill me.

I know for the minimum wage increase, I will have to pass those costs onto my clients, just not sure how it will all play out.

I went in to the doctor a few days because of Covid exposure, and they tested me for Covid but also tested me for strep because she just thought it seemed more like strep. Well, they told me they'd call me if either result came back positive (they just sent me home even though it only takes ten minutes for a strep test) and never called me, and I've only just found out today that it's strep by coincidence when I checked online to see if my Covid test came in. So today, almost a week after coming down sick, I get to start taking a shit ton of antibiotics, more than I likely would have needed if they would have just fucking called me when the result came back positive.

122,"I thought I was getting out ahead of everybody because I’m 21 years old and I only drank my first cup of coffee a week ago! The people around me complained when their vapes were dead, when they missed their morning cup of coffee, when their adderall script ran out. I was exhausted like them, but I kept my hand out of the pill bottle and my lungs clean. I thought I had some kind of edge on them even though I also constantly felt like I was tired and dying...

Then this semester came, 18 credits and an internship, and I physically and emotionally could not muster up the strength to get my work done. How could I possibly edit a 70 page document, run a club meeting, read a book and write an essay on the Holocaust, and give a presentation on ancient Chinese religion all in the same day? I started taking my friend’s ritalin and finally I could work for more than 10 minutes at a time. Hours in front of my computer and I read the entire book in a day or two. I wouldn’t have touched it without those drugs. I got an A on my papers and the meeting went perfectly.

I ran out of ritalin and adderall a week or two ago and I decided it was time to try coffee for the first time. Once again I was just ... able to function. I was able to work! I finally understood why people say they *need* coffee to function. I don’t think always that stems from addiction - I was dead tired when I was 100% sober. I probably needed it without having ever touched it. Coffee is the reason I wrote my paper! I think the nature of modern life probably warrants some light drug use because I am just tired tired tired all the time without it ...

I don’t want to drink more than a cup or two a week because I don’t want to get dependent. I also want to lose weight, so I bought a vape this week. Just one for this semester and I know I won’t buy more. I haven’t drank coffee today but the nicotine made me feel awake enough to get my paper done. Now i just have to finish my presentation, write one more essay, do some reading, and go to some classes...

The amphetamines are my favorite, but I’m surprised at how much I like coffee and nicotine. I probably sound like an addict in the making right now, and I’m a bit worried about it. But I’m not sure how else I’m supposed to get my shit done. After this semester I hopefully won’t need stimulants or nicotine or coffee, but I’ll still be tired all the time without them. Life is better when i actually feel present and awake and these drugs are the only things that help me. I’m being really careful about how often I use all of these substances. I’m basically rotating them out, so I guess now I do depend on *something* to get me by each day. But I don’t know, it’s not like I was getting by very well without them.

I’m graduating in a few months. I’d love to be a super healthy sober raw vegan, but I feel fucking dead and unmotivated all the time. The only thing that motivates me to be healthy is putting drugs in my body that make me feel present and able to think. I’m worried about how I’ll handle adult life.

From the time I lost my virginity &amp; caught chlamydia at 18 to this sociopath who abused me, cheated on me with a 16 year old. He also stoop me up for prom. It scarred me for life. And he came out unscathed.

To almost my entire undergrad college experience (3 yrs) not making any friends or partying because my bf was insanely jealous (who turned out to be cheating on me and refused to ever pay be back for rent). He was my first serious long term bf, and a lot of firsts were with this guy who ruined my fucking life.

&amp; the time I met this guy at the concert on my bday last year— looking back on it that experience alone would come to ruin my bday one day. I ruined my bday pic album on insta by posting a pic with him in it. 

&amp; the time I went on vacation to Europe for the first time, celebrating an accomplishment of one of my loved ones.. only to meet a guy at the music festival I should be able to look fondly upon today, but can’t because he ended up breaking my heart. All of the pics I took at that festival were with him &amp; his friends. He strung me along for months, &amp; I fell for it. He came out of it unscathed with a gf, and I ended up feeling used and like I wasted that experience with him. 

These are just some that come to mind. But shit like this has been happening throughout my adulthood. I’m fucking sick of it. I’m sick of ruining what could have been good memories by wasting my time on these guys. If I knew the outcome, I would’ve have let myself be their ego boost &amp; told them to fuck off.

I want to create better memories from now on. I just want better things to happen.",04Nov2020,1

133,"Given everything that’s happening in the world I thought I’d share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources. Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/) \- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design. Aimed at people looking to reduce symptoms of anxiety.",04Nov2020,1

139,"We always have, and will continue to, live in Trump’s America.

In a country founded on genocide and slavery, any incremental progress fails to reckon with the dark truth of who we are. Biden, if he ends up winning this rigged process, will be a coat of paint over our blood-stained history, paint that will surely be washed clean next election cycle when a savvier-trump rolls along. This is to say nothing of the ways that Biden would uphold the same status quo - tinkering with the edges while leaving the rotten core intact.

We need to work to dismantle all systems that led to Trump’s presidency - abolishing police and prisons, evolving past capitalism, and ending US imperialism. The fact that this race is so close is a testament to many things - voter suppression, misinformation, undemocratic electoral college, etc. - but first and foremost it is a testament to the failure of Democrats to win over the working people they claim they support. Polls tonight showed that a huge majority of all voters (70%+) supported public health care, a pathway to citizenship for people without status, and seriously reckoning with the twin epidemic of COVID and structural racism. Yet, Biden is squeaking by. In fact, in Florida (FLORIDA!), a $15 minimum wage passed with wide support while Biden lost. If that isn’t setting off alarm bells in your head, you might be looking at the wrong things.

But this isn’t a call to get more focused on national politics. If anything, the hyper-focus on national races (not just Biden but Amy McGrath, Jon Osoff, Jamie Harrison, etc.), brought attention (and money) away from where true change always starts: in your neighborhood. In your city right now, there are hundreds of organizers working to defund the police. In your state right now, there is an organization fundraising to pay bonds so that our neighbors can be freed from cages. In your county right now, there is a chapter of the Sunrise Movement strategizing the next chess move in our fight for a green world. Next door, the next AOC or Cori Bush could be putting together a team that will propel them to victory in one, two, five years. All of these fights have national consequences but they all start as relationships between a couple of people. These are the relationships that can withstand the assault of being outspent, being harassed by right-wing militias, societal apathy, and creeping hopelessness. There is no better balm for fascism than tight, widespread, human connection.

Humans evolved to fight together, not alone, and so if you want to evolve past Trump’s America, join in the fight with your neighbors. We hold our only hope.",04Nov2020,1

142,"I have 4 close friends who all live in other countries, but I dont want to vent to them all the time, so here I am as speaking to the abyss online seems to help somewhat when the sads and lonelies overcome me. 

I cycled to the shop at the hours hes usually there hoping to run into him as I need to return a flashlight he lent me before we had our last fall out. When he heard that my cycle home is through pitch black fields he walked over to my bike and taped the flashlight from his scooters compartment onto my handlebars, saying it was a loan not a gift. He even joked about us having a fight and him coming to ring my doorbell to get it off me again. When we had our first fight, he threw every gift I'd given him into my letter box and kept ringing my doorbell wanting me to return his books that hed lent me.

Only a few days later, the same events from our first fight recurred, he spiralled over me not replying to his messages fast enough and started sending me long, hurtful texts concluding in a proclaimed end to our friendship. Except this time, after telling me that he wants nothing to do with me, he told me he had a crush on me. It was the only thing left that could hurt me from him, and it did. All these months of butterflies, of not being able to do anything but daydream about him, of anticipating every meeting and replaying it all in my head each night, I held back. He had raised a few red flags (until they became more and more... and more) so I am glad I held back, or I would not be able to disconnect from the drama now. But it sucks, having this thing that I had hoped to build into something real and good and safe, thrown there like that. 

He wanted me to meet up with him asap when he was sending me all these texts about how we would no longer be friends, saying there were things he hadn't told me. I agreed to a time and he stood me up. I was pissed. I look at my phone later for another deluge of weird texts about how much I suck. I told him to leave me alone, and he blocked me on everything. 

Now I just need to return his dumb flashlight. Ends never feel good, but this one is extra bad. Part of me wants to leave a note saying that by the way, I also had a crush, in fact i was crazy about him but didnt tell him out of support for where he was at in life and how he always said he wasnt ready. I wanted to be his friend first, not some girl who finds him crazy attractive. But I know that the only way out of toxic looping behaviour is to not engage. 

I'm trying to learn to be someone who can express their emotions freely, but in this case I think bottling it up and venting about it online is in fact the safer and healthier option.",04Nov2020,1

144,"I don't even know what to say

I feel like I want to say everything but can't find the words, just disparate ideas

What if I'm gay? I'm not, but I guess I'm bi. I don't mind the attraction. But I hate the label. I hate everyone else. Not that anyone has to abide by a label, but that won't stop people from labeling you and treating you differently. 

I'm theoretically in therapy. Have my second appointment tomorrow. The first one that's supposedly supposed to be an actual conversation. I don't know. I don't know how to talk about myself. 

I'm anxious over everything, but somehow having a lack of worry for anything or drive to do anything. I can't make myself do anything productive. I just drink booze most of the time, and smoke weed when I can get it, I prefer it and it's far better for my body but I'm in a backwards illegal state. 

I don't plan on fucking anyone so my sexuality is irrelevant except for how it dictates and effects my behavior and how others perceive me. I'm an ugly dude, lol. I'm the kind of guy everyone forgets. Although I guess that's good for me. 

I have so many memories of me being horribly cringey or awkward that I can keep myself warm in an avalanche. I get along with people fine generally, that's good. I can talk to people because I know how to smile and nod while being somewhat socially smooth in small talk. Cool I guess. Most people I've met in real life are cool if you treat them well. Although many people online suck lol. But that's probably also my fault. 

I hate myself, I hate what I think of other people, but I also often hate other people. I look down on them even though others would only have reasons to look down on me. 

I live in what feels like a prison. I have no idea how to better myself. I spend money on booze that I shouldn't spend at all, it feels like I can't stop. I hate living with my family, I don't get along with them and go out of my way to avoid them in a small house. My sister won't speak to me or acknowledge my existence, but she'll complain to my mom if she hears or sees anything she doesn't like, and she lives on the other side of a thin wall from me so I can't even speak in my own room without filtering it first. I can't believe that I'm an adult and dealing with this shit. 

I hate everything about me except for being egotistically impressed with my own thoughts and the cynical way I look at life and make humor out of things. I don't know. My entire life I've been the opposite of an effective person. I'm terrified of every bad possibility that could happen to me. If I encounter any major expense than my life is effectively over. I can't even get the money to buy a gun as an insurance policy to exit life. Reddit isn't even a good escape from life. Honestly it mostly sucks on this website, but I don't know what else to do. 

I wish I was someone else, born in another place, to another family, in another body. But I would want to retain my memory and experience so I can remember what I used to be like, and what I've learned about life and people. 

You know, I jerk off to some drawn male porn that no one would want to admit to looking at, including me. But obviously a lot of people consume it. Sort of funny. People want to avoid certain labels at all costs, because some labels that don't involve hurting anyone else are still seen as justified reasons to make someone a pariah. 

This is gonna get buried, no one or barely anyone will respond. No one will read this whole thing. I don't blame anyone. This is long and without any point. I'm just so tired of life. So tired of myself. So tired of having my vices. Pretty sure my body is breaking down from all the booze. I have a very addictive personality. 

I don't care to maintain friendships generally, but I hate being alone, even though it's functionally what I prefer and what I almost always choose. I guess I value jerking off whenever I want than I value human interaction.

145,"So I’ve had this issue since I was like 10, and it rarely happened but now I don’t even know what could cause it. So basically, when I was younger, I would have this happen ever so often. So for example, I started watching this tv show, and my entire family knew about it and questioned me about it, so that tv show was “ruined” for me. So like, I thought about how I “ruined” that tv show nonstop for 3 days. If I wasn’t distracting myself, I thought about it and felt bad. It was a miserable feeling, I don’t know how to describe it, it was like sadness, anxiety, I don’t know, it just felt bad. So I eventually got over it, and could never finish that tv show. So this problem of fear of “ruining” things had only happened with tv shows until like 3 weeks ago. I recently went to therapy for the first time for ocd, and it’s been helping me overcome that ocd. Well one day in there, I cried and felt really bad afterwards. Like I wasn’t that fulfilled after the therapy session, because I needed to get everything out but I really don’t like crying so I didn’t. So then I had that feeling again, and I didn’t know why at first. But the more I felt it, the more I realized it was that fear of ruining things. So then I was absolutely destroyed for like a week because I thought I had ruined therapy. So every time I looked at the photos I took that day, thought about it, literally anything to do with that day/therapy, I would get that miserable feeling and overthink myself to death. I brought this up at the next session and I started feeling better afterwards, she wanted me to try to clarify what “ruin” meant, but I really don’t know where it comes from. So yesterday, my mom was taking photos of me in my backyard, and I went my this tree and there was a spiderweb, so I freaked out. We were going to go out and eat after that and have a good night, but I ruined it(there’s “ruined” again). My fear of ruining things literally ruined something. So we clarified there was nothing on me, but I couldn’t get over it. School had just been called off for the week. So I was freaking out because I was afraid I had ruined the week that I was so excited for. So basically I couldn’t even function for the next two hours. I cried, I tried really hard to get these negative thoughts and worry out of my head, but I couldn’t. I eventually got feeling a bit better, and calmed myself down. So I got to a point where I knew I would be a mess for the week,( like I was a week or two before) so I just told myself that I would have go nonstop try to fight the negative thoughts and worry of ruining this week of no school, that was supposed to be fun. So it’s the next day, and I’ve just been doing things that constantly distract me, and I’ve had to try and block those negative thoughts out nonstop. I can’t play certain games, because they don’t stimulate my mind enough to where I’ll be distracted from those thoughts that I ruined my week. I know with time I’ll get better, but I don’t want this to become something normal for me, that I’ll have to just deal with. It’s miserable.

156,"I’m a college student and I live in a bustling college town in an apartment. Over the summer, we found a stray dog on a bike trail who was completely malnourished and had two collars on that were both way too tight. It was a rural area but it was near a cluster of houses so we asked the owners if he was theirs and they said he had been there for a while but no one owned him or even wanted him. 

We took him in and got him checked for a microchip, posted online, and did everything we could to see if he had an owner. He was extremely skinny and flea infested, for reference he was 12 pounds when we found him and he weighs 20 now that he’s fed well. 

He was an amazing dog. Horrible off leash and he had bad reactions to people who looked a certain way (curly blonde hair, older black men) which we over time got him accustomed to both.  He is extremely smart and we got him potty trained in like a month and even taught him tricks like shake and dance. 

The real problem came in when we had to leave him for two weeks. We left him with a friend to dogsit him and they had two bigger dogs but all three got along really well. Mark never had ANY issues with other dogs at this point. He was always friendly and inquisitive to other dogs. Well the day before we got home he got attacked by another dog. There was no blood but ever since then he’s been a completely different dog. If he sees another dog on the street, even from the 5th floor where I live, he goes absolutely (there’s no other word to describe) batshit. He bowls and yells(?), cries and barks and there’s no way to stop him. Even breaking eye contact and carrying him and being soothing/telling him it’s okay doesn’t do anything. It takes him about 10 minutes to calm down from an episode. 

This happens with any type of dog. My friends dog is the most calm and small puppy and mark still will he going crazy one foot away from a dog that’s just lying in the grass not even looking at him. 

I am just in constant fear about what would happen if I couldent control him and he attacked another dog. He’s a min pin so he’s not huge but I know he would have to be put down. I also never really thought it was fair to have a dog in an apartment in a college town and the fact that he’s terrified of others that he has to see and hear 24/7 makes me feel horrible. 

We have tried slowly introducing him to other dogs who are very calm but there has been no change. I consulted a trainer and they don’t think that this trauma can be overcome. Basically the answer is a nice home with a big backyard that he will never have to see another dog again. 

Despite his flaw, he’s an amazing dog. Loves cuddles. No accidents. Tells me when he needs to go on a walk. Absolutely adorable. The light of my life. 

I’m just starting to accept that I can’t put either of us in this position, but I started looking at rescue groups and I just feel like my whole world is shattering. I can’t imagine Christmas without him, much less the rest of his life passing without being able to spend it with him. I’ve been miserable for the past few days. 

I just needed to vent a bit. He honestly made me even more responsible and pushed me to do better in my side hustle just so I could buy him nicer food and treats and toys.

I've been going through a backlog of movies that I haven't seen yet and get recommended a lot. **So far half of them had rape scenes**. I am so sick and tired of this, i feel like every movie and show has a rape scene. Usually the rape doesn't even bring anything valuable into the movie or book except for the shock factor. 

I'm sorry. I don't know why I feel so strong about it and my opinion probably sounds stupid to everyone else. But for some reason it just affects me so much. I'm easily disturbed by it. Sometimes I can't sleep because I get flashbacks of the disturbing scenes. Something about it, the horror and hopelessnes of the victim is just too much for me.

I remember there was also a mention of a depressing and disgusting scene of gang rape in ASoIaF books and I remember being so angry, because it literally didnt mean anything in the story later on; I was so moved and affected by countless other interactions happening between the characters, which had a much more profound effect on me rather than the pointless raping, so I just dont understand why put it there if the author can achieve a better effect without it.

Little things bothering me, room temperature, my concentration being that low, all the time, and not remembering things, having to repeat something for five times only to realize that I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about and questioning whether I understand my mother tongue and how sentences are formed...is NOT normal! 

Conclusion - I hope I have a disorder. Cause otherwise...",04Nov2020,1
165,"I don't even know where to begin. I'm a total faker. Everything people know me as is an abject farce. I'm trying to be masculine and boyish. I'm trying to act content with my body. I'm trying to act advanced. And no one questions it, yet I'm constantly, fastidiously doubting it, because I know that isn't me.

I say I don't care about my appearance. Other than brushing my hair and showering, I don't care for my appearance at all. Because the ways I want to appear aren't possible, as I don't have the resources to actualize them.

I'm a 14-year-old boy. I have curly, brown hair, an incredibly hairy body, and I'm overweight. I have large hands, a large nose, a small mouth, and facial hair. I hate how I look.

I want to be clean-shaven. I want to be curvy. I want a plump butt, vagina, and breasts. I want long, black flowing hair. I want Asian skin. I don't wear to wear boys clothes. I wanna wear dresses, leggings, makeup, Converse shoes, Vans, heels, boots, skinny jeans, overalls, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, and jewelry.

I hate trying to be who people expect me to be. I'm supposed to be a teenage intellectual, I'm expected to be a rhetorical prodigy. Everyone wants me to be fucking Einstein. I can't take it. I just wanna be a kid. I just wanna have fun.

But they'd never allow that. It would scare them. I was once watching an episode of Adventure Time, and my dad looked at me in bemusement: ""How do you go from Schopenhauer to this?""

People's expectations of me have robbed me of my childhood. All I want in life are the things I never enjoyed as a child: Hopper balls, cartoons, plushies, bounce houses, toys, video games, etc. I just wanna have fun.

Yeah, I'll hold a job, pay taxes, own my own home, of course. But all I want is to take the steps necessary to recreate the childhood I lost to high expectations and a fucking pandemic and be at peace with my body through transitioning and cosmetic surgery.

I feel dirty and disappointing. Everyone in my life expects me to become the author the next Plato's Symposoum, everyone wants me to unlock the key behind psychopolitics, everyone expects me to be a superhuman genius. And I want is to snuggle a teddy bear and watch Steven Universe. All I want is to be a woman.

I'm scared of what my family will think. Their son/nephew/grandchild who could once hold a conversation on the geopolitical buildup to the Russian Revolution is now someone who grew up looking like a Sephardic Jewish male and now looks like a southeast Asian woman, who spends their time off from work riding hopper balls, binging Adventure Time and We Bare Bears, and snuggling plushies.",04Nov2020,1
166,"I was walking home, I drank a bit (enough to make you warm, but not dizzy or unable to walk properly), I was walking a girl home, because she was afraid of bad guys and on the way, 2 dudes catcalled her.

I told them to shut the fuck up, and they made a move, they told me to know my place (something like that), and I replied to fuck off, they was acting strangely, maybe they was high or drunk, I don't know. 

One pulled a knife, and tried to stab me, I blocked with my arm, and thanks god, my jacket trapped it inside, the dude was so surprised he stopped, I kicked him in the knee, and clearly heard a ""crack"". 

The other dude was shocked (he was probably wondering what the fuck is happening) and tried to punch me in the face, I dodged it (I have no idea how, 100% luck in my opinion), and headbanged him, he fall on the ground, I was so pissed I just headbanged him, again and again, until the girl stopped me. His nose was bleeding a river.

Me and the girl leaved, and after a moment, I fell on my knees: what the fuck just happened, what the fuck I done, the adrenaline was gone, I was so shocked of my actions. In the end it's the girl who escorted me home.

I wanted to share this, because it's the first time in my life I fight with someone, and I was enjoying this, I was enjoying the feeling of his nose crushing under my forehead, I enjoyed the crack of the knee and I enjoyed the adrenaline, I'm already fucked up, could it be that I am a psycho ? I don't know, and I hope not.",04Nov2020,1
168,"For starters, I'm not an active smoker. I smoke weed maybe once every 2-3 weeks at most, when a friend happens to bring some. Never bought weed for myself either.

Due to lockdown I won't be able to meet my friends as much in the coming weeks, and tbh I'd love to get stoned every now and then, maybe over Discord with some friends. Getting drunk doesn't really feel viable anymore, due to my hangovers getting worse and worse.

Don't really have any concerns regarding this choice, but I'm still unsure if I want to get some. I still live with my parents (who wouldn't really be bothered by though afaik), and it's not legal here in Germany either. Also I have college to worry about, and I'm not sure how much it would affect my ability to study if I smoked a joint every now and then in the evening. Probably less than getting completely drunk on the weekends though haha.

Just wanted to get this off my chest tbh! Might ask a friend to hook me up with a gram or two soon.",04Nov2020,1
169,"I’m gonna begin by saying that I’m probably typing this cause I’m in a good mood rn. BUT ! I’ve noticed that I used to think of the past as better times and I’d think about how much happier I was then etc. even if in reality those times weren’t necessarily better. 
I have a problem focusing in the present in general so i’ve trained myself to try and focus on the good parts of the present and not the past (or future but I still haven’t gotten the hang of that). 
What I do is just try to be better every day so that way when I think about the past I can be like “well yeah maybe those times were better but you weren’t that good of a person, or you didn’t have X quality then, or you were more selfish and fake etc. It’s always things I can control within myself and how I act so there’s no way I can find an excuse to feel bad. 
Like yeah maybe I was prettier 4 months ago but now I’m more giving and selfless so which version of me is REALLY more beautiful huh?? 

Im probably rambling but maybe this can help someone that’s feeling down rn? idk",04Nov2020,1
170,"I’m a man. I’m not sure how to feel about it. Adult life hit me hard man. It’s not all fat, I’m in pretty decent shape, but I’m not a gym rat by any means of the imagination. I work in a warehouse 50 hours a week lifting multiple 60 pound boxes at a time, and I run up multiple flights of stairs many times a day. That being said, my diet is total crap. I eat anything and everything. 
I’m a mix of happy and sad. I’ve always wanted to be a “big man”. I grew a beard and lifted some weights to get the physique of a large, “bear” like figure. But I’m also 5’11” 
Not sure if this is a good milestone or a bad one. It’s like I dirty bulked my way to a body weight goal. 

Anybody know how I can maintain this weight and make my body look amazing?",04Nov2020,1
171,"I’m a 14 year old male and I love to sing. I believe that God gave me this musical talent for a reason. Often times I worry about my future as a musician so I wrote this song to remind myself that my life is in his hands. I was just strumming on the guitar and the words seemed to just fit in place.

I’m not sure if I’m going to share the song yet but I just want to share this to you guys.

If you want to hear my sing [click here to watch the video ](https://youtu.be/gIVyz5qBJmw) it will help me a lot and also I need feedback! :)

Thanks",04Nov2020,1

174,"Without thinking, I looked at myself in the mirror and said, “I’ve made it this far”.

Suicidal ideation is squirming through and I’m trying my best to suppress it, like suffocate it with a pillow. Diet includes protein, daily fruits n veggies, lots of water. Six days of the week I’m finding at least 30 minutes to work out along with college, and full time time. Work is stressing me out, especially with everyone coming and going due to Covid. I keep thinking about quitting my job but I can’t because I’m paying school out of pocket.

It doesn’t help that I don’t really have any friends. 

How do I keep myself sane? After working the Election yesterday, I cried while peeing in the bathroom and I almost got a fight with my sister when all she asked was, “when are you coming home?”


I keep telling myself, “I’ve made it this far.” to remind myself that I am not a pussy little bitch and I’ve been through far more stressful situations.",04Nov2020,1
175,"I always wanted to be famous. I only thought about being praised and loved by millions and not being forgotten when i die. But i don't like getting feedback, criticism, any kind of reaction from others. I hate it. When i say something i want everyone to hear it and acknowledge me but when they answer back i hate it. Like i never expect an answer. I ask a question but i don't wanna hear an answer. When i wear something new i don't like hearing compliments about it. It's just a cloth, it's just hair, it's just some material. People even complain about my pace while walking and i can't take it but i wanna be a famous singer and hear all those criticisms? All that hate even when i don't do anything... I can't take it. A person like me who can't even take compliments can't take hate comments. So why do i want my voice to be heard if i don't wanna hear an answer? I have no idea... Maybe people think that I'm selfish or narcissist i don't know but  sometimes i feel like a stranger to myself",04Nov2020,1
