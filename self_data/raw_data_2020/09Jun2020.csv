1,"The amount of muscle loosening all over my body since my last update has been amazing. I‚Äôm eagerly looking forward to the day that I no longer have that ‚Äúgotta stretch‚Äù feeling, no more clicks and pops. I feel like Batman recovering from his broken back.",09Jun2020,1
3,"I‚Äôve failed a lot in life.
I‚Äôve known a lot of pain in my life. I say that reluctantly as a 21 year old white man living in 2020. Others have known worse pain than mine.
However I‚Äôve learned to validate my own pain. Nobody will do that for you, so you need to do that on your own. I‚Äôve realized that nobody cares. That helped me a lot in life. Upon realizing these things I‚Äôve learned that I need to take the proper steps to further my life. On my own. Because nobody is going to do it for me.

Believe it or not that‚Äôs actually pretty difficult. I‚Äôve been smoking weed since I was twelve years old. I‚Äôve had depression as long as that, and recently I‚Äôve developed a form of anxiety. Undiagnosed on all fronts. 

When I was around 16 my parents finalized their divorce. It was a long time coming, I remember the fights more than anything. They actually split up once before when I was about 5 years old. They should‚Äôve just stayed split up. 

I joined the marine corps right out of high school. That was a mistake. I don‚Äôt know why I thought the marine corps of all things would fix my depression. Despite it being a mistake, I actually loved my time in the corps. I fit in well. A pretty solid marine. I joined in August of 2017. Got to my unit in February of 2018 as an 0311 Rifleman. I learned how to party, how to fight, I learned the meaning of honor, courage and commitment, and I learned how to set up a complex ambush. I was 19. I drank more alcohol than I thought humanely possible. I woke up in a puddle of my own piss and vomit, ran three miles and did it again that night. I‚Äôve had sex with more women than I care to count. The marine corps made me the man I thought I wanted to be. 

But I left.

I went UA. For those unaware, UA is an acronym in the Navy and Marine Corps standing for Unauthorized Absence. It is the same thing as the more commonly known AWOL, or Absent WithOut Leave, in the Army and Air Force. I went UA because I felt my life crumbling. 

What I didn‚Äôt tell you is that boot camp is secretly a money grab. They pay you while you‚Äôre there, but they fail to tell you that you‚Äôll be spending some of it while aboard MCRD. They also like to get you really tired through strenuous activity, and then sit you down in an air conditioned classroom so they can talk to you about Navy Federal‚Äôs credit card. Which every new marine gets approved for. Needless to say, when they handed out the paper to sign up, I didn‚Äôt know what I was signing up for. I was so damn tired. Prior to this I‚Äôve always told myself that I wouldn‚Äôt get a credit card. I didn‚Äôt have the discipline for it. I‚Äôd fuck my life up. Well sure enough, I was home on leave just after graduating boot camp, and my new credit card came in the mail. With a limit of 17 thousand dollars.

Yeah that all got used on Taco Bell and beer.

Also I have debt on a car that I no longer have and I owe the marine corps money for going UA. Total debt is above 60 thousand dollars.


I should have killed myself a long time ago.

And believe me I‚Äôve thought about it.


But that‚Äôs not how I think anymore. 

That‚Äôs not how I ever should have thought. 

You know what? I‚Äôm fucking smart, dude. And I‚Äôm able to do the things that I set my mind to. And I can tell you right now, I‚Äôm glad I went through that. I‚Äôm glad I made the mistakes and bad decisions that I‚Äôve made. I‚Äôll never make them again. I‚Äôll never get into a commitment and back out of it again. I left when the going got tough, and that will never be me again.

Today, I‚Äôm 21. Not much older, a little bit wiser. I have an amazing girlfriend whom I share my life with, and I‚Äôm enrolled in university, studying Political Science with a concentration in Pre Law. My girlfriend‚Äôs Canadian and the border is closed, so when I goto college back home, I won‚Äôt be able to see her again until the border opens. I‚Äôve been staying with her. So to make sure I have a bed, I‚Äôll be living in the dorms here on campus. If I get overwhelmed, I‚Äôll take a class or two off my schedule.

But I will not fucking quit.

Oh no.

I‚Äôve learned my lesson on being a quitter. I‚Äôve had family members, former friends ridicule me. People who don‚Äôt even know me, but held me to this ridiculous standard because I was a marine, ridicule me for leaving the corps. I‚Äôll have no more of that. I will prove to myself and to the rest of my family that I can do what I set my mind to.

My end goal, become a lawyer. More specifically, a civil rights attorney. I would also be interested in becoming a district attorney. I have a long, long road ahead of me. When the going gets tough, I won‚Äôt leave, but I will get going.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story, I just needed to tell it.",09Jun2020,6
4,"This isn't a pro or anti-guns post, just an observation about the nature of reddit's community. 

Even as /r/news moves in lockstep with the left on almost every issue, favorable opinions on gun control are still universally downvoted and firearms remain revered in a way that would not be out of place at an NRA convention. You see some of this recently with the stories on calls to defund the police: lots of upvoted comments about gun stores being empty.

I find it interesting how gun owners are still able to dominate the discussion in the comments so completely. This tells me that gun control advocates are either unable or unwilling to converge on stories about guns in large numbers. They lack the coordination and sheer fanatacism to compete with gun owners.

This is true on reddit, and it seems to be true in real life as well. Gun owners will always make their voices heard no matter how many or how few they are. You really need to match their passion and intensity to compete with them on this issue. If you can't, they win, as they have historically.",09Jun2020,1
5,"I just needed to get this out for a little bit of personal closure. For reference, I am mixed. My mother is white and my father is African American. I grew up in a small town in a state with only a handful of black people. My father was not one of them. I do not blame him for not wanting to live there. 

Mom. I‚Äôm not angry at you. That‚Äôs not why I left. I left because ‚ÄòI‚Äôm the problem.‚Äô On my last day of high school you made me very aware of that. That I had spent my whole life being very self centered about how my skin color and hair were impacting me. I had never looked up from my own pity party to think about how it impacted you. How it made people not want to hang out with you after they met me. How it made guys not call you back after meeting me. How my being there made you lonely. 

And then I ran into some not so great people. I don‚Äôt think I ever told you about this part. I didn‚Äôt want to burden you with more things that were happening just because I was there, being your child. Anywho, it turns out some really racist people hang out in the bar down the street from your house. They also threatened to burn down your house. After one of my co-workers took me there for a drink and drugged me and... well that part still doesn‚Äôt really matter.

Point is, I would spend all night worrying about you and my sibling dying in a house fire just because of me. So when the chance arose, I left. I mean. I had considered some other alternatives before deciding on that one, but I always kinda liked being alive. I‚Äôve always had an unshakable feeling that I am ‚Äúdestined for greatness.‚Äù But maybe I watched the lion king too many times. 

But yeah. I‚Äôm fine. No warrants were ever out for my arrest. I‚Äôm actually living my best life and doing some pretty awesome things with it. I‚Äôm surrounded by some really great people these days. Just wanted to let you know I‚Äôm not coming back. For anything. And I‚Äôm sorry I tried to rekindle our relationship. That was a born of a pretty selfish desire on my part. I should have thought more about the danger I would be putting you in again. 

I know that you‚Äôve removed just about all physical traces of me and sometimes you forget I even exist. It‚Äôs good. You really don‚Äôt have to be telling anyone I exist anymore. Or if some one does remember I exist you can say I passed away and kinda move on from there. 

You‚Äôre free to go find some one, and make friends, and not have to worry about that rejection anymore. Go be happy for once. I‚Äôm not your bogey man in the closet anymore. Haven‚Äôt been for a while.

7,"My relatives used to take care of her when she moved here. Family friend situation from what I gathered. She later got her own flat upstairs. When I got here, my relatives took care of me. When they left, she started looking after me.

She's about 2/3 years older than I am. She's accomplished and focused (as I've observed thus far), very sweet and caring and brings me food once a month and checks on me. I've been nothing short of respectful towards her and grateful for all the help she's given me. And I developed fucking feelings for her. Gradual mental deterioration from being alone aside, I hate that I have feelings for her. I feel like shit and all my other problems prancing around my head didn't make my situation any better.

9,"I have always disliked a certain kind of people, and that is people who think that they are enlightened and that everyone else in their life has wronged them. They act like the problems always with other people and don‚Äôt try to work things out, and are too afraid of confrontation and criticism.

To me these people are worst than assholes, at least assholes are openly assholes while these people act nice on the outside and you only begin to see their true colors when you get closer to them. 

The difference between narcissists and these type of people is that these people do SEEM to take others feelings into consideration, what makes these people worst than narcissists and assholes is that they preach about meaningful and nice things like, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt compare yourself to other people, everyone has different circumstances.‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeople tend to *insert action* when *insert event*‚Äù and other ‚Äúenlightening‚Äù things. Major problem is they either can‚Äôt relate to what they say or are just generalizing what they see and forming some quote or they don‚Äôt even practice it at all. 

These people love to use the word toxic very lightly, blaming others for being toxic when they themselves are toxic. This one person told me how I was toxic, which I admit I wasn‚Äôt very considerate which I acknowledged in front of the, but next thing you know they tell me how taking a gap year after high school was stupid because I wasted a year when I could have been taking classes. 

Also these people cannot take criticism, if you try to tell them how they are in the wrong you will be viewed as toxic to them and they will ghost you until you apologize.

I admit I‚Äôm not perfect either, but at least I admit my wrongdoings, take criticism, and try to listen and work things out. 

Sorry just needed to blow some steam but I have seen too many of these people and am tired of their ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù bullshit",09Jun2020,3
11,"For reference, I am a guy. I really need help or advice on how to move on after a super nasty breakup. It‚Äôs been over a year since things ended but I‚Äôm still struggling with this so much. This was my first girlfriend (and first sexual relationship) so I definitely feel like that‚Äôs impacting the healing period. 

I‚Äôve been told by a few of my friends (and my parents) that I should move on and just try going out with someone new, but I feel like that‚Äôs going to be really unfair on the new girl because of the strong feelings I still have for my ex. 

Me and my ex still talk on the phone occasionally for hours at time (maybe once every two weeks) and when I ask her about getting back she‚Äôs never open to it. She was a liar and a cheater throughout the entire relationship - but I‚Äôm still wanting to try again with her and hope it‚Äôll be different, I don‚Äôt understand why I feel this way. The breakup was super nasty because after we started dating she had just come out of a 3 year relationship. We dated for around a year then her ex boyfriend died and she was so devastated by it that she said we couldn‚Äôt be together anymore. Kept trying to comfort her and help but she was just so closed to me. Found out she‚Äôd still been in very frequent contact with him the whole time we were dating, especially while I was at work. She‚Äôd also lied about a lot of other things, including telling all her friends she was single while she was actually with me. There‚Äôs a lot more to it but that‚Äôs the general gist of it. 

I guess my question is why I still have feelings for her and why I can‚Äôt move on and get over her? I don‚Äôt want to hurt some poor girl the same way she‚Äôs hurt me but how else do I get over this? It feels like a year is a long time but I‚Äôm no closer to being happy than I was when we first broke up.",09Jun2020,5

21,"  Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I‚Äôm thick because I‚Äôm ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‚Äòand well done‚Äô as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‚Äòlet me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc‚Äô a lot more than once too.


Edit: she started saying the ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",09Jun2020,0
22,"Personally I don't like making Bezos any richer than he is, but it's just so damn convenient. The other day I decided I really need a bathroom scale (quarantine issues - no judgement).

Finally found an employee and asked, he said they're over in bedding, pointed to the sign. I walked every fucking aisle in bedding and there were no fucking bathroom scales.

every passing moment from this point on will keep sleep‚Äôs sweet nothings at bay; for now, the cool, humid early-morning air fills my soul and leaves the hint of salt dancing along my taste buds.

30,"Yeah. I'm going to a private school next year, and I'll be in 9th grade. I made a few friends in middle school, and they were pretty nice, but I usually act dumb around everyone who I feel is out of my league, because they can laugh at me, which isn't the best, but it's better then them acting friendly to me or acting me being awkward to them. I'll pretend to be clueless all the time. I actually reiterate, it feels GOOD to have them even acting that way towards me. Sometimes it's even in good spirit. 

At this point this is just becoming a dump for me to write my thoughts. 

I watched porn for the first time when I was 6. I saw a cartel beheading online when I was 11 or so, and I regularly frequent gore sites such as bestgore, but I don't really know why. I guess I would just like to know what I would like when I die. It's pretty neat to see how far removed movie effects are compared to real life. I always wonder if being exposed to things like that have influenced my current self. I feel like they have. I'm an asian american, and I'm a lazy bum. I procrasinate all the time and whenever I feel motivated to do something I always quit, ALWAYS QUIT, eventually. Whenever someone says something to me or I read something particulary moving to me, I do a complete 180 in terms of my personality. I always try to force a different personality on myself, different thoughts, depending on one little thing. I pulled a knife on my brother, too. I wonder if the people who read my last post are here too. 

I can't do anything, I can't stick with anything. If this is what being a teenager is like I hate it. Who the hell thought of pimples anyways? My dad doesn't get along with my mom too much. I'm paranoid my brother is on this website and will read this post and know it is me and think that I am an idiot. I don't have social anxiety, I just have thoughts like this all the time. I'm not in constant agony, I just find it very annoying to have to be this way. I don't bother to change myself because I know I'll give up. I wonder sometimes if those racist and genocidal comments the people on the shock sites I visit are leeching into my brain, slowly but surely. I wonder if there is logic in what they say, about black people being inferior, but I know that's wrong, but then again, I'm not the judge of what is right or wrong in my head, everyone else is and they don't know it. I don't have myself, I don't own myself. My dad remarks in a positive way about the BLM movement and I remember that I was having racist thoughts. One comment about one thing and my opinion of something completely changes. It's not exausting, it obviously isn't a disorder, I'm just really getting ticked off at not being able to say my thoughts to anyone. Isn't it dumb how drastically the teenager mind changes over puberty? How can my peers be seemingly having such normal lives if they think like me? But if that is not the answer than that would mean not everyone thinks like me and that I have an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the last few times I've gotten involved in help, I get screwed over.   Just recently I had a woman that I used to know from high school ask for money to help her kids.  ""Diapers"".  I thought sure, I know she just split off from her husband, so I sent some money.  She seemed pretty relieved and we talked for a while.  Nothing important, just some memes and junk, seeing if she was doing okay.  We then went on with our lives.  A week later she invited me to a campfire, asking for a little more money.  It seemed like it was going to be a nice ""thanks"" get together.  Catch up, make some food, see what's changed.

&amp;#x200B;

Blocked on all messaging, find out the campfire address is fake.  A big middle finger out of nowhere all over... $50.  Money I make in a fraction of a day, so I'm not worried.  But it *feels shitty* to get sold out/played over next to nothing.  Especially from someone I use to know as a nice, kind individual.  I suppose it's saddening to realize what some people prioritize.  It's something I wouldn't stoop down to do.

I was born in a city in the south, but for anon sake let‚Äôs say Atlanta, and been claiming that I‚Äôm from panama (im not, i was born in Atlanta but I have Panamanian ancestry) and been putting up this facade that I‚Äôm from there for like 4 years. I did this because I am very insecure about my ancestry as my dad is a mutt (not knowing who his non black father was) and my mom is American born Caribbean-black and native, again her not knowing about her side, so it just caused me to create a story in my head, to belong to a group and to be cool.
I also ‚Äòhad‚Äô a small accent for a while but it just because so overwhelming to lie so I stopped. I thought people would think I was cool doing that. I speak French and English well and I shouldn‚Äôt be pulling off an accent for brownie points.
I‚Äôve done a lot of self growth lately and I realized that lying is lame. lying isn‚Äôt cool and i wouldn‚Äôt want to pull a lie like this again. I want to come clean. Especially after being with my bf for so so long I can‚Äôt continue this. I love him too much to lie.
I lied because I thought it was cool to belong as I felt lost. Im okay with claiming my black side but my family doesn‚Äôt know anything about their tree so I agreed to take an ancestry test so I can lay this situation to rest. 
I want to tell my bf but i don‚Äôt know how to tell him. Any advice?",09Jun2020,1
37,"TLDR at end

I brand myself as being this super secure confident unshakable person. But I am not. With strangers or close friends I am secure, and I look forward to seeing them. But there is a huge area of people I sort of know that terrify me. I am scared to see them because I don‚Äôt want them to see how I look or know what I am doing. This has led to me isolating myself a lot, which only makes my insecurities around old friends or acquaintances worse. I avoid places I think I will run into people. The avoiding certain activities like public areas or certain places is starting to make my life worse. I need to break the chain.

The thing is I don‚Äôt know what the issue is. On a real level I know I don‚Äôt care what these people think, but I still make decisions based on avoiding being seen. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like how I look. Although there are some weight gain insecurities that definitely are apart of it. But I think I am happy with my appearance. I am also a pretty happy and cool person, I have hobbies and I enjoy my time a lot. I don‚Äôt know why I feel like I don‚Äôt want to see most people and just want to move far away where I won‚Äôt have to deal with this. Anyone relate to this? Have any ideas?

TLDR: 
I have insecurities that I let prevent me from doing certain things in order to avoid seeing people. Any ideas?",09Jun2020,1

42,"I work as a night security guard, one if my company's biggest clients is the local hospital. So, last night, as I was walking in at 3am for my rounds, I coughed, the nurses asked me if I had been coughing, I said that I'd been feeling a bit of tickling at the back of my throat and was denied entry until I get back results that I don't have the virus. So today, I went to get tested. 

I'm not very scared, I live in a small town in Australia with no reported cases, my nose gets all runny on cold nights (And nights here are freezing, being winter and all that) but still, testing was nessecary. 

So, getting tested fucking sucks, the easy part is the mouth swab, they brush the back of your throat with the swab, be warned this does trigger your gag reflex. But the real bad part is the nose swab. I won't lie, I did make some pained noises when it was done (not screaming, but that clenched teeth ""uuurrrrrrrrg!"" Noise) because they brush the swab so far in you feel like it's picking your brain. Following this is a few minutes of blowing blood out of your nose followed by a few days in isolation till you get the ""you're infected"" or ""you're clear"" call. 

While getting tested sucks, it is important to get tested. The death toll in the U.S is all the info you should need to know how dangerous it can be.

46,"  Okay so hi guys, i‚Äôve been trying to get some real and good sugar daddies but get scammed. lol. If i knew things will be like this, i shouldn‚Äôt have done it and get stuck more with my expenses.

PLEASE RESPECT. 

So here is the story, I met them on twitter (yeah them) and there is this ‚Äúsugar momma‚Äù says that she is willing to pay me off blah blah blah and in order for me to get her money is to get her a google play card and sis guess what? I paid her google play card and sent her the code. (although I‚Äôm running out of money) sorry for being gullible with these things. Then, things were really hard, i lost her contact since i don‚Äôt have a phone and i only let my friend talk to her since she is free and has a phone. 

The second scammer, David is his name. This time I thought it was real (LIKEEE YOOO WTF) I did exactly what he wants me to do though I‚Äôm having a doubt with him, but my dumbass still did it because I asked a friend of mine if the google play gift card is needed when u send someone a money from paypal and she answered yes. I trust her so... I know you guys would get mad at me, but my mindset that time is to gamble if you want something in return...  

Okay so I searched in google if how many days will the transaction get completed fo me to receive the money. It says it has to be completed within 1-3 days so I waited. BITCH THAT‚ÄôS 2,000 DOLLARS and I could get my necessities for the whole school year if I have that big amount of money. u

So, four days has passed and I know that deep inside I have been scammed again. I confronted the guy. I told him that we‚Äôll be friends after this, I just need him to confess what he did and why he did it since 1$ is equivalent to 1kg of rice and I should‚Äôve bought some rice instead of wanting an ‚Äúinstant money.‚Äù He said that he‚Äôs from Nigeria and had to do it because he also needs money to pay his bills and he only makes furniture under this small company to live. I asked him how did he get a US prepaid card but he didn‚Äôt answer. 

So all these times, I‚Äôm just fooling myself around. Haha and I have to pay my friend since I borrowed some of her just to get this google play card shit. Sorry if my english is bad. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I now have a phone but it is downgraded, I need a laptop for online class. :((

This is gonna be a short post because I'm really tired
 but had this thought bothering me for the past 13 minutes. So here goes:

When I was still in middle school (8th grade) this group of very nerdy and friendly guys for some reason took a interest in me. They were in 7th grade but they seemed mature than most young teens.  

They never did any drugs, or smoked, or had sex, or cut class or anything bad that more other teenagers do. 

They also had similar interests as me.

I was too shy and alway in a bad mood and despite their kindness and efforts to get me to join their small group of friends I just ignored them. 
I probably missed a opportunity to have nice friends.

And now that I'm older making friends seems so much fucking stressful and harder and no one is willing to approach me and try to befriend me. I feel so fucking terrible for rejecting those guys. 

I probaly wont have any good friends any time soon... I feel so lonely and upset and angry at myself.",09Jun2020,3

61,"I'm a department Director for a senior living home and I just cant do this anymore.

In January/February I was on top of the world with this job. I was in excellent graces, got a 5/5 on my review with a nice raise, helping out other communities with my expertise. Finally fully staffed for pretty much the first time in two years. Then COVID hit. At first, we were fine, I was helping other communities again, but when Quarantine hit, that's when shit started going south. Our dining room closed, and we turned into a hotel with full time room service. I had to create a whole new system for how we took orders, and executed them. Corporate did provide us with guidance on it however it was a one size fits all and would severely affect my communities quality of life. I took on more than I could chew in order to keep our residents happy. Still didn't work. I had to take myself out of helping the other community and focus on mine. A brand new executive director just started mid march as well, getting to know him slowly. I started getting more stressed, more tasks were shoved on me. Being an independent community, we didn't have a care staff needed to help with extra tasks bestowed upon us for resident safety. Anonymous complaints against me started happening to HR to the ""ethics"" hotline. 

One director got fired, then another quit. Then the COVID employee tests came. 1 diagnosed positive in my department. Lost him for two weeks, then another employee of mine went on leave due to health reasons in light of the positive test. Then I lost another one because she walked out due to a tiff with another employee. Then the anonymous complaints about me came in again. I wasn't helping my staff enough, I was playing favorites, I was too aggressive in my tone, I went to the store to often and wasn't there for them (my food purveyor shorted me a lot during this time) I start doing 1 on 1's with my team to try and repair the miscommunication and bond. I'm down to almost half a crew. Cooks are getting sick (not with COVID) I'm covering their shift weeks on end while still doing my jobs. Getting yelled at by residents because they hate the menu corporate sent me. Getting resident complaints that I'm dismissive and arrogant. No, I'm just overworked and little time to discuss frivolous matters. 

Then the write up comes in. I've never received a write up in a managerial role before. This one was a ""final written"" however, because they provided me verbal coaching on one other occasion. I told them I'm overworked, stressed out, suffering compassion fatigue. But what am I doing to fix my issues. I have a strong feeling, the employee complaints are from two employees who don't like to be held accountable.  The anonymous nature of it makes it impossible to adjust my management style for a couple employees rather than a whole team who I know doesn't feel the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done. I've never felt so defeated in a job. I've never gone from top of the world to last leg so fast. I've battled depression all my life, and these past few months I've mused over suicide so much more just to gain the littlest sense of control back into my life. I've had to move twice in the past two months as well due to roommate safety (with the positive COVID news) I'm constantly moving days off, coming in on days off, making concessions for the company and community. I'm always on call for anything they need. I'm heavier than i've ever been, I've been eating like shit, not sleeping well, exhausted physically and emotionally. I've saved up a decent cushion fund and bolstered my retirement a lot this past year. I'm going to take a break. From responsibility. From the beholden nature of the corporate world. Time to refocus on myself. No I don't have anything lined up. But I will find something. Scary as the job market is.

71,"I live with my childhood best friend (both 20F). I have always been there for her and she for me, and she has been through a lot. I won‚Äôt go into detail but she comes from a very abusive home and she suffers from severe mental illness so I feel protective of her like a big sister. Last summer she started seeing a girl who is two years younger than us, she is a lot of fun and at first I liked hanging out with her even though she could be a little immature sometimes. 

But then a few months ago I got a call from my best friend. She was literally screaming and crying because she was in pain. She was hysterical, so asked for her to hand the phone to her gf. I begged the gf to call 911. She refused. I could hear my friend in the background still screaming and begging for help, asking for an ambulance. I pleaded with the gf to call 911 and hung up for her to do so. I would have called myself, but I didn‚Äôt know where they were. I was panicking and crying my eyes out. I had just lost someone close to me in my family and was terrified I would lose my best friend. 

When I called back the gf she had not called an ambulance. She had a friend drive them to a hospital, but it was a mental hospital so they had to turn around. I could still hear my friend crying in the background. By the time they got to the hospital, it was an hour after the first call my friend had made. I was fuming mad, I felt like I could throw up. My friend is fine now, she had a small tear in the membrane around her brain with was causing fluid to leak from her nose and mouth and triggered a panic attack. My friend forgave her for not calling 911 and is still with her and still brings her over even though she knows I am very uncomfortable with it and don‚Äôt like her at all. 

I don‚Äôt think her gf is an evil person, but my stomach turns whenever I see her. I can‚Äôt forgive her and it‚Äôs making me pull away from my friend but at the same time I feel I need to protect her.

Today I go to a driving school and I have very less clothes so I wear an oversized collar-shirt and pants. They are very oversized because I am only 151cm tall and very skinny.

In class and outside, I get very scared and even move half-doubting my movement. I can't move smoothly and whenever others answer Q&amp;A, I did not even have the guts to speak out. My voice is also quite weird, being quite ""childish"" squeaky for a 19 yrs old to have.

Even at times when I can't see properly the screen because I am at the back, I am scared to move forward so I just listen to whatever they say. 

I can't even see level eye contact with anyone because besides all the problems above, my face is also quite ugly. I try many skincare but still ugly.

And I go to a shopping mall just now still in my oversized clothes. When I see girls walking near me, I quickly go far away and also I can't get my friendly voice out when talking with girls. Because of my fear, I automatically speak in an angry voice for no reason.

I lost my nerve completely. As a kid, I couldn't say those words or talk in front of others about what happened. So I stopped the process.

108,"I had a last appointment to get travel expenses for my new job with my job advisor who I'd been going to for 6 months. I'd never really got on with her in recent times as I used to just keep my head down rather than saying hello to her and I always felt she hated me tbh.

I got a new job and I told my new job that id been in a temporary work placements the last 6 months rathery than being with that advisor the last 6 months as I said (because they didn't want to see too many gaps in unemployment, I lied) and my advisor (who didn't know tbh) contacted my new job to confirm my employment, and then my new manager questioned me about where I actually was the last 6 months ( I nearly got sacked) I emailed my advisor angry about it and her responses were her mad to on the defensive she replied with things like ‚ÄòI will not contact you again now if this is what you prefer‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry you are unhappy about this but I do wish you well for the future‚Äô etc. but but I quickly apologised as I realised she didn't know I lied I replied ‚Äòok sorry to make a fuss‚Äô and she didn‚Äôt reply. 


Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‚Äòthat‚Äôs fine graham, don‚Äôt worry, if you want to come in to office ‚Ä™before 5pm today‚Ä¨ I can sort this out for you‚Äô. 


Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she‚Äôd of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass at her desk. so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'oh Its ok I understand' (in a nice way) and she went quiet as she carried on  written the paper form out for me then just asked when I‚Äôm next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‚Äòtonight?‚Äô (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses).  

A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got a job.",09Jun2020,0

120,"  Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I‚Äôm thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‚Äòawwwww ok......and well done‚Äô as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‚Äòlet me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc‚Äô often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",09Jun2020,0

123,"tldr at the end...


This like happened in 9th grade. One of my classmates only ever brought a cube to school beforehand, and nobody ever really remembered about it.


Come 6th grade. My brother and his friends learn how to solve the cube, my brother even teaches me how to solve it. The following years, they forget about it, but it's still in my head. Plus, I was extremely socially awkward (still am), so I thought, maybe I could use it to make some friends.


By 9th grade, I had become pretty adept at it. Being able to solve it in about 50 seconds, which amazed many people. One guy in my class who's also known as a nerd started talking to me, and I started imparting my knowledge onto him. Eventually, the amount of people learning how to solve it from me went from 1, to 2, to 3, to 7.


But, at the middle of the school year, disciple number 7 claimed he had finally attained the skill to beat me, and he did. I was heartbroken, but he was the better man. After that, I realized that there's no point to this because I'll never be the best, let alone be the best where I currently am. So, I kinda stopped caring about it. Eventually, I lost all 7 friends except for 2, who were my classmates so that kinda made sense.


A year later. I see every boy the playground holding Rubix Cubes. Not exaggerating, solving the 3x3 became as popular as playing Fortnite was last year in 2019. Every kid was holding it, and it was a sign of coolness. Apparently, the kid's (my underclassmen) that I taught eventually went on to teach other kids as well(their underclassmen).


Things got so out of hand that the school was forced to recognize it (This same school also banned chess and any kind of clubs, schools in my country are all study 8 hours a day!). As a result, the first ever club in my school became the cube club. Admittedly, it was more of an after school club because the school did not want to ""waste"" time.The supervisor even recommended me as the club leader since I started this mess, but I refused and suggested disciple no. 7 since he was probably the best cuber in the school. Was kinda flattered.


Years later, I was still called the cube boy by my teacher and classmates. The girls who made fun of me for always playing with the cube, still make fun of me. And I'm still socially anxious. This year, I moved to a new school, and I was recognized by many people as the cube boy, and I'm like wtf. Apparently, one of the disciples of my disciples moved here and started his own movement. Also, even before entering I was touted as this genius asian that would be the smartest boy in school upon arrival (I am not). Also, I have no friends again!


Sorry for the long post. I recently started using the cube again to keep my mind off my depression, and this memory has been resurfacing a lot recently. I wanted to tell someone about it, but I have no one to tell it to. lol.


tldr: I taught how to solve a 3x3 to many people. Those people taught other people. And suddenly, becoming a cuber  had became as trendy as Fortnite.",09Jun2020,1

148,"It's a long story, but we met on /r/r4r from a really morbid post I wrote. She ended up being 6 hours drive away. We started as a long distance relationship and we spent all of our free time together.

She was really nice to me, she never hurt my feelings or pained me. We had good times watching movies together over the phone. We shared our tastes, complained about our jobs and talked about whatever else was on our mind. We slept together at the same time over the phone and kept it running until the morning. We were each others reminders and alarms clocks. We were really close.

Eventually, I took my car for a 6 hour drive and got there really tired past midnight. We had a good time together and we we're all over each other. She was what she said she was, she met my expectations. We didn't do it but we didn't need to.

We started discussing our future and feeling each other's vibes and things weren't lining up. What we felt over the phone we didn't feel in real life. We didn't expect it but we just weren't on the same frequency. On the third morning, we agreed that we wouldn't work out and broke up mutually. We spend some time together hugging and kissing before I went back home.

Although it was mutual, it was still painful for both of us with endless crying spells and really strong feelings of missing each other. All the memories of the good times we spent together are stuck in our heads.

As the feelings dissipated we started talking to each other again. We're best friends now. Thanks sweetie.

Our semester just ended a month ago. Today, I was contacted by our department head and informed that they would not be seeking my services for the next semester due to the low number of enrollees.

165,"My dad worked for the United Nations and as a result I lived in war torn countries until I moved to the states when I turned 18. I had the opportunity to hear oppressive regimes and those fighting them use statistics as a basis for many of their arguments and here‚Äôs why it never worked.

There are so many variables concerning human behavior. Statistics are fine for looking at something like ‚Äúhow does a motor perform under a certain amount of stress‚Äù or ‚Äú how much sunlight on average goes through this opening‚Äù but with human behavior it‚Äôs flawed because no two data points are the same. Because of that simple fact statistics can be generated to support almost ANY CLAIM surrounding human behavior. They are almost misleading at times and I‚Äôve seen this a lot with all that has been going on recently.
I‚Äôve seen people bring up the statistic that ‚Äúabout 40% of cops best their wives‚Äù as a reason why the cops should be disbanded or on the other side ‚Äú98% of all crimes against black people are by black people‚Äù as an argument that cops aren‚Äôt really a problem. Ignoring whether or not those stats are actually true, It really is the manifestation of a problem that has plagued humans for so many years because it doesn‚Äôt mention the thousands of variables that address each member of that statistic. For example, the statistic surrounding the cops that beat their wives; in the context I provided we don‚Äôt know how they sampled it, if it‚Äôs cops in America or certain states, we don‚Äôt know anything. The statistic about black people killing each other also ignores the fact that most blacks are in close proximity to each other so they are more likely to commit crimes against one another.

I‚Äôve always took statistics concerning human behavior with a grain of salt regardless of whether I trust the person telling it to me because they are always biased. Very few people look up stats that support their opposing view. This was a huge problem for me because growing up around such radical people (not my family but just people my dad was helping) I‚Äôve always struggled with figuring out what‚Äôs right and wrong, whether what‚Äôs being done is helping or hurting, and what the best way to sort through all the bs is. 

My current method has been to look at feedback from the affected community. When I went outside back when I lived in the Sahara desert, if the locals unanimously had a belief about how something was affecting them and constantly acted on those beliefs, I tended to trust those more than government shown statistics that went the other way. 

My question to you is how do you sort through all of it? How do you use statistics? Do you believe in them more than I do? Why?

Tl:dr I believe stats surrounding human behavior are misleading and people use them incorrectly. How do you sort through the bs and use them?",09Jun2020,2

I haven't moved out because I don't make enough. People give me a ton of shit for it, from girls I've met up with to members of my own family.

For example, I had a date come over. Now, it was late and I live in a separate quarter of the house, where I have absolute privacy. She sat there for a minute and then said, ""I don't want to sound like a bitch or anything but... *do you live with your parents?* I'm just really independent and I have my own house and my own car that I bought with my own money."" I pointed at the door and told her to get out. Then the other day, I was at lunch with family. I was talking about how I'm tight with money. I jokingly asked my brother, ""what do people even spend money on?"" Then he replied with, ""you know, bills, groceries, insurance...""

I'm sick of everyone being so condescending, because I feel as though people are kicking me when I'm down. My dad constantly chastises me for majoring in communications (side note: also have two minors - chemistry and psychology). Customers at my retail job also talk down to me. God, even classmates talked down to me even though I routinely made the highest grades in the class (graduated with a 3.5 GPA).

I have no clue what to do with my life. I feel like I'm stuck, but a small part of me is confident that I won't be stuck in a shitty dead-end job for the rest of my life like my nightmares tell me.

The other part is that I'm terrified of moving away and getting a demanding higher-paying job. I worry about crashing and burning, starving all the time and constantly living with crippling stress. My work experiences haven't been good, either. I remember every single time I've ever gotten chewed out. I get flashbacks of getting scolded by my former manager EVERY day, even though it happened six years ago (I'm going to celebrate on the day he dies). My problem wasn't so much doing the job, it was that I wasn't enthusiastic and I wasn't going ""above and beyond"" at a place that was paying me $8 an hour. But I'm incredibly susceptible to burnout and I get very easily overwhelmed. When a supervisor is showing me how to do a certain task for the first time, I'm so anxious that I can't even hear what they're saying. Then going back to getting chewed out - it's humiliating and I cry for the rest of the day.

I want to be self-employed and make a good enough living so that people will be comparing themselves to me and not the other way around. I'm disgusted by people who make more than I do (the fact that my brother is a millionaire makes my blood boil). I want to make a name for myself, and make the people I know feel frustrated with themselves so they can get a taste of how I've felt for my entire life. I'm disgusted by people who make more money than I do, and how they talk to me in ways that insult my intelligence and make me feel like I'm beneath them.

But in the end, I'm mad at myself. My work ethic sucks. I have no motivation. I switched to a useless major because I wasn't smart enough to get through STEM classes, and I knew there was no way in hell I'd make it through dental or medical school, much less get accepted by those schools. The only way I keep myself sane is by daydreaming about living out the revenge fantasies I've mentioned in this post.",09Jun2020,10
170,"My sister and I were visiting my grandmother today.  We were watching ""Family Feud"" when we all heard some crashes.  I briskly headed outside and my sister followed me.  We went out the backdoor and as we made our way around the apartment building we saw a car upside-down in the street.  Something just came over me and like in autopilot I just sprinted toward the overturned car.  My sister and I were the first ones there and the driver of the upside-down car had just freed themselves and there was a passenger stuck inside.  I ran to the passenger and pulled them out while my sister called 911.  Quickly thereafter other people were coming outside and other cars were backed up in traffic as the street was effectively shut down.  My grandmother made her way outside in about 5-10 mins and then we told her what had happened.  When the fire department came and cleaned up the scene my grandmother said to one firefighter while pointing at me ""That's my grandson and he pulled the lady out of the car"".  It was really sweet to see my grandmother taking pride in it and honestly pulling someone out of an overturned car kinda leaves a bit of a high.",09Jun2020,70
