0,"We live 2mins away from each other, and I saw her two days ago - but it warms my heart.


Our relationship has had rough patches, but we're in a pretty good spot currently. I'm lucky to have her.",09Oct2020,1
1,"
I’m 23. I often feel intensely frustrated with myself and envious of other people. Sometimes it’s not totally warranted and I know that but I still feel so envious, I often wish I was more successful/accomplished/attractive/cool/interesting/had more perseverance/grit/positive qualities. It’s not that I think those people are just lucky. I know they worked hard and face their own challenges but that doesn’t help me not feel jealous it just makes me feel even more upset because not only do I not have what they have but it’s my fault. It’s not that I don’t believe I can change it’s just that I know it will take a long time and they are so far ahead. It’s also that I am jealous, not just their accomplishments, but of the admiration, attention, praise and “love” they receive for their success/accomplishments. I know they deserve it and earned it but I want it too nonetheless. Well it feels like I need it. And now. But that’s irrational and greedy, I know.",09Oct2020,1
2,"I'm not a party kind of person cos I don't know how to dance and I don't drink and I'm shy and I've never been to proper parties but whenever someone tells me about the parties they went to and the things they did I feel so jealous. I want to have fun with people like that too and share in the fun that other people are having but even if there was no corona I would feel so awkward to go to a party like that even if it's just to see if I'm missing out on anything, I just wouldn't know how to act at a party. I feel like I'm missing out on fun things.",09Oct2020,1
3,I feel like no one in my life except a few people actually like me. My family judges me and loves me but I don’t think they like me. I feel like my friends only hang with me because they pity me. Just a short rant feeling very lonely.,09Oct2020,1
4,"6 years ago I started dating this guy named Bob (not his real name). Bob is fantastic, extremely smart, very logical, quite lazy (not a problem), very kind, can solve everything and anything. He was my human Google search. He taught me how to be confident in my intelligence, not to be afraid to ask questions, and express myself. He knew about my past (dysfunctional family and was sexuallly abused from ages 5-6years), but he came with me on this journey of self exploration and helped me become the woman I am today. I love who I am, and he supported me to be me. 

But... it was all shattered last year. A lot happened last year. I found out he was into loli hentai (ages 5-10) and when I confronted him about it he denied it and said it was accidentally downloaded. I believed him. Then I saw the same pictures (thought it was weird that he never deleted them) and more. Confronted him about it. He denied and said they were accidentally downloaded. I believed him. I saw them a third time (not deleted and more). This time I searched, because it didn’t make sense and then I found out he was using different browsers to look up loli hentai and this time I confronted him with the evidence. He confessed and said it was him who downloaded it. 

I was angry, hurt, and disgusted, because he knew I was sexually abused. I was annoyed with his selfishness and his lies. Disappointed that he would ruin our relationship just for a moment of bliss. The future I planned for us to have kids, to become foster parents, for us to help kids in need to provide them a safe place all went up in smokes. Poof. Gone. The damage was done and there was not going back.

I stayed with him for a year, because after I found out his secret my mental health started to decline. It declined so badly that I went into the mental health hospital. He visited me everyday and tried to help me get better. Eventually I was released and we stayed together until I got better. But now, a year later, I am breaking up with him. I can’t see myself with someone who was looking at loli hentai fully knowing I wanted to work with kids, have kids around us, and knowing knew I was sexually abused.

It hurts so much. I am leaving the man of my life not because I don’t love him. It’s because I don’t trust him and I don’t think I can.",09Oct2020,1
5,"Okay I'm 24 M, straight, I work full-time and have a townhouse to myself, I drive and own a car.

My personality is more introverted, I'm quirky but very chill and get along with people very easily, I'm very loyal and care deeply. I get easily attached though which fucks me over continually. My sign is Aquarius if that matters.

I'm like 5'5"", slim but fit 165 lbs.

I have tried everything, from dating services to asking out people I've befriended to co-workers even. Yet no one will even give me a fucking chance, every time it hurts more and more, to be continually teased and then denied the one thing you've been craving for nearly a decade, the missing piece. 
Being religated to everyone's best friend starts to become a slap in the face after awhile, when the intimacy you've longed for for so long gets continually kicked out of reach, when it's the one thing that would cure your depression.

What the fuck is wrong with me? 
Why won't anyone give me a chance?
If someone would ever give me a chance I would hold it to the highest honor a man could have for a woman.

All this shit makes me feel fucking undatable, like I'm still a fucking virgin if that tells you anything.

Sorry for the tangent, but there's only so much one can take before you're ready to break.",09Oct2020,1
6,"Hi, I'm not sure why I'm even posting? Maybe call it a cry for help. 

I feel like I'm going nowhere, every time I wake up I immediately feel a sense of dread. Another day to tackle. 

I'm working a dead end job that I hate, take no fulfilment from - Graduated a year ago, took the piss the entire time. Was one of the most capable in my year but opted to go out as much as possible instead of do any work. Got a shit grade because of this and have literally no idea what I'm doing anymore. 

I want to retrain and do psychiatry - psychology is my passion but that feels impossible, a million miles away.

How do you motivate yourself when everything feels empty and worthless? I'm still young but feel like I've got no time. I feel like the decisions I made when younger have set me up for nothing but failure - constantly feel like I woke up last week and I'm dealing with the consequences of the fact I haven't done anything",09Oct2020,1
7,"So this happened today. It didn’t start today but it happened today. It started months and months ago on tinder when I swiped a girl I thought was kinda cute. We swapped Snapchats and then nothing. Until last week when I was feeling especially lonely, I messaged her just for the company. Since then we’ve been messaging everyday, the conversations seem to drag out over multiple days like a chess match played via carrier pigeon, each of my messages carefully thought out to try to be the best I can. 

I’m sure for her it comes naturally, but for me I make so much effort with each message. This morning I woke to the torrential rain outside. I checked my phone straight away to see if she’d come to her senses and cancelled yet, she had messaged but only to say we would have to push back out meet-up time as she had a problem with her house but she’d get it sorted. 

I tried to act cool, I went about my normal morning routine and was secretly smiling to myself about how the day might unfold. “You can get here for about half 10” she sent me. It got real then because until this point she had just been a name and a bitmoji on my screen, but at 10:37 she was across the street. 

She wasn’t the type of girl I usually go for, not that I can afford to be picky, but she was so different to me. But my god she was gorgeous! Long black hair flying around in the wind like it was trying it’s hardest to get away from the gleaming smile on her face. Jeans, trainers and a coat, so simple and yet on her it looked flawless. 

“Heyyy.” I was gone, luckily when she said it she was putting on her seatbelt so she didn’t see my stupid face extend like it was being stretched from the eyebrows up and the jaw down. Her accent was incredible. My stomach felt like it weighed as much as the car I was in. With my hand on the wheel to hide the shaking I replied “hey, you alright?” With the pseudo confidence rarely seen outside of the intoxicated. 

I went to drive but I stalled. How embarrassing, how much worse can I get? Oh yeah I stall again. What a great start? Way to make an impression. Third time lucky though I managed to creep the car out of her street while asking for directions out of her estate like I was an Uber and with the professional tone in my voice to match. 

Half an hour later though I was settled, I had asked all the questions I had thought of before I woke up that morning. Flickering between “so what surprised you most when you first moved to this country” and “what’s your favourite dinosaur” I was just as much a mess as I was 30 minutes ago. 

I drove her to a small town in the countryside where I had planned on telling her about my experiences there and showing her the river that flows through the centre, the medieval buildings and the history on offer. However, as we arrived I just drove past all that at the speed limit while talking about how I was failing my duty as the tour guide for the day. 

It’s amazing how differently things work out in real life vs inside your head while you lie in bed at 2am. The romantic meal on the side of a river turned into a very greasy fish and chips ate in the front of my car while staring into a shop window. 

What am I doing?! Here I have one of the most genuine, sweet, beautiful and charming girls I’ve met in my life and I’m smashing battered cod down my throat like it’s a competition. There’s no way she’s having a good time, she can’t be having fun, she probably only smiles and laughs at my jokes so that I’ll take her home after I’ve spent my time with her. 

Just as quickly as we arrived we left, it was half way over and I wasn’t ready for that. We listened to music on the way back with the occasional quick short conversation, usually ending in some sort of dad joke by me and her with a smile and a stare that just said “I can’t believe you said that” but in a good way. 

Back at her house, I made an excuse not to drop her off in the middle of the road but instead to park up, clinging to any hope that she might possibly invite me in. 

“So when are you free next?”

What?! First of all you *want* to see me again? Even after that shambles of a ‘date’ you want to endure me again? Then the realisation that she wasn’t going to invite me in. My mood went down, up and down again as fast as my breathing must’ve been the last time I was here earlier in the day. 

“Uhhh, I’m not sure, I’ll let you know later.” 

How generic. Truth was that no matter what I would’ve made sure I was free for whenever she was but I couldn’t say that to her. I’m not even sure if she liked me or she’s being nice until she shuts her front door and can block me from her phone. But, this time without stalling, I drove away feeling defeated, unwanted and like I just traded an amazing few hours for a whole week of sadness to follow. 

I couldn’t help myself though, before I made it home I messaged her. Telling her how much I enjoyed meeting her and that I had a great day. 

You should’ve seen the grin on my face when she replied, reciprocating what I had expressed with the same cheerful texts that we’d been sending before. I forget exactly how we got there but she asked what my first impression was of her and when I asked the same she said “you just need to get more comfortable, you don’t get much credit for” and that was it. She must’ve accidentally sent it or misspelled a word. I had to know so I asked “much credit for what?”

“I guess what I’m trying to say is that you’re really nice, you’ve got a great personality and great features.” I didn’t even know what that meant but I didn’t care. If someone had seen me they might’ve thought I was trying to taste my ears with the corners of my mouth. 

On the drive I mentioned a game that I was particularly good at, she hadn’t played it or even heard of it before but she downloaded it earlier and I played with her for an hour or so. She sucked, I know she’s new but she was absolutely trash at that game. Yet it was the most fun I’ve had in that game. 

Next time I see her I have to just be more confident. I really, really want this to become something more but I just don’t know if she feels that way. Like all the times before, I’m probably setting myself up for a months long misery. How do I know this won’t be different if I don’t even try? 

I just need someone to tell this to, thanks for reading.",09Oct2020,1
11,"Previous post I made explains the situation so read there if you're really interested. Far as I'm concerned it's at the very least some great schadenfreude so enjoy.

So, quick summary- covid sucks. Life sucks. Every day i could lose my job or get sick. Line ups everywhere. Everything is terrible. All that finally bubbled out when the stupid fucking elevators at my work just... ugh. Fuck. I lost my temper and punched the screen, breaking it. My fault. I know... I'm not trying to make excuses. Just explaining why someone might be willing to lose their job over an annoying, inconvenient and often broken elevator.

So... I woke up today to knocking on my door. It was the police! They were there to arrest me they said but because I have no previous run ins with the police they figured they'd just take my information at home. I'm being formally charged with a crime and they want me to pay for the panel. Turns out our city only has like two buildings that use that shitty fucking system and its gonna cost upwards of 5000$- closer to 10k from what I understand. I was also banned from the premises so while I'm not 100% sure if I've been fired from my company who operates within this building- I can surmise I won't be working there anymore. So... I lost my job, and the corporation wants me, a low wage earner who is now unemployed to pay them 10k$. Yup.

The cops to their credit were very understanding, and even friendly. They made it clear they thought this was a bit unfair even if they agree what I did was wrong. They're actually helping me out... the officer called me back later and said he could sign me up for some sort of mediation so I might not have this on my record and if I'm lucky not have to pay the full 10k. Maybe. But I can't go to court if I go this way.

I just feel so overwhelmed. Its two years since I tried to commit suicide, and I've worked so hard to fix my life. I was doing good. I was making decent money, and I was HAPPY. I hadn't thought about suicide once this whole year! Today... well, the suicidal ideation is back but my dad gave me a clonazipan so I'm feeling pretty calm now. But... its just so frustrating. I made a mistake and it ruined my life. The building who owns these elevators is taking in mountains of money... 5 to 10k is nothing to them. Its up to a half year wages for me though.

Haven't talked to my employer yet. Im hoping they go to bat for me- I am very well liked, and I do excellent work. My sous chef said I was a pillar of the operation and they couldn't do what we've done without me. I'm hoping instead of firing me they let me ""quit"" and keep them as a reference. Thats if I'm lucky. My dad said that they might be able to help continue to work there because the owners of my company own 4 major businesses in this high rise... but honestly? I don't feel super comfortable with that. 

Why am I like this? I don't know. I meditate. I used to medicate for depression. I do all the things... but its all just so frustrating. You work and work and work and you bust your ass... for what? A meagre pay cheque? A pat on the back? I've spent the past decade fighting the urge to kill myself. I want to do better. I want to not live paycheque to paycheque but when 70% of my mental fortitude goes to just keeping sane how the fuck am I supposed to go back to school while working full time?

Its like, life for me is like being surrounded by mosquitos. They're always there buzzing and drinking my blood. No ONE bite is intolerable... but dozens? Hundreds? Of course I'm going to stop sometime and scream out because I can't take it anymore. But those mosquitos are modern life! There's no escaping them! They'll always be there... biting and stinging me. I'm told to think happy thoughts. I'm told to take medications that take my passion and love for life away. I'm told to be numb. But what if I don't want to be numb? What if I can't ignore the mosquitos? What then? 

Moral of the story? Don't ever lash out. Keep it in, and cram it down deep down inside and don't let anybody know it's there. If you don't have the money for expensive mental health treatments all you get is medication and bland impersonal group therapy where they tell you to think about the trees. And the medication takes all your bad feelings away but they leave you feeling grey and placid. What worth is a grey world?

18,"To preface, I’m almost 25 and I recently got my MBA. My goal is to get into Human Resources/Compliance in a hospital system. I send out lots of job applications to both healthcare systems and businesses to try get my foot in the door somewhere. Considering we’re in a pandemic, the job hunt is hard.

Yesterday, I got a text from someone who said they were in HR in a company and they wanted to set up an interview through google hangouts. They ask me a lot of questions, and they have a position I want which pays twice as much as my current job, and they pay me for purchasing a computer, etc for a home office. I was so happy. They liked my answers and offered me a job.

When I got off work to finish the onboarding, they sent the check through email (weird I know) and my offer letter. Everything looked legitimate. They wanted to make sure I deposited the check right there and then to be able to purchase what I needed.

What got weird was when they wanted me to set up Zelle to send money to the vendor (rather than giving me the link to purchase the items like they made it seem like they would). They wanted me to send $500 right away and then the rest (another $2000...the check was for ~$2500) when it cleared in the morning. I asked how I could if the money hadn’t cleared. They said $500 should’ve cleared (it hadn’t).

So my parents and I did some digging. The company was legitimate. The guy who’s office sent me the offer letter was legitimate. We found a number to call, and I got through to the guy and I explained what was going on and wanted to confirm everything, and he said it was a scam and to not send them any money.

I was devastated. As I progressed through the onboarding, it was starting to be surreal. And not in a good way.

As a protection, I made a new checking account, moved my money over, and when the bank opened this morning, filed a fraud claim for the check. The account is now restricted to see if anyone tries to pull money out, and I’m insistent they send the money back and close the account.

The lady I was dealing with kept texting me, asking me where I was for the onboarding and then asked if I was defrauding the company. I responded by saying I called the company, they said I wasn’t employed and that they hadn’t sent any money and it wasn’t real, and then told her to not contact me. She asked for the money back and I told her I was working on it and to not message me again. She then asked if the bank gave me the money and I never responded.

As I typed this, I realize how bizarre this encounter was, and felt embarrassed and silly. But I didn’t send them any money, and as soon as it got too strange and then wanting more money, I backed out.

Let this be a lesson. Vet companies in detail and the people that work there. Talk to human, don’t rely on virtual correspondence. And don’t send people money if you don’t know them or if they send you a check that hasn’t cleared yet. I may have engaged with them too much, but I didn’t lose money. Just a little sanity for about 12 hours.",09Oct2020,1
19,"No matter who you're voting for. Do not choose your candidate based on what the rest of the world thinks. Choose based on what YOU think, no one else.

I had a traumatic experience in my program and was dismissed, I had to graduate with a different degree but even though I still got a bachelors, I don’t feel accomplished.

27,"I’ll never tell this to anyone I know in real life, because it’s disgustingly misandrist and I hate it about myself. I know it’s wrong, and if the genders were reversed everyone would get pissed. They should get pissed regardless. This is a terrible way to think and feel. 

I’d like to consider myself a feminist. Men and women should be equals in every way (apart from genitalia, which even then depends on gender/sexuality and varies). I’m *very* outspoken about good fathers’ rights to see their children, about boys being able to enjoy traditionally “feminine” things, and encouraging more men to speak up about their emotions. I have a boyfriend who isn’t traditionally “masculine” himself, and I love him with my whole heart. I know he loves me too, I see it in the way he looks at me in pictures and how he holds me tight when we’re together. 


It’s strange knowing that deep down I feel that all men are faking it. 


I have a nagging, scared voice in the back of my mind that tells me constantly that men, as a collective whole, are inherently sexist and they hate me for having a vagina. That all men are, deep down, born rapists and horrible, disgusting people. That I’ll end up raped and murdered by a man and I’ll be another number on the charts for someone to look at. That my boyfriend is simply faking it, because getting blowjobs and cuddles just feels nice and if a pillow could do it how a woman can, no straight man would ever be in a relationship with a woman again. That scared voice tells me I’m in danger simply for existing as a woman, because if I travel to certain parts of the world it’s likely that I’ll be killed violently for not wearing certain clothes or acting a certain way. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even watch men in TV shows, because it feels like they’re just faking all their emotions to hide a sociopathic nature. 


Another voice, my more logical voice, slaps the anxious one in the face and tells her to shut up, but she still frets and worries and fills my head with terrible thoughts. It’s getting harder to block bad thoughts out. 


I don’t know. Logically, I know that all people experience feelings, with most knowing love and affection and guilt and grief, which is why I’ll never tell another living soul this. I know feelings like these will pass through time and therapy and I’ll get over my fear/hatred of men. I *know* that men are people and a teeny portion of the grand total of men actually hate me for existing, and the vast majority don’t hate women at all. 

Worst part is, I don’t even know where these fears came from. All I know is I’m deeply scared of men. They appear in my mind like cold, calculating individuals who only use women for sex. 

I’m tired of feeling like this. Most of my friends are guys. They’re so all sweet and I *know* that they’re just as emotional as any woman can be, but damn, does my brain do a good job of telling me otherwise.

I held him at the shop for a minute or so, but I'm letting him acclimate to his new home before taking him out.

37,"When you first have children people talk about the challenges of parenting: The struggles of a baby waking in the night, the toddler who won’t stay in their bed, the cost of childcare, injuries from sports, etc. 

Maybe you have to take off work to pick them up from school when they don’t feel well. You’ll spend evenings helping with homework, your days cleaning a messy house, facing a mountain of the never-ending laundry, etc. 

But you also watch their eyes light up on Christmas morning and try to soak in the magic of those fleeting moments. Birthday parties, Halloween, picnics. 

You coach them in sports, rush off to dance classes, cooking classes, art classes — anything they’re interested in, you’re behind it 1000%

Life gets so busy you rarely even stop to think what the end of those days look like. 

You don’t think about the “last time” — the last time you were asked to take them to the playground, the last time they reached for your hand before crossing the street. You go into it thinking that 18-20 years sounds like a long time. 

Then, suddenly, hours turn into days, days into months — and months into years.

That little person who used to crawl up next to you in bed and cuddle up to watch cartoons suddenly is this young adult who (maybe!) hugs you in the hallway as they come and go.

The chaos and silly laughter that used to echo throughout your home gets filled with silence and solitude.

You’ve learned how to parent a child who needs you to care for and protect them but you have no clue how the whole “letting go” thing is supposed to work.

So you hold on as tight as you can, wondering how time passed *so quickly* and feeling guilty that you might have missed something.

Because even though you had 10,15 or more years — it just somehow doesn’t seem like it was enough.

You ask yourself so many questions: Did you teach them the right lessons? Did you read them enough books as a child?
Did you spend enough time playing with them? How many school parties did you have to miss? Do they really know how much you love them?

What could I have done better as a parent?

And when it’s time for them to go, it all hits you like a ton of bricks.
—
Parenting is by far the most amazing experience of your life. At times it can leave you exhilarated while at other times leave you heartbroken.

But one thing is certain: There’s  never enough time.💕

So for all the parents with young children, whose days are spent trying to figure out how to make it through the madness, exhausted day in and day out —

Soak. It. All. In.

Because one day, all those crazy days full of cartoons, snuggles, sleep overs, Christmas morning magic, ballgames, practices and hours in a playground...

...all come to an end.

And you’re left hoping that you did enough right, so that when they spread their wings ... they’ll fly.",09Oct2020,1

But when he’s mad at me, he reminds me that this is “his apartment,” and I could be homeless soon.

He playfully pinched my nose when I asked him not to, because I have TMJ, and it’s PAINFUL.

He told our couples counselor that he thinks about leaving me sometimes because I’m too messy, but his office space literally looks like an episode of hoarders. 

He one time placed his hands on my neck, and didn’t put pressure on it - but I know he wanted to. When I told him it freaked me out, he said “I’m sorry for being a butt.” 

I don’t clean the kitchen because he gets pissed when I “do it wrong.” 

I feel like a bitch for leaving a man that has provided so much for me, but I also don’t feel like his partner anymore. 

I have made the resolve to break up with him multiple times, but fear and doubt always holds me back. Not this time... I hope.

Tomorrow, I am going to leave him. I have nowhere to go, and I look forward to that. Of course, I’ll get my storage situation sorted. But after that, I think I’ll just roam about for a while.

I believe my mind has gotten a little softer and things that gave me extreme anxiety on a daily basis because I put so much of thought into it, now doesn't bother me as much. I have a clearer mind and I can look at things in a productive sense. Someone recommended meditating for my anxiety and it hadn't helped until now. It's honestly weird how early these effects started to show and shocking to me that I might have been addicted to this. On downsides of this experiment I do feel a bit of withdrawal.

43,"This was stupid of me to do . I know now . We had dated for about 8 months then but times started getting hard because I had to shift my priorities and focus on my academics and getting into college and scholarships . She started saying I wasn't giving her enough attention . The complaints went on for a while and then I said we can ""delegate"" so we can take the load off . So it was kind of an open relationship but we would decide the boundaries . 

So she started texting and calling her guy friend a lot . It took the load off of me and I could focus but it did come at a cost . Over time she wanted more and more from him . They would go out together on ""dates"" . They would post pictures on social media that made it seem like they were dating . Things started getting a little sexual between them as well . Little sexts here and there , exchanging shirtless pictures . They've even had a few ""sleepovers"" where I don't know what they did but at the time I thought ""I hope this keeps her busy for a while"" . 

Once the three of us hung out and I felt like the third wheel . He had his arm around her all the time and they looked like the couple . Then just before leaving he kisses her on the cheek right in front of me . Like wtf . I just ignored and said the same old ""this will keep her busy so she'll leave me alone for a while"" . After I was done with my tests I decided to focus on the relationship but it just seemed lost? Like we were together but only on paper . Even after that she still went out with him and got drunk . 

Then I told her enough was enough and that we should end things and that's when she started confessing to me . Turns out she's given him oral many times . She even once gave us both oral on the same day and mine was after his so looks like I've kissed her after that . Ugh . Anyway , I got it sorted out .

44,"Hello reddit,

I've always feared talking about something like this as i dislike being judged and never wanted to take my 'feel good about myself' mask off..

So i'm a male, 23 years old and i don't have a social life, spent my school days playing videogames and watching youtube and nowadays i cannot socialize whatsoever. That also started a sort of self-destruction sequence where i'll lie to everyone i meet to seem more interesting, i usually talk about other's lives because i lack one of my own and that built a terrible image of me in my workplace and also among the few people i used to call friends.

Nowadays i'm ignored, pushed around and left alone in my workplace mainly and today i want to change, i want to make myself pleasant to be around, have interesting topics to talk about that's not lies or other people's lives!

Obviously that has a huge toll on me, i've cried countless times at home thinking what i'm doing wrong and how to fix myself...

So today i ask, can you help me?

So I had a dream just about a week ago, the beginning isn’t really important (it was just some personal stuff) but the ending.. That’s where IT happened, the feeling of happiness again. I don’t feel this very often, but when I do it haunts me for days. Anyways back to the dream. I had this device, it was like a halo, made of silver but disconnected at the back. It allowed a person to travel in time or through dimensions or to bring a loved one back for a discussion. I wanted to keep this device to myself, I felt that others would abuse it. But one day as I was finishing talking to an old friend that died in a car crash she saw me. She hounded me for days to take her on a trip to the past. So I took her to the one place I wanted to go that I always wanted to see, the Beatles rooftop concert. Then it was like a montage, different time, universes, people all rushing by like fond memories. I finally felt freedom, like there were no cares in the world, I could go anywhere, do anything, and she was by my side the whole time. Then, I woke up.",09Oct2020,1

Why death should not be feared.

The universe is 13.8 billion years old

Humans originated 200,000-300,000 years ago. Let’s take an average of 250,000 years ago.

13,800,000,000\250,000=.000181

That’s .00018% of the universes existence. Let me ask you do you remember the first 13,550,000,000 years before you existed, Obviously not. Our conscious minds only came into play the day we were born, and everything slowed down because our mind slowed it down.

51,"There are many religions out there and is easy for someone to choose the wrong one. I just, cant understand how a person's soul is so easily to get lost in hell for having the wrong religion.

I have ocd and my mind is full of doubts. I can try and be a good person and honest but believing to Jesus and follow 100% of his teachings is difficult for me and since, there are many other religions I just, cant force myself to believe. not yet at least.

I used to believe in Jesus in the past. I was not a good follower but I was believing in Him. Now, I just, have doubts. So many religions. I guess, many people claim that their own religion is their right one. Many people are being taught a different religion and probably, try to follow the teachings of their religion. Do they deserve to go to hell?

I just, cant see the point of believing without seeing. I think, when it comes to faith, it is pretty logical that some people will believe and some others will not. I do not blame them.

If someone tells me that he has heard and read about Jesus but prefers to keep an other religion because he feels better and more secured, I find it logical. We have faith to Jesus because of the Christian Scriptures. But, aren't there other Scriptures, too?

Why do not know for 100% which religion is the True one. I cant blame anyone who prefers an other religion than Christianity.",09Oct2020,1

59,"The decision to quit sugar and join the gym changed my life. I was a huge, fat 73 kilos girl a year back and was full of underconfidence.

**The turning point:** I was really disgusted by the fact that my BMI was way above normal and people calling me all the names like ""Golu, chubby, motu"" and fat-shaming me. I had stopped looking into the mirror, my fondness for shopping or trying new clothes had reduced. I used to feel very underconfident about myself. Something in me spoke to my inner goddess and said"" Let me put a very sincere effort in being the best version of myself"" and I started reading about nutrition online and found the John Abraham's take on nutrition very fascinating.

**My breakfast**: Oats, eggs, sprouts or baked chicken/fish. I have no indulgence in any artificial source of protein, vitamins or any weight loss pills.

**My lunch:** Roti, Dal, Vegetables, Salad

**My dinner**: Roti, Dal, Vegetables, Salad

**I indulge in (What you eat on your cheat days):** Baked chicken, Khakhra, Idli

**My workout:** Weight Training accompanied by leading an active lifestyle.

**Low-calorie recipes I swear by** Oats (Roast oats and garnish it with a lot of vegetables and black pepper), Baked Chicken (marinate chicken and bake it with yoghurt and black pepper)

**Fitness secrets I unveiled**: 1) Start exercising, it makes it easier to follow the diet.

2) Follow a sustainable diet. Drink a lot of water. I used this app to track my water intake. 

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.happyverse.drinkwaterapp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.happyverse.drinkwaterapp)

3) Don't eat just because someone is asking you to. No compulsive eating or drinking

4) Use a calorie counter app

5) Don't skip meals, I tend to eat more if I skip meals and it messes up metabolism

6) Four exercises I swear by are Planks, pushups, squats, lunges.

**How do I stay motivated?** Life is about creating ""feel good factors"". Staying healthy is a big feel-good factor.

**How do you ensure you don’t lose focus?** I try to exercise 5 times a week, putting efforts in exercise makes me cherish every grain of the food I am putting in my mouth. I follow a sustainable diet. I had not got into crash dieting or fad dieting. I have customised a diet which I can follow for life happily without comprising on my work or other important stuff.

**What’s the most difficult part of being overweight?** One is always under-confident, low self-esteem. There is always a part in you telling you are an under-achiever because you don't feel good about yourself.

**What shape do you see yourself 10 years down the line?** Fitter than now with body fat percentage lesser than 20 per cent.

**What are the lifestyle changes you made?** Sugar is poison, it is striving because it has become a billion-dollar industry. It is more addictive than Cocaine. I quit sugar, maida and am only consuming natural sugar, eating healthy, home-made food every single day to achieve my goals.

**What was the lowest point for you?** Being overweight can be depressing at times.

Violet and I were infamous for our likeness with each other. Our friends constantly commented on how we were “clones”, and how “perfect and in-tune” when we were together. And it was true — we could finish each other’s sentences and anticipate each other’s wants and needs without trouble. 

Our drug habits weren’t a mystery to our social circle, but the only difference was that I was on the tail end of experimenting and she had just started. Cocaine. That was her drug of choice.

But, like many great things, it had to end eventually. I found myself *buying* her coke to appease her (I’ve only done it once and it’s not really my thing). I found myself putting up with her verbal and very rarely physical abuse because I loved her, and convinced myself that it was the coke withdrawals speaking and that I should probably buy her some more so she can calm down. I tried to be patient and understand, you see, because I get it. I understand addiction and fear and pain. But patience and understanding has its limits.

It was pretty bad by the end. Thankfully we had our own places and never got around to moving in together. The break up was rough. The getting back together and having make up sex and trying to work things out seemed like it could pull through, but it never did. The last time I saw her, she and I were having an argument in my car in front of her apartment, and she left while calling me a selfish asshole with a god complex.

I like telling myself that it was because I’m 30 and have wizened up a little bit, and that’s why I never followed her or even called her back. I knew it was done, then. I deleted her contact info and our text messages. I think I snapped out of it, honestly. I’m not really sure. She didn’t reach out either — no phone calls, not even a text. She just disappeared from my life instantly.

That was six months ago.

I woke up to a text sent at 11:43pm last night.

*“Hey. I know this is really random and it’s been a while. I was wondering if you had any coke or adderal on you and if you did, if I could buy it off you?”*

Yeah, not even a “how are you?” or “I’m sorry about what happened”. Just ... asking if I had drugs on me. 

I blocked her number and deleted the text. Fuck that.",09Oct2020,1
68,"I am 27 years old. I have never dated anyone. 

I started using apps last year to try and find a girlfriend but it never really worked out until a couple months ago. I started talking to a woman from Hinge.

She was the first person from these horrible apps I have hade a really conversation with. I was extremely nervous about meeting. My friend was trying to pump me up and calm me down all week.

Last night we met for the first time. We went for a walk in a park and chatted for 2 hours. I think it went well. She knew it was my first ever date. She said she was to shy to say it during the date but she liked my smile when I saw her for the first time.

69,"In my 18 years of life I never been able to get in a relashionship. Recently, I finally met a girl that was a great fit for me. We started texting to each other a lot and we then started dating. It was fantastic because for one of the first time in my life I felt connected to this point with someone else. I was finally able to be intimate with someone without being shy of my emotions. In my head it was almost a done deal that we were gonna be a couple and nothing bad.could happen cause I really had the feeling it was mutual. But then, a little bit after college started, I felt like she was more and more distant with me. My first thought was that it was a bad mood only that would came back to normal but days after days it was worse and worse. So I asked her what was happening and that's when she announce me that it was nothing against me but she didn't had the time to be in a relashionship and that she needed to take distance for a while. I was destroyed. I rarely felt so bad about myself and I was struggling dealing with this through the days. I been depressed and I was stuck with depressing thoughts all day long thinking about this. Recently, 3 weeks after she dumped me, she texted me again. It's feeling great but we ain't talking about our relashionship yet so I am stuck with the hapiness to talk with her again but also with the fact that maybe nothing will happen and that I will be back with all these negative thoughts and right now I really don't know what to do!

73,"I genuinely thought it was impossible. After 10 whole months ive gotten over her. We dated for 6 and I was so infatuated and in ""love"" with her it took almost twice as long to get over her. And man was it a tough 10 months. But im here to tell you that it is certainly not impossible. 

______________________________________
**How do I know Ive gotten over her?**

Ive kept her sweatshirt hanging in my room this whole time, knowing that eventually its meaning and importance to me will fade. Last night I looked at it and saw it as nothing more than a sweatshirt. 

Ive randomly delved into whatever social media I hadnt blocked to see what she is up to. I have her account blocked on everything but Facebook which she doesnt use. I know this isnt healthy but sometimes you do things you know you shouldnt. I looked at things she was tagged in and did not find her as attractive, to the point where if I didnt already know her I would have to think about even asking her out. 

Ive had dreams. The worst ones. The ones where you fall back in love, where you never broke up in the first place. Initially I would wake up and be sad all day and it would affect me for days.  Eventually I would get to a point where I would wake up and it would leave my mind like any other dream. 

I have no connection to her. Have not talked to her. And have not, even though I consider it from time to time, reinitiated contact. She broke up with me, and I have to respect that for myself. 
______________________________________
**What have I done to help get over her?**

I keep living. Seriously, there is no special cure. You have to continue living. You have to do you and do things you enjoy. Spend time with friends, spend time with family, spend time with yourself. Just go and do things that keep you busy and keep your attention away from the breakup, especially in the beginning. Just keep living and dont stop. Time is the only effective cure to heartbreak. Eventually you will feel it fading, but you care so little at this point that you dont even think about it. Other people will find their ways into your life. After 10 months ive casually dated two people, have had way more non-romantic relationships with females, and have been talking to a few others. All without dating apps. This is solely because of the confidence you build when you just live.

 Delete the dating apps. DELETE THE DATING APPS. You WILL NOT build confidence on an app. Build it by actually interacting with people in real life, in person. And DO NOT expect romance from everyone of an opposite gender. Ive gained alot of valuable female friends by removing the rose colored glasses and just treating everyone like an acquaintance and not a romantic interest. Eventually someone will come along that sees you living and wants to live with you. 

So, please enjoy your life. A relationships is not your life. But life is a relationship with yourself. Put effort into that relationship.",09Oct2020,1

76,"so i am an introvert, this i believe tells you mostly everything about my personality and how this quarantine, social distancing, lock-down and many more versions might be treating me.  


now your assumption might be correct for early 6 months about  my situation. i loved the isolation and mostly me time, now one more thing about me, i am very curious about cultures, languages, human behavior etc so the free time i got i basically traveled through the world by the stories, cultures, languages, everything connected to this world. I absorbed everything i read, heard, watched. Obviously it's a good experience learning about the world travelling through time.   


But problem started after 6 months, the BLM, the war between countries, HR violation, my culture being insulted in other countries due to BLM and other reasons, don't get me wrong am not against BLM but some elements have been wrongfully targeted by the protesters in multiple countries, and many more stuff have effected me. I don't know whether it is for isolation or something else but it has effected me seriously.  
I am continuously having anxiety and stuff.  


I am having some pretty dark thoughts but not strong enough to act upon it and i have tried many things to ease myself music, exercise, meditation, going out for a round alone, smoking, drinking, etc still nothing changed even try talking to friend but i wasn't able to dial a single number on my contacts.

77,"Hello, 17yo dude here. Sorry the post is long.

So I moved to the US with my family when I started highschool. I've always been an introvert so it was quite tough making friends in the US (I have like two now). I dedicated my everything towards studying, got all A's, took a ton of advanced classes, learned English in this time, became better academically. I am very grateful for all of this. In my home country I would've never had the opportunity to type this using a phone or get a job after university that pays more than $500/month. I can get into a top tier university, get a degree, get scholarships etc. but I feel like it might not be worth it.



I lost all of my friends. I skipped a year and we're poor in the US so I kind of turned into an adult when I'm supposed to be like a normal teenager without a clue about life. I never went out with friends, never skipped classes, never ate lunch with friends, no one waited for me after classes, never did anything I wasn't supposed to do, never fell in love. Yes I gave it all academically but I won't be able to go to Harvard or MIT so it's pointless. No one from my home country cares if I go to a #10 uni or #100, all they know is Harvard and MIT. Yes I know I will be able to make money once I graduate but tbh I don't need money. I would've been fine with making $500/month if I never left my home country. It might not be enough to buy a smartphone, but I wouldn't have needed one because all of my contacts would've been near me anyway. I might not have had a car after college, but I could've gotten a bike and rode it with my friend group. I could've found someone I loved instead of waiting pointlessly for an arranged marriage. I don't really need expensive stuff. My life hasn't really changed that much. I used to eat, sleep and study (with real friends and family) and I still eat, sleep and study (alone). I could've managed to tutor some kids and the pay would've been enough for my needs. Life wouldn't have been that fly or anything but it would've been real I guess.


I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I don't want to turn into a corporate monster. If I go back home after college I'll be an outsider most likely. I'll still be an outsider in the US. I don't even know if I'm making sense right now. How do I let go of these feelings? Please help.

79,"I don't even know if the title made any sense. So basically I am an introvert, a socially awkward and shy introvert to say the least. I spent all my high school years thinking I wouldn't need anyone in my life to make me feel happy and that I was doing pretty well on my own, and no one would actually talk to me either lol. But now I literally don't know how to talk to people, not even my family members. My grandpa is 90 years old and he feels lonely most of the time. So I wanna talk with him, but I don't know what to talk about or how to talk. I can't make friends at all and this whole online classes situation hasn't been good. No one really hits me up and those who do are just there for their own benefit. I do have a friend circle but I don't really connect with them, I guess? I want to be friends with someone who wants to have meaningful, deep and intellectual conversations, and maybe will help me develop some social skills too. 

I also feel exhausted talking to people. I made an online friend two months ago and we've been talking to each other everyday. She's an introvert like me so we don't have a lot of topics to talk about honestly.

 I solemnly believe I only made it this far because I made a habit of responding to “hey girl, how’s it going?” honestly. 

When I responded with “man i am not okay; I am hanging on by a thread” and the stranger said “yeah me too”, I made a new friend. 

And slowly but surely I collected a handful of sad friends. Friends whose souls were also suffering. Sad friends who knew how to comfort me when my spirits were low, because their spirits have also been that low. 

My sad friends and I all have a death affinity; we don’t really care to be.

But I carry on with their support; they are the most important factors for my well-being.  In other words, my sad friends with a death affinity are invaluable to my spirit. 

If the last sentence is true, I’m sure the reciprocal is true as well, that I am invaluable to their spirit. 

I don’t really care to be, but if I suddenly weren’t, my sad friends’ spirits would further diminish and they’d have to weather this life without me.

84,"Recently, I landed a job at a top tier company in my field of study, and my girlfriend landed a job in the same company, the same location too, in a different role. 

Both of us are really happy, obviously, but the jobs were supposed to be our backups, in case we couldn’t get admitted to our target BSchools. We’re still applying, but it feels like so much stress. It wouldn’t be worth it to drop the job for anything less than the best colleges, but at the same time, for our relationship, and for my ambitions, continuing our education abroad would be the best bet. 

Here’s why-
I’m dating a muslim girl, and I’m a hindu guy. We live in the most bigoted, partisan country in the world when it comes to religion. For all the rest of the world, well, it would be like she’s from an ultra conservative white family in some predominantly racist American state, and I’m a first generation immigrant with a family that wouldn’t want me marrying out of my race either. 
Another thing is that I hate my field of study, even if my grades speak otherwise. I’ve just been putting in effort cos I know I’ll need a good GPA to get a good college for postgraduate studies. So, if I start to work in my field and I start earning, it’ll be harder for me to pitch my case considering my experience in the field, nor will I have much financial support from my parents because I’m earning. My target colleges have high returns on investment, and I can afford loans on tuition but I’ll need support for living expenses.
It really seems like I cannot afford to do my Masters anytime but now.

&gt; Getting out of this shithole of a country would work help in a ton of ways-
&gt; There’d be way less pressure on her to marry, and we can drop the secrecy and be ourselves more.
&gt; I can easily switch my industry to what I want to do, and my CV right now is actually inclined towards my target sector so a job wouldn’t be hard to find.
&gt; We can wait as long as we want to get married. The more successful we get, the less say our parents will have.
&gt; It removes our extended families from the equation, so we just have to focus on our parents.
&gt; It helps us get our mind off of marriage and fucking enjoy our 20s. Society here is so so destructive in the way they casually pressurize couples in their 20s.
&gt; Both of us are top performers, her academically and me in extracurriculars, and our goals are, well, ambitious. International exposure would work well in our favour to help us get to where we are.

There’s so many more reasons to study further. 
It’s killing me, the worry. Her cousin got married last week and everyone was so happy. It was an arranged marriage, but the good kind, basically parents acted as middle men, no pressure on them, nothing forced. They’re both muslim, everyone’s happy. It’s killing us knowing we will never have that. 

My family is worse in one sense, most of my extended family support the religious fascist direction India’s heading right now, and they despise Islam with a passion. I’m an anti-theist, and I would totally convert simply for utility, but it would be taken as an insult if I converted for her, and as comfortable as my parents would be with me marrying a muslim, I doubt they would be happy with me forsaking hinduism. Everything’s so complicated.

Why can’t we just date like a normal couple, and meet each other’s parents and go on trips together. We’ve been dating for 4 years, since highschool, and it’s crazy when I think about her family recommending a total stranger for her to marry. In my case, my family’s extremely patriarchal, so my word would be final, so I don’t worry much in that case. Plus, I don’t really mind cutting them off since most of them are toxic. 

I’m just trailing off but this pressure just won’t go. I get panic attacks, worrying about my applications, deadlines are in two weeks. I’ll be the first in my entire family to go for postgraduate studied so I have no help. I have connections who give me advice, but I still can’t muster up the confidence. My head literally goes blank when I sit down to write my essays.

Both of us getting a super competitive job in the same office at the same place seems like a sign that we’re meant to be, but it makes me think about everything that go wrong on the way to us simply going after our happiness. 

It may seem like my future revolves around this woman, and I prioritize myself too little, but she’s already a HUGE part of my life, irreplaceable to be honest. I can’t envision my success without her, but that doesn’t imply I love myself any less. I’ve been steadily building my CV during lockdown, remotely volunteering at NGOs and working out too. 

It’s just the grand plan that fucks with my head. Short term goals are somewhat easier to sort out.

I am not asking if that dream is stupid or impossible or out of my reach. I know it will be hard and I'm probably too optimistic but I'll learn eventually.

I'm planning on doing the four years for the bachelors. If i can major in one subject and minor in two, I'm wondering if I could do something like minor in art and plumbing and get an associates degree for both my first two years. If i'm in college for four years then I can minor in maybe electrical work and get another associates degree my last two years of college.

I know it would probably be a lot of money but as of now I have a 4.5 gpa and high test scores so hopefully I stay on this path and I can get better scholarships.

90,"Same goes for those who do know someone's past and still blame them for things out of their control or for not having the same chances to succeed.

It's exhausting. Humanity is losing humanity. So many people belittle others because of their life, regardless of the facts, just for kicks.

Sure, if you had a lot of chances to change your life and you still prefer the ""comfort zone"", you need a wake-up call. But nobody deserves humiliation. 

Criticism is productive if paired with advice and support. 

If someone feels like a failure or even if they really are failures, don't put them down. That's not helpful at all.

Humiliation and sugarcoating are (sort of) opposites with similar effects. They do nothing in benefit to others.

Constructive criticism, support and love are what helps people rise up.

This may seem a vague rant but it actually happens to me. It surely happens to many other across the globe.

Just look at all the depression, frustration, low self esteem and other ""dark clouds"" humans carry.

95,"I've recently been watching some older Disney movies and I've been noticing that the evil characters are the ones I like the most. For example, Cruella De Vil in 101 Dalmatians, Ursula in The Little Mermaid, Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty, the evil Queen from Snow White, etc. My girlfriend has noticed this because usually when I am discussing a movie I mention how much I liked the bad guy.

I think the reason I like them so much is that they have so much passion. They are completely, totally committed to their ideals and they have the drive to go out there and seize what they desire, even in the face of incredible danger. I wish I was more like that. I've got depression and social anxiety that usually keeps me cooped up at home playing single player videogames by myself (even before the pandemic). I often feel like I can barely even commit to brushing my teeth every day, nevermind trying to seize absolute power and/or murder my enemies. Hell, going to the grocery store is a challenge that I put off until after I've had nothing to eat but a block of cheese for 2 days.

But these evil characters are the opposite. They know exactly what they want, they know exactly how they're going to get it, and then they execute their plan from beginning to end. I really admire that quality in them. Sure, their goals aren't always so admirable, but even then they don't always come from a truly evil place. The ""evil"" Queen in Snow White just wanted to be the ""fairest one of all."" So she's got a vanity problem. Big deal. So do most people I know. Or the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz - all she wanted were the obviously very expensive slippers that were literally stolen right off the feet of her dead sister by the foreign girl who killed her minutes earlier. I feel like if I was in her position I'd have been every bit as livid as she was, perhaps more.

In fact, the more movies I watch, the more I feel like the ""bad guy"" is usually just misunderstood, and I find myself feeling badly for them. Take, for example, Gaston from Beauty and the Beast. That guy is living the dream. He's strong, he's confident, he's charismatic, he's handsome, he's got friends by his side who look out for him and women who desire him. He is everything that I am not. He gets a major crush on a girl who doesn't like him back, but who hasn't? And when he gets word that there is literally a monster living in a secret castle in the woods outside his town, and that the girl he has a crush on is being held prisoner there, he does exactly what a hero would do - he rallies the town behind him and storms the castle to save the girl. Then he gets killed for his trouble, and even then only because he had no backup, because the townspeople are dumb as rocks and get their asses kicked by a bunch of magical furniture.

99,"A few years back I did a project for a self help guru based in Southern California. His name rhymes with Tony Throbbins. 

After the project was completed we never worked together again but the experience still makes me laugh. 

As soon as you enter Throbbins HQ, you are greeted by a cardboard cut out of Tony promoting his new Netflix documentary. As you continue through the office a strange sensation washes over you. The closest equivalent is falling asleep on a train and waking up in Jonestown. You look around the office and can’t help notice the pictures on the wall. They’re all Tony. 

He’s there watching over the stainless steel countertops in the employee cafeteria. He’s hyping up the crowd at Tonycon 07’ in the travertine clad men’s restroom on the 2nd floor, just past the water cooler, can’t miss it. Sometimes it’s Tony from behind, a profile of Tony, but it’s always him, looking back at you, judging you.

The part that actually made me uncomfortable was the busts. I started noticing that on a few lucky desks there where these little busts. I went to use the bathroom at one point and managed to find an empty desk that had one. Sure enough, it’s “A Tony”...get it? If you did a good job working for Tony, you got a Tony, a bust of your boss to put on your desk.

I imagined that each winner got two statues, one to watch you at work, one to bring home. The weight you felt when you held Tony wasn’t the alabaster or plaster but a camera and a microphone.",09Oct2020,1

A lot of it sounds like bullshit but can an average guy on the streets with street fight history beat up a guy like McGregor? We were also watching jones v Alexander 1 and they were saying how they’d just rush in and beat his ass.

He lives in New York, a resident of New York, he’s coming in a bus! He’s afraid to tell us he’s COVID-19 test results he took a few months ago, which is suspect and would be invalid now cause that was a few months ago, he doesn’t follow rules he’s been meeting up with all his friends and family, he goes out everyday, doesn’t wear a mask, so reckless! He’s coming to a hot spot from a hot spot. We don’t have the virus, we’ve been a bubble for months now, haven’t seen our friends and relatives for months, we’ve been playing it safe.

Then last night while celebrating my birthday early with friends, we witnessed a woman trying to escape out of a car. I chased the car and tried to help, but was hit by the car (I’m ok, just a deep bruise on my leg) and it drove off with her still in it trying to get out. After calling the police and giving them the limited information we had, I completely fell apart. 

Today, I am struggling with how ineffective I was and how this woman may still be in a dangerous situation. I keep going over the events wishing I had done more, seen more so I could have helped get her out or at least help the police find her. While I got to go home, snuggle with my boyfriend and puppy in front of a fire, she was still trying to escape from someone.

110,"Literally, like, I wish they didn’t exist. Being overwhelmed and then having one more stupid thing happen. All of a sudden it just comes crashing down and then you’re in your room crying.

Why am I having a mental breakdown right now? Well, of course, after tons of stress and bad stuff happening, I just couldn’t handle it anymore. But my school changing game plans last minute made me stressed.

Today, my family has plans to go somewhere, and we have everything reserved for tonight. We can’t just get a refund and today is the only time we can do it.

Turns out, last night we were told to email our band director if we weren’t able to go. I didn’t see until this morning. But, I told my section I wouldn’t be able to go and we didn’t even pack my instrument, because like so, I told them.

I didn’t have any time to email my band director until during last period. So I emailed him and he replied about 30 minutes later.

He told me I should’ve contacted him sooner and my parents needed to email him. I wasn’t told that our parents had to tell him. I was told that I was supposed to. And he asked why I emailed him so late, but like so, didn’t have any time today and didn’t see the text I was sent until this morning during school.

So now I’m in my room trying to get stuff ready while I cry. Even with tears and snot rolling down my face, I’m trying not to look upset since I’ll be leaving soon.

I feel ashamed that something so little just broke me. But that’s that. Just a mental breakdown doing mental breakdown things. I’m sorry if I’m using the wrong term or something like that. I can’t really focus right now.

I didn’t know where to post this rant, but i finally landed here.
I am amongst those affected by the COVID job crisis, and i lost my job because the company i worked for went into administration. I have been jobless since July, and have been really using my savings to get by. I live at home so it has been okay, but at the same time it’s not a lot of savings as it was all earned whilst working part time during Uni.
I used the Depop app two weeks ago to buy myself a pair of shoes, as i couldn’t afford a new pair. I’ll admit they are a luxury Adidas NMD’s, and i paid £30 for them. I wore them out twice and loved them. 
I went out today and couldn’t find my shoes in the shoe rack at home and questioned everyone in my house. At last my dad said he might have left the front door open the other day when going to work. The only conclusion i can come to is that someone stole the expensive shoes from my front porch. 
I feel as though i have no right to be upset as they are just shoes, but i can’t help but feel so down.
I have been really struggling with mental health being stuck at home and unemployed and this one thing that was making me happy has been taken away. I’m so sad that this has happened but at the same time feel like i should suck it up.

this is gon be a long one so sit back and enjoy or scroll to bottom for tl;dr lol


Ever since I was kid, i wanted to be a musician. I even have a drawing from a little journal when I was five that says ""when I get bigger, Ill be a rock star!"" 

I had gone to a smaller private school in rural Canada with my two older sisters. Life was good, we took trips every thanksgiving (which also happened to be the week of my birthday). But the economy was shooting itself into a bit of a reccesion, and my parents being reletivly young and with three kids got hit hard with it.

Its the funniest thing looking back at it, when I was 6 (and it was 2006) we were just below the ""official goverment line of poverty"", which is a fancy of saying the goverment was kind enough to send us a letter basically saying ""lol yooo broke bois whats up""

My parents werent the worst persay, they did what they could. Dad was cities away most days back then, and Mom was slowly losing her mind (like legit). The oldest was the first to have money spent on, passion wise, until they had a job of their own. Both my sisters took dance when they were younger, both eventually went into theatre based productions, none of them are doing anything remotly related to that now.

Me? I had a toy drum set that I loved. My oldest sister played piano and my middle sister was a vocalist. At one point we did all take piano lessons from a local family friend for a few years. Music was, for the most part, ""In the family""

Now as you can imagine, socioeconomic instability has a way of tearing families apart. My oldest sister eventually for hospitalized for attempted suicide before turning to a high school career full of drugs, drinking and sex. My middle sisters coping mechanism was to shut everyone out, just stay out partying with friends and rarely be home. We only talked about her drinking problems after we had all grown up. Me? I had a crazy insomnia, and growing with sensory issues in a house where someone is arguing with someone else every night? No sound sleep and nightmares plaqued me for 7 years. I sort of just closed myself off from my family, always putting up believable front.

Finally things were kind of getting better by 2013. My oldest sister was trying to make her way in small village in the next door province, and my middle sister was looking to travel overseas for college by the following year.

Then the stereotypical middle-aged couple divorced happened. The details arent Important, except that:
she mostly left my dad with the debt
she made it clear she was living on her own
she was going out to live young and party
yes she got a tattoo right affer
yes we all pretty much lost contact with her after a while. she is kind of shallow.

Right when both my older sisters had gotten jobs and knew what they wanted to do, right when it was about my turn to get some of that sweet parent dream funding money, it all sort of fell apart. I tried to make friend by overexaggerating my personality, and while that did work and I become somewhat popular, those friendships were mostly empty.

Id like to say I found God or Spirituality or whatever you want to call it, but thats not what this story is about right now.

I was homeschooled for pretty much my whole life, and I ended up dating a nice girl come 2016-2017, we'll call her Sarah. We did long distance for about a year until her parents disaproved and sent her off to college. Honestly isnt too much of a big deal, but i was just about ready to give Sarah a ring. And normally I aint one to let someones parents boss me around, but the things they said they hated about me was everything I was insecure about. I didnt have a job, I didnt have a Learners or License (still dont btw), i had lots of mental illness (also still do lol), and i think they didnt like how honest I was (listen they were literally crazy)

Safe to say I was hung up for a long time. Even now, about 3 years after the breakup I cant even comprehend dating again. Im also pretty emotional if you hadnt guessed.

Around the time Sarah broke up with me, I also found out I was 3 credits short from actually graduating. Due to learning disabilities I didnt want to risk cramming it during the summers end aT SS, so I did another full year. SAFE TO SAY... that also put my life back by one year. Most of the stuff I wanted to be when I grew up was blocked by academic goals i was not going to be able to reach. Being a timid introvert, and a hermit for 90% of my life, its not like I knew how to get a job, or even plan my life. And its not as if my dad could help, he was juggling being hung up over the divorce, balancing finances and figuring out how to file taxes.

Musically, I couldnt really sing, I couldnt hold a pick or play guitar (got some kinda condition where blood doesnt flow properly to my hands). But all I knew how to do was listen to music, and I could appreciate beat at least being  a drummer. that kind of became my life. according to Spotify, pre break up I was listening to maybe 80 hours of music a year. Post break up (basically anything past 2018), I was listening to over 800 hours! Thats over 1/10th of a year!

Over the next couple of years the amount of music was only rivaled by the amount of alcohal that had gone through my system. I had attempted Suicide about 6-7 times from 2017-2019. Though I will say music, and even occasionally just jamming on a Ukelele was almost all it took to get me through.

Call it divine inspiration if you will, but things got somewhat hopefully in the summer of 2019. that village my oldest sister was living in? i moved there for 6 weeks. small little place of 1600 people. and i was basically on my own, still, I came back earlier than expected...

That Woman who birthed me had emailed my dad in 2019 too. said we had to sell the house. said she was owed half the money. got a lawyer backing it up. we ended up getting basically nothing from that sale. The woman who used to be my mother took a chunk, the lawyers took a chunk, the bank took a chunk, and the real estate agents took the rest.

I moved back, I didnt want my dad to be alone, plus it was really fucking hot in that desert for a pale white boy! All we really could afford is a basement suite in a fourplex, and we're looking to move out by next month

2020 didnt really change much for me, it was more me that changed. I heard a song that inspired me on one thing, goals. I realized I never was taught to dream or have goals. I didnt know what I wanted... So i wrote out some goals for the next three months! January was a dry month, no alcohal. And I did it! Febuary I wanted to put a song on spotify, and I did it! It turned out my cousin was a producer, and somehow i had never known that....

Flash forward to 8 months later. Im 21 in 5 days. My relationship with my dad is good, and I actually feel like we can bond. I dont feel like having Aspergers, ADD, Aniexty or depression makes me any less able to pursue my goals. Im actually ready to start applying for jobs, I feel confident in myself! I used to be so insecure about sharing my life or my art (in any form) online... But my first ever album drops on all streaming services next week! Me and my cousin decided to keep making music, and my dad is actually super supportive of it!

Im kind of tearing up writing that last part, but i just really want to stress this point:
2020 was a shitty year, maybe your entire life has been shitty... but it is never too late to start improving, to start changing, to start moving forward and pursuing what YOURE DREAMS! DO NOT SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS!

thank you for reading this far, if you have :). i hope you were even a little encouraged!
