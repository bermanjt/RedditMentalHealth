1,"I don’t make friends easily and I’ve been trying to get out of my shell. So I go on whisper and message people and try to see if people wanna hang out. Most people are old or looking to get laid or both. I have a bf and I just want friends, so, of course, that doesn’t help.

Lately I’ve been talking to someone and they keep wanting to make plans but they keep falling through. Since I have my wisdom teeth surgery tomorrow, I was hoping to meet them today and it would’ve been so nice. Especially since I can’t work, so I tend to stay home and do the same thing every day. Super boring.
But they had to work, which is understandable.
I was okay with being disappointed in this, cuz I expected it. I still want something fun to do though.

My anxiety has been crazy and I’ve been so bored and restless. I just want one thing to go right right now. So much is going wrong, why can’t one thing go right?",15Oct2020,1
3,"I’ve always been one to keep to myself but not because of any anxiety but because a lot of the time I really can’t be bothered. I don’t have any problem striking up conversations and enjoy meaningful talks but i don’t have the energy for small talk and would rather just be about my business. I’ve noticed it about myself a lot lately and I’ve started to feel like it’s a bad thing, like I should be more talkative like everyone else.",15Oct2020,1
4,"So I'm going to try to make this comprehensive.

There's a girl, whom I've been close friends with for about 5 years now.
A couple of months ago since Corona time we started to hang out a lot more and I started catching feelings.
In this time she was with this guy who she was crazy about 
At one point I went to her house and she told me that she had feelings for me (sometimes) and I told her that I have feelings for her as well. We kind of had the agreement to hold off our 'potential relationship' until we (she) were ready.
Keep in mind that all the times that we were hanging out with friend we were really close, as in holding hands hugging constantly etc.
At one point we were drunk at a party at our place and she was extremely flirty that night. I spoke to her and told her that it wasn't fair what she was doing (the whole clinginess) while she is with that other guy. I told her I would take a step back and see her less often (she really didn't like that).
I failed. I was still clingy with her when I saw her with friends (albeit less than before). 

A few months passed, and she is acting as if nothing happened, talking about other guys she's dating etc.

I still see her once every 2 weeks or something, but keep being dormant for some reason. All the while still hurting about this until a certain extent.

Today I was at her house with some friends and she invited this guy over. (A friend of hers).

She was being a bit touchy feely with me but I stayed dormant.

There was another girl who seemed interested, but I basically ignored her.

After a while I saw her dancing with the friend she invited really infinitely and I still did nothing. 
Some more time passed and she slipped into a room with him.

I felt really shit at that moment.

So I was standing in the balcony with the girl who I mentioned before who seemed interested, but the spark was gone.

Now I feel really shit about myself and I don't know what to do.

I keep being dormant in these situations, not wanting other girls, but at this point not even wanting her. On the point of being depressed. I don't know what to do, I don't know how I can conquer this. 

All I want is my sanity and my (honour) back so to speak.

Please help me guys. I'm lost for words, how much of a first world problem this may be. I am thankful for what I have..t",15Oct2020,1
5,"The title says it all, I’m just not okay. For some reason the idea of opening up to strangers scares me shitless (it really shouldn’t but whatever) so instead I’ve come here to ask y’all something. What makes you happy you stuck around? Or what’s a happy memory or the highlight of your day? Idk y’all definitely don’t have to answer but reading some nice stories might lift my spirits a bit.",15Oct2020,1
6,"I’ve (24F) been working in my childcare program with my local county government for about two years now. I currently work with grades K-6 — it is a before/after school program that follows a curriculum of different themes of art, sports, STEAM, etc. 

I’ve always had this longing to go back school to get a school counseling/psychiatry degree in the graduate level. However, I didn’t do well in undergrad (my gpa was below a 3.0). I’m not really sure how to navigate my chances of getting into graduate school, and I just have extreme anxiety about it. I want to continue to work with children, but I just don’t see myself staying in this occupation and really want to help children of all ages. I feel really stuck, and I didn’t really establish any relationships with my undergrad professors since I didn’t think about grad school until after I had graduated in 2018. 

I apologize in advance if this post doesn’t make sense. If anyone has any questions, any advice to finally overtake this anxiety of grad school, please feel free to do so! I’d really appreciate it.",15Oct2020,1
7,"I wouldn't consider myself a stud but I wouldn't consider myself ugly either, yet I've had zero relationships thus far in my life (M20). Am I just that utterly repulsive, or is it something else? Y'all may say ""get yourself out there"" or ""be confident"", but I've done these things. Each time I've ever told someone I liked them I've been rejected, dating apps are useless for me apparently because no one swipes on me. I'm just venting, but dang it really hurts knowing that I may forever be alone.",15Oct2020,1

12,"I, too, wore baggy and unflattering clothing growing up.  I wanted to avoid being looked at.  Not only did I see myself as fat and undesirable, but I couldn't stomach the possibility of being sexualized.  The idea that someone would look at me and see me as anything other than the mess I was terrified me.  

When I woke up this morning, I saw a photo of Billie Eilish.  She's wearing shorts and a tank top (rightfully so, as it is over 95 degrees in SoCal at the moment).  Horrible people were shaming her for her arms or thighs, ogling her chest, and making unfunny and hurtful jokes.  

This morning, I also saw something else.  I saw a photo of a girl who looked...*just like me* when I was a teen.  I saw my arms that I was so self-conscious of.  I saw my thighs that I have stared at for years, wishing they would shrink.  I saw a chest that looks so similar to the one that burdened me everyday of my teenage life (and well into my adult years).  I saw me.  

As I close in on 30, I regret a lot of things from my youth.  Mostly, how I treated myself.  I was impatient, angry, and most of all unkind to myself.  So, if you read this, take a moment to be kind to yourself.  If you felt the way I did, now or ever, please know that I believe you to be beautiful.  We all are.  And it's time we started acting like it.",15Oct2020,1
13,"I lost my brother, the best person I have ever known, in April. There are no words to describe how broken I am because of it. I won’t even try to articulate it. 
The man I have loved for over 4 years doesn’t see a future together. This is the lowest I’ve ever felt in my life which is understandable but so hard because I used to be such a happy person with a love for life. 
Covid has made the world seem so dark and dismal.
I don’t know how to pick myself back up or how to move forward when the world around me is crumbling. 
I don’t even know what I like or want in life anymore. 
I don’t know who I am or how I feel except for depressed and confused.
Therapy and journaling are the only things that bring me a little peace even if it’s just for one hour of the day.
I just feel so incredibly lost and overwhelmed. The only answer I have for everything is “I don’t know.”

Needed to vent..thanks for reading if you did",15Oct2020,1
14,"[SERIOUS] I am an adult, today, infact an hour ago, I woke up screaming like madman. I have never screamed like that in my entire life even when awake. I can't recall any nightmare that may have caused it but again I have seen so many nightmares but I never did this. I have woken up crying some times but that is when I see any of my family members die in nightmare and I usually remember that stuff but this time I woke up screaming my lungs out.
One thing I would like to mention is that I had earphones plugged in both of my ears and the alarm was going in full volume when this happened.",15Oct2020,1
15,"I know I’m a teen going through puberty still but lately I can’t seem to get my emotions under control. I’ve thought about talking to someone like my bsf or my mom but they won’t listen to me. I want to ask my bsf on advice about my bf but she definitely won’t listen to that and actually answer realistically because she doesn’t like him (there was this huge argument we had over me and him) and I want to talk to my mom about going to like an emotional therapy of some sort so I can figure out my feelings but we don’t have much money right now so I feel selfish asking that of them. I feel like my bf is mad at me or something and that’s really messing with my emotions because I’m sitting in bed thinking “what if he doesn’t love me anymore” and “is it me? Did I make him upset in someway?” Every time I think about it my heart hurts and tears well up in my eyes. But it’s not even just about my bf, I’ve been feeling so much anxiety lately and I’ve been so stressed about everything. I haven’t been going to the gym because we’re “so busy” at the house and me having a body image problem doesn’t help me either. I can’t wear over half of the outfits in my closet anymore because it hurts me to suck in everyday. But sucking in became such a normal routine that my body can’t breathe right if I don’t suck in. I have body positivity problems, anxiety and stress, I’m emotionally unstable and I’m afraid to ask for help. I don’t know what to do. I feel helpless...",15Oct2020,1
19,"So basically today was very stressful because I have a feeling performed poorly on my test. I am always a hardworking student but I just don’t know what’s up lately, I don’t know if I’m losing my drive or what. But my previous classes I got A’s B’s right now I’m taking a math course, and the professor always had good ratings. So I can’t blame the professor I’m convinced maybe I’m losing my drive and I just need to rejuvenate my motivation to want to do good again. I never bombed a test and for some reason I am so stressed out about but I don’t know. Just really need some advice and I just recently applied to a college and that really doesn’t help on my end; I can definitely come back from this situation I’m pretty sure. My professor said she drops the lowest grade if you perform better on the final. So we will see I just think I need my motivation and drive back, I just think I’m in a low point in my life now that I think about it. I just seem to be lacking in a lot of criteria maybe because of covid and everything not being the same. But honestly this whole government needs to change something about the educational system; some people just cannot perform well being forced to take virtual classes. Just going to campus and have that consistent schedule was just so nice, maybe I’m just trying to justify as to why I’m performing so poorly, need advice.",15Oct2020,1
20,"But, you know what? Fuck that. I’m always spoiling my friends on holidays, what’s stopping me from spoiling myself just this once?

So, fuck it, it’s October and I’m disappointed with how Halloween looks like it’s gonna turn out so I’m gonna spend money on myself and (try my best to) not care about how much my family judges me for how much I’m gonna spend just on myself. Am I gonna feel selfish and self-centered and greedy? Fuck yes. But am I gonna just let myself wallow in my pity on the one day of the year I associate with good things? Fuck no.

I’m gonna buy myself merch and pride flags and wall flags and candy and everything related and unrelated to Halloween because I deserve to make myself happy if nothing else can. I’ve got nothing to save my money for, so why shouldn’t I put aside some of it for myself?

The only problem is that the candy’s probably going to be a bit harder to get because buying it online could mean it goes stale while it’s being shipped or it arrives broken or melted, and buying candy in general at a store with my family would probably earn me quite a lot of judgement that I’d rather not deal with, but I guess I’ll figure something out. Fuck it, why not? I’m allowed to spend my own money on myself. Who’s stopping me?",15Oct2020,1
23,Today I went back to the gym and worked out for the first time in years. It feels good to have committed to getting more fit and less fat. I’m tired of feeling out of shape and I’m tired of having my pants fit too tight.,15Oct2020,1
24,"To start, I don’t do this type of thing at alll I just need somewhere to vent safely We started a business last year and we where starting to grow and actually make money but covid hit and now I am tired, tired of not having the right cashflow, tired of not getting the appropriate support from banks during Covid-19, tired of having to deal with my personal bank because they f**ked up and wrote off a personal loan with out telling me (bank error) and is now causing me issues with business finance which effects our cashflow which then effects our personal life, tired of suppliers being untrustworthy, tired of the being in the same position I was in March but now worse off because of not bank or government support for my Industry (manufacturing alcohol ), tired of being told no we will grab your next product, tired of feeling like we finally caught a break to only be told this one minor thing has stopped it in its tracks, we do have one positive we are working through a contract with retail large chain and so far so good it would triple our capacity and help us with bank financing but it takes time.

*This next part is more of a vent than any thing
I get home and I get screamed at by a 2 toddlers until bed time because they are excited I am home we sometimes play but mostly it’s little fights all the way to bed time like clean you room or stop hurting your sister, no you cannot turn the stove on after you climbed onto it, we just had a 3rd and my wife mainly deals with the Bub and she is the easiest to deal with, we only have one car as we were bootstrapping the business as best as possible it was working but ...covid and now all I get is complaints about how they are stuck at home.

I am No contact with my family I have been for some time, as they are in the thrall of my Narcissistic Mother, they are of no help and at this point I never expect to see them again and I have been quite happy not seeing them, but the past two weeks I have been missing my dad, and the Fact that he has not seen my kids at all, they would love him.

I cannot wait for all of this to end and the business is running smoother and my wife has the things she needs the same with my kids. I know that most business have struggles but it’s hard, very hard, you cannot plan for covid coming in and f**king things up.",15Oct2020,1
25,"Should probably start this off by saying I’m a girl.

Someone asked for my number and was flirting with me. He wasn’t being subtle, was bragging about himself, offering to throw away my trash. It’s like he was checking all the boxes for ‘ideal male specimen’ and just doing everything he could to impress me. He invited me to sit next to him on a bench and we just talked for a while. But it felt so strange and unnatural, like he didn’t see me as a human, but as a girl he wanted to be with just for the sake of it. Like he’d throw me away the second he was bored with me. He’d acted so natural around his other friend but he acted so mechanical and scripted around me.

It just irks me because I’m not into him. I don’t like the way he acted because he wasn’t subtle at all, seemed to be putting pressure on me. Like, he asked me for my number within ten minutes of meeting me, asked to be friends with me within twenty seconds.

I don’t know if this is a dumb reason. If I’m put off by someone, if their behavior sets me off a bit, if I just don’t see myself liking them, is that a good enough reason to just... give up on them? 

Curious to know what you guys think.",15Oct2020,1

Many times, I am praying to different Gods but due to ocd, I am afraid that I may have made a mistake with my words-thoughts so, I repeat them again, even though I am sure that I did not make a mistake.

47,"tw: abuse

All my life, I've been seen as a burden by my family. I've never had any personal conversations with them at all. Hell- we didn't even speak the same language at one point in my life. My parents are severely mentally ill due to the war in their country, and they made my life a living hell since I was just a kid. My sister, who was being abused just as bad, took her anger out on me because no one would believe me if I mentioned her abuse.

Today, my sister apologized to me for traumatizing me all these years. As it turns out, there were things that were happening to her that I cannot say publicly. Regardless, I'm in my early 20s, and I told her I was alright. Or-- I was going to be alright. I did not think much about it. I'm not sure if she was hoping for a different response, or something teary... our family is never emotional.

I kind of already just forgotten what she had said to me. It wasn't until one of my friends linked me some random youtube video I used to listen to when I was a kid, and it's like all of my memories came back from the trauma I went through with my family. Usually, when I am triggered, I just want to cry and throw the biggest fit ever. But, today I just feel so funny. I feel sad, I feel sorry, I just feel lonely. 

If you were to ask me last year, I think I would say the worse shit ever about my family. But, now I just understand. While what they did never justified what they did to me, what they gave me, how they treat me now. I just feel so much emotions!? Y'know!?

It took me some time, but I realized that I'm starting to forgive my family. I feel so euphoric, like holy smokes. This is the first moment where I feel peace. That life isn't so bad. Yeah, I had one of the worse childhoods ever, but it's time for me to move on. I am so grateful for finally getting therapy, and while the world's future is so unknown, I feel so.. hopefully. and important. and that I will be okay?

My mother said I have become a disappointment because I am not married nor do I have children....I am only 24 years old. 

I actually can’t believe she said this to me. I’m kind of in complete shock. 

Personally I think marriage is completely pointless and I have actually wanted a family one day but it probably won’t be something that will happen until my mid 30’s because I actually want to pursue my goals and passions in life and well I also feel like a kid myself. 

I haven’t spoken to her in a week. She thinks I’m being unreasonable. 

It’s literally made me hate being a woman all of a sudden. Ive never felt so much pressure and judgment in my whole life. It’s given me this terrible anxiety I’ve never felt. I hate that women are seen as only baby making machines who should bake pies all day for their husbands or something. I am a human I have desires and dreams too. Just because I am a woman doesn’t mean I don’t want other things. 

I told her it’s not something that I want right now, I told her I’m way too young for it and that I don’t think I’ll ever get married but if I was to have kids it would be my own choice and in my 30’s when I’d be more ready. she said I’d be leaving it too late in my 30’s and that I have denied her grandchildren because she is getting too old. She thinks I’m being stupid for the choices I have made in life. 

I don’t know what to say to her now, I feel like I can’t even look at her. I’m shocked, completely shocked.",15Oct2020,1

52,"I am a 25 yo male, live in Belgium and work in a laboratory as a researcher. I consider myself to be slightly introvert and down-to-earth as a person. I have girlfriend and at the moment I live a happy life. 

2 weeks back, we welcomed a 28yo girl I call J for now. She is from Brasil, Rio and she is more extravert. 

As you may or may not know, Belgians in general are mostly grey, stiff people, which I dislike very much. Now, J and I started talking and we agreed to meet up and go for a walk and drink. Note that we have never ever met before and I was genuinly interested in her culture. 

Yesterday evening, we went for a walk, smoked some weed, drank some nice belgian beer, and we started talking about everything. Our differences in culture, the things we like or hate, which music we listen to, the way we dance and so on... But the more I listened to her, the more I felt connected to her as a HUMAN. So I told her this and she completely knew what I was saying.

Just imagine you go for a walk with someone you don't know anything about, has a different culture, skin color, taste in music and you just TALK and LISTEN to each other. I felt like this type of vibe of love and likeliness towards her, I can't really explain.

At the end of the evening we agreed to a very long and intense hug and my body was filled with love and happiness (and warmth, becuz it was insanely chilly outside). 

I have never had this feeling ever before with someone I have known for like 4 days and is basically an alien from the other side of the world. I encourage everyone to open their arms and TALK and LISTEN to everyone. The world needs more of this, especially in these troubling times.

55,"They say, ""What about men? What about their rights?"" First of all, women are clearly more oppressed than men. 

These men blame feminists for not fighting for the equality of both men and women, even though that's what feminism is about. Since women are more oppressed and need more help, the focus is more on them. Feminism also talks about men's rights, FYI. 

If you are one of those men who think feminists are sexist for ""not fighting for men"", instead of criticising someone for not speaking about a certain issue, why don't you speak up for it if you believe in it?

I've seen that most feminist posts are empowering women's rights without shitting on men's rights. However, men's rights activists are usually misogynistic who shit on women to empower men. If you want to speak about only one issue of only one gender, fine by me, as long as you don't shit on others who are respectfully and passionately speaking about their issue!",15Oct2020,1

59,"For some background, I have struggled with addiction since I was young, around 12. It first started with porn, then went to drugs, and over the years has involved shopping, various aspects of sex addiction, drug addiction, alcoholism etc.

I stopped all substances for around 8 years and recently gave medical marijuana a try which did not go well.

Throughout all this, I’ve been very successful in my career, and am one year left on acquiring my bachelors degree also. I have a wonderful family with 3 kids and we do very well financially and also with what we have achieved in relation to our goals etc.

However, my issues have caused many problems in my life and the lives of the people I love.

In essence, I’ve spent a lot of my life moving between high’s and lows, without much time spent in that calm stable I’m between area. My brain is always searching for the next high, and it doesn’t need to be substance related. I have a tendency to overdo anything that makes me feel really good, and tend to ride things until the wheels fall off, focusing solely on that and kind of disregarding everything else.

I find when I stay in that middle stable area, taking care of my responsibilities, keeping up with work responsibilities on the day to day, more of the “grind it out” mode, not really high high’s or really low lows’s, things just seem so bland and boring. I have a hard time being satisfied in that “middle” stable area.

My conscious mind wants that stability and knows I need it, but when I strip everything away ( addictions and unhealthy habits, keeping things balanced, going to bed on time, being responsible, not procrastinating ) and start to live the life I know I need to live, I start to feel somewhat lost, very unfulfilled and just generally have a lower feeling of well being and happiness.

I know this is the path I need to walk, but it’s scary and feels so unfamiliar. I can feel my brain calling out for satisfaction, and while I’m not actively craving much addiction wise ( kind of went past that point ), I feel like I’m just floating around in the water without a paddle.

The interesting thing is that I’m actually starting to accomplish the goals I really want.

Maybe it’s just brain changes going on for me, not sure. Wanted to see if anyone else has any familiar experiences or tips to help me along.

I want to feel fulfilled from the standard day to day things ( going to the park with my family etc ), which tend to feel so boring and unfulfilling for me.

I love my wife and kids so much and don’t know what I would do without them. I need to walk this path for myself and for them. 

Thank you!",15Oct2020,1
60,"	I've given up on everything.  I'm a junior in high school, and I can't do anything.  I'm failing all of my classes because I've fallen behind.  Online school is so difficult, and I can't seem to catch a break.  I try to get my parents to help me or just talk to me for a little bit, but all they do is tell me they wish I would be like my old self.  I used to read a lot and I used to do a lot of different activities, like academics and softball, they just don't like what kind of person I've become.  They don't like the things I've started showing interest in.  

Quarantines been tough for me as I'm sure it has been for everyone.  I've gained weight, lost the little bit of self-confidence that I had, and I feel like my parents hate me now more than ever.  My dad talks to me like I'm stupid and whenever I try to talk to him about it he says he's never done anything like that.  He always thinks he's right and whenever I have an opinion that is different from his he makes sure to let me know that I'm wrong because he's right.  

	My mom isn't any better.  I'm struggling a lot with loving myself and I know she does too.  My dad tells her she needs to lose weight all the time and I always feel so bad that I can't help her in any way.  She has depression and anxiety, and I don't want my future to look like hers.  I try to talk to her about me worrying about my weight, how I don't think I'm pretty, and I'm not good at anything.  All she has to say to that is it's because of my choices.  ""You're getting bigger than whenever I married your dad you need to slow down.""  I know I'm not even that big, but she makes me feel like I need to quit eating or no ones ever going to love me.  She ashamed that I'm bigger than she was whenever she was 20.

	Today I had a school-wide test that I take every year.  I usually get above benchmark on everything, but today I failed all of them.  I went and talked to my mom about it by telling her I've never scored this low before and that I'm disappointed in myself.  She followed up by saying it was because I've given up on myself.  My boyfriend is the cause of all my problems when he's the only one that cares whenever I'm upset.  She said that suddenly I just stopped doing everything.  Whenever I started dating him I suddenly quit everything, which isn't true I quit everything before we started dating because I lost interest and started doing other things I liked.  		

	The past month has been one of the worst I've had all year.  My mom made me get rid of my cat of 3 years because she didn't want him anymore.  It broke my heart and I cried so much.  We got guinea pigs because she 'felt bad' for making me get rid of him, but they are so much work.  I'm just so stressed out.

&amp;#x200B;

	I know this kind of jumped everywhere and I apologize for that I just needed to get everything off of my chest.  This isn't a post to get pity from other people.  I just can't tell anyone I know all of this.",15Oct2020,1
61,"I know that the likelihood that you will ever read this is pretty low. I know you use reddit but it’s a long shot to assume you’ll ever see this. If you do, I hope you’re ok with it all below. I’m sorry that I couldn’t say any of this to your face, but I just am so scared that you’ll react in a way that will mean our friendship will be tarnished. Even writing this directly to you would be so hard for me. I’d just feel empty when I saw for certain you could never feel the same way. You’re the best friend I’ve ever had and can’t put into words entirely how much you’ve meant to me. I feel like if I told you this, I’d lose everything I have with you. 

Truth is though... I’ve been in love with you for years. Not for any superficial reason, but just you as a whole person. The person you are when we’re having a good time together is the person I want to spend every day for the rest of my life with. I was always aware that it was unlikely you could ever feel the same way about me though. So I never said anything, never made a real move out of total fear. I know you love me in a way, and a way I appreciate, but I know it’s not the kind of love I feel so much for you.

I first realised I loved you when I saw you after months of not seeing when you went overseas to try some new experiences with work and travel. In those months you were gone I missed you every day. I’d think about you every day. Where you were, what you were doing. I cried at the airport when you left, I cried that night at home and I cried in the weeks after. I hated that you’d gone and may never come back home... as some months past. I asked if I could come stay with you where you were. When you said yes I booked it all immediately...  I flew to where you were staying and despite the never ending journey and 4 different flights over 30 hours, I finally made it there to see you again. The moment you hugged me at the airport is a memory I’ll never forget. A warmth I’ll never forget. A relief I’ll never forget. I didn’t ever want to leave that moment and everything I knew I felt about you came rushing into my head. I was there with you and I couldn’t believe how strongly the feelings I had in the past flood back after months of missing you. 

Travelling with you at that stage was incredible. The things we did and saw are unforgettable. I wanted that month to last forever. I can’t remember a bad day. It was just a month of bliss. 

After the best month of my life, the best news I heard was that you were coming home soon. You weren’t staying for years and years. I thought you may never come home... you were though, you were coming home in just a few weeks. I felt overjoyed. The message you sent me the morning I flew home I’ll never forget. It made me so happy to know you appreciated me. I knew also with you coming home that I could see you all the time again, and I was so happy about that. 

When you got home, it was the same feeling over again. You were with me. You crashed at my place for a few days and I loved that you came to me first. I loved being with you. I wanted nothing more than to just have you with me forever. I felt so special that the first person you came to see was me. I never wanted you to leave again. 

By the next year we’d moved in together. Your life got flipped on it’s head with your parents issues, but I was just happy I could be there for you. I was so broken for you and I could tell you were hurt. I’d never seen you so down and out, but I knew in those moments I loved you more than ever. 

Life changed pretty rapidly for both of us after that but so much good came from it too. We spent so much time together, we did so much together, I just felt like we were always getting closer. I loved you more and more as time went on. Those sunsets we would watch together, those holidays we’d go on, those countless nights of staying up til 4am just to hang out and talk... I loved those days and nights. I wanted to be so much closer than just a hug though. I wanted to tell you that you meant the whole world to me. I wanted to be close as I could to you and wanted you to know you meant everything to me. 

I felt like even though you could have any girl you wanted, you chose to hang out with me instead. Instead of going out and meeting people, girls or hanging with other friends it just seemed like you always wanted to be with me. We’d go to out and hang out for hours, we’d stay at home and watch the footy or basketball or just play video games in your room. Smoking and drinking just talking about random shit. We’d make dinner and do the same thing again the next day. I love when we hang out, because we can talk so openly. I love when it’s just us, because it feels so special. 

Some nights you’d fall asleep when we were watching a movie and I’d just look over and stare at you for a minute. I loved you so much. But I felt like if I said I loved you the way I did that you’d not feel the same way back. I just wanted to tell you I loved you and have you say it back, but I knew that was never going to happen. 

We talked about a future together. Buying a house, starting a business and I just couldn’t help but feel like we were going to be doing it all together in the future. My life had some meaning and purpose. It was ambitious and maybe a pipe dream but I felt so hopeful it would eventuate... 

Things seemed to change late last year though. We got back from a holiday that I tried to make perfect. I thought everything was going well, but then it just seemed to flip... it was the first time I got to spend Christmas Day with you, and I was so excited. You seemed so distant towards me that day though. I just wanted to spend it with my favourite person in the world and enjoy it together... You just seemed to be not happy at all I was there with you that day though. That hurt me so much. As the new year rolled in it seemed like you were less and less excited by anything we used to do. I would ask to do all those fun things and you’d just be happier by yourself. You just seemed happier doing nothing than being with me. How could that not hurt me... 

As March rolled around, I spoke to you about why we were drifting apart... you told me that we were always spending time together and you were growing tired of the same old shit. I was crushed and hurt. I know you were just mad at the time and that you later said sorry, but it just seemed like out of nowhere things just changed and weren’t ever going to back to how they were. I just felt even though you were mad at least it was the truth. I felt helpless to stop us drifting apart. I wanted to show you how much you meant to me and how much fun we could have but it seemed like you almost wanted us to fall away. You wanted to separate from me. I accepted and tried to give you space, fearing I’d lose you to someone else soon enough. 

You started going out to places you never seemed interested in going to before... Hanging out with people I didn’t really know and you seemed to be happy with them. It just seemed like I was boring... I could tell you were looking for something I couldn’t offer you and to find someone who you could do all the things we did, but when the day ended, you could be with someone you could put your arm around and hold. Someone you could kiss during those sunsets. Someone you could share a bed with and hold close. Someone you could wake up next to and smile. 

I knew it would be one day you would come home with a girl. All those years together and not one girl. It never made any sense to me. You were so amazing it made no sense. You were so beautiful it made no sense. The thought of you with anyone but me crushed me inside... and when you came home with that girl all those months ago. I was crushed. I was living a nightmare. My life’s been a mess since that night. When I saw you holding her, kissing her, looking into her eyes the way you were, I was shattered. I was so hurt. I was devastated. I hoped maybe she was a one off, a fling... but no. She’s over every weekend. She turns up at all hours of the night to be with you. We hang out and you leave to go be with her. You keep me so separate from her. Never talk about her to me. Don’t ever talk about her with me... What do you see in her? What makes her so special to you? Why couldn’t I be that person to make you happy... The more that times passed, the more she’s been a part of your life and the more I’ve sank to rock bottom. I feel dead inside. 

I hate when she comes around. I hate hearing you listening to all the songs we used to listen to with her. I hate that she gets to be in your room and we never hang out like that anymore. I hate that she’s going to replace me and go to all the places we love to go, all the special places we went together... it just kills me. I don’t understand why things had to change and every week I just hope she disappears from your life so we can go back to how things were. Every week I just hope you come home and tell me she’s not ever coming back. I want you to tell me you don’t love her. And I feel horrible feeling like that because I know you’re happy. I see you happy and I try my best but it’s just so hard. My heart feels so broken. 

I know you and I never had anything more than just a friendship in those years. But I felt like it was closer than that... And I felt like maybe deep down you felt like I did but just didn’t want to acknowledge it too. Maybe you were as scared as I was. Maybe the stigma made you feel shit too. Maybe we didn’t fit into a category. I hoped you felt like I did and just hid it like me. I hoped that maybe one day you’d be the one to realise you loved me too and we could have a whole lifetime together. I always felt like youve known this about me too. I held out ridiculous hope for us being together forever in the future. It felt like it was my only hope to be happy in life.  I felt like even though we didn’t have anything more than friendship, we still shared so many special moments. Maybe they meant something different to you. My life has a massive hole in it. I’ve lost so much hope and feel like my future is meaningless. 

It’s so devastating to have had a potential future planned out and now I have nothing. I’m lost in life. Nothing could make me happy. Every day I wake up and I hate life. I hate the weekends. I feel numb at work. Everything I enjoyed I feel no joy for now. I have no motivation. I miss you so much even though I still see you always. I miss the old days so much though. I miss being happier and having something to look forward to. And though we still hang out occasionally like we did years ago, I hate that she dominates so much of your time and life. I can’t compete with her for your attention and love. I hate that my life has become this hollow. I hate that I have nothing now. 

I wish you’d had seen me how I saw us. I wish you could know lost I am. 

I hope one day life improves. I hope one day I can accept you’re with her and not me. Sometimes I can be ok with it, but when I see you with her I still sink. I hope maybe one day things change and you see in me what I see in you. Sorry I had to write this. My life’s just become miserable. 

If you read this and you know it’s me. I’m sorry. I’m sorry that this my problem. I’m sorry I’ve not been great when she’s around. I’m sorry I’ve been a shit friend. Confront me... Even if all you say to me is just bye or we need to move apart. 

I want to be happy for you, but I can’t be while I feel this broken. I want to be friends still, and I know how good you’ve been to me, but I just wish you’d know how much I’m hurting. My hearts ripped in two, and I feel like it’ll never recover.",15Oct2020,1

Three days ago he went home for some business with my mom (yes, she and I live together) and ignored me even after I greeted him and tried to start a conversation.

prior to this: smoking weed every day doing any drug we can get our hands on basically nothing hard-core though

May 2020:One day back in May me and my friend decided we were going to sneak into a middle school courtyard. we found a golf cart tried to push it but it did not move so we left the courtyard and went home ate came back in when we came back we shut off some fireworks on the roof after the fireworks we dipped. then the next day we came back we push the golf cart again and it moved so our dumbasses thought it would be a good idea to push the golf cart of this little hill that leads into a door and ram it into the door at least 15 times caving in the doors so we can get inside we never went inside because it was just a boiler room we spray-painted all over the walls of the courtyard not the school and we spray-painted a Camera my dumb ass friend was wearing a school hat which is how they identified him they did not identify me so three weeks later my friends mom gets a call from the local police department and it’s a investigator speaking saying that they believed her son vandalized the school three weeks ago they immediately got a lawyer so we don’t say anything we are supposed my friend never got arrested Or taken in for questioning because they knew that he had a lawyer and also after we found out about ice-skating in trouble for the school all smoking stopped in fear of probation.

fast forward five months as nothing happens....

july 2020: no more THC in my system (self test)

august 2020: we get a call from the lawyer saying that the DA (district attorney) is now looking at our case. My friend meets with the district attorney to in person and the lawyer asked if we can just get charged with restitution or if we would also get charged with restitution and jail time and felony. The district attorney said would you be able to pay the rest tuition upfront and my friends family said “yes”and he said “we will look into that”

september 2020: DA calls and says that they are charging us only restitution and here is the list of items below with costs surprisingly we did not get charge for the golf cart because the golf cart was not that damaged

camera $300 
doors $2500
power washing $250
lawyer fees 5k

split between the two kids 4.3k

64,"I hope this fits here cause I'm too stupid to find the community rules.

This is probably going to be unreadable and stupid but here we go. I have no idea what the fuck to do with myself I feel like everything is going to shit and I just wanted to get what I'm feeling out somewhere even if I don't want to tell anyone in person. just as a warning there's gonna be a lot of tangents. I'm already scared to post this even though I created an alt for it. Also when I say im having panic attacks Im reffering to when for a short my hands/arms are shaking and I sometimes just jerk my body, followed by a lot of axiety and ""o fuck o fuck"". Idk if that is actually a panic attack but I dont know what else to call it so im sorry if it isnt.

I don't know where to start so ill just start with the frequent panic attack things I've been having. I used to only have a panic attack every couple of months or weeks, but now that I've started college I've started ADHD medications again. So I have pretty bad ADHD and I've been on like 20 different ADHD meds since 3rd grade. I stopped taking them in high school because they either wouldn't work or had uncool side effects. But I've started back on them this summer and have tried about 4 so far. some of them didn't work like Adderal or did work and were too expensive like daytrana (400$ a month with insurance ) or had not bad side effects (daytrana again, that was an adhesive patch that would leave like weird chemical burn rash bruise things? idk I might attach a picture of the not so bad ones.) anyways it was not fun but I stayed on it for around two weeks to take summer classes. after that, I switched to Vyvanse which is somewhat effective and only had side effects of reduced appetite, dry mouth, and apparently increased anxiety. (also something changed in my insurance so now instead of 44$ a month it's like 180$ or something (: ). But yeah I've had a large increase in overall anxiety which is apparently increasing the rate of panic attacks I've been having which makes it hard to sleep because I depend on distracting myself to get over them. (also to note my panic attacks have always been about the same thing, the nothingness of death and it's inescapability) For example, today for the past 12 hours I've been having waves of panic attacks with heightened anxiety in between them. So that's not fun

Another shitty thing is my relationship status. So a bit of background, this girl had been my best friend for around 2 years and a friend for around 6 years. during my junior year, she just cuts all contact with me and starts avoiding me. This lasts for about a year and was really fun for me and not damaged in any way. Senior year she makes contact with me during school and starts talking like nothing happened, Idk what's going on so I don't question anything yet. but after a week we talk about it and sorta move past it. But this happens again for about a week during February(actually on my 18th birthday). Honestly, I shouldn't have really trusted her after this (please I promise I'm not a simp) but we remain friends. During quarantine, we start video calling a fair bit, and eventually, she admits she has a crush on me and I tell her I have a crush on her. So we become ""more than friends but not dating"" because her parents don't want her dating and also she said at one point ""she probably doesn't like me as much as I like her"". Anyways it is sorta good for a while but then she starts talking about emotional and friend problems she's having almost every day and while I try to comfort her and offer advice it's too negative and while I feel bad saying it was too much to handle for me because every time we talked it was about bad things. So once I move to college we start communicating less but are still in contact. Then a week ago when I said something like ""hey I like you"" she says ""don't say things that aren't true"" and ghosts me again. So if she ever contacts me I'm gonna have to end the relationship and probably won't take to her again. Which sucks because while she has been an asshole, before that she was my best friend and the only friend I still talked to after graduating. BTW this was my first and only ""relationship"" I've had so I knew it probably wasn't going to be the best but bruh. (FYI this relationship lasted around 6 months)

I've also been getting not much sleep and the reduced appetite from the ADHD meds have made me lose around 20 pounds in less than a month. ( I was 130 lbs and 5'10 when I started) but I think I may have stabilized because I've been at 110 for a little while. Als,o I just feel like I could cry at any moment but I'm good at holding it back. And in addition to all this shit, I have family problems too. I'm a triplet and one of my sisters had severe depression, and the other has an eating disorder. And the one with an eating disorder also has a heart condition that apparently over 60% of those who have it don't make it past 35 so that's pretty distressing for me.

Idk man I just feel alone and I wanted to get it out there anonymously. I think I've been handling this surprisingly effectively by ignoring it and distracting myself with youtube videos so far, except today the videos aren't working for the panic stuff so I thought maybe ranting would help. But I feel similar.  Hopefully this was readable/understandable.

Tl;Dr Things suck, sorry for wasting your time. It's 1:00 AM I'm gonna try to go to bed and fail miserably. I'll probably post this later. I'm sorta embarrassed about writing this honestly.",15Oct2020,1
65,"I’m typing this post as means to get this out of my system. I can’t really talk to anyone about this. 

About two years ago a coworker and I began a harmoniously, quiet relationship. We’re both married and things weren’t great in that aspect for either one of us. Things just kind of happened as we bonded over mutual feelings. When things started, we agreed for certain boundaries. Doesn’t make it right, I know. Who fucking does these things? 

Can’t speak for her, but for me, being with my spouse for over 12 years now and growing up together seems to have set us on a path of growth in opposite directions. Do I love her? Absolutely, but there are things that we don’t do well. We don’t communicate effectively anymore and rarely have sex. I wouldn’t say I sought something, it just happened naturally. I felt, still do, that my coworker just understands me better now than my wife, at least viewing things objectively. She knows how to communicate in ways I wish my wife did. She’s helped me grow not just personally but professionally as well. Giving me sound advice and helping me see things differently than what my feeble mind is willing to allow. Helping me to fix issues before they become massive problems. 

Anyway, she recently decided to call things off since things are better for her at home. Which is great for her, family first. That was always a priority for us. But it was random and only done via message. I had some inkling feelings for a few weeks since she wasn’t opening up as much or responding to me. But this was a huge blow to me. I don’t even think I would take it this hard if my wife left me. I feel my coworker is the “person” for me now, with where I am in life and how I’ve grown. 

We’ve talked a little about it and her answers are kind of mum and short. It’s almost as if she’s not affected by this. We told each other we loved each other and that if we were ever single, we’d be dating. We dreamed about where our futures are and what it’d be like to be together without boundaries. We literally talked almost everyday for the past two years and now I’m just alone with my thoughts and feelings. No one to share this with. Not that I need advice, I just need catharsis.

67,"Hi everyone,

I'm 26 yrs, girl, australian, Idk why I came here, I was sitting here realising that again, I'd reached that point I reach every year or so, and I thought, maybe it'd be interesting to some people to hear about my life. Fuck knows, but I do hear sometimes that I should write a book about my life, but it seems so self centred. All things considered, my life has been colourful for my age, but it's my own doing so nothing to really claim has ""happened to me"" but moreover something I've learnt I do to myself ultimately, so the consequences are on me. One thing I forget though, is those consequences are sometimes unbearable! 

Childhood; I'll keep brief, the interesting parts of my life are more the actions I've made based on this childhood, so it's just a bit of background to the real thing.. haha.

Dysfunctional upbringing, by no means want sympathy, 3 older brothers, mum got a boyfriend when I was 6 (who was my eldest brothers friend from school) long story short I was fiercely afraid of her when from that age until 14 I was, and only me of the four children (still confusing) unthinkably abused sexually (by boyfriend - meth addict, his friends - meth addicts) and physically by mum. Brothers knew and saw but denied, still do to this day. My dad was my only family I loved. I and only I saw him every second weekend but he was never to know about my childhood. He lives in England now (moved when I was 22) Lived with Dad from 14 to 18 when I moved in with...

My boyfriend, born same day same year, met in high school, started doing drugs with me and my guy mates. And yeah every drug. I still continue.
Thus started 10 years of him and I together, me insanely dependant on him for happiness, whilst treating him horribly, got worse after dad had a heart attack, he was all I knew for 10 years, he the same, but last year after 4 drug overdoses &amp; 2 weeks in a coma, I pulled a knife on him in utter despair and I still can't explain why, when he said he was leaving me, landed me in jail for 6 months. Life seemingly over for me. No family, no soul mate. Got out 6 months ago, got really bad on heroin, back on meth, met a guy, NZ born smart as fuck but drug addicted like me (meth), finally felt happy, both actually got off drugs, life seemed alright, now he's just been sentenced to prison for 4 years for a charge dating 2 years back. 

Now I'm back here, sitting with some people I don't know, back on drugs, realising again that I've fucked up. But it's all lessons and honestly it doesn't phase me anymore. I just know I gotta sort all this out. Fuck knows why I'm here

71,"And I'm depressed almost every day. The only joys I have are watching my two daughters grow, although their constant screaming, crying, fighting, and diaper changes are causing me constant bouts of stress and migraines. I love waking up at my wife's side, but only on those days I fit on the bed because my eldest daughter likes to take up the other half and kick around all night, so I end up sleeping in the baby's room on the couch.

I have a pretty much dead-end job where I'm pretty much stuck. I'm a graphics designer and office manager in charge of printing, design, and customer service. I get paid a salary, but recently I've felt it's too little for everything on my plate.

I'm trans-female pre-everything, and there are no doctors in my local vicinity that assist in HRT (closest doctor is an 8 hour drive away). I can't afford the online HRT services, and can't drive anyway. None of the planned parenthoods in my area offer it either considering I live in a surprisingly conservative city (surprising because 90% of the population are immigrants and illegals).

I get home late at night, do my chores (washing dishes, bathe the girls, mop if needed, etc) then I just try and relax with two screaming children. 

On my offtime (which is usually limited to either my lunch period, or after everyone else has gone to bed) I enjoy drawing. Recently, though, I've been feeling uninspired. 

I'm just so incredibly tired of everything. I'm exhausted to the point of falling apart. I don't know how I'm holding myself together recently. Inside I can feel myself screaming in tears, but it just won't come out. I'm tired. I'm so tired.",15Oct2020,1

I think I remember him telling the wife how bad and awful the child was for their behavior as well. 

The reason this post is important to me is because I remember the comment section calling the father an awful person, child abuser, should have his kid taken away, etc. Maybe they were overreactions, maybe not, but that post is what eventually got me to realize I was being emotionally abused by my father.

88,"I,(18F), take 5 college courses and work at a fast food place, so my schedule is already *super* crammed, but one course in particular, English 1, has given me a lot  trouble.

I should mention this is my first semester in college, (community college), and my first job, (which I absolutely love), and I just reached Midterm for the semester.

This course has had more work than any other course combined, and I'm barely passing. My professor is really strict with her deadlines and grading, and I've had plenty of zeros or low grades because there physically isn't enough time in the day.

I've had to take zeros or low grades in other courses, I've had to stay up until 3- 5am, I've brought school work to my job. I've done so *much* to keep this course afloat.

I have no trouble with the finances, because I have financial aid, but I still have enough mone th saved up in case I have to pay a refund to withdraw.

I've talked to my mom, the professor, a tutor, a college advisor, and a financial aid advisor, and they all say they believe in me,and that's it's up to me. I love the support, but I need facts. I've made lists of pros and cons and researched what I know, but it's so hard to decide.

The problem is; If I stay, I'll continue to struggle, and have either an unsightly grade on my transcript, or fail the course. However if I leave, all this work will be for nothing, I'll have to take it again next semester, and I'll prove everyone right: that I couldn't do it.

The pros if I stay: I'll complete the course. I won't have to worry how my financial aid will be affected. I won't have a W on my transcript.

The pros if I leave: I only have one other course I can take at this college next semester, so I'll have a much lighter schedule. I will have more time for my current courses. I will be much less stressed. I will choose a different professor, (my current one is known to be way too difficult). My grades will all be better.

Tldr: My english class is incredibly difficult and my schedule is completely cramped. Should I withdraw from this course, and take it in the spring, (when my schedule will be much lighter), but loose a Midterm's worth of work, OR, push through the stress and complete the course?

Any input or advice would be much appreciated. I will try to respond as soon as possible. Thanks in advance!",15Oct2020,1

I’ve tried online dating but it’s hard in to find compatible guys that are genuine and won’t stereotype me as a black woman.

Dusk and dawn, tears run down my cheek with the agony of emptiness I feel. Nothing seems to make me happy. For 2 minutes I feel good then I relapse into this cycle of despair, anxiety and loneliness.

91,"Surely I'm not alone, it's such a common thing. My ex broke up with me like 2 days ago, we dated for like a month and when things were good, they were good. But when they were bad, they got real bad. She got a thrill out of arguments so that's often what she would resort to. To make matters worse is we work together, and the day after we broke up, we worked together and she whispered in my ear ""I still want to fuck you, just don't tell my (made up boyfriend)"" - mind you she had blocked me everywhere. I just smiled and said okay. She had done this before where she makes up a guy to make me jealous, this time it didn't quite work. What bothers me is the fact I'm stuck working with her when she keeps switching between ""I want to fuck you"", and ""get the fuck away from me"" which is really conflicting because I know she's crazy enough to try and get me in trouble now. I've been super depressed because I actually did have a lot of feelings for her, but I just feel so used and abandoned. She used me to help her with homework and to fulfill her sexual desires, and once I couldn't tolerate her verbal abuse anymore, I would blow up and just reiterate every insult she threw at me, right back at her. I was always the bad guy to insult her back, (guess since I'm a guy, I'm supposed to just tank the abuse?)... well anyway I have to see her at work tomorrow, and Saturday, I'm still blocked, and to my understanding she is probably moving on and I should do the same. I absolutely hate how she told me ""I still want to fuck you"" and lied about a new guy, because she doesn't do hookups, and she doesn't cheat, so obviously I'm the guy she wants, but I think she wants to punish me for insulting her back. Even if she does try to get back with me I shouldn't do it, but its eating me alive. I think I might have loved this girl, even through the abuse, because I can't get her off my mind. I just want to sleep because the thoughts of suicide are so enticing without her around, I feel like all of the gaslighting she did is getting to my head. She told me I'd be nothing and I'd be stuck working at our job for the rest of my life, (just cause she's going off to college) called me an ugly piece of shit constantly, (even though she would lick on my abs and call me hot af, she has ran up and forcefully made out with me on several occasions while we were dating [at work!]), the gaslighting she did was insane. I felt so strongly for her... I write this as I'm talking to a tinder match about hooking up casually... and honestly I'm not even interested, at this point I just want to validate myself through a rebound. I'm kind of fearing my ex wants to get back together and she finds out about this hook up... she will kill me AND her. She was the type to make me block girls (BEFORE WE EVEN WERE DATING!) But she had 100s of random dudes added on snap she would post like ""Hmu I'm bored"" when I was working, just begging for attention from other guys... but she would get upset that I even WORKED with another girl. She would urge me not to look in their direction, not to talk to them, etc. She would always tell me ""don't give out your number or snapchat to other girls, that's basically cheating. Don't hang out with other girls while we're dating, that's cheating. (I followed her rules for the record). On a few occasions she seen me on my phone at work, and she got visually upset. When I asked her what's going on, she replied ""I'm going out with [some random guy] tonight"" (after work...) and I made the connection that she had an immense amount of school work and it would be too late for that after work, so I called her out and she pretended like it never happened basically. I caught her making shit up several times just to upset me, she even admitted that her (and her family both) have a history of being unhappy, so she likes to make other people unhappy. All of this has just made me super depressed, I really did have strong feelings for this girl (might have loved her, if not I was close to it..) but she is absolutely bat shit crazy and I can't keep doing this with her. She said ""My mom is making me quit this job"" after telling me she wanted to fuck me, but I suspect it was a lie because she had used that before to get a rise out of me. She enjoyed telling me she would just quit and find a new job because she wanted me to baby her and tell her ""oh no baby Ill miss you so much, I love seeing you at work!"". When she told me she was going to have to quit because her mom, I just smiled and said okay, (not giving her the reaction she wanted) and she was not happy about it. I'm still on the block list (even tho she said ""I wanna fuck you, when do you want to fuck? I'll make an appointment"") I'm sure she is just trying to make life hell for me at this point, so I guess moving on is my best course of action even if I did feel so strongly towards her. Ugh life sucks, I hate dealing with heartbreak, especially when things were so intense. Thanks for coming to my rant.

102,"I went to emergency early in the morning about my hemodialysis stent.  They didn't even look at it, but they were going to have me wait 2 to 14 hours without any food or water in order to perform surgery to change the stent.  At some point I asked them to let me go home and phone me when the surgery could be performed, but they said ""It doesn't work that way,"" I have to lie on a hallway stretcher for perhaps 14 hours with no food or water.  

I had previous experience as inpatient of being told at 6 p.m. that they had been too busy to squeeze me in so they'd do it next morning.  That day as inpatient I hadn't had any food or water all day and it was already after dinner. All the ward had to give me was a small container of apple juice and plenty of water.  I asked to be permitted to go buy myself some food but they said it was against the rules.  I discharged myself and went the inpatient route.

Given that previous experience as inpatient, I wasn't going to risk a repeat of it in the emergency room, so I discharged myself.  The staff coerced me into signing a form saying that I was leaving against medical advice.  That gives hospital staff carte blance to murder me and get away with it.  Tomorrow around noon I have hemodialysis, and if I happen to die everyone will blame me because of that form I signed this morning, while whoever killed me will totally get away with it.

I'm not going to be paranoid and discontinue hemodialysis just in case there's some murderous psycho in the hospital who decides that I'm a likely victim.  Without regular dialysis I die anyway, so I'd gain nothing by discontinuing it.  But if I'm dead by this time tomorrow you'll know why.

Not saying I'm a prize, but I could have *a* relationship if I just wanted one.  I wish there was another option to dealing with existential loneliness, I see friends and family on a weekly (sometimes daily) basis and have hobbies, but I still feel inadequate like something is always missing even though I feel like I should be content with having everything I need.",15Oct2020,1

Today you lost a good friend. Someone who honestly did his best to be there and help you even it it meant taking time off work, despite being behind. It wasn't that he wasn't busy, he just simply gave you his time. He helped you with things you needed to buy even though he barely had enough to pay bills at the end of the month. He did small things in hopes to make her day just a little better because it made him happy to see her that way. He wanted to show her that there are people out there that truly care.... but then it started to get exhausting for him to keep up....not giving him time nor day for a chat when he needed it. Just twice he tried... He thought she would be the good friend that he imagined, but he was mistaken. She would make excuses day after day until she conveniently felt like being there. This whole time he was blinded and never realized that their ""friendship""was run only on her time...He hopes you'll be considerate the next time you find someone that's good to you. He'll still be your friend because he cares, just not that ""good"" friend.",15Oct2020,1

Inside I keep the temperature at 72-76 Fahrenheit. Humidity in the winter gets really low but I'm OK buying a localized humidifier. (I have an apartment.)

If any plant lovers have recommendations I'd be grateful to hear them. Cheers!",15Oct2020,1
