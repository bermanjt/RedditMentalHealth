1,"I'm educated and well-traveled, so I know painfully well how much the USA sucks compared to other developed countries. No guaranteed parental leave, no universal healthcare, no free college, no guaranteed vacation time, no high speed rail, no metric system, baby boys have the most sensitive parts of their penis sliced off at birth so they can never experience sexual pleasure, counterintuitive date format, endless wars, destabilizing the world, obesity, racist Cheeto in the White House, ignorance, routine mass shootings. All of these things infuriate me about my own country, yet I'm powerless to change anything besides the meager right to vote. I don't need to reminded all the time of how much everything sucks because I'm living it. But that's exactly what happens nearly every time I browse Reddit. 

On clever comebacks and murdered by words, half the posts are dumb fat ignorant Americans getting destroyed by intelligent Europeans. On world news, there are top posts every day about how awful America is. Even on subs that have little to do with any international affairs, there are Redditors lurking, ready to pounce at a moment's notice to correct the stupid fat Americans. On vexillology, anti-American sentiment is rampant. From cool guides to sports subs to history pages to meme pages, non-Americans are itching to put the Yanks back in their place. The hivemind has determined that we are not allowed to win any argument on any subject. The worst thing a person could possibly be is American.

I've been on Reddit for ten years this year (across many accounts that I periodically delete and remake) and it seems to be getting worse. It reminds me of the reason I stopped going to 4chan. I used to post almost exclusively on the sports board, it was once a lot of fun to follow game threads for hilarious memes and commentary in real-time. But I left over the incessant anti-American posts about how terrible our sports are and how much we're missing out on ""the only sport the world cares about."" Reddit is starting to resemble the 4chan I left. 

Everyone desires to be happy. I am no different. I have eeked out my own tenuous bubble of satisfaction in life with my job and wife I love. Sometimes I need to take media breaks to preserve my mental well-being; there's just too much bad news on the planet in the midst of a man-made mass extinction. It's looking increasingly like I need to finally quit Reddit for good because I can't browse for more than a few minutes before I'm reminded of how much life actually sucks, and how much better my life would be if I lived in literally any other country. I shouldn't have eeked out my own bubble of happiness because there is no happiness to be had. You are not allowed to be happy when you're a dumb fat American with no healthcare, student loan debt, and a mutilated penis that's incapable of either providing or receiving sexual pleasure.",04Feb2020,1

Hello, I moved here in November from Baltimore to progress my budding career in culinary arts. I've been cooking for 7 years and have been fortunate enough to have taken multiple international stages (culinary term for internship) at some highly respected restaurants. After working for one of the greatest chefs and people I know for 3+ years I eventually became his sous chef at a true farm to table restaurant and learned SO much from him and my other coworkers and former managers. I moved to Chicago to be part of a more serious food scene. After landing a job at a restaurant I had a lot of respect for, I was disgusted by how they treated employees and the way those in management looked down on everyone yet would not help when shit hit the fan. I shortly after left and was looking into other restaurant jobs. This wouldnt be a problem except that since moving somewhere new, where I am not already familiar with everything, I am finally realizing how much the restaurant industry forces you to miss out on in life. Being that I was recently engaged and my future wife and I plan on having a family I have become turned off by the life of chefs, having even turned down a job offer from a michelin star restaurant that I absolutely adore. I'm having trouble getting my foot in the door in other industry's that are more 9-5. I've been applying to sort of random places like a startup insurance company, or software sales agency but they dont seem to work out. I'd somehow like to stay involved with food as it is something I am truly passionate about but I want to have a more normal life and a career with better pay and hours that still does something for the community and those in it...I'm feeling a little lost sorry if this was rambling. I also have all this knowledge from cooking and teaching myself and learning from others for 7 years that I'd like to be able to put to use!

TLDR Moved to Chicago to keep chef-ing, changed my mind and need help finding some sort of career with better work life balance",04Feb2020,1

10,"I feel like my life is just chasing something that doesn‚Äôt really exist and will never actually fill this hole that has stuck around for as long as I can remember. I feel like i‚Äôve been robbed of my life from being raised by two completely emotionally unavailable parents and now here am i‚Äôm. Drenched in anxiety, fear, hollowness, sadness, and self loathing. 

My life whether I like it or not, always revolves around ‚Äúfixing‚Äù my problems, and it leads me to abuse drugs, grapple with addictions, become so absurdly invested in abusive, toxic relationships that obviously could never work out. But it hardly matters, I romanticize all the blatantly terrible things just to keep myself from confronting just how truly miserable I am.

I have such great friends who will hear out my issues to no end. Have talked to numerous therapists for extended periods of time. Try to focus and fix problems that I can identify in myself to no end. And where am I left? 

It‚Äôs like walking around with a deeply rooted pain and emptiness that you can try to shove drugs or relationships or habits into to fix, and you just destroy everything even further. How can I really know if a partner is good for me if without them i‚Äôm miserable. I‚Äôm so addicted to love, or anything else that will actually make me feel joy and passion and excitement and see beauty in the world where otherwise I feel despair.

Okay so what I mean is ethically/nationalist etc. 

I‚Äôve always liked history in school, idk why but I just like hearing about what happened etc. so this has always been a big deal to me

My grandparents moved out of Spain to Mexico where my parents were born. My parents then came to the US where we(I) was born. 

So I‚Äôm like.. ‚Äúwtf am I..?‚Äù My grandparents are all  majority Spaniards with little bits of English/French German and Scandinavian etc so, we‚Äôre Spanish right? Ehhh not really.. once they moved to Mexico they cut off all ties to Spain. We don‚Äôt even do Spanish culture shit. 

Okay so then we‚Äôre Mexican right? Nope. We have zero connection to Mexican culture other than from time to time eating a tortilla lmao 

So then we‚Äôre (I‚Äôm) American..? Yes I was born here but like America is a mixture of other ethnicities so, people here can trace their ancestors to whichever country they originated from 

Idfk why I make such a big deal out of this. A few years back my brother and I got that ancestry testing kit thing 23andMe and we took the test and it came up saying we were like 90% Spanish and we told mom and she was like ‚Äúno shit, your grandparents moved to Mexico from Spain‚Äù I was like facepalming so much bc we had asked before and they said they didn‚Äôt know Imfao 

No but yep, I‚Äôm jealous af of those people who can go like ‚Äúoh hey I‚Äôm German, my grandparents moved here when the bubonic plague was going on‚Äù (lmfao shhh it‚Äôs just an example) or like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm German and I live in Germany‚Äù  or even ‚Äúsup I‚Äôm Irish and in my culture we make (insert random tradition)‚Äù See what I‚Äôm saying?

17,"So, recycling...everyone has heard about it since they were quite young that it is important to recycle, but I have found an interesting phenomenon of late...it is almost impossible to find places that recycle stuff.

I live in a rural town that receives trash services from our neighboring town, but since we are a neighboring town (8 miles away), we have to pay more for trash pick up...AND we do not have curbside recycling as the main town does. Obviously, that would take too much effort. When I was younger, we would see a variety of types of trash bins in shopping areas, airports, and even parks and schools. Now that I am older, and it seems as if that effort should have progressed, it appears to have regressed. It is now hard to find a place that will actually take the stuff that should be recycled.¬†

I taught my kids from the time they could walk about recycling. They weren't even talking in full sentences yet...well, not really doing much more than babbling, to be honest, but they knew where to put the recycling vs. the trash that was not recyclable. We, as a family, do our utmost to ensure that everything we can recycle gets recycled, but it has become increasingly frustrating to find that glass is not accepted, or that only hard plastics can be taken. Why then are there so many little numbered triangles on the bottom of our products???

I used to live in Japan and I was amazed by the efficiency and demand for recycling that exists there. Not only do you have to separate the typical stuff like paper and plastic, but even glass was separated by color and somebody from the neighborhood would stand out by the recycling area to help you put your stuff in the right place! Anything not placed in the right place would amazingly find its way back to your door so that you might have a second chance at it the next week. I also know that many places in Europe are making amazing strides toward recycling and cleaning up the planet...I cannot say the same for the US.

Some people ask why in the world it is so important since recycling also requires energy, but interestingly, the energy required to reuse a material is around 95% less than what it is to make it from raw materials. With a really good effort, there is very little that needs to go unrecycled, especially if composting is involved, and it takes very little effort.¬†

If each person does their part to push for recycling and actively use it, not only should our planet start feeling better, but our pocketbooks should as well!

27,"Hey y'all, first post and it's kind of a rant/vent, so bear with me here.

First things first, I'm a freshman in university, I met this girl who's in the same program as I am during orientation week. We got super close, and a couple months in, we started dating.

Keep in mind that this was my first relationship. I had caught feelings for a lot of other people before, but, as clich√© as it sounds, I felt like this one was different. For the first time, I had someone who felt the same way about me, and it was amazing. I grew up in a very sheltered environment, so i had never actually had much legitimate physical contact (a hug was the maximum). So when we started holding hands, kissing, and cuddling, it felt like the greatest thing ever. However, the most important part of this all was that we made a promise to each other: no matter what happens to us, we STAY FRIENDS.

A month in, after we come back from break, she starts acting weird around me. Like she doesn't want to hang out anymore, isn't as enthusiastic to be with me. I kind of shrug it off, but a week later, I finally ask her about it, and she dumps me. We ended on good terms, though; we cuddled one last time just to get rid of the sadness. I just took one day to be mad at her and get all of the anger out of my system, and then it was back to normal.

In reality, we just kind of downgraded to friends with benefits; we'd hang out, hook up sometimes, and there was still a lot of love with whatever we had; we'd text each other random memes and talk just as if we were still dating, and kind of leaned on each other for emotional support.

Then, out of nowhere, like a switch, she leaves me on read no matter what I send to her. I keep trying to start a conversation, and to no avail.

This goes on for several months, and I decide to confront her about it after winter break. In response to me asking if we're still friends, she simply says ""We are; you're just forcing conversation, and that makes it a lot more awkward."" At that point, I decided to accept it and stop spamming her with messages (although I'm not sure if one text every two days constitutes spamming someone). 

Thankfully, we still had a friend group that still hung out a lot together, but every time we would get together, she'd do her best to avoid me. She still treats me differently than her other friends, mostly by  ignoring me, and she's done this to date.

The worst part about this was how sudden it was. I don't know if it was anything that I did, and I'm trying my best to keep our friendship alive. After all, we promised to each other that we'd be friends, and it's not like she completely forgot about that after we broke up. I kept putting in effort into whatever it was that we had, but she never did.

I'm trying to diversify in terms of the other aspects of my life: I started doing research in a lab, signed up to volunteer with middle schoolers in the local area, started making new friends and going out more often (which is an achievement given my introverted self), and tried to start catching feelings for other people who might be interested in me, but no matter what, I can't seem to get her out of my head.

To make matters worse, the program that we're in funds our study abroad for our first summer, and we'll both be in England with 5 other freshmen living together for 8 weeks, and I 1) can't stop thinking if we might get back together then, and 2) really want us to be on good terms at that time, given the fact that we'll be living together for like two months.

34,"Hi guys.
A little background on me. 
I have had anxiety since I was about 7.
Dealing with major panic attacks since I was 7 as well. But I was never depressed..
I'm in my 30s...
I just moved from a southern state to a northern state. I lived in the south for about 8 years.
I moved to my fiance s home state.
I got a brand new job..I moved in with my fiance..i left everything I loved behind. 
I moved into a home he had shared with his ex.
To say their relationship ended badly is an understatement.

I think between moving in with him, the new job, the new state, the changes in weather,  I just feel overwhelmed.

I cry alot. I feel lonely. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing. I want to sleep all the time. I'm not my normal bubbly self. I feel completely in my head. Basically I feel blue. I'm never fully happy. Like I get up to go thru the motions.

Me and my now husband fight at least three times a month. We have no intmacy.

37,"I genuinely can‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs a whim decision and I don‚Äôt have my passport yet. I‚Äôll be getting it expedited, and hopefully it goes well. The biggest part is that it‚Äôs not settled in yet? I have a pessimist view in life but.. the ticket has been purchased. No going back, is there?

I grew up in poverty. 6 kid family on 24k a year. I‚Äôve always wanted to go to Japan. I was definitely a nerd growing up (grew out of my weeb phase however!) and was always interested in anime. I wanted to go in high school but everyone who I was planning on going with dropped out so I settled for NYC. That was in 2016. But my interest in visiting the country remained. I watch a YouTube couple‚Äôs videos and watched them go from Korea to Japan and I still had that yearning to go.

And now in a month, just one month, I‚Äôll be going. 22 years old and I‚Äôll be in Japan. I‚Äôm going because my boyfriend‚Äôs going and he got the tickets. I would never have been able to do it on my own. I never would‚Äôve been brave enough or hopeful enough. Growing up poor meant good things just don‚Äôt happen to me. But here it is. 

It hasn‚Äôt hit me yet but when it does, I‚Äôll probably cry. I don‚Äôt know how to repay him, I‚Äôm at a loss for words. I‚Äôm so.. excited. Genuinely and carefully. I‚Äôm not going for anime, I‚Äôm going for the culture and adventure and! It‚Äôs been a lifelong dream that I‚Äôm finally getting to do. Traveling this far has always seemed impossible.

I worry I might come across as ungrateful but I have no idea how to express my genuine happiness about this. Or gratitude. What could I possibly do in return of one of my dreams coming true? I don‚Äôt really have a solid plan on what I‚Äôll do there yet. I know I‚Äôll visit Coco curry and eat my weight in ramen. It‚Äôs like a shaky hope. If my passport goes smoothly, I‚Äôll definitely cry because then it‚Äôs guaranteed. I just never thought I‚Äôd be able to do this. I‚Äôm so.. happy.",04Feb2020,1

40,"Minstrel shows are you might know where performances of yesteryear where white men dressed up in black face and pretended to be slaves.  They instated slave culture based stereotypes.  Minstrel shows were very popular forms of comedy for a long time.

Drag shows are essentially the same thing if you think about it.  Men dressing as women and acting like women based on stereotypes for the purpose of comedy.

This seems weird to me because LGBT and feminist under any other circumstances would be up in arms over the portral of women as slowish chractatures.  Also drag undermines the legitimacy of trans people by blurring the line between gay men in dresses and trans people being their own thing.

I don't know why drag is so popular nowadays, it really shouldn't be imo.  Honestly any defense of drag could be made for the minstrel shows of yore and nobody in their right mind would defend those.

Even as I write this I looked up the history of drag and it turns out drag is in fact an off shoot of minstrel shows.  I'm not surprised haha.",04Feb2020,1

My dad has been overwhelming me a lot, asking me when will I graduate and it started the moment I started college as a freshman. It pissed me off.

Well, right when everything was finalized I enlisted and instead of being called by my new first name I was being called by my new last name. I spent a little under a year in total in training which meant absolutely zero going off base/seeing civilians.

 I've spent the last 6 years building a family. Moving across the country, leaving everything I knew to be with someone I thought loved me unconditionally. Raising a son, buying a house, working tirelessly every day to provide for everyone. Forgiving my wife for cheating on me with two different people. Going to therapy, working through my own problems constructively to be a better husband. But it wasn't enough. She broke up with me 3 days ago, saying she couldn't be in a physical relationship with me and that she still loves me and wanted to be friends and work on this house together. She took the kid and left today because I hadnt stop crying. She didn't come to see if I was alright during that time. The few friends I have left didn't care enough to stay on the phone for more than 5 minutes before ignoring me. Everything in my life has fallen apart. Everyone is mad at me for being upset. For crying too loudly, for being hysterical. They've made it known it was my fault everything fell apart. Our roomate, the man she cheated on me with, the man I've brought into my home and called brother for the past 5 years, the man who my past ex cheated on me with, the man I've spent years forgiving for this action just to have it happen again, sat there and denied everything while getting angry at me for confronting him about it. Angry at me for not wanting him in the house. Denied the truth she had already confessed months ago.

If you love someone but you bring out the worst in them, let them go and let them be happy.

73,"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm 21 and still an awkward mess like this around people I like, but here we are. Basically there‚Äôs this girl in my extended group of friends who I‚Äôve been kind of crushing on for a little. She always seemed really intimidating and hard to talk to, and I never saw her much so for a long time we didn‚Äôt take notice of each other really, but in the last few months we‚Äôve been out quite a lot together, and the more I learn about her from a few deep conversations and just goofing around and stuff the more I realised she was a really fucking good person, and just had a bit of a front up for various reasons.

The more we‚Äôve seen each other the more I feel like we‚Äôve gravitated towards each other, we‚Äôve messaged quite a bit outside of going out, she‚Äôs put up a lot of Instagram and snapchat stories involving the us, etc. I made the stupid move of telling my close friends I kind of like her, but apart from that I thought I was playing it pretty cool. Recently though in the big group chat we‚Äôre all in (that she is also in) there‚Äôs been some teasing about me liking her, even from her own friends too. I was confused as shit about how it was so obvious to people, but when I brought it up to my friends they just laughed and were like ‚Äòdude, everyone knows you have a thing for her‚Äô.

A couple of nights ago, before the teasing began and I knew how much of an open secret me liking her is, I was out with the guys and she was messaging me asking where I am and what I was up to that night, but cause the guy who‚Äôs house we were in wanted a ‚Äòguy‚Äôs night‚Äô I couldn‚Äôt get her to come over. She said she understood if it‚Äôs a guy‚Äôs night and she didn‚Äôt want to intrude (I really wanted her to come though and said as much to my friends lmfao), but we both agreed that we hadn‚Äôt seen each other in too long though and that we‚Äôd arrange to get all our friends out this weekend, which we‚Äôre now doing on Friday.

Since then though the teasing about me liking her has ramped up a good bit, my friends have kind of half jokingly said that I was ‚Äòdesperate for her to come over‚Äô, that kind of thing. Since that‚Äôs kind of started she‚Äôs left me on read, not really replied at all to any of the jokes people make about it, etc. I‚Äôm scared that she‚Äôs just realised I like her and feels awkward about the whole thing. She‚Äôs told me before that she doesn‚Äôt want anything serious in her life right now, which I was cool with: I was just happy kind of being chilled about the whole thing and just enjoying seeing her every now and then.

Now though, she obviously knows I like her, all our friends do too, and I am not good at handling shit like that. I don‚Äôt have a clue how best to take it all without making her feel awkward and weird about hanging out.

Getting a biology degree also sucked, I worked nights at a nursing home and took way too many science credits at the same time (18) - which is my fault, but I went from a psych student to a bio student half way through college (me = dumb).

I Felt I was in prisonwhile working this job. I know it was safe job, I had OK Salary. But I'm only 21 and I thrive for adventure and for new things in life

After I quitted, I worked with friend in construction, but that was for short time only. I had no other plan besides that. That was my biggest mistake. But in my country it's extremely hard to find job. Unemployement rate is above 16%. After all work in construction was done I had no job.                            
I couldn't find job in my area for 2 months.After that time I finally found job as warehouse worker (forklift operator).I Worked 20 days and when I Was supposed to get salary, on salary day my boss didn't pay me, he just told me I will get this salary paid with the next one. Even if I wanted to wait that long I couldn't. I didn't have enough money for gas to drive to my job and back   
It is possible for him to not give me salary, because I lived in corrupted country, where you can only hope to get salary. (btw salary is 500‚Ç¨ for 20 days of work)

From the anger and frustration, I asked friend who moved to Luxembourg 2 months ago to find me job. Turns out he lost his job in luxembourg too and he couldn't find job himself.

But I didn't have any options, I had no money, no job, I was screwed.  This seemed like good risk to take.

Especially because I rarely took risks this big in my life before.

I sold my crappy 700‚Ç¨ car and moved to Luxembourg. First day when I arrived here, I got call for job interview because I was already sending job applications before I arrived here.  
But guess what? I was late for the job interview.                     
Friend was with me to help me out get there, but he never used train before in Luxembourg, when we got to railway station, it was so big that we got lost, we couldn't find our train and we missed the train. Next one was scheduled to arrive in 1 hour.  
I was devastated. I can't believe this can happen to me. So it's been 20 days since I moved, I've sent over 200 job applications and 90% of them don't get reply,10% of them answer negatively. I'm starting to lose hope. I spent most of my money for rent and food. Rent is paid until 15 march, and I don't know if I can find job till then. If I don't find job, I couldn't even return to my country, but here I can't stay if I don't pay rent. 

For me this seems like hopeless situation. Days go by very fast and nothing is happening. Only good thing so far is that my friend got the job as a waiter (he has experience as a waiter and I don't, we both applied, but he got the job).

Do you have any advice for me?

81,"i feel like i can just go somewhere where nobody knows me and ever will without hesitating. i want to do that right now. its too much too handle for me. why is it hurting? that word is really dramatic. but my heart feels like its shaking, not beating. i feel overwhelmed by who the hell knows what. im just nothing and i only need myself to help myself. i cant, i just cant. i hate feelings so much. its a stupid thing. i want to go back to where nothing meant anything and i didnt have to think about it. it wont happen so whats the point. and i dont know what i want. i keep going and letting myself keep going even though i already know it is nothing in the end. i just wish i was a bird. they can just hide in a tree or some big cloud. they can fly wherever they want. they can see things from high up and afar. they dont need to think cause they get to fly",04Feb2020,1
82,"So the idea of jerking off into a sock was really popular when I was growing up. Geometrically, the idea made sense, but I guess I'd never considered what I would do with the sock afterward. I was probably about 14, in my bedroom doing my thing, and I decided to try the sock method out. It made the initial clean up a revelation since there was really nothing to be done. But then I had this sock. I couldn't put it in the laundry because my mom did my laundry and she would find it and know that I was a young man doing young man things. Same went for the garbage, because I guess at the time I imagined my mom to be some kind of suspicious raccoon that combed through all the detritus in the house.Our house backed onto a forest so I decided the sock best belonged there. I walked to the edge of the yard and hurled it into the woods. But you see, it was winter and all of the trees were bare. The sock wrapped itself around the branch of a particularly tall birch. I'm talking like 30 feet up. It stayed up there, bright white, and waved like a shameful flag for months until summer storms came and blew it off. My mom totally noticed, too. She kept asking everyone in the house, who knows what's going on with that sock? My strategy was deny, deny, deny.",04Feb2020,1
83,"So I‚Äôm not really sure where to start I‚Äôve never really done something like this, I hope this is the right place to put it. I‚Äôm going to start from the beginning my life I was born 20 years ago in the heart of the south. Throughout my childhood I always enjoyed the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù of having comfortable life. I never had to worry about food on the table and always had the things I wanted within reason. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I worked for the things I wanted, doing odd jobs for family members and saving my money from birthdays and such. I was always able to do the things I wanted to do without finical repercussions, my parents supported my hobbies to what was I guess was finically safe. Since I can remember I have always been interested in the outdoors and working with my hands. I am now beginning to think at 20 years old that my parents never really invested fully in me. I have always been interested how things work. I was always taking things apart because I was interested in how they worked. I started with nerf guns then moved on to working on boats then eventually cars. The problem in my head is that it was always just me doing the things I was interested in. My parents worked a lot which I understand is the reason I never had to worry about money, but I have no memories of simply playing catch with my dad much less working on things with him. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they pushed me to explore my interests, but never really took the extra step. It might by my fault I never asked either of them to join me in my hobbies. I feel like they never invested in us. For example I have always really been into fishing and in high school got really into bass fishing. I breathed and dreamed it, I was always watching YouTube videos about bass fishing looking up techniques, and of course fishing when I got the opportunity. In my head, when my parents saw that I was so into this hobby, they should have pushed me further into and included themselves in it. My dad never showed interest in it, or helped push myself to the next level. The reason I say this is because I was on my high school fishing team. The other parents who could afford too had bass boats they helped their sons become better fisherman, and took them to fish tournaments. I never got to fish a single tournament because well my dad didn‚Äôt involve himself like the others. I‚Äôm not sure if he could have gotten off of work to take me to tournaments, but I feel as though he could have been more involved. I eventually got the bass boat, it was just my senior year, I enjoyed fishing with my buddies and everything it just felt like it was late. I have tried going out a few times with my dad, but I‚Äôm just uncomfortable around my dad. Bass fishing is just one of the many examples of things I feel like I was never fully invested in (by this I mean I was never given the opportunity to fully explore my interests). I know realize that I‚Äôm writing this entirely about my father. So I guess my problem is with my dad. I feel like he unnecessarily traded our relationship for financial stability. I know I sound like a spoiled brat and should be more appreciative of my dad. His job isn‚Äôt physically demanding, I think he could‚Äôve spent more time with me after work instead of sitting in a recliner watching tv. I apologize for my rambling this is the first time I‚Äôve ever expressed all of this. Please help me figure this out am I being to hard on my dad. I have zero doubts that he loves me, and I know that parenting and even life itself has no instruction manual. Are my feelings simply just a privileged kid making mountains out of mole hills, how do I confront my dad about this, how do I make our relationship what I want it to be.

P.S. my dad didn‚Äôt totally ignore my interest back when my grandad was alive (he died around 2012) we used to fish all the time. We would fish for  catfish which is what eventually led to me getting into bass fishing (which are totally different concepts). Then my sophomore he did try deer hunting with me for a season, I just wasn‚Äôt that into deer hunting. After finishing my post I felt like I should include the good stuff.",04Feb2020,1

im still a teenager, which i shouldn't say because now everyone's gonna be like ""oh you have so much to live for! please don't!"" i don't... give. a shit. i feel like someone inhabiting the wrong body (thanks being transgender!), and the only people who understand are the voices in my head (thanks psychosis!).
im being put on multiple medications for psychosis, depression, anxiety, fucking everything. it's so annoying. i just want everything to end. i don't feel like i should have lived this long. im 16. i shouldn't have lived this long. i should have died last year when i did try to commit suicide and didn't fucking tell anyone for 8 months until it came up in a game of never have i ever. 
i feel like i have died before. i feel like i know what it feels like. i can feel the peace. in those moments i almost died when i dug that razor into my wrists like never before, i felt so good. i wish i could've stayed there with my little cousin. i miss her so much. when i saw her i felt ethereal happiness. but it was taken away from me when i woke up groggily to my bloodied body and bedsheets.

I'm not sure what caused this sudden change of personality, but I don't mind it as, along the way, I made many many friends, including two girls who would both be my girlfriends (not at the same time ofc).

The first one I really liked, but we had a bit of an falling out and didn't speak for months. What I didn't know eas that she was gonna tell me she liked me, but because of the fight she didn't get the chance.

The second one I met days after the fight with the first one. I was kinda head-over-heels for her and eventually we got together. It lasted for about four months before college in different cities drove us apart and made us both fearful of the future. It ended badly, mainly because I didn't want it to, but right now we are on friendly terms. We don't talk much but we don't hate each other.

About two months after the breakup with the second girl, I hit up the first girl. We became super close again and she admitted her feelings. We get together.

First day is great, but after that she becomes scared we will not talk again and breaks up, causing a rift between us which eventually got us to really not talking anymore again. 

I feel so empty. I keep dreaming them and I have no clue how to get over either of them. I consider them both ""loves of my life"", and would be with either in a heartbeat.

93,"TL;DR - I jump from thought to thought and wait for the day to end while constantly thinking about ending it all while waiting to be divorced from an awful human being.

Everyday I go through so many thoughts and I wonder when everything will calm down and I will be able to just ""be""

I go to work and look forward to something that might be happening in the next day or two because I know when that happens then something else can be complete.  I can't seem to just live in the present.  I'm always looking at what is coming up so I can complete it and the day can end.  My favorite part of the day is the end of it. It's like I want to fast forward to the end of my life so It can just fucking be over already.

I wonder how long it's going to take for my divorce to be final so I know if I can stay in my house.  Then, just like that, I am depressed and think about how maybe if I just end it, it'll all be better.  Why bother trying to keep my home or a place for my kids when the court system is skewed and bias towards men?

I gt up and go to work and I don't know why, yet I make sure to not be late or get in trouble or anythign because I need my job to pay the evil woman who destroyed my life and the life of my kids by stepping out on me multiple times until I had enough and told her to get the fuck out.  I think to myself that once I am divorced and can remove her from my life insurance then I can finally end it all and I can stop trying to live in a world that consistently shits on me.

I want to do something, anything, but then I don't.  I want to be left alone, please don't talk to me, don't engage with me yet I am also missing companionship.  But then I think, why?  All it has done is brought you misery.  I trust no one, and believe no one. I have tried dating apps and they are all complete shit.

I wonder why I am having these thoughts and whining like a fucking baby, because after all, things could be worse.  Then I think, maybe this is it, this is where I am destined to be for the rest of my life.  Alone and having no one really give a shit about me.  Which then brings me back to the original thought of, why bother?  I can just end it and then it'll all go away.  I've been waiting for this divorce to be final so I can take away any chance she has of getting money.  I will be sure to draft a will and state my intentions for my belongings and my decision to have NO memorial, NO burial.  I will be cremated and tossed into the trash or whatever legal thing that can be done.  What's the point of a memorial when no one really gives a shit about me anyway?

I am going a 100MPH in my head with ups and downs and feel like I am becoming more and more detacthed from reality and the desire to be here as each day passes.  I am almost numb to feeling anything other than sadness or negativity.  I hate the thought of something good happening for the intense fear that something terrible bad is going to happen next.

100,"I am a 16 year old male.

I have had a friend for something like 7 years now, we'll call him Kevin. In these years, we've had our fallouts, our best moments and everything in between. 2 years ago, he became closer to another group, so I naturally joined. We all bonded over the years and this group of 6-7 is the group who I'd call my best friends. However, about a year ago they all used to gang up on me, attacking my lifestyle and appearance. They even messaged me at crazy hours in the morning telling me that it'd be better for everyone if I killed myself. If I retaliated or did so much as ask them to stop, Kevin would guilt me and make it seem like he was the victim. I used to be pretty suicidal, harming myself regularly, until they stopped. I don't know why, but we were just good for a year or so. I had no people in school to talk to because I knew none of the teachers well enough to comfortably confide in and nobody outside the group would talk to me due to rumours that had been spread. I did not tell my parents because I didn't want to worry them. I have one other friend outside the group, but at the time I did not know him well enough to confide in him.

Yesterday, this started again, but with Kevin being the only person. Yesterday, I walked into school to be greeted with ""Just look at the way he walks. It's not even a walk, you retard."" Followed by ""You're actually so fat. You need to shave, you don't shower, you don't even brush your teeth. You're disgusting."" The others in the group kind of just stood by while he insulted me. When I asked him to stop, he said ""What's got you so down this morning?"" Prior to seeing him, I was in a great mood. At lunch time, he told my brother about my bisexuality despite my asking him not to. He even told me he'd respect the choices I made regarding my sexuality, as he felt the same way about his music preferences. I felt betrayed and panicked. I was not ready to come out to my family and he knew.

Today, I walked into school and he just said ""It'd all be better if OP wasn't here."" I just stared at him. I hate him, but he is the centre of the group of my only friends so I can't leave. At lunch, he blackmailed me and as long as I shower every other day (A condition that is actually beneficial to me), he will not tell my mum about my sexuality.

102,"As someone who had a very low self esteem, I began becoming my own friend. Being a friend to yourself is so much more important than we realize. Through meditation, concentration, and will, I learned a lot about loving yourself. The dictionary explains the Self as:

  *noun*

1. a person's essential being that distinguishes them from others, especially considered as the object of introspection or reflexive action.""our alienation from our true selves""

If you have an essential being, that makes you one of a kind. One out of ***billions***. You are like a star in the universe, unique and beyond rare. To help with my low self esteem, and believe me, I was a suicidal hot mess, I started meditating and writing letters to myself, congratulating myself on accomplishments, being frank about my misgivings, and being supportive of my failings. We all mess up, but there are four types of support you can give yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

1. SELF LOVE- First and foremost is self love. Love is the essential because when you love something, you will do anything for it, and you'll also know when to stop it from harming itself and you. Even when you love someone, you will know when its time to step back and allow them freedom. When you love yourself, the others steps will fall into place. You have to be your own friend. You have to know that you owe it to yourself to have the best life, however you see it fit, and as long as you're not hurting anyone, anything is fair game. Be true to your wants, never actively deprive yourself of happiness or goals. Listen to yourself. Love who that extremely unique individual is.
2. SELF RESPECT- How can you love someone or something if you don't respect it? Love is built on trust and respect and you have to show that respect to yourself. No one will respect you if you don't respect yourself. Be your own best friend, be your guardian, be your driving force. Live for yourself. Don't willingly tolerate abuse and negativity. If you sense it, leave it. Drop it. It'll ruin you. Abuse is a stem of obsession. Don't let anything control you. 
3. SELF SATISFACTION- Like self respect, you need to know how to be satisfied with your own abilities. Your mind is a gateway and you are the only person in the universe who knows what that chamber consists of. That's a tremendous sense of power and you can use that power to strengthen yourself. You can do things that make you stand out, whether its an artistic ability, a logical one, a spiritual one, it doesn't matter. Embrace those gifts and own them.
4. SELF FULFILLMENT- We are under the illusion that we need someone else to live for, when we don't. You have to learn how to find peace with your own presence and thoughts. You don't need that lost love to complete you. I promise you that if you can find inner peace, then the selection process of finding a mate, if you're so inclined, will be far easier. If you are fulfilled with yourself and happy, then you know what else will make you happy, what kind of people you want in your life, be it friends or romantic. Let go of the negativity and the toxic people from your life. They're ruining your flow and your balance. Finding fulfillment in yourself will open doors you didn't know were right in front of you. I speak from experience.

Now, I'm not a lifestyle coach, I'm too unprofessional to be a guru. I'm just a real person who has experienced such a positive change in her life that I want to share it with others. However you choose to be satisfied and love yourself is your call. There is no sense in shaming others because they are living their best life, even if it's fundamentally different to yours. The only rule I really live by is to actively not hurt others. 

I was a real bitch before, and I still have trouble with empathy but through meditation, my four self help mantras, and lots of honesty with myself, I feel like a different person.  It's been a blessing, even if it came out of nowhere. I prayed for it and sought ways to help myself, but literally one morning I woke up feeling better. I can't promise that'll happen to you. Everyone's path to self love is individual because it's specific to our spirit. 

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, don't be discouraged by the shit life will throw at you. I tend to believe that we experience the negative so that we can appreciate the positive. How can you know happiness if you've never felt despair? Think about that for a little while and love yourself. It's absolutely worth it. You owe it to yourself to live the best existence that you can, to throw off the hatred of oppressors (enemies, fake friends, bullies), and to look back in your older years with a contended smile, saying to yourself, ""I lived the best that I could. I have peace. I can go now.""",04Feb2020,1

123,"At 18, half way through my freshmen year of college I met a beautiful girl. I fell in love with her instantly, everything was perfect about her, exactly what I envisioned my dream girl to be. Luckily(?) we hit it off and we started dating. I was crazy about her. Though during summer break she ended up moving 8 hours away from me. Being broke college students with busy schedules it was very hard for us to see each other. So we broke up after trying long distance for 6 months, it was a bad break up and we cut all ties.

I am now 23. Since then I have dated but haven‚Äôt had a relationship with another girl as I still miss her... though thanks to my heart taking such a long time to heal I was able to focus on myself. I have graduated college with a STEM degree and zero debt, landed a great career, paid off my car, commissioned into the Army Reserves as an Officer, saved a nice chunk of money and am now working on a Masters degree and my pilot license.

I feel like I would have not accomplished most of these things (or it would‚Äôve been much harder) if I would‚Äôve stayed in a relationship with her or if I had moved on and begun another relationship. I probably would‚Äôve spend to much time, energy, and resources on maintaining the relationships.

No, I'm not an introvert, and I'm in the groups that people would consider popular. Not fuckboys and I am not a kid who drinks, Vapes, or does drugs. I don't plan to. But, I am short and that ruins my confidence. I consider myself ugly. I consider myself untalented and unfunny. I always thought my whole life that I'm funny and socially apt, and everyone tells me I am but I don't believe it myself. I live in China (not right now because of Coronavirus) and have been here almost 2 years. I thought it would suck and all my friends miss me back home but I like it here better honestly. I am so scared of the environment with irresponsible kids back home in America. The reason I'm writing this is because I think I don't have a lot to live for and recently I figured this out. I have not had my first kiss or full relationship, because I am just not developed, even though I am at my age I am not matured physically and it's not attractive considering I am a year under all the kids in my grade. I can't play sports at all even though I always go outside with friends. I am surprisingly good at school with only 1 A- and all A's and I am really good at singing. I'm not bragging with this cause this is all I have. But I am just not confident, I have nothing to show off. I have nothing interesting and I don't stand out.

133,"My flat wasn't dirty. Because it's small, it looks cluttered.
I'm a full time final year student and I work weekends and sometimes a day or 2 during the week after class, so by the time I get home I'm exhausted. I came home today and was just really done. I just wanted the place to look neat and welcoming, especially after a long day. I've had the complusion to tidy it for ages, but I've just made excuses and brushed it off. 
So I stuck on Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners to look for tips and tricks, and here I am, a couple of hours later with a fully cleaned and welcoming flat. I feel so much better for doing it. I've been playing the game of ""I'll do that tomorrow"" for a few weeks now, but no more.
I'm demanding that I be an adult and live a proper adult life. I'm not a kid anymore. I have to hold myself responsible for dishes, and putting out the rubbish, and making the bed.
I'm proud of me for finally and forcefully tidying this flat.
If anyone is in that situation, put on any form of programme or YouTube video like Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners or How Clean Is Your House? Watch an episode, then have it playing as you tidy and clean. That's how I managed to get out of this rut. Hopefully for good!",04Feb2020,1
134,"I don't know how to even start this post. Or if it even matters. I guess it just helps me write everything out. To preface, and to possibly save you some time for reading this, this is about feelings and how I'm trying not to go crazy over them.   


For context, all the parties involved here including myself are females. My ex and I dated (and we are still close friends) for roughly 3 years. For 2 of these years, we had a mutual crush on a 3rd girl, we'll call her Nikki.  We thought it would be cute and quirky to make ""Nikki"" our 3rd ""girlfriend"", it was never serious but we always ran with the joke. We'd get drunk and hold her hand, make out with her, etc. It never went past that. My ex has always claimed that she saw a special chemistry between Nikki and I, but I always ignored it. Nikki and I work in the same industry, so there was only one night in particular where we were on a work trip and we had a genuine kiss, but only because it was discussed beforehand. My ex at the time was okay with this.  


We broke up recently for reasons unrelated to that, we just weren't emotionally compatible for the long term and that's okay. I moved to another state, where Nikki also lives. I didn't move here for her, I moved here for my career. But Nikki and I have obviously been able to hang out more, and I have been trying to ignore my feelings for her. However, I can't help but pick up on sly comments via her and her roommates that there is something going on. Like there is an elephant in the room and we're tiptoeing around it. And it's driving me absolutely crazy. Every time I try to brush things off, I see something passive on social media (ex: subtweets) or her roommates imply something. Nikki and I's dynamic too is often playful banter. ""Ugh, I have to see you two days in a row?"" - stuff like that.   


Since my ex, myself, and Nikki are all friends, I don't imagine she'd ever say anything straight up. No one wants to be the one to bring anything up if there are feelings involved. I know she's been hanging out with this girl from Tinder, and it guts me to think about that. But when myself, her, and her roommate came over the other night to have drinks and play games, there was a point where the subject of having feelings for unattainable people came up. She brought it up. And there was kind of an implied energy in the room. I tried to brush it off.   


Later that night, when she was washing dishes, she said something like ""Well this is better than getting drunk alone and talking about ridiculous life things that don't make sense"" or something like that, and when I asked ""What kind of life things?"" they both went quiet. However, her roommate locked eyes with me and widened them, looking at her and then back to me multiple times. As if he was implying something.   


Since Nikki and I work in the same career, we unfortunately work a gig together this weekend that will require us to spend a lot of time in the car driving and working on-site. I'm dreading it because afterwards I think I need to sit down and talk with her once we get back home. I don't want to do this to my ex but she's also desperate to know so we can all know what to do with our feelings. I know my ex will be hurt but she's also been supportive of this whole situation.   


I just feel crazy. All of this could not even be about me but stupid things like the other night happen and make the cogs start racing all over again. I've tried ignoring all of it and brushing it all off but I can't help but feel like there's something going on. My feelings for her have grown to a point where I feel I need to hear from her directly what's happening so I can just get on with it otherwise hearing small indirect comments like this every time we hang out will just continue driving me insane.   


Even writing this all out, I feel stupid. Especially knowing she's been hanging out with someone from Tinder. But I still want an answer. I don't know what's going on.

142,"I (19M) have had hard time coming to terms with my life, it's been so exhausting. I wish I could discuss what the hell's been happening but it's really difficult.

My mental health wasn't (and isn't) really the best: My loneliness triggered my first suicidal thought by the age of 12, and ever since then it has just been episodes of depression nonstop. It also didn't help the fact that literally every girl I had feelings for, had or ended up having a boyfriend months after meeting them (Big coincidence). After I finished high school, I decided to become super productive (Workout, learn piano, read more books, etc), thinking that would change my outcome; The results? Nope.

Meanwhile, time for college had came up and I was super excited to finally start my electric engineering course, but there was one obstacle: admission exams, which I understimated. Fresh after high school, I was feeling pretty confident about doing them and after finishing them I said to myself ""Okay, that went pretty well"". The results finally come out, and I got denied.
