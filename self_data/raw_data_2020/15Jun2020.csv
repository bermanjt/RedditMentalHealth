0,"I was just thinking today, once school is over for the quarter, I’ll go and babysit my nieces and nephews again (I've been staying home). What also crossed my mind was about how I discovered r4r recently and was considering posting on there - I’ve never met up with anyone from online before (I was going to write about being interested in searching for an ex look-a-like in the area to grope with). 

A sense of “oh, hey…” washed over me, about how I would rather choose to spend time and energy and stress on the enrichment of my younger relatives lives than with some stranger through Reddit that could fall out of my life anytime. 

I do like meeting new people, but I know everyone’s stay in my life varies. I know my family will be in my life, as for other people there is no definite span of time. 

I think it’s good to meet new people, but for me right now, that’s not what I need. I’ll see how it goes.",15Jun2020,0
3,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  as I gained weight from 11.3 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.4 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not as small as I want . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast until 9:30pm then eat is that better? 

I can PM pics if that helps

8,"This summer has been extremely difficult for me. I’m so close to just throwing in the towel, because as soon as I take one step towards improvement, I take two steps back into a relapse in some way.

At the beginning of Quarantine, I had to fly home from college across the country to stay with my parents. I lost my friends I had out there, as I can’t visit them, and worst of all. I was separated from my boyfriend at a really rough time in our relationship. Long story short, in a 2 month period of quarantine, he and I spoke just 3 times total. It was really stressful for me, and I was sad just about everyday. Then on April 30, he finally had the balls to break up with me. That was really hard for me to begin with, but it’s obviously been a good chunk of time and I’m feeling better.

As I mentioned, I go to school out of state, so my tuition is through the roof even with various merit scholarships. About a month ago, my parents broke the news that we most likely couldnt send me back to school, and they decided that if I wanted to get a student loan to fly back there and go to school, they’d completely cut me off, because they’re just that controlling, and are using COVID as an excuse for me to not go to school across the country.

A few weeks ago, I was playing video games, and instead of approaching me calmly and thoughtfully, in anger, my mom yelled up the stairs “OP, your dad and I are getting a divorce! Are you happy now, OP’s dad?”. Such a terrible way to break the news. 

I didn’t even have a chance to process this, as the next day I was rushed to the ER due to my lung spontaneously collapsing because apparently I have these things called blebs that are air blisters on the lung, that can spontaneously pop. So I had to get a very painful procedure where the gave me many shots, and operated on me while I was awake to place a tube inside my chest for 24 hours, before I was sent home.

They said the likelihood of a recurrence is a 30-50% chance. Well guess what, last Sunday, it happened again, not even a week later. I had to get the same agonizing procedure, and this time they sent me home with the chest tube, where it’s been sitting in me for 5 days. Until today, when I got a surgery called VATS, where they removed part of my lung and chemically glued my lung to my rib cage. As you can imagine, yeah, terrible pain. And so the hospital is where I sit, looking back on my life, and how quickly it went from pretty good, to a shit sand which all in just 3 months time. 

Will it ever get better? I don’t know, I guess.",15Jun2020,15

18,"

Tldr: was living with parents for a few months to get back on feet, dad and i would argue constantly and he threatened to shoot me once when he was drunk. Hes never been physically abusive and was a loving father when i was growing up. He never flashed any guns and kept them locked up the whole time i was with him. 

This happened a few months ago, but i moved out the day after the threat was made. 

Do you guys think it is a legitimate threat or one made out of anger.

Heres the situation and some info on my dad:

He never threatened me before, growing up he was loving, never physically abusive, and tried to do the best for us.

I was in a tough spot and so i moved back home with my parents. But all we did was argue. One night my dad and i were having an argument and he was drunk and threatened to shoot me. 

He has a lot of guns but they are in a safe. I was with my parents for a few months and he never flashed any guns or took them out of the safe which makes me think the threat he made wasnt legitimate.

However he did pepper spray me point blank during an argument we were having where i wasnt doing anything dangerous.

Besides the pepper spray nothing physical ever happened.

Graphic warning:

He also said other outlandish stuff like me being assaulted by black men and j!zz dripping out of my ass. 



Combining the outlandish stuff he said, the fact he has his guns locked up and never took them out and him never being abusive growing up makes me think he was just being verbally abusive. But id like some second opinions. 

Im in a better place now, im wary of my parents knowing how things were very recently when i needed there help but was treated so poorly. Despite my wariness ive seen them on occasion and theyve been very kind.",15Jun2020,1

21,"Hello

25 (almost 26) M. My first sexual experience was earlier this year before the confinement at a massage parlour with a sex worker (how I lost my virginity at 25). I did it again the subsequent day. Ever since the confinement began, I have been social distancing and have been feeling very lonesome. It's been 5 months since I had any intimacy and I have been wanting to go to see a sex worker at a massage parlour even if just one more time and quitting the hobby. That being said, many erotic massage parlours are resuming services tomorrow. And, I have been actively debating whether or not I should go. I feel like getting it done (whilst taking the precautions of wearing a mask etc) and removing that huge weight off my shoulders (compounded by lack of intimacy and indecision to go) then resuming the social distancing for the rest of the isolation period. Since they are resuming services tomorrow, if I go early that would probably be before many customers would have had visited so I suppose maybe perhaps it would mean less chances of contracting it. The loneliness and lack of intimacy are getting to me a bit and a session would do wonders for my mental health at the moment. Should I keep resisting or should I go for it? I am in Montreal Canada which has been hard hit. Seeing sex workers is my only way of getting intimacy at this point. I live alone too and have been very severely isolated for 3 months now.

After a few stressful life events 3 years ago, I coped with stress and anxiety by losing my appetite. I lost about 40 lbs in a 6 month period, and since I never saw a problem with my body before, I never considered it to be an eating disorder. My appetite became suppressed indefinitely, and I physically couldn't eat more than about 1,000 calories a day, though most days I ate less. I became used to it and never considered it a problem until I saw a naturopath last fall. I had severe anemia and my hemoglobin, hematocrit, and the like were all very, very low. It explained why my hair had been falling out. She told me that continuing my current lifestyle would put me at risk of cardiac arrest because my heart was having to work harder. I started supplements and started being more disciplined about making myself eat. I cook mostly healthy, with a few special snacks here and there. I'm not anemic anymore but still need to build up my iron more. I also got the ok to start cardio again, and also have been adding weights. 

I feel really good physically and emotionally, and even though I'm a bit soft around the edges now, I feel much happier and stronger than I did at my lowest, despite everyone telling me how good I looked. 

I know many people struggle with weight loss and body image, but please understand that skinny doesn't always mean healthy.

42,"Title may seem a bit off, and please bare with me.

So right now I'm (25F) single, have been for 19 months but it wasn't until recently my ex decided he'd gotten his use from me and fucked me off. I'm dealing with the pain and trauma of a 2 year abusive relationship and extra 18 months of abuse outside of it. I'm fucked.

Somehow though, Ive attracted more men now than before (all online though, shocker) including a friend (23M) I made last year, who I kinda wanna have a little something with. He knows my whole situation, as was there through most of those months, even answering calls when I was freaking out and in tears. He has changed a lot though and is planning to join the marines, but claims he likes me and such, just his focus is in the marines. I get that, I can't be in a relationship right now, all cool. Plus he's in another country.

However he doesn't use his phone a lot, so I don't get to talk to him much, nor does he reply too often. He treats me well when we talk, things now getting a little dirty, but despite him telling me he *really* likes me, I feel as if that's not entirely true as he still keeps to his routine of ""not touching his phone at all until the evening"" - which honestly, may just be me and my issues. 

I was wondering if there was a healthy, positive way of getting him more engaged, or wanting more. Having some way to get him to talk to me just a little more, be a little more attentive, without seeming needy, desperate or clingy. I also don't want to ask just yet, as I feel that's not fair and also kind of...forced, if that makes sense. 

He's reassured me he's not avoiding me, that this was just how he's been for some time now, that nothing is outside the norm. He also seems to be so genuine with his words, and was extremely upset at hurting me recently, telling me he'll show me that he means what he says, etc. He claims he really likes me, and so on, too.
 I'm trying to not overthink and push, and work on these pesky issues my wonderful ex left me to deal with. Trust is hard rn, he knows, but it's why I need some neutral points of view.

I was one of those kids who just used to pay attention in class really well and used to score well in exams. So I never really learned. How to work to get my grades and rather the grades would just come naturally. But all of this went downhill when I reached high school and it was no longer possible to do that. Now The thing is, after this whole thing happened, I tried learning an to be honest, till now  I have never really studied hard for anything, and medicine requires a lot in Lawton. Lot of studies. So what should I do right now? I really don't understand anything. Like I just don't know. Majority of my days I do nothing. And you know, it's like life is passing me and. I don't know. I never had a choice at life. I was born in this house that was so abusive and it was so dramatic and so my father is like borderline and my mother is a proper over nurse and both of them are crazy. Both of them are just crazy. And there was so much abuse in the house, my dad Always used to put me down and. Anyways, The thing is, I never really grew up in that house and now I'm out of the House and I'm abroad. And I have a choice now like I can study, I can become a doctor and I can go back and I have a sister. I have a sister who is also a doctor and she told me that she will guide me and help me become something in life. So she was just like just do this thing. Now for now just do it and later after you do this degree I will help you for your future job or whatever. So I have this. I have this path. The part is simple, like if I just study right now, it's just steady medicine right now. Somehow find the motivation or love or passion for medicine and just read it for now. Later my sister will be there and she will help me settle somewhere. And all of that. Like my future studies and everything, she will help guide me. But The thing is, I'm not doing anything at all right now. Even my room is a mess. It's just a mess. I haven't, I just wake up everyday. I eat and I go to sleep. I don't study at all. So what should I do about this? What is happening? What is this? I just don't know. I just wanted to vent all of this out an I want someone to help me make sense of all of this. Thank you Ann.

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really have anyone to blame but myself - my parents brought me up in a stable household, we never went hungry and we always had heat/electricity etc. even when things got bad and my dad was made redundant a couple of times.

I went to university and got a politics degree too. Now I work in insurance and have a pretty stable, well paid job despite the current pandemic. I rent a little house with my girlfriend and again, I have the things I need to live a comfortable if modest life.

So why do I feel so shit all the time? Like I could and should be doing more? Anyways laying awake last night I had a bit of a realisation: I really like simulation games (Farming, Car Mechanic, Construction to name a few I own) and I figure that I like those games because they let me live out what I would want to do in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

But every time I've tried to push myself in those directions, I hit a wall - I can't find any courses that fit around the job I have, I can't find any decent online materials for the things I want to do, and even if I could I have nowhere to do this stuff. Even if I could, the 'rona has basically put everything on ice pretty much worldwide, so I have to basically put up with it at the moment.

One stinks very bad of BO every day and  looks like a drug addict and sometimes scavengers food and cigarettes. The other wears tons and tons of of makeup  it’s a mask and fake hair extensions and fake tan (iv never seen a girl so artificial) they basically both are very  quick to call guys ugly (they both called me it in their own way hence the rant) and think they’re entitled to a hunk. I once overheard the one wit tons of makeup brag to another girl on there that she said to a guy talking to her ‘go away, I only like big men’ on a night out. (imagine a guy said something like that to her)  then she complained she wasn’t getting any 10 mins later (I guess all them big men are at home Sick or something) plus she’s on the dole and lives in a council house with 2 kids, a big hunky mans dream I’m sure. The one who stinks is just as bad if not worse, bragged she’s 31 when she looks like a 50 year old junkie with all the drugs she’s taken over the years. a bf in prison but checks out dudes that wouldn’t go near her ever but thinks he will. Basically one of them the one who stinks can’t do a thing to take care of herself at all yet a man needs to be a perfect hunk and she thinks she’s entitled to it. 31 and she looks 40 and severely drugged up and suffered from ‘im a princess’ syndrome. In their heads most dudes are ugly to them but there’s no such thing as a guy finding them ugly. Deluded pair of gobshites",15Jun2020,1

Over the past year I feel like I’ve changed so much and I’m incredibly happy with who I have become. Though it comes at the cost of all my high school friends. I’ve realized that I just don’t fit with them anymore and that they are kinda awful people. I don’t really have any friends anymore and I just don’t fit in at my school/town. I know that these are all common things with kids my age and as I’ve been told by too many people, “it’ll all be better when you get to college.” I’m sure it will, but I’ve still got a year before then. I’m so afraid of spending the whole next year alone. I have such a hard time meeting people and I have no confidence that I’ll be able to do so this year. I want to start a band and hang out with a group of people that I can identify with. And since I’ve finished all my classes except for one this year is essentially a gap year and now the only certainties I have for the year is that I’ll be working on music most days. I guess what I mean is that I just feel so uncertain for what the future has for me and it kinda makes me nauseous. Thanks for reading my mental breakdown haha.",15Jun2020,1

56,"Okay so a little background here -

I am 18, I graduated high school last year with English, Physics, chemistry , Math, computer science. Now I was always confused between taking math and biology... I had biology for half a semester in grade 11 but we had a shitty teacher and just 3 kids in our batch who took bio.. So I dropped it and shifted to math.  later on after graduating I took admission into architecture college, I made a mistake and I did tell my parents before the college started that i hated it but not like they listened...

Now 1 year later....

I am sure what I want to do dentistry.. I always wanted to go into medical and everything about being a dentist is right for me. So is there any way I can pursue dentistry? and is it worth it? All advice is welcome :)",15Jun2020,1

59,"For the past 3 weeks I've had difficulty falling asleep, or more back asleep during the early am.

It all starts with I haven't had a cuddle with my old boy in the longest time. Me and my SO live at the back of my parents property with his own cat and in December we wrangled a kitten while traveling. All the while I big fluffy cat is just next door. He never had tolerance for the dogs in the house and when we moved in the back he was pissed with me.

The yera before that I worked abroad for 3 months and that didn't help our relationship either.

I sit in the dark and wish to cuddle him, intent to get him to tolerate me again, every dya, 3 weeks straight, I head into the main house to give him love and attention. I got him to purr just 3 days ago and yesterday my dad found him, still warm. My parents saw him about an hour before, not wanting breakfast, staying in the house during this cold front.

I'm just glad I got to hold him one last time. As hard as his limp body was, my previous experience with cat-loss was a runaway, no closure.

I got to see him everyday it's just been a year since we had a full on cuddle session and I'm broken.

I feel like i never gave him enough attention in the last year and it's killing me because it's exactly what was keeping me up at 3am every single night. I started therapy on Friday and he's the first thing I told her about. That feels so far away, yesterday felt like a week had passed.

He's buried opposite our bedroom, my side in line with his grave, also outside the first bedroom we shared(I got to move into the basement for the rest of highschool.

During highschool! New city, New school, no friends, I find this baby and he's mine. He talked to me and comforted me and when I was abandoned by the friends I managed to make, he was there. He was there for the first boy I dated, he comforted me through 'the big mistake' ex. He annoyed the hell out of mum leaving fur everywhere and wanting to sleep by her because she's the closest thing he could get to me.

I'm sorry I didn't take care of you when I knew you were sick, just not how sick.

He died somewhat peacefully, kidney failure.

He lay on the spot where our last dying pet took comfort and that's where he was found.

I love you Mr Frodo, there will never ever be a cat who could call my name at 5am demanding full attention. Fuck I miss you.",15Jun2020,1

65,"I am a 14-year-old transgender boy with a BMI of 19 and I religiously follow the number 15 rule: 15,000 steps a day, 1,500 calories a day. I used to have a lot of ""puppy fat"" and puberty came very early for me, I've always looked twice my age even before puberty. Both of my parents are overweight, and from personal experience, I'm an endomorph: I find it hard to lose weight and find it easy to gain weight, even with the right lifestyle. I am stressing out big time right now, yesterday I ate over 3,000 calories and I'm panicking so badly even though it was just one day.

My household is very overweight, and I have little control over what food they buy. Instead of grazing on unhealthy snacks all-day, I've decided to follow 3 meals a day but I got up at lunch. Went through 2 entire meals but tossed them into the bin: was going to eat peanut butter on toast, but 100g of PB is literally 500-600 calories, and was going to have pasta and \[vegan\] meatballs, tossed that into the bin as well because the meatballs were grossly undercooked and all soft and cold. Felt tempted to have a bowl of coco pops but got the scales and discovered a bowl of coco pops is actually 450 calories, not 120 as it says on the box. It is also hard to cook for myself in the kitchen, I'm a massive introvert and there's constantly people walking about. I might cook turmeric rice with tofu and vegetables but like I said my eating regime is \*\*\*\*ed up.

The reason why I am so so so so so so so weight-conscious in the first place is that I believe that the more I gain weight, the more that will accentuate feminine curves which I don't want. I feel like having a slender, straight, masculine frame is crucial to my identity.",15Jun2020,1
66,"This is going to be pretty all over the place, I can't really structure anything right now.

I'm absolutely fed up with my cousin.

She's just graduated high school. Has no ambition, no drive, no hobbies, and no skills. All she does is watch netflix and lead on very average boys on snapchat. She's virtually impossible to talk to if you're not a girl, as around guys (even her family members) she just shuts up completely. Her parents are divorced, and likes playing them off of each other to get out of doing things/getting free stuff. 

I don't get it. If a family member asks her to do something she insists on being paid for it. The only time she's talked to me in the past year on her own was to try to get me to sign up for this app to give her $5. She went to an expensive private school, yet when she went in for an interview to one local college, she didn't speak the whole time. She'll hold \*any\* little thing that she has over somebody in front of their face, and gets legitimately mad if she does not somehow have ""the upper hand,"" in being older, taller, smarter, etc. It's completely childish and I don't understand it.

She only dates black guys, not in the least as some ""rebellion"" against her parents or cool points with her friends, as opposed to actually liking them as people. Her parents finally had enough of her just eating their money and being a complete asshole to her so they're beginning to cut her off financially. Her response to this is that she's going to follow her boyfriend of a few months and attend his historically black college with him. And fully expects her parents to pay for it ""because it's college."" I can't get over how delusional that is. A week ago she never mentioned college. And now she expects to A) get in to that college and B) do it for free. She has very little actual interest in education and no interest at all in the college, only chasing her boyfriend and trying to spite her parents.

I've tried helping her, I've tried talking to her, about school, about just trying to be friendly. I don't get it. I don't think she knows that I know half of this, which is why I'm hesitant to post it, but holy crap if I try to bring this up to her directly I'm afraid she'll just not respond and just not talk to me ever.

67,"Hello, today I put down a few thoughts about Enlightenment. Let me know what do you think about it. Check my profile for more if you want. :)

Enjoy!

Enlightenment simply means waking up. Similarly to a dream, that upon awakening we realize that we were dreaming. So too is enlightenment, where we realize the illusion of life and see the reality as it is. However, what happens after enlightenment is the secret of secrets.

### Dream, life and after enlightenment

When we are dreaming, most of the time we do not realize that it is a dream. We play the role of the dream and think that what is going on is real. So we get serious about it, and really involved with the story. Sometimes, the dream is so absorbing that after waking up, confusion is embracing our thoughts. Am I dreaming about now? Was the reality then? But as daily life goes on, we get used to this new reality and realize that the previous one was just a dream. However, what if this reality that we live, would be another dream that we are not aware of? In fact, when we are lying in our bed sleeping and dreaming, we completely forget about this daily life. Similarly, it happens when we are living here, and now, we forget about the dream world too. So then how to know what is real and a dream? What happens during and after enlightenment is simply the realization of the above question. The truth reveals itself, and we see what is all about. To understand this, we need to realize that the mind is the creator of this reality and the dream world as well. It is the engine that makes things work and interact with each other. It is because of the mind that we identify with this body and personality. Indeed, the mind makes us think that we are separate from each other. However, you would agree with me that, during the dream time, we also think that we are separate from the people in our dream. But when we wake up, we realize that everything was in our head. It was just us, interacting with ourselves thanks to the power of our mind.

### What is stopping us

In other words, what if this life could be something similar to a dream? Would we interact with each other thinking that we are separate from them? And most importantly, would we be that serious about all the ongoing drama? Indeed those are mind-blowing questions that can be realized only by self-experience. It is possible for every one of us, to wake up from this dream that we call life. The only thing that stops us is similar to when the alarm is ringing but we do not want to wake up. We snooze it for some time and go back to sleep again. Sooner or later, we all have to wake up to the alarm bell, it is just a matter of time.",15Jun2020,1

You will never get rid of racism. 

Because racism is HATE.

The sad truth is there will always be elements in every race on this planet that hates.

Black, White, Yellow, Brown or Red.

For starters it is every colour against the Whites.

Then it is the Blacks against the Browns.

Then it is the Yellows against the Browns and the Blacks.

Then it gets real crazy when same coloured people but from different regions hate each other.

Japanese against Koreans.

South East Asians against Chinese.

North Sudanese against South Sudanese.

African Countries of same colour are continually fighting and killing each other.

Middle Eastern Countries of same colour are continually fighting and killing each other.

It only becomes racism when whites are involved.

It is just misleading. It is just HATE.

Then throw in religions into the mix.

Then throw in criminal elements into the mix.

Then throw in politics into the mix.

And what props it all up and keeps it all going is MONEY.

The less you have the more you HATE.

Don't be mislead.

We can do our best to not nurture it.

We can do our best to not perpetuate it.

Sooner or later we all learn to HATE.

&amp;#x200B;

Add Media to the mix and the HATE explodes.

24/7 conflict of colour, race and gender.

The Information Highway runs red with blood.

Every person gets their chance to spread their hate.

We'll write about hate.

76,"I've posted here about my mom, she's a preschool teacher and really handled virtual learning like a champ. She's worked at her school for 13 years, has won teacher of the year a couple times, got local recognition for starting a preschool coding class, ran all the school plays, and was adored by everyone at her work until they administration changed leadership 2 years ago. Well, her efforts during coronavirus (and in general) went wildly unappreciated by the school leadership. 

When summer school started up, they told her that she would no longer be teaching pre-k, but would be with 2-year-olds instead. She was so upset, but figured she'd make the best of it, because that's what she does. There has been a fuck ton of drama the last 2 years that I won't get into and that I honestly didn't even realize was possible at a got damn preschool, but here we are, and she finally reached her tipping point after 2 years of leadership fuckery.

My mom was given a co-teacher to help with the toddlers (who is BFFs with the administrator who had been making my mom's life miserable for 2 years) and they agreed to alternate lessons each week. My mom spends the whole week preceding preparing for her unit, but realized that the co-teacher just.... didn't care about pulling her weight. So, this week the co-teacher was supposed to run the unit and by Friday hadn't planned anything. It all came to a head yesterday when this teacher emailed my mom and said ""I'm not really feeling the unit this week, you can do it."" 

I'm sure we've all had a coworker who has left us with all the work last minute, but my mom was having none of it and replied to her email basically saying ""You know what? No. You're gonna do it, all of it, because I quit."" The co-teacher replied ""WHAT???!??"" and my mom basically just left her on read, called her boss, told her she wasn't coming back ever, and cancelled her 4:30 alarm.

This will basically halve my parents' income but they legitimately don't care at this point. My nearly 60-year-old mom had been working 60-hour weeks for two years and it was taking a toll on their health, and she realized it wasn't worth it anymore, and that she was more important than this job. I thought she'd be upset, but she sounded like she just broke out of prison and basically ranted for 30 straight minutes about all the things she now *doesn't* have to do anymore. It took some serious guts to do that and I'm very proud of her.",15Jun2020,15

No, apes aren't running around as our slaves and we aren't slaves to them, fortunately. However both species deal with the same conflicts- those between religion, science and government. Withholding information and literally blowing up any evidence that could tear the government apart. Nothing new there, but what really got my attention was the uprising scenes. They look a liiiiittle too similar to what I've been seeing on the news lately. 

The more I think about it, the more it intrigues me. The Planet of the Apes movies will take your brain on an intellectual ride. If you haven't seen them, I strongly recommend them.

96,"I ask because I've moved around a lot, and between moving around a lot when I was younger as a teenager, I made a lot of friends.

But never any close ones.

I stumbled and tumbled my way from one edge of the country to the other... And landed in a place I am a real minority to grow up as. I think I always handled everything on the defensive, never really letting anyone get too close because I look different, my culture is so different, I eat so different. And I was ashamed of that. I felt ashamed to be associated with my people. No one knows about my country, so all they hear are the really huge, big, awful news or the huge, big, amazing news.

They don't understand the reality of where I'm from. How my grandparents have lived happily for almost 90 years now... We facetimed grandpa and he didn't look good. He was reacting weirdly to our questions... Repeating what the question was... I hope he gets better.

We should really visit him soon, tickets are really expensive though and they throw you in a quarantine for 2 weeks. If he gets really sick, I don't think we can wait 2 weeks.

Grandma was her usual, loud lovely caring self. I haven't called her enough. I haven't called them enough. The instant I asked her about dating several years ago, she gave me miles and miles of advice about self-love and growth and finding a true love that lasts as long as her and grandpa have. 

I don't know if we have 2 weeks. 

How do I explain this text to my own mother? She doesn't know English. I've only seen her cry 3 times, when we had to give away our cat because our 2bd apartment doesn't allow pets... but it did allow 5 grown family members. How do I explain this in Urdu? How do I talk to my dad about these emotions? He who is so ever strong, unyielding and I've never seen cry. I've seen my mom cry 3 times.... Once in Pakistan a long time ago. 

Do you think it was the time when my brothers and I were so young and traveled there with them, and my dad didn't let my mom go visit her own family in Pakistan because he didn't know how to take care of 3 baby boys?

And her dad died. And she was stuck at her husband's place with 3 dumb ass babies that he didn't know how to take care of? They married young. And then traveled the world together. He was from a relatively wealthy family, she was not. She never smiled in her wedding photos. I don't know if that's culture there; that poor young women get married to rich young men... Hell, I don't know if anything about this scenario is true. I didn't understand the language at 2yrs old, or however old I was. All I remember is the slapping and crying and screaming and throwing from mom in my dad's parents house.


But I don't know when mom's dad died. 
I've literally never asked her, because I don't remember anything else from that trip. And then we moved to the United States. 

I don't even know how old babies are to retain memory. Let me Google it for you. 

&gt;
The incomplete development of language in young children is thought to be a critical cause of childhood amnesia as infants do not yet have the language capacity necessary to encode autobiographical memories.[1] The typical schedule of language development seems to support this theory .[48] There appears to be a direct correlation between the development of language in children, and the earliest age at which we can obtain childhood memories (around the age 3-4).[48] Performance on both verbal and nonverbal memory tasks shows that children with more advanced language abilities can report more during a verbal interview and exhibit superior nonverbal memory compared to children with less advanced language skills.[29] 
&gt;

Now I don't entirely understand what any of that says, but I don't remember anything at all ever. Everything is repeating or completely erased from my brain and I don't know any parts of my past besides big huge events.... (Someone's always damn crying!). I've always been able to speak both languages right? Have I slowly been forgetting Urdu since I don't speak it to anyone but my parents, just two people daily? 

If I ask my parents genuine questions, how the hell do I even know what they're saying back to me? 

Fuck, it's 3am. It's been a long day.

Do therapists not like to read from their patients because it doesn't allow them to be a normal human being? But they don't tell you because they've been told not to tell you? Is this like Scorpion King? Remember that book about rich people harvesting poor people for organs but never properly explaining how? 
What if that was an expose in book form, but no teachers/mental health experts were able to figure that out until it became popular enough to not be stopped? It was just cryptic enough to fool a ton of us into ignoring it as creative writing. 

What if cyberpunk dystopia already happened? But the good guys trying to break us out have the same technology as the bad guys throughout history? But with better technology comes better attempts at cracking us out. But without real future alien-levels of sophisticated tech breaking us out, we're doomed to class warfare and destroying our planet and the end of our world? 

The earth is a power source. It's got a core, it's got life. It got consciousness and life and memory and culture. Of all the planets in the universe, it got life. Now there's a shit load of life in the universe, but we haven't been able to explore it all though. 

What if we're really just an outlier in a galactic super party of planets at the other end of the universe forming massive utopias? What if we're the introvert planet at the extrovert planrt parties. 

Do you think it's impossible for different planets to always be kind to one another? Do you think those planets themselves also always have wars raging constantly throughout history like we have? 

Maybe the other living planets got along *so* well that they all just left us because we're so damn annoying and loud and can't get along ever? 

What if they tried to tell us were destroying our little blue dot? 

""2012"" was an entire movie about this. Using the most consumable form of mass messaging possible in that time. 2012. 8 Earth Years ago. Have we actually been improving since 2012 as a planet? As a healthy system? As a people? 

We've been getting less and less violent, yes. But how many Earth Years has it taken for us to start becoming peaceful longer? Friendlier? How many Apocolypses have we gone through? How many resets, asteroids, wipe outs, climactic shifts, growths, tectonic shifts, etc.... Have we needed? What if we truly reset? What if it just starts a very slow count down before the next massive asteroid finishes us off? Imagine if after reaching a threshold of ""F-, trash planet"" the rest of the universe votes for a reset and flashes into a harddrive wipe? The planet we're on right now, yes. I'm saying what if the timer started recently? And it was so subtle it was taking 10+ years to figure it out. 

I wonder if the count down started?

the reality that life is cruel and takes more from us than other people can repair

[So do you think they’re expecting you to repair what life took from them?]

it feels like it sometimes. and i dont even really blame them. but its too much and i have come to the realization that I resent being born honestly. what a shitty deal. i get the pressure of not being enough for my parents, the family name ending with me, the guilt of not wanting the be the one who lived, the guilt that comes with not being grateful, or happy, or successful or any number of things that ive inherited or imposed on myself. my dad coming to visit unannounced before going to [distant town] all week and then just silently walking back to his car [after i didnt answer the door] and not bringing it up to me or texting me about it is too sad to think about. all they want is to see me and its too difficult for me to reciprocate. 

i feel like deep down i am just a tangled mess of rage and shame and cowardice and when my parents want to know me thats not who they want to know but its all ive got so i push them away to protect them and myself 

its just the same dead end i always end up at: nothing matters enough for me to put in the kind of effort it would take to come to terms with all the issues i have. nothing makes life worth living in the grand scheme. its just beating my head against a wall compared to smoking weed and playing games. i dont know how people make any other choice. i think at my core i dont enjoy life and i cant seem to find any footholds to make progress from. its just struggling in vain until i find another distraction to occupy myself with

I'm currently living and germany and going to attempt university for computer science next month.

This post was made because I don't know what to do. My goal was to be self employed and to build something from the ground up but everything I do doesn't work.

At first I started to develop mobile games 1 or 2 years ago and all of them but 1 failed. I made a lot of them but only one was profitable with over 27k downloads. This game made me a little bit money but it got banned from the playstore so I just gave up mobile games and wanted to make pc games.

I built  a demo of a game and only one person played it. It was a free game and I only wanted some feedback but I got nothing.

Furthermore I tried my luck with fiverr making websites and optimizing websites but I got only a few random gigs (all of them gave me best rating).

My blog failed with 4 views daily.

I tried dropshipping  this year but only got 3 sales. I made a websites and read everythign about marketing but nothing seems to work.

I thought if you work hard you can archieve everything but this shows me that I'm a failure and I'm not meant to be self employe. I gave so much passion into everything and so many hours.

I feel like bothering my girlfriend telling every night how depressed af I'm an.

116,"This is a completely spontaneous and pointless rant, and it's probably poorly written, but I just wanted to post it somewhere.

I've had about 3 months of time to enjoy all of my hobbies. I read a lot, played some video games I've neglected, but most of all I played more music than I have in years. I'm mostly a guitarist, but I've got plenty of other instruments and programs that I use to make stuff. 

Now my workplace is slowly opening back up (I'm a cook). I've only been back for about a week but I can already feel myself getting caught in the same routine that kept me from playing for years. 

For a little more context, about 3 years ago I went to college to pursue music professionally. It was just a one year course that taught all aspects of music business (live, recording, theory, producing, etc...) but the most valuable part of it was really just getting to work with the professors and pick their brains. I met lots of people and got amazing experience doing session work in classes.

It was extremely satisfying and, more than anything else, I realized it was something I could actually do. I also had fun making short jingles for myself, because I thought that could be a fun way to make some money. Wouldn't you know, one of my professors got a lead on someone who needed a jingle and I got the job! During that same year of college a classmate told me about a jazz/blues music studio looking for talent, and after reaching out and meeting the owner, I got multiple gigs playing guitar, piano, harmonica, and even arranging full songs for hire! That year in school completely changed me. Following my dreams was completely attainable, and everything I thought it would be. I felt whole.

That sounds pretty good right? Guess how act 2 starts? My dad dies right before Christmas, during the only break off of school for the entire year. My sister, myself and my poor mom (even though they divorced a decade before) are all crushed. He was battling cancer and, long story short, things turned downhill extremely fast. 

So imagine going back to school on a full time schedule with really only 2 weeks to process this. I was alright, but I couldn't really hide it if someone asked. More than anything I wanted to finish school because I know that's what my dad would have wanted. I learned later on how hard he could be on himself, and how he didn't want us being disrupted with his illness (which is part of how we never knew how bad it was). We never even had a funeral for him. We ate some sandwiches at his house and buried the ashes in his backyard. 

I'm getting sidetracked. All of this to say, I was fully embracing the best and shittiest year of my life at the exact same time. It was insane, but I found solace in playing music. No matter what mood I was in, if I locked myself in a room with a guitar I could turn myself around in an hour.

So now fast forward to graduation. Everyone goes their separate ways, some people go to school elsewhere, some people get side gigs while working at a music shop, some people find genuine success completely on their own merit, and some people go back to the 9-5 work they did before they went to school. Guess which one I was?

The place I started working at (and still do) is an incredible restaurant that I first started at when I was in high school. I quit after a few years to try other things out but came back after college. I've known the owner for 10 years and they've been nothing but amazing to me. I started as a dishwasher and now cook and prep just as much as anyone could there. Everyone there is like family, we're paid well, the hours don't go into the late night (I've worked at places that close at 2am) and the freedom is unparalleled. The only problem is, it's impossible to work there full time and give any real attention to playing music. I get completely lost in working there, and that's been the case for about 6-7 years in total. The few times I played somewhere as just myself (not as part of a band) at an open Mic, I would immediately get leads on future gigs and make about a dozen new connections that I could pursue. If I had the time... but I couldn't turn down the security of a paycheck, I can't risk not paying rent. 

Then the pandemic hit I had nothing but time to play music. It was amazing. I felt like I did in college, like the world was my locked down little oyster. For the last 5 years I wanted to make an EP of original songs. I play instrumental fingerstyle guitar  (like Chet Atkins, or Tommy Emmanuel, just not as good) and writing takes a lot of time for me. Getting to sit down and be inspired can't be planned, but it was always a struggle when I would only have 1 or 2 days off a week. I slowly came up with some ideas but even throughout the college year I could never write enough for it. You know how much time it took me to finish writing everything once the quarantine started? 3 WEEKS.
 
This was my wake up call. Good god, if I actually just put the time into it with no distraction, I might actually get the confidence to perform live (I've always been anxious about it, since I don't do it enough). I can write and record music to my hearts content.

In quarantine I wrote an EP of completely original music, gave my neglected youtube channel some much needed content, learned to write sheet music, and made a website to post all my tabs for original arrangements of covers for anyone to download for free. I was being more productive than ever and I loved it. This is what I want to do with my life, the only difference being that, if there was no pandemic, I would also go to open mics and play at farmers markets and subway stations and make some money and connections. I can do it. I know I can do it.

This time to myself made me realize I need to move on. But there's nowhere to move onto for, realistically,  roughly a year. And my workplace is opening up now, so I'm back to working in the kitchen instead of playing music. I don't want to slip back into this work life. I want to do what I know makes me really happy with myself. I want to play music with people, and write and record and make others happy with what I do. 

Maybe I never really tried because if I failed it would be because I wasn't good enough, but if I had to work too much, I had a reason for never succeeding. I've been giving myself an ""out"". But I've also been hard on myself for not being good enough, even though I never even gave myself a chance. I've had money from my dad's life insurance that I don't touch, because I don't want to squander it on something stupid like quitting work to live out a fantasy, but anytime I really put myself out there and try performing and recording, people have liked it. I don't want to avoid it anymore, I'm ready now. But I can't realistically establish anything while the quarantine is still happening, and while I'm working and saving up money, I don't want to completely fall into my work cycle and forget about music again. 

It's like I was drowning and didn't even realize it until I got a moment to breathe. I don't want to work this job anymore. I want to save up as much money as I can and go from part time to no time. But I may never even go through with it. I don't know. I just know that I've been feeling inspired, and it's been lasting for months. And now I'm working again and the feeling has gone away. I don't want this to happen again. I've spent too much time avoiding something I love for no reason and I don't want to wait anymore. 

I'm not a writer, so if you've stuck through this far I'm sorry if it's incoherent. I needed to vent and I need this to be posted somewhere so I can look back on it in a year and see what I've done since. I'm going to practice some guitar now.",15Jun2020,3

&amp;#x200B;

I then told him that I was actually hoping to get a math PhD after I'm done. I then braced myself, prepared myself for the 2 minute justification speech I give every time as the person's eyebrow then raises. I planned to say how I want to do it because I love it and am passionate about research and expanding human knowledge and teaching others, inspiring others in hopes to repay the people who inspired me and further expand human knowledge. I've given this justification more times than i could count. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of raising his eyebrows, he nodded and said, ""I think you'll do really great with that, OP. You'll make such a good researcher and you're very bright"". This was exactly what I needed to hear, even in a dream. Instead of telling me how hard it is and how most people give up, he supported me in what I love to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just last week, I told an acquaintance what I was majoring in and my plans for the future. She rolled her eyes and said how it was just me having big dreams and she was the same at my age and it'll all crumble. I wasn't ready for it. I was really hurt, especially from someone I saw as a beautiful young girl, just like me but a few years older. I looked up to her.  She had big dreams, but then got burnt out.

She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bite to me about how much she smells.

Edit: she’s Normally really  nice to me in a friendly way and she seems pleasant etc with me never had a problem with her before",15Jun2020,1

132,"I always feel like I have horrible luck. It's like, anything that goes wrong, will involve myself. Does anyone else feel this way?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, all in one semester, I've:

Got rejected from a tutoring program because my Google form never went through after I hit submit

Someone accidentally put their lock on my chemistry lab locker the first day of lab check-in

Everyone could sign in to their school email except me, and even IT couldn't figure out the problem

Got locked out of an account because the submit button decided to ""hit itself too many times""

Shuttle bus crashed into a trash truck and I had to walk the rest of my way back to campus at night

Got stuck with a bad TA who didn't couldn't even recall what he was teaching himself

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand what is wrong with me. Why is it that *I* have to deal with bad luck all the time?",15Jun2020,1
133,"I used to watch a certain youtuber who basically talked about her university life and academics/studying, lately she posted a video just explaining how her academic plans changed because of covid and how she was so scared she's just going to spend a whole year having to study her courses online in her room and not doing many things. And it just hit that the ""nightmare"" she was  describing and fearing is my everyday life. Because yes not everyone around the world has the privilege to do many simple things. I stay in my room most of the time and I study as much as I can and I endure the pain of not having the luxury to do many things I can't do simply because of where i live/ financial issues, while hoping I get my shot one day to change my situation. and covid didn't change a thing because that's how I always lived",15Jun2020,1

I've never loved anyone before in my entire life, and I don't know if I ever will. How can you make yourself be in love?

137,"We used to break into our friends houses without knocking. We used to call them at 3 AM without any specific reason. We used to share even our very small thoughts with them. Yes we had less privacy but less suicides too. 

Now we are obsessed with privacy and selfishness. We know so much about our friend’s lives through their social media stories but still don’t know what actually going around in their lives. We don’t like to listen their long ‘useless’ stories. We actually don’t want to know more than what their stories tell.",15Jun2020,1

In December 2019 I had a shave and went over again and again and again (stupid I know) with shave gel. The next day I had really bad hyperpigmentation and swollen face (also was brown too) and my nose went really red and oily too. the hyperpigmentation is now 98% gone and my face is a lot clearer again after 7 months. But my nose and the area around it is still very oily and grey oily under my eyes and I can’t look at myself in reflections etc unless I cover the middle of my face with my hand. It’s that bad. Iv tried E45, SPF 20 moisturiser. Palmers cocoa butter helped with the hyperpigmentation. 

Can anyone recommend any products or how to clear my nose and mid face again? 

My mum said moisturiser will make it worse but it can’t get any worse.",15Jun2020,1
140,"I wanted to just stay home and make burgers for lunch, but my mom insisted on running some unnecessary errands. I was also annoyed that my sister texted asking about food when she could just come into the room and ask us. So I had to ask my mom for my sis and then relay that info when my sis was just a few steps away 

Took mom to run the errands and came home and was starving.  Sis picked up food up  for everyone in the family but didn’t pick up anything I asked for. She stated she forgot the one thing I asked for but was able to get everyone else 2-3 of their own choices. 

I was angry because I was hungry before we left, and because I felt like she was so inconsiderate of thinking of what I wanted but was able to get random shit other ppl wanted and didn’t ask for. I barely spoke to anyone and ate barely anything then left 
She then came into my room while I was trying to cool off and annoyed me even more. I was trying to be patient but just told her to leave when I couldn’t stand it anymore. Then she called me a dumbass as she walked away and said I was upset for no reason. 

Then I got up and said why I was mad and how dare she call me a dumbass. We fought and then I slammed my door shut. 

The thing is, I’m a pretty patient person while she always gets upset about stupid shit. It’s like I can never be mad about anything but it’s ok if she is. 

 She’s older and it’s like my parents walk around always trying to please her cause she’s bound to be mad",15Jun2020,1
141,"Reddit I need your help. I'm currently in a relationship with my girlfriend and I have been planing on breaking up with her. We are in a long distance relationship and I am afraid that by me breaking up with her she'll do something terrible to her self. She often says ""without you there would be no point to me being alive"" and I am terribly scared. This relationship has been going on for close to 8 months. I feel like it's just not working and that it's hurting the both of us. Same texts everyday never talk for long ect. I don't know what I should do. Should I stay in a relationship instead of breaking up with her and risking that she'll do something to her self?",15Jun2020,1
