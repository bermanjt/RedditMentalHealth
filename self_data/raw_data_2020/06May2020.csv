2,"So basically, I've been noticing somethings lately. I just feel like I am an annoyance to my family and sometimes even a mistake. I'm on a group chat with my mom's side of the family, and my father. I told them that there is a 13-year-old girl who was training to go to Mars. Though I was joking and said ""could I go too?"" because they know that I like space, but then my cousin said no. I said yes but i didn't mean it, though it's my dream to go to another planet. My family started saying multiple things about space being scary and that this and that will change my mind over space. Now, I'm only a young person, and that is how they see me. A stupid kid. Though, I don't necessarily think I have the mindset of my age, more mature? I'm not sure though. They kept on saying that space is dangerous and that i would die and this and that. Now, I know that, but will it stop me? I know many people lost their lives out there, but I am amazed by them to have such confidence to try. I respect those people, yes, but the thing my family doesn't understand and or know is that I'm not afraid of death. Not at all. Though, I'm not suicidal. It's more of a, if I die, i die. I don't mind living but I don't mind dying.  Also, I learned that being scared of death could sometimes prevent the things you want to do. That is why I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid of space one bit, and I will never be. I plan to go to college and do all the courses and major into rocket science and everything that would be required to be an astronaut. I know i sound so childish, but my love for space is big. Yeah, i know, i sound like some five-year-old kid. I just feel so anxious because i opened up about loving space and wanting to go to space, and all i got was negative support. Ive been crying and having a headache while writing this, so i apologize if i have bad grammar. Anyway, so basically what I'm saying here, it's like every time i open up, i get negative shit. I talked to a school counselor before, and she says that is communication lack, and i need to open up more to my mother.  It is like she won't let me talk sometimes, you know? Once my mo argued and got mad because she had to pick me up from band practice. I told her there wasn't a class so i was with my friend (lets call her Jaz) for the time, and she started yelling on the phone that why was i with her and shit. *Then she did pick me up, and was saying that teachers were leaving and i was like ""wtf"" and i kept on saying and talking, she wouldn't listen.*  Turns out that she misunderstood the OTHER NIGHT, because she knew i had no classes, but i said "" i can go with one of my friends, her mom is a teacher there"" though she said no. Okay reasonable got it, i knew another amigo who was just there for there. Though he apparently she thought i was talking about the little girl whose mom worked there. she thought Jaz, was another chick. Heads up, there are two jaz's we know but one of them goes to another school. So yeah, she didn't listen, and when i explained she still wouldn't until she finally did which was at basically 6 o clock when all the shit happened at 4. Also forgot to mention that while she was yelling at me, and hit my arm and called me a bitch, blaming me for my grandparents to talk to her and say bad shit.  Then all she says ""Oh, sorry"" while she literally had fucked up my mind, and made me afraid if she would ever hit me again. She has hit me before, I'm not used to it, but it's when she is so pissed off at me. She hit me multiple times with a belt i think but I'm not sure during the same time of the Jaz and band shit, and i felt like she just wanted a reaction out of me, because i wasn't screaming in agony or crying loudly. All that she got from me were silent tears, and i guess it wasn't enough. Then, i used to be bulimic. She talked to me about it, but it didn't change shit, though I'm only not doing it because she made me swear to god, and my family is pretty religious. Though now, when i spend some time in the bathroom, like during this lockdown while I'm at my grandparents, and assumes instantly that I'm throwing up, and makes a huge deal. She isn't the one who feels the way I do, she isn't the one suffering from the pain of hating yourself of my body, or even just everything about myself. She says that she does it because she loves me, but sometimes I don't really feel love. Now my family is affectionate, though i feel like i just don't fit in. I'm barely a middle schooler now, but i just have all these thoughts on running away soon, just to feel free and to explore. Though, really it is because i feel like I'm an annoying and a waste of money. I don't feel like i fit in with my family.  I just feel like the more i stay, the more insecure and anxious i become. The school didn't help either when i went to public school. So, i just feel like i should run away soon, just so i won't be a bother and a annoyance to my family. I would open up, but they would probably yell at me. anyway, this is my first post and i don't plan on making anymore. I just feel so childish and stupid, but i just have all these thoughts and shit i needed to let out.",06May2020,2

-ads on LOOP. When I used the “stop seeing this ad” on youtube I started seeing less.... and then I started getting Air Force ones instead.

7,"So, before we get into the story time, here's a little context:
My bio father is a drink, and raped my mother and impregnated her with me.
My bio mother is abusive, recently ""started"" drinking (""because of me""), and has kicked me out multiple times before I was 17, because I pointed out that one of her plans wouldn't work/wouldn't be worth the effort, and suggested something that would

Around the time that I was... I believe between 11 and 13 (I've blocked much of my childhood out) my bio father started asking about me a lot, and trying to get back into my life after stopping his visits without a word to me when I was 6. He called my mother's phone and asked to talk to me, so she woke me up, and started telling me what she wanted me to tell him while she muted her side of the call, and threatened to beat my ads and ground me if I didn't say what she wanted (not the only instance of this, just the most prominent). After about 15 minutes of mindlessly repeating what she wanted me to say, the only part of the conversation that I remember came; in the midst of my father's drunk ramblings, he said that my sister was his favorite.

I'd've been fine with this if it was his daughter, but she's not. My mother had 4 children, by 4 different men, 2 of which the father is unknown, and my father had 2 children, by 2 different women. His favorite child was my mother's child, who was entirely unrelated to him.

There's a lot of holes in this story, as you might have noticed, and that's just because, retelling it here and now, I've realized just how much it hurt, and how little it registered then, because I was merely going with the notion my mother put in my head, instead of the reality that, despite the fact that he was an abusive drunk, who preferred other people's children over his own, he still treated me better than my mother who somehow still won full custody over me when I turned 3 after only having a few monthly visits for those 3 years.

As a side note, I am now living with my sister, and have gone LC with my mother, and haven't talked to my father since that day.",06May2020,1
8,"At school or with my friends, I'm pretty basic and ""normal."" I don't know how to explain it, but I know people online like to call people like me basic or normies or sth. Like I'm outgoing, my friends are like those basic popular kids, my fashion is just those basic Brandy Melville kinda clothes, my music taste is so basic, I can fit in with almost everyone, my friends and I go out to clubs and bars and just things high schoolers think are ""cool"", I kinda look down on the kids that are considered weird and my friends treat them kinda badly, I used to hook up with a lot of guys(but I started getting a reputation), I'm not super pretty or anything but I'm not ugly like I'm just decently attractive, and like I don't know how to exactly word it but I'm just seen as a normal basic teenager to other people.

But when I'm alone at home, I'm so fucking weird. I hide it from my friends though. Like even with Reddit, I use a private browser to use this and I always delete my accounts because I don't want my friends knowing I use Reddit because it's considered weird. I love playing Roblox and I love trolling on there and just acting like a 12 year old kid. I used to have Discord and I used to voice troll on random servers with friends I met on Roblox. I recently started watching this cartoon called Ninjago because I used to watch it when I was younger. I watch PewDiePie sometimes and Roblox youtubers. I know it doesn't sound that weird(maybe it does), but it's super weird for me and my friends and parents would probably the judge the fuck out of me because they see me as just normal. Like I even hide this from my parents. Like sometimes I'll be trolling on Roblox or watching Ninjago, and I'll just be like ""I'm so fucking weird, I can't believe I even have friends.""

I'm not really pretending to be normal though. Like I know people will think I'm miserable because I have to hide this weird side of me, but I'm not. My friends are nice and they would judge me if I told them all this, but they would still be friends with me. Same with my parents. I'm genuinely not pretending to be basic because tbh, I kinda am, but I just also have this super weird side of me. It's like I'm that ""popular"" kid(I'm not saying I'm like popular, but just that term helps you understand what I'm like) outside but I'm also super fucking weird inside. Like there's this kid that's considered ""weird"" at school and people find him annoying, but wow, I understand him. Like I'm basically him in a different form?

This sounds like a shitty thing to do(and it is to be honest), but I also enjoy the self-esteem boost I get when I'm around other people considered ""weirdos."" Like on Roblox, I made actual friends there and we shared each other instagrams and they're always like ""omg you're soo pretty."" Like I'm not even pretty, but to them I'm considered so pretty. And almost all of them say they got bullied at school or they don't have a lot of friends, but I never experienced that. I did use to be super awkward and pretty ugly in middle school, but when I hit high school, I changed so much that it's insane. It's like I'm in between normal and weird, but I went with the normal side.

I just wanted to get this off my chest and I really want to know if anyone else is like this because I feel like I'm the only one. Thanks for reading, lmao.",06May2020,1

11,"Damn it, i know this sounds too ridiculous, but believe me it isn't. Keep in mind she's been thinking this for more than a decade now, and surrounding herself in a circle of friends that think the exact same way. She thinks tge government is going to force us to accept computer ""chips"" into our wrists, and that they'll brainwash and control us that way. 

She never actually gives any evidence as to how or why this could happen. But I'm just about tired of listening to this garbage since i was a child, and now she thinks that I'm going to be a violent killer and evil if i don't start believing in what she's watching.

Whenever i hear the chip conspiracy, i seriously can't help but want to end it for myself based on its sheer stupidity. I hold disdain for all the scientists, historians,etc. both fake and actual ones that use their positions to trick people into holding distorted views on the world for their selfish goals.

He claims he does not have an instagram and does not know we've seen him use it. My sister saw him messaging women (once even saying hes 18) and we think we just found the account he has, which has a picture of a young woman (obviously not my dad) and about 200 followers. The account even follows one of my friends. We don't know for certain but we're pretty sure. There's definitely something shady going on, he always hides his phone and super secretive.

14,"So, I just want to preface this by letting everyone know this is going to be pretty long. I'm going to talk about a lot of pretty personal stuff. So if this isn't your type of post then I wanted to say something so you don't waste your time past the first couple of sentences.   


Anyhoozles, I am making this post for two reasons. The first one is that it would be very therapeutic for me to talk about a lot of this stuff. I blew up and got into a huge argument with my friends yesterday and I said some bad things I regret. This all has made me reflect on my life and I always found peace in helping others out. I also want to give some advice and hope to people who find themselves in similar situations to me. I really hope I can give some hope or comfort someone else. This is for anyone who is struggling or suffering right now and feels like it's hopeless and that it's all over.   


To put it bluntly my life has fucking sucked. I've been put through the ringer more times than I can count. So i'll start off with my story. I will try to summarize as best I can here since obviously it is my life and very long and i'll be willing to go into more detail about different situations upon request. My life up until the time I was about 6 or so was relatively normal. My dad wasn't really around all too much but when you're a youngster you hardly think about such things. When I turned 7 I started throwing up my food. It started with small little bits of stomach acid but in time it got to a point where I was having a hard time keeping anything down. My mom brought me the the doctor and I had a hiatal hernia that was causing my epiglottis to not work properly. So I had a surgery to fix it. There was a complication with it and I started to not be able to eat anything. For about ten days after I was released from the hospital. I couldn't eat and could hardly drink. My mother implored the doctor to bring me in to get me examined because she noticed I wasn't eating. They admitted me that day after the tests showed my epiglottis wasn't working at all. I was so dehydrated they couldn't find my veins and it took them several times to insert and iv for fluids. I had my surgery redone successfully.   


I wish I could say that it was the happy ever after ending for me after all of that but looking back i never could've imagined how that surgery would change my life. I missed a ton of school and I was home school like two or three times a week at a local library. Pretty much all of my second grade year was spent away from school. So I didn't see my friends. Then soon after that we moved upstate and away from everything. The new school i went too was horrible. My body was totally wrecked from not eating properly for so long. I was so skinny you could see my ribs. It was horrible. I had to go to physical therapy instead of gym class and I was put on an IEP because I wasn't in class for so long. Needless to say, the kids i went to school with bullied me relentlessly. As i went into middle school They would take my lunch every single day, beat me up really badly, spread horrible malicious rumors about me. I wasn't safe at home either. I would come home to my older brother who was incredibly physical abusive to me. One time he tied me up, put tape of my mouth and beat me until I had bruises from my neck to my ankles. The only reason it stopped at home was the teacher noticed all the bruises on my body. My sister was very verbally and mentally abusive. Plus coming into my teen years not having my father around was extremely difficult.   


All of these factors led me to be isolated and to feel completely alone and I craved love and attention. My Uncle came into the picture around this time. He actually paid attention to me. He would talk to me. It started off well enough but soon he became extremely manipulative and fucked with my head. Making me feel like i was worthless. He was tearing me down and making me two inches tall. He ended up sexually abusing me. He made me feel like I deserved it and it was repayment for failing. I won't go into detail about the horrible things he made me do but suffice to say. It scarred me for life.   


I also fell into the wrong crowed in school. People who did heavy drugs. This comes into play in a bit but i don't want to say too much about this.   


This changed me. Ruined me and I still suffer from the consequences of all of this to this very day.  I have a hard time expressing my emotions and I have a short temper sometimes with the people I love. I am very sad all the time and i've been struggling with Alcohol consumption. Several of my friends from high school are dead. Most of them overdosed. My friends from high school that are still around are shells of their former selves. The drugs destroyed them as people and when you look at them all you see is addiction. A lot of my older family members have passed away. Age, a stroke, my great aunt passed away because of this corona virus shit and my Aunt passed away recently from liver and kidney issues. The one that affected me most was my great grandma. Every one of the people I've lost has taken a piece of me with them.   


Suffice to say, I have been through a lot. The consequences of all of this are still present in my day to day life. I struggle very hard. Like i'm sure a lot of you do. Despite everything that has happened to me and things that have been happening recently. I've become successful. I am healthy and strong, I became my own boss and work for myself. I've seen a lot of success despite everything i've been through. I try my best to be a good person. I don't always live up to that but I try hard.   


If you're struggling. If you've been through a shitty past like I have. If you struggle with loneliness and pain. This advice is for you. Don't give up, never ever give up. I understand that going through struggles is a brutal war. It's fighting every impulse you have and sometimes it feels like it would be easier just to give up. Don't surrender to it. It's a war worth fighting. You're worth it. You're a human being and that makes you infinitely valuable and precious. Your past doesn't have to define who you are or define your future. The struggle is real and it's long but there is a light at the end of the tunnel and you can become happy and make yourself have a good future. Hard work pays off.   


Remember that it's okay to be imperfect. It's okay to have bad days. It's okay to feel weak and it's okay to express how you feel. It's okay to not be okay. It's okay to make mistakes. We're all only human.

22,"I honestly just need a place to vent, like a lot of people here.

Background: Unlike almost all of my friends, I have a wife and young kids, so going out is hard, especially with COVID-19. Making matters worse is almost none of my friends are in my city, so like a lot of people I keep up with them over gaming, PlayStation in this case. 

Story: so I got online about two days ago and I went to join the party of friends, but I get an error message that I can’t join due to player or party settings. I figured that hey, maybe they want to have a couple of people for that one night, whatever no biggie. But then I go to get on tonight, and I have the same issue. So now I message the group text and ask “who blocked me and why?” Radio silence. 

Then, I get a text from one person saying he knows who did it, won’t say who, but it’s because that person thinks “I’m difficult to be around, and others agree.” Now, I’m not really sure what that means, but I guess I’ll do some self-reflection to figure it out. 

I’m bummed because

 1) this is really my only social interaction beyond my family 

2) I don’t have any idea who it was

3) I’m not entirely sure why it was done

4) the fact that this person just did it without ever talking to me about me being difficult. 

Big friend points to the guy who texted me so I wasn’t left in the dark. Honestly, if you have a problem with someone, I think you should try to talk it out before escalating it.",06May2020,1

And idk why but those comments coming from young girls has really messed with my head. Because I remember thinking that as a kid, looking up to the older girls wishing I was like them. I thought that if I looked like these girls then my life would somehow come together and I’d have lots of friends and partners and everyone would like me more I guess. 

And now that I am “one of the cool” older girls I gotta say it‘s the exact same. I only have 2 close friends and  forget keeping a guy interested in me for longer then a month. It’s really just made me realize how looks don’t matter because life deals the same shitty cards to everyone.",06May2020,1

She was my favorite person in the house, I always entered her room and gave her a kiss every time I passed by, I heard she felt rather lonely and we were going to make a book club, we were supposed to discuss my favorite book but she died the day we started it.

My house was always active until 1 am because of her, there were always people talking or doing something because she needed a lot of help, but now the house is rather silent since 9:30, everyone is already in their rooms and I'm here writing this post just missing her, alone in the living room.

I am in a very happy relationship, but I met my SO online and I approached him. I know it doesn't matter, and I'm not super upset about it. But I just felt like letting out my thoughts about it. It does sadden me a little bit and I am curious why.

Looking back, in highschool i actually think I was quite cute. My SO says I was very attractive back then as well. But no guys ever talked to me. In fact I was ignored all throughout HS.

My SO says nobody hits on me because I don't wear makeup, don't try with my hair, and don't work out to get a nice booty. But even so, I feel like even ugly chicks get hit on. Some girls make it seem like being creeped on is so common. Some of the stories, I'm like damn, wish a dude was creepy towards me \[but not stalker level\] lol. And I get that I don't try at all with my appearances now, but I did try a bit in highschool, and yet, like I said nothing. 

I don't think I'm a super terrible person. I'm a bit shy, but kinda laid back at the same time. Idk, oh well. /End rant/self pity party.",06May2020,1

34,"For as long as I can remember, I don't think I've ever been 100% satisfied or happy. I've been taking hits forever, and I've never really succeeded at anything. I try my best, I give it my all and I still fail. 

I try my absolute best to win, and I never do. Everytime I try to take a step to fix myself and get to work, something happens. Everytime I think I feel happy and start to relax and drop my guard, something happens. Everytime, with no exception.

I don't feel anymore. I've lost my emotion, and the only one I do feel is animalistic beautiful anger and desire for carnage and I can't even have the luxury of that feeling because it comes and goes. 

I'm starting to think  I was born to be an example. I was born to lose, I was born to die young. I have a strong feeling I will die by the age of 22, and I welcome that. Even if things do improve in the future, they will go bad. Maybe I won't die now, but when I don't want to - when I finally start becoming normal and happy, that's when I'll die. 

Nobody in my life cares about me. They pretend to, because that's easy to do. They don't listen. Nobody listens. I have no control, no power - and I'm tired of trying. 

I'm fucking tired of life. I want to die in my sleep. I don't care anymore. I don't care about anything. I'll be the happiest guy alive if I was diagnosed with a terminal disease that left me weeks to live.  

Dying would be the greatest thing that ever happened to me.",06May2020,1
35,"I'm feeling a need to get these thoughts out. 

 I've lack success with it for the 30-some years I've been drawing since I came into this world. There has only been one instance where I had anything good happen regarding my art, and it was in Japan. Far, far away from where I am. It has been a driving force that has kept me from giving up though, even though I question nearly everyday if I should--and if that one incident of success was nothing more than a joke by some entity in the universe to have a laugh as it watches me fail over and over again, crying in literal pain as I create; as I'm physically and neurologically disabled with an ailment that makes it hurt when I draw.

I'm always made fun of for my art. Both online and offline. When I was in college (which I could never finish), the drawing circle told me I wasn't good enough to join them. I've read the lines, ""You can't join the cool kids table"" in a mock when trying to be part some online art groups. If I do join an art Facebook group or something, I always end up saying something dumb... 

 I fail to gain any kind of following on social media since my disability keeps me from creating quickly--which is what is needed to get anywhere with social media in the art world.

For 4 years I've been trying to apply to sell my art at Anime and comicons, and I haven't been able get one acceptance yet if it is juried. I got called stupid to my face for trying to sell my art...

Either I'm rejected on the basis of not fitting the niche well enough (aka you suck), not enough social media following, or they say, *""You draw in too many styles so you don't have a style.""*

Then the events that I can manage to get in by lottery, I'm always placed in the back. Sometimes with the only wobbly or broken table. So many events also ""forget"" to include me in their pamphlets, and/or they lose my information and I have to bring up receipts to prove I paid for a table space. I stopped counting at the 7th time this happened... And I'll be the *only one* of the vendors that it happens to.

I'll half joke and say that I'm cursed in regards of my art, but then I get quickly exhausted of hearing how everything is my fault, and attract this ""negative energy""...  
*So chaos magick...?* But even then, no amount of magic is going to cure my dyspraxia (the disability I have the makes it painful for me to draw).

If you've read all this, thank you. I really just felt I had to expel these plaguing thoughts for some reason. 

... And to add to the toxicity of anything relating to my art, this is actually the second time I'm writing all this, as my browser crashed as I was just going to press post before.

AND even *now*, this was originally posted to a ✨ Spiritual Journey ✨ Facebook group where people talk about their personal lives and post their art all the time, but yet this post was deleted within a second of me posting it for no reason... (maybe because I said magic won't cure being disabled). 

Then I just posted a picture I drew of some cats, and **that** got deleted too...",06May2020,1
36,"So this is a throwaway I use when I'm feeling down.

Everyone I know in my life are people that I've known longer than ten years--mostly family or related friends of family. The last time I made any friends, in real life, who I could rely on was back in 2009 when I started university. Needless to say, I'm not in touch with any of those people anymore, so throughout my entire 20s I've never actually made a friend in real life. Someone who I could rely on for a favor or vice versa, hang out with, talk to on the phone or text or whatever.

In the early 2010s, I spent most of my time online or gaming so I did make friends that way, but it's always been through the game and sometimes went beyond to Skype or Discord. I even managed to meet a few people in real life. But I've also lost touch with all of them. The last ""online"" friend I made was in 2014. And now it's 2020 and being put in a situation where you're forced to isolate makes this so much worse. I was looking forward to this year being the one where I thought I would try things differently and ""put myself out there"" but that's been stumped.

I want to blame it on my situation, but it's not really even all that bad. I didn't grow up with toxic people, I don't have a mental (that I know of) or physical disability. I don't even know how I managed the last 5 years without anyone I could confide in, except myself.

It's not that I can't talk to people or have trouble socializing when those I interact with on a day to day basis (co workers). I just can't find a connection, something to stay connected beyond work. Of course I've met people throughout the years, but even all the people I've known over ten years are people who I don't feel close to--they sort of just have been in my life.",06May2020,1
37,"In some ways I feel I am irredeemable.

I’ve always tried to act on what’s “best,” but still I have made the wrong choice in quintessential moments time and time again.

The moments that hurt the most have a common theme: I didn’t value my relationships with friends or acquaintances enough and in some way or another, lost them.

The past couple of years I’ve gotten a grip on life and gained insight into my own identity. However, I didn’t know there’d be such a cost to understanding myself: ruined friendships, toxic relationships, and a quick end to adolescence.

I’m now in a place where I know who I am and I know who I want to be. I can confidently say I’ve learned from many mistakes. I know where I went wrong. I understand why I made the decisions that I did. 

In spite of it all, I still feel that I’ve lost part of myself that can never be fully redeemed. I ruined so many opportunities. I know how to make the right choice in choices I no longer can make.

39,"I grew up with a highly narcissistic mom, only ever showing affection when it benefits her in some way, manipulating me and my sister, threatening to abandon us or put us up for adoption if we didnt lie about things. I could never make it up to her, whenever I show her my artwork she only says how weird or ugly it looks, as if it owuld be a sin to say something positive. Her boyfriend was a heavy drug addict, she would become very computer addicted, we lived in the ghetto, I was the one to go 2 miles in the dark to get groceries and carry then back home at 11 years old. I was very underweight, our house was a catastrophe, no clean clothes, ever, we wore the some clothes for months at a time, rats, heroin syringes, alcohol, police comign to see whats going on, because my stepdad beat up another guy in front of a club.

There is so much, my dad ended up taking me in when I was 12, his wife however, we didnt go well together. She was the opposite of what I had experienced, I was a troubled child, not a trouble maker, just very quiet and having issues expressing myself, asking questions, or telling anyone what I wanted. She hated me, and I felt it, her resentment. She would constantly look through my room, my phone, my drawers, if she found anything suspicious or if once again I horaded food (I did that sometimes, we didnt have a lot of food at my moms house, I was underweight back then and ended up hoarding soem food so I could have some) and that kept going even at my dads.

Hour long interrogations of asking me why I dont like my stepmom ""what is wrong?"" and why I dont behave the way they want. I never took drugs or drank alcohol, nor did I like parties, or doing anything else illegal. I started cutting myself, not in an attempt to kill myself, but in hopes that someone might see it and notice just how bad I felt, I hoped someone would reach out to me. Even now, I could barely enjoy what little of a childhood I had left, my dad and stepmom constantly telling me that I have to grow up faster than others because my mom messed up with me, that I have to become an adult right away.

At school I was slacking, sleeping most of the time, escaping home, after school, the only public place was a church in my village, so I would secretly lay on one of the benches in the church and take a nap for 1-3 hours, so I would not have to spend as much time at home.

I am an artist at heart, it is my big passion, so that is what I pursued as a career, but my dad wanted me to do a proper job, so when I graduated high school at 18, he told me to either go to the military, or he would kick me out.

So I moved back to me mom, she had changed, but still the same person.

I worked at a hotel, but ended up getting very ill in the same year, out of the blue.

I couldnt eat anything but a tiny piece of toast every few minutes from that point on, for 3 years, I was horribly underweight, a walking skeleton, my stomach hurt so much. but doctors could not figure out what I had.

No one in my family believed me, I lvoed to eat, I just couldnt, I kept telling them, but they wouldnt listen, even after seeing a therapist for half a year, who ended up saying there was no correlation between my mental state and symptoms. For three years my mom kept making fun at me, and letting her anger out on my sick self, always tellign me how I ""cannot keep living like that, you need a job!"" Just poking the wound, that was me slowly dying, not wanting to live that way myself.

I was barely able to walk in the third year, my mom and her new byofriend would keep threatening me to kick me out if I dont soon have a job or a diagnosis. Thanks to reddit, I ended u being diagnosed with MALS and three other compression syndromes.. I got a big surgery for it.

And after that, my depression was almost worse than before. I had dealt with the thought of dying soon, I was almost looking forward to it. I had lost what little I had in life.. life would never be the same. all friends, all stability. 2 after my open abdominal surgery she urged me to get a job again, so at month 3 I started working at burger king, the only thing available that wasnt as hard as the body as farm work around.

I enrolled in a college, and was accepted, but my dad and mom did not like that, they didnt want me to do more shcool, but instead do more simple labour jobs ""the country needs that"". And most of all, they would have to support me financially.

They told me they would not support me at all, no money, no housing, I would have to deal with that myself. To try and get me to do a ""normal"" job that pays well. They would always tell me ""Silaries, you are already 21 now, you wasted 3 years being ill, you cant do school anymore you NEED to earn money!""

I never chose to be, I wish I could just be an artist earnign money, I wish I couldve studied art or design like my friends did, but it was not meant to be it seems.

I met the nicest person online, during my recovery from surgery, but I lived in germany and he in the US. In a crazy decision, I spent all my money I had made on burger king on flying to him.

I love him, he is the sweetest man, my husband now. However, thigns were not planned well, immigration did not go as planned as we need a sponsor, and my husband did not earn enough money, and now with corona he doesnt have a job at all. Plus I have been having bad health issues since February now, but have no access to healthcare.

So we are now stuck at his dads house with no money whatsoever, my health declining, this hosue is a horrrible mess, the various dogs and cats of the 7 kids in the house pooping and shitting everywhere, the kids having poor hygiene... no dishwasher, everything just smells horrible, and is horribly dirty.

and in the middle I am here, an illegal, even if I had moneyy for a plane ticket, I couldnt go to germany because of corona.. and to where? I have nowhere else to go, and how would I get my husband with me?

I wish things were better, I am hopeless, indescribably depressed, I have no way out, I feel horrible and there is nothing that I can do about it.

I crave a figure that could give me advice, help, or even just care, but most of all I crave stability, not having to worry about everything all day...",06May2020,1
40,"I’d like to think that I’m a pretty nice person. I treat people how I’d like to be treated. I hold myself to high standards because I love and respect myself and know that the limits are endless for me to achieve greatness in life. I’m far from ugly as well, and I take good care of myself and I’m fashion forward. So I know it’s not because I’m ugly. But somehow people always find me unlikeable? 

A suppressed memory just dawned over me. I never really fit in with people and I’ve never really been liked.  I remember being 15-16 y/o going over to a party with my parents and trying to befriend these two girls but they told me that they didn’t like me later over a MySpace post and deleted me. The same memories repeated in highschool and college. I tried to be friends with a group of girls in highschool but all they did was talk shit (even about each other) and leave me out of things. I didn’t mind this because I thought they were toxic anyway and found my true group of friends that I’m still friends with till this day.

I didn’t finish college but during my 2 years there people didn’t really find me likeable either. People liked me I guess. But I never really fit in and it overall ended up being a bad experience. I always felt fake vibes and knew that the group of people I was hanging out with that day would probably talk shit about me once I left. 

To this day, I have a select few friends who I don’t really hang out with that often. I don’t care to go out my way to make friends anymore. And my friends are either introverts like me or they just understand me. I only really see my family, boyfriend and coworkers on a daily basis. 

Is there something I’m missing? Is there something bad that people see in me that I don’t? Do I just gravitate towards toxic mean-spirited people? Or am I just overthinking it and this just life...?

I’m just self reflecting and it just seems like every other girl flourishes socially. But I also get fake vibes from girls who are friends with everyone.

41,"So hi I’m 18 years old I’ve been sick for about 2 months with many different things since the beginning of March 

My family has arrived for a bit last week on Friday and I’ve been getting worse kinda tho I have been recently diagnosed with Gilbert Syndrome(Jil-Bear Syndrome) which I have pretty high Bilirubin levels but things have gotten worse or better and then gotten worse if gotten better ever since I had this congestion in the beginning of August and I was given mucinex DM which gave me my first Anxiety attack but right now I’ll tell you my symptoms.

1.Non painful throbbing throat like almost like an pill is stuck at the bottom of my throat it isn’t painful I haven’t coughed if I have it’s like small dry cough like once or twice doesn’t hurt my throat or chest at all and I won’t cough for another like 6 hours.

2.i did have trouble breathing for a bit but it got calmed down once my anxiety went away 

3.for about an hour I think when I woke up one morning like yesterday I had like constant shaking with chills but the shaking stopped once I calmed down really

4.i had an 99.9 fever the night before for like 30 mins really after about 35 mins I checked my temp again and it went down to 97.7 which is the normal temp for me and I didn’t take medicine to chime it down either it went away on itself 

5.for about an full day and almost night my shoulders were so like sore or in pain but imma take a guess that  it was because of the tiredness and insomnia of the 1 hour of sleep each night but has gotten better since I just got an full 4 hours of sleep for once in the past 3 nights 

6.chest pains left and right but that is a symptom of Gilbert syndrome I do know that but it is also of COVID19 but it isn’t persistent at all it comes and goes and it isn’t bad.

7.headaches I have been having headaches like up like my nasal and like behind my eye and it goes up to my ear but I’ve felt this before when I have sinuses and I do have like terrible sinuses so. And I’ve had poor concentration to poor memory which btw are all symptoms of Gilbert syndrome and fatigue 

8.no appetite slightly. Recently I’ve had not much appetite the past few days really but today is the best day I’ve actually eaten. From a breakfast to lunch to dinner which usually with my diet is usually just maybe lunch some snacks and small meal dinner 

So I did go to get tested about an week ago now I think or an week and a half cuz I felt like I had mono or was told I have it or sounds like it the more research we went into it. And when they brought the test out I was telling the doctor my symptoms and my old past medical conditions but I noticed the whole time he looked at like where I scratched on my arms and my eyes a bit and he said “have you gotten blood work done recently? You may have low bilirubin levels your eyes are a bit yellow and seems like you have a yellow tone in your skin the places you scratch” and yeah so I did have my mom get gloves and check my throat for anything cuz she is a health worker but was fine nothing swollen or red or white dots. So but these are my symptoms tho I have been getting a bit better I’m just a bit malnourished a bit and having lack of sleep but it would nice for someone to help answer this if they read all this.",06May2020,1

50,"So my period cramps are extremely painful. It leaves me bed-ridden and just about crippled for the first couple days. So recently, my period started, but I became very very nauseous the first two days so far, which I know is a common symptom for most women, but it's never happened to me before which has gotten me worried.

Whenever I've thrown up in the past, my body starts to uncontrollably shake, which was a sign that there was no escaping that I was for sure going to throw up. I was awake all night last night from pain and feeling so sick and shaking uncontrollably again, and I was thinking I was going to throw up but I never did. I felt nauseous again today, but it wasnt as bad as last night, but still really bad. It has been absolute hell.

Is this a sign of something more serious if I've never felt nauseous during my period before? Or am I just overreacting? Could it be a mixture of anxiety/stress problems around my period?

52,"Whenever I’m hanging out with my dad and some of his friends I’m fine for the beginning of it, but as the night continues I become more and more tired of talking and just start to feel shitty and kinda listen instead of talking. Then when I’m 2 hours past ready to go he’s in the middle of a long ass story that I’ve heard a dozen times and I start becoming sick, sort of... whenever I don’t wanna do something I start thinking about being sick or being in a state where they decide it’s better to get me home. After only 10 or so minutes I start getting stomach cramps, and feeling like I have to pass gas and then from there it progresses to me having to shit and after that feeling like I’m going to throw up. And at the time I was 24 hours with out sleep and we were at this persons house for hours already, so I’m dozing in and out while feeling a slow pulse of feeling fine and then having to throw up (by this time I don’t really have to shit anymore). So after I start feeling like vomiting my dads says alright I’ll bring you home. Literally right after he said that I was about to throw up but then it went away and turned into a shit. So me and my dad start heading to the car and realize there’s a flat tire so we spend like at least 30 more minutes sitting outside pumping air into the tire, which only got to 15 PSI. After that shit show we finally got on the road home and I’m feeling like shit the whole ride and right as we’re about to pull up to my house I start wondering if my body was unconsciously making me sick to get out of situations I don’t like. 
After we park I feel relief in my stomach, but it wasn’t gone completely so I go inside and lay on my bed and after a while the feeling just kinda faded but it was never as bad as it was in the car or at my dads friends house.

 Kinda weird cause I’ve felt this exact feeling before during the summer for a month straight of the cramps and shitting and feeling a slow pulse of having to throw up so it wasn’t anything I’ve never felt this before it’s just it’s unusual for it to come and go away that quick especially for me I never get sick so when I actually do catch something it’s not small or short it’s big and long and fucking sucks.

My past doesn’t bother me personally, but I live in horrible and constant fear of people I care about finding out from someone else.

61,"In my feels right now so I wanted to write and get it off my chest. Not really expecting a response.

I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn’t fall back asleep. My neighbor is playing loud music.

I thought I was missing people but I’m really also missing a feeling. 

I miss the feeling of being with a bunch of family members during a holiday or in a dorm room full of your friends from university. 

That feeling that you are having fun and are safe. I love in a big city and my partner works during the day and I often try to recreate this feeling in my home. I have you get brothers and a happy memory that I have of them is when I visited them ( they live in a different state) and in the morning when we woke up we would have a smoke and watch funny things on YouTube /listen to music. We would joke around while doing this and it was fun. 

My mom and both my grandmothers died in the same week in 2017 and since then my family hasn’t been as close with me. They are all off doing their own things. 

Anyway I was mentioning how I realized that I attempt to recreate that fun/happy/together feeling on my own in my house but it doesn’t feel the same

I wake up and smoke, drink an energy drink and feel awesome. I have all this creativity and ready to start the day. I begin working from home and play funny YouTube videos/documentaries/music in the background and feel energized (from the drink lol) and happy for a while. I get up, do chores , get dressed and focus on an “errand” or task for that day. Usually I have finished that errand by the afternoon , I do some exercise and then it starts to go downhill from there as far as my mood...

By that point I know that I have several hours until my partner returns home and even though I am always counting my blessings and trying to stay productive I get to a point in the day where I feel lonely.

In the evening my partner returns and we turn on the tv or have dinner but I know they are tired from their day and it’s more of them unwinding than the happy gathering type feeling that I crave . 

A text from someone with a funny meme, a friend stopping by with pizza and staying to hang out and talk, watching movies and talking shit are all things I miss. 

And no matter how many energy drinks, blunts and funny videos/music I watch I just can’t get that hype happy safe surrounded feeling again.",06May2020,1

68,"My girlfriend and I have been going out for just over a year. Unfortunately we even spent our 1 year anniversary away from each other because of the quarantine. 


We met at work. Right away I was attracted to her. We started talking and after a little bit I asked her on a date. It was one of the best days of our life. The next date I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend. 


Over the next few months, we fell for each other hard. I went away for a few days and she dropped my off at the airport. The entire time I felt like crying and finally broke down right before I went through security. We both cried together and confessed how much we loved each other. 

The thought of being away from her for a few days made me so depressed. We texted all day and the day I came back, she ran into my arms and embraced me. 

Since the quarantine, it’s been almost two months since I’ve seen her. We still text everyday, but at the time of the night, I feel so sad because I can’t see her and I just wanna hold her again.

I wanna look her in the eyes and tell her how beautiful she is. I wanna feel her next to me and have all my problems vanish away. I want her to hear her voice until she runs out of words to say.

She comes home and I'm watching a show on netflix in Germany cause it was the kinda show it liked and she goes ""You understand this?"" and I go ""Yea"" she goes ""No you don't"" I insisted I did. She asked me to turn around, listen, and translate.

Wow today's world. I refuse to call it the new normal. It makes me sad see the way it's affecting everybody. Everything I read everything I watch everybody I talk to have conflicting views. It's Everybody else's fault the red or the blue or the black or the white. Conspiracy theories. And I don't disagree I just don't know what's real anymore.

I've read all your stories and its changing People. Couples are fighting extreme amount. Or maybe it's just brought up feelings that have been there all along anger and resentment. Domestic violence and people separating have gone up since the quarantine started. Best friends for years. now quarreling and ghosting each other. And there doesn't seem to be an end to it.

Drug use has gone up in both adults and children. Alcohol is included in drugs. An alarming rate of teen depression and Suicide. You can't even have a simple conversation or have your own opinion without people berading and attacking you. Call Mia libtard or commie or another one calling me all right wing conspiracy theorist.

Women being shamed for their bodies. I believe slut shaming is the term. The Rise in men becoming addicted to pornography. And masturbation. Twitter not even having normal sex with their wives or girlfriends anymore.  Making their wives feel like less than. Which makes them Target other women. Hence the slut shaming.

You can't even get a decent web search without it being censored on the Internet. News stations and social media telling us what opinions and music we can watch and listen to.. Even the doctors vary in there diagnosis of this pandemic. This plague. It's rotting our society it's plotting one against each other and it's driving us into the future depression and oppression. Can I take years to recover.

So go ahead slam me into the ground with your opinions. Tell me I'm crazy. Tell me whose fault it is. Laugh at me if you want. I'm just observing through a microscope watching waiting to see what's going to happen. It's going to be very slow and painful for a lot of us. I wish you all the best in your decisions. Whether you decide to stay in or decide to go out and live your life again. One more thing this has been building 4 years it is just now coming full circle.

76,"a couple of my friends have been really annoying me. they’ve been distant and weird and i have no idea what’s happening. and of course, this is all happening in a group chat because of quarantine. because the internet is the best place to communicate.

i want to argue with them, is the problem. i’ve never gotten so mad at their dismissive shit till now. 

i had to go to the hospital. because i had been vomiting every other day for a week straight and i could not, for the life of me, hold in fluids. it was horrible. i was terrified to go into the ER during a fucking pandemic and i was freaking out and one of my friends said i needed to calm down. i have a lot of medical trauma and i just HATED being told to calm down. it reminded me of how dismissive my parents could get growing up. illnesses like these trigger some mental stuff, too. i have always been underweight. not being able eat consistently for a week really took it’s toll physically, i looked pretty gross. 

i had to get an iv and a strong anti nausea medicine, i was so scared though because in the hospital right now, they don’t allow family with you. and in this stupid group chat where i was freaking out about somehow getting coronavirus from either my essential worker dad or my irresponsible mother. it was pretty terrifying. and they were just like “i need you to calm down.” oh you NEED me to do something right now? no, i need you to be my friend. i’m scared right now. 

it’s been a week, i  finally recovered from whatever that illness was, all my tests were normal and i was negative for covid-19. despite recovering from it, i have not recovered from this interaction. i don’t know why i feel so vindictive right now. i almost posted a thread of “vague tweets” about the situation and then was like wait, no, i’m not this person? why was my initial instinct to antagonize the situation? 

i just feel so talked down to. and for a long time things have been painfully distant between all of us. i know there’s another group chat where i’m the only one not in it. this sounds like petty teenager shit, and we’re all in our fucking twenties! i hate this new world of all tech communication, it’s honestly ghastly. but i also realize that the burden may be on me to approach them. ugh!!!!",06May2020,1

88,"So let's take this back to the begining. When I was in my mum's womb, the umbilical cord was wrapped round my neck, I was choking and didn't really get much food in there. On top of being 4 or 6 weeks premature (can't remember which) when I came out of there, I weighed less than a bag of sugar and someone could hold me in the palm of their hand (not hands) hand.

My heart actually stopped beating for a while (I can't remember how long for) I think only a few minutes or maybe less.

I was put on life support and put in an incubator soon after. During that time, the doctor's were chatting instead of focusing on me. Then as my dad rushed in to check on me, he said I was covered in blood and in a way forced the doctors to take it seriously. 

Later down the line, I jumped out my cott and broke my arm. Few months later, I burnt that very same arm with extremely hot coffee which just came out of the kettle. It went all over me but just managed to effect that arm. 

A few years later I almost drowned.....TWICE!! One was in the sea while a life guard just casually walking back and fourth right near Infront of me. My mum had my brother with her but she had to leave him there trying to run after for me (Lucky our nan was just by the sea and quickly was there to look after my brother while my mum ran to save me) Both of these times I was swallowing water (must have been thirsty 😁) either way my sister and my dad were in the lazy river sort of and decided to come back the long way (if they went the short way, I probably would have died) so since they went the long way, they saw me and my dad quickly picked me up.

The second time in the same holiday. I was in the pool, I was holding onto the side and went to the deep end. I went closer to the middle and started drowning (lucky my dad came out and grabbed me) he put me on the sun bed as I was coughing out some water.

Jeez, as I'm writing this I really appreciate how things work out. And my dad saved me from death three times out of all these. Oh yeah, there's more.

After that. A few years later me, my brother and mum were almost at primary school when this lady on her phone speeds into the side of the car (not a lot of speed) but enough to cause whiplash and back problems somewhere down the line.

Quite a few years later  I landed on my tailbone on solid concrete (which if it shattered, could have paralyzed me)



This post is to say, no matter what you're going through or have been through. Someone always had or will have it worse, including what's happened to me.

91,"I went on a drive last night to get out of the house. Was cruising along the coast overlooking the ocean. When I pulled up to a red light, the car next to me rolled down its windows. The driver was screaming at me at the top of his lungs. He was a scary looking fellow. I didn't roll down my window. He looked nuts and I had never seen him before. I continued driving. He came behind me and started to flash his lights non-stop. I tried to ignore it and kept driving. He wouldn't stop. This continued for five miles. I didn't know what to do. I decided I needed to try to lose him. At one point I thought I lost him, and felt relieved. Then, he was back. He drove in front of me and slammed his brakes. I changed lanes, continued driving, and called the police. I had no idea what this guy wanted but I was not ready to have a chat with him alongside the freeway (or anywhere). I told them where I was driving and where I was headed. There was a patrol on the freeway in my path and they asked me to turn on my hazards so they could identify me. I got into the right-hand lane, turned on the hazard lights, and drove really slowly. This guy did the same. What eventually happened was I was basically parked on the freeway, hazards on. The guy was a few feet ahead of me and did the same. Then he started to reverse. Was really hoping at this point patrol would find us. Or was hoping he would exit his car so I could really get away. Well, I think he figured out that cops are on the way. He drove away slowly and merged onto a different freeway. Cops were really nice and once I told them what happened they said they'll escort me home just to be safe. They said they've seen lots of cases of people acting very strangely and this isn't the first. This was a very weird case of road rage. It went on for nearly 30 miles.

96,"Right, so let's start off by making it quite clear how I feel about my partner. I love her. I think she's great. And she loves me too, I'm quite sure of it. So the idea of my problem being an absence of love or the presence of emotionally abusive behavior I think is out of the question. The last few months have just been a little weird. Let me explain...

I met my partner a little over a year and a half ago. She was a regular where I was bartending and was always very kind and almost always brought a book. An avid reader myself, I gave her what I thought would be a book she'd enjoy, only to discover she's read it before and it was one of her favorites. Still, she appreciated the gesture so much that she gave me a book on her next visit with a note inside including her phone number in an effort to ask me out. After letting her know I was actually already in a relationship, I thanked her for such a sweet gesture and gave her my phone number encouraging her to reach out if she was interested in being ""just friends"". Yada yada yada months later I am single again and after a couple of months of healing and avoiding the topic, I ask her out to lunch and we've been together a little over a year now.

Things are going well overall. We've had some challenges, a few arguments, and conflicts here and there...but just like any couple. And we've pushed through and stayed together all the same.

It wasn't really until yesterday I started to analyze things. Overanalyze, mind you...but still.

It was around New Years we just got back from a trip I had planned/paid for out to a cottage on an island off the coast. Romantic little gesture and a fun time I hope. We make it back after a few days and a long drive and are about to attend her friend's party that same evening and she says ""You're not fun to be around when your're not 100%"" which in her defense is true, I'm more quiet when I'm tired and feel a little uncomfortable and it's not like I want to be a buzzkill. Still, it stung a little so I let her know and she apologized and we moved on. No problem.

Valentine's Day and have another nice little evening planned and she gets me a card that says some very sweet things and at the bottom ""I could live without you"" and then a little after ""BUT I'd prefer not to"" which gives me a good laugh. After all, a little funny given how so many Valentine's Day cards read stuff like ""I couldn't live without you"" which is of course, ridiculous. I mean, if I were to die tomorrow or something, I'd sincerely hope she'd not only keep on living but get over me and forget all about us as quickly as she can. So the message was more funny that anything and I still give her grief to tease her at times. Just surprising.

Our anniversary is just a couple weeks after that and I have tickets to take us to a 'speakeasy' type bar at the height of a historic building overlooking the city. And it's fun, and she likes it, and we have a wonderful evening reflecting on us and also talking about the future. I notice I guess she started a lot of sentences with ""If we're still together in blablabla years...."" and stuff like that. Which is fair. Loads of couples date 1 Year+ and don't make it. I guess I just thought it was strange to say on an anniversary but I get it.

Last weekend we're doing a brief visit to check in on her folks and on the car ride I talk to her about what moving in together would be like. We had sort of talked about it in passing before and last month she had mentioned getting sick of her roommates and humoring herself by looking at solo apartments. Anyways, she seemed excited by the idea but didn't actually seem into. Loads of problems, which is fair. Like ""We'd need a bigger bed than my queen"", ""I feel like we'd need separate rooms so we could both have our own space"", ""The dog needs another dog to play with and that kind of place may be difficult to find"", ""It'd be too expensive"". All valid arguments but whenever I propose a counterargument she's just not feeling it. Because those places may or may not exist but we wouldn't know unless we looked into them. But hey, I keep that part to myself. After all, she may just be uncomfortable with moving in together and is looking at a gentle way of putting it off. I get it. I guess I was just a little bummed she didn't want to sit down and just see what's out there. But I get it.

And yesterday. I came over to help her out with some deliveries. She had sold a ton of honey online for charity and needed to deliver them. So I offer to deliver the honey and after driving around the city we hang out at her place with the roomies and she talks about a phone call with her close friend and I asked how she was doing. She catches me up and her friend and also mentions she had asked about me and proceeds to tell me something like ""She asked me if I thought you were still the one which I was surprised by because I hadn't remember saying that to her but she mentioned I had said it last year or something. Anyway, I told her I wasn't 100% sure because, well I've been wrong before haha! I'm just being honest"" And that's 100% fair. I mean, I wasn't planning on proposing yesterday or anything. It's ok to not be sure about things right now. Nothing wrong with that. I guess I was a little taken back...like, why tell me that? If we had been talking about marriage earlier I guess it'd make sense but it was sort of out of the blue. And while true and honest, it seems like a weird thing to single out.

Maybe I'm overthinking things but over the past few months I sort of feel like she doesn't want to be with me anymore. Not that she doesn't love me or anything! But I feel like she thinks she's trapped. She's in this place where she's more or less content, but also unsatisfied with us. And without thinking, small stuff like this comes out to voice her displeasure.",06May2020,1

98,"I joined Tumblr back in 2013 and it helped me quite a bit throughout my life. 

It helped me find my sexuality, become way more open-minded about things like race and sex considering where I live, and see that people are people and are allowed to enjoy things I don't. I become a much better person talking and reading about other people's experiences and gained a lot more empathy as well. 

And then Tumblr changed...a lot...and not for the better. 

I think they are called Social Justice Warriors, but they took over in a bad way, and there is so much misinformation being spread that nobody fact checks! At all! It's just a terrible place where you are not allowed to make mistakes and the users will go to your blog and go all the way to your past to find something problematic to use against you. As if you are not allowed to change and grow from what you once thought??! 

My therapist was the one to actually tell me to not use Tumblr as much because it was having such a negative impact on my mental health. I'm an art and anime blog, and I still feel nervous to post anything in case I start getting death threats from people who disagree with my opinion and don't know how to just avoid the things they don't like. 

And the platform of Tumblr is just a mess as well. Navigating and sending messages is awful. 

I almost wish there was a subreddit just for complaining about Tumblr so I can get more of this off my chest haha. 

I'm starting to go to Reddit more, I heard mixed reviews about it but I think it's already leagues above what Tumblr has become.",06May2020,1
99,"Hello users of reddit. I got bored of watching reddit videos on youtube and Ive decided to jump on the band wagon.

Im a 20M from South Africa and I have traveled around the world with many many stories to tell that I would love to share, from dark times between family and relationships, to scary ex girlfriend stories and tons of advice from my perspective (regardless of the fact I am still young.)

But I will keep this story to something with a bit of a happy ending. 

This story starts with the begging of what has become one of the weirdest, hardest and most annoying years of my life. 2020. To kick start the story with all the bad and the sad, we have to go back a few months into September of last year. I recently returned to my home country of South Africa after living with my grandparents who retired to Spain to finish my final year of High School (Matric). I had met an absolutely amazing (or so I thought) girl the same age as myself who was living across the country but in the same online school I was in. Amazing right! Now how the school works here is that the begging of the school year starts in January and ends in November (for Matric) and I had to be in person to write my finals. So I had made a plan for my girlfriend now at this stage (we will just call her E) to come stay with me so that at least she has a place closer to the venue we have to write our exams at. Everything was absolutely beautiful, some of my best memories to date come from this time, but peace in my little ball of happiness wasn’t going to be long lasting. Jump forward to the start of December, all our exams are finally done and now it is time to find something to do, in terms of work, to fill up the time while E and I saved money to help her come back with me to Spain.

Sounds beautiful and wonderful right? 

But luck would not be on our side, we were both selling what we had, bar the necessities to make up the money for her British Passport and air ticket. Keep in mind, My grandparents were covering all the expenses for me. But E and I were left no other choice to move across the province (state) in hopes of finding work. We eventually found a waitering job together and although it was not the best pay, It was something more than we thought we would get. Fantastic! Life was picking up and E and I were busy looking towards the future, money in hand for her passport and papers, I had made a few calls to some of my absolute best friends (If you guys ever see this, thank you again for the millionth time) on getting the cash together for her air ticket. On Christmas day, I had saved up some extra cash and bought her an amazing Christmas/birthday present as well as an engagement ring which she happily said yes to marring me.

Then everything that could go wrong, went wrong. And this is where the story turns bad and still pains me today, and will for a very long time. 

We were staying with E’s dad, and his work had decided not to renew his contract due to an illegal dealing between the company and my “beloved” government that was being highly scrutinised (and still is! Google South African State Capture to understand more of this.) E and I decided to use the money we had put together to help her dad, especially for housing us and taking care of us as he had for the past month without asking for anything in return (I always cleaned the house in my free time because 1. I like a clean home. 2. Its the right thing to do.) even though we did this, we still had enough money saved up to at least get the passport and papers, with a portion to the air ticket. We just had to work a bit longer before we could leave, which we had planned to leave at the end of January, but pushed it back to end of February. No big deal, I would still make it to the start of University in Spain, so life goes on. 

January 1st. The start of the new year, and the beginning of the end for me. I had gotten news that my grandmother (64F) was in hospital with GBS- Guillain-Barré syndrome. Not good but not the worst thing possible, only 4-7% death rate. Few days pass and everything seems to be okay and then I woke up one morning at 5 am from a call from my Grandfather that my gran had passed away. This was the 5th of January, I was absolutely devastated, for the first time in 4 years, I spoke to my mother to break her the news. I didn’t go to work that day, and E came home that night in tears that not only was she heartbroken but our work shifts were cut in half and the restaurant was moving to a new location which meant less funds coming in, stress, panic, heartbreak and depression was in the air. Not even a day later I got a call from a now ex friend (19M) that he had a massive fall out with his father and was now homeless. I did what any person should do, I sacrificed my return home to Spain to help my friend out in need. I drove the 2 hours to fetch him, loaded his things up and drove back to the house at 9pm in the evening. 

Things were dire and stress was high and I was struggling to process and cope with everything that happened in such a short amount of time. But my gran was looking down at me saying everything is going to be okay and that I will find my path again, and I will be happy once more. 1 week after the funeral and helping my friend out, it was the last day at work at the old location and there was this small, stray grey kitten who came up to me (we had seen her millions of times but she was always running away and hiding out of site) and allowed me to give her some love. I ended up using the last bit of change in my pocket to buy her some food, get her to the vet and everything else in between and I adopted her the same day. Her name is Minx, (or as I called her, Minxie) and she is beautiful, she is soft, fluffy and has mancoon somewhere in her genes, small cat, lots of fur. I had some sort of happiness back but I was still not myself, I wasn’t social at home or work and I just spent a lot of my time in my own space drowning out the world with music. Things between E and I were a bit rough and I would fight with her (small, stupid fights but fights nonetheless). I slowly regained myself to a good enough point to get involved again with people near the end of January and things were coming alright once again. I started looking for new work and found some really amazing jobs, E was looking as well and we started looking at maybe moving to the coast and getting our own place. 

This return to happiness became short lived, my friend, 19M started talking about me behind my back and things became misunderstood between E, her father and myself. 19M also spoke about E behind her back to me and that really ticked me off. But E had become a little less understanding of what I was going through and would only look at things in the perspective of “if we cant do it now, we wont do it all” to everything. House, car, going out on a date. You name it. And I became weary. What I did is not cool, and I strongly suggest no one ever do it, don’t make the same mistakes and myself. I went through E’s phone and found out first hand that I was being played at the very start of our relationship. Which cut me so deep that I confronted her for the truth, not once but three times before I came clean. She was not too happy with me because of that, but we pushed on, agreeing that it was stupid and it belongs in the past as we had both been living together for quite some time and there was no connections between her and this other guy. 

Then just before Valentines day, something changed. She changed completely and just didn’t want to be together anymore. Looking back at it, I wasn’t the best of people to be around but I wasn’t the worst, but the stress of everything had gotten to her far worse than it did to me. It wasn’t my first rodeo dealing with massive life changing situations. E is insanely book smart but not nearly as street smart and people smart as me. I am a smart guy and I would challenge her knowledge and win 70% of the time, but I had the life experiences she didn’t even know existed. This ultimately drove a wedge that would never be fixed between us. We were both back and forth for 2 weeks on getting back together, we had jobs lined up and everything and it was looking good again, ready to rekindle the love and take it slow. Then my friend 19M backstabbed me in a way I will never forget. He twisted the truth of my life against me and the day after valentines day, after an amazing evening that I had personally planed, cooked, cleaned and everything else in-between. She woke up, came to me (as we were sharing a room at this point) and told me no, she’s not going through it again with me. 

I made the decision to leave back for where I had come from and was staying with my other set of grandparents. In the week that I got back, I was accused of so much, even though I proved every single accusation wrong, I was discarded and she removed me from her life leaving on last message for me. (Edited due to language) You can bugger off, never message me again as I do not want you in my life and Minx is my cat and she will never belong to you again. I was Blocked before I could even say a word. Last I heard she moved to the coast to her mom and left Minx with her dad who is being evicted as soon as the national lockdown ends in the country. He will not let me look after Minx, I already tried, multiple times. 

But the good news comes in. In that exact same week, I found a job by accident on Facebook and with in 3 days I was hired into an amazing software company, with really good pay and amazing colleagues. I have been working remotely from home and I have started house hunting fir my own place to call home. My friends and the little bit of my family Im still close to are highly supportive and I end up spending most of my afternoons talking to all of them. I look back and I see all the lessons I have learnt, the growth in my own personality and the growth of how I see things and do things in my day to day life. I know where I made my mistakes and I work on them every single day, constantly growing into the person I know I am and can be. 

Im sorry that the story is so long, but I hope its a good read. I have shortened it extensively from the full story. So please fell free to ask questions if you want to hear more and let me know if you want me to throw in some life experiences and other stories as well. Thank you for your time and I hope that wherever you are reading this. I hope you are safe and doing okay in these trying times we are in, in this world we call home.",06May2020,2
100,"I'm sorry for the vent. I really just feel so lost and dont know where else to put this and I'm probably going to delete it at one point. 

I feel like a lost hope 

I feel so lonely. i crave love. but at the same time I'm so so afraid of it. I have a lot of trauma and a lot of insecurities and it's hard for me to love

and even harder for me to ""make love"". that is a whole different can of worms but again… it makes me fearful of relationships. and insecure. so so much. I crave love yet I reject it, and I post naked pictures of myself online for validation to make up for it.

I keep telling myself I should accept the fact that I will not have anybody. it's hard for me to accept. i want to reject that fact. i want to think that there is always somebody out there for everybody… but maybe I'm an exception

I know I have friends and family members I love. I truly do. I love them and they love me. But i want somebody who is ""mine"". and I am ""theirs.""  I want romantic love. I want somebody i can tell my deepest darkest secrets to. somebody i can cry into their shoulder all night and they'd be okay with that. somebody to fall asleep cuddling with at night. 

i just wish i wasn't way i was. i wish i was different so i could just have somebody. ",06May2020,1
101,"I (F37) have had a crush on an engaged coworker (M28) for several months. We have both flirted off and on with each other at different times. I had backed off and then *he* started displaying interest in me and ngl I reciprocated. It is obvious to everyone around us at work that we are into each other. Gossip is that we are hooking up even though nothing has actually happened. 

Thought I would get over my crush during the Covid separation and I did for a little while. When I saw him again this week though, it is obvious that we are both still very attracted to each other. It feels magnetic and involuntary. People have commented that it appears mutual, so I am not imagining it. I know this is wrong so please don't judge me, I already judge myself! 

Unfortunately, and I absolutely ***hate*** to admit this to myself, I think I have feelings for this person. It seems that what was initially sexual desire and tension has turned into something else by accident. I hate feeling vulnerable but this guy drives me crazy as much as I wish he didn't. 

I know it is unrealistic to expect anything from him given the fact he is engaged. We can't talk at work because people are watching us. He hasn't contacted me outside of work though so I feel fucked up about it. Seems like neither of us want to be the ""bad guy"" and initiate something outside of work. I am not used to dealing with feelings.

Could anyone else share their experience of getting unexpected feelings for someone who is attached and how they dealt with it and how they got over it. I hate feeling vulnerable but I just can't deny I am feeling something beyond sexual attraction for this guy, help!!!!!",06May2020,1

103,"Hey guys. I'm trying to improve my social skills and external confidence. I really need some perspectives about it.

I can be very nervous and self-doubting when talking to others. I worry a lot about how people will take it. I envy people who are accepted by everyone.

I read this book called Models by Mark Manson. He puts forward this concept of 'Non-neediness'. He describes needy people as ones who place others opinion of them above their own opinion of themselves. 

The central point thrust, then, is on being your self and being vulnerable in expressing things that may be received well. He categorically says that you can run around the idea, read a lot of material on this, but until you choose to do the vulnerable thing, you will not make real progress. He means vulnerable in 'putting-my-neck-out-on-the-line-way', not in the weak way.

These ideas form my new opinions. Do you think it's correct? I wonder if there are some major blind spots to this approach. I'd love to get some external feedback. Thank you guys.",06May2020,1
104,"I've just ended things with my fiance, the woman I thought was my soulmate. She's done a lot heinous shit, and I mean heinous, but today she lied to me for the last time. 

We were supposed to hang out after I got off this morning but I was exhausted after my shift last night and didn't feel like waiting for the two hours it would take her to get to where I was. 

I gave her money for gas and kratom. She's, I thought recovering, drug addict. Shes supposed to send me reciepts when ever I give her money. She s nt me the reciept for the gas but ended up needing more money for the kratom. While I was waiting for the reciept I got a call from her mom. Her mom asked me if she was still with me. 

Her mom goes on to ask, ""Didn't I talk to you earlier?"" 

So. I call my fiance, trying to get to the bottom of this. I know what's happened though. 

She never answers. 

So I leave her a voice mail and a few texts that boil down to ""this is the last time we will ever talk. I hope the high was worth it."" 

And I blocked her.

I feel like my heart is being ripped out of my chest. She's the first person I ever loved. I didn't even think I was capable of this depth of feeling before and now it just hurts. 

Especially that I'm now coming to realize that she only ever kept me around for money and for sympathy. 

The woman is made of lies and poison and I know I'm better off with out her in my life but God I wish it didn't hurt so damn much.",06May2020,1

111,"Guys, for many, many years I have had an unfulfilled artistic, and creative dream - I feel a ""need"" to share many emotions, feelings, experiences that have been accumulated in me for a long time. (23M here). I came up with an idea to create a book with interviews with ""ordinary"" people - with representatives of different generations, nations, orientations, with different views, who are not **""famous""** \- just ordinary, average people, that you could pass by on the street, make friends in a pub; with people, who are struggling with the problems of today's world on a daily basis.   


I don't want to create something that would be a „remedy” for ubiquitous problems, but I’d like people to be able to reach for this book to read something unidealized, to see that they are not alone with many problems, to identify themselves with a given hero (I would like there to be \~20 guests in the book) - to get a materialized particle of someone's life in a standardized edition.  


What do you think about this? Do you think it’s an interesting idea or rather nothing special? What to remember, what to include? If it sounds pathetic or boring, let me know, I'll be very grateful for any feedback.

125,"I (25) married young. I married someone much older than me (43). I didn’t know I was being manipulated every step of the way but here I am, with the unfortunate enlightenment that every choice I made so far wasn’t really mine. When you date or marry someone older and you’re fresh out of college, they’ve got their shit figured out miles beyond where you are, so you kinda just assimilate to their lives/lifestyle. You move into their house because they’re a homeowner, and all you’ve got is a shitty one BR apartment. You let them give you professional advice because you work in the same field and, hey—they’ve been doing it way longer so they know better right? You’re expected to act years beyond your time to keep up. You feel really special for a while, like you’ve been given a hand up by someone who loves you because they say they love you. You feel special til they know they’ve got you. 

Then you’re trapped. 
Or in my case, quite literally because of the quarantine. Slowly over the last year I’ve started to realize the extent of the manipulation which is too much to ever write. I’ve always been belittled. I’ve always been in situations engineered to make me insecure. I’ve always had it twisted and thrown back in my face tenfold if I brought up my feelings. I’ve always been ignored if I cry. I always feel guilty or sorry, even if I don’t know why. At the beginning of the quarantine it felt like “whatever, we’re married so I’m trapped with him anyway”. Today I raised a concern about how much time he spent talking to a coworker (did I mention we work together?). In my defense, it’s several hours of everyday for the last few months and she has nothing to do with our department. She is simply someone paid by the same company. I didn’t understand why he needed to talk to her at all let alone with such frequency, and with the same charm I used to get myself before I was locked in. When I mentioned it, I was verbally battered and told I “don’t know shit” and that it’s “none of your business”. Gaslit for the billionth time when I was told that what I was observing wasn’t even real. Not only was I invalidated, but the response gave me more reason to worry. I want to say I’ve been invalidated &amp; gaslit for the last time but I know that’s not true despite how adamantly I feel like putting my foot down. Lots of help that’s been in the past (/s).

Flash forward a few days and my sister is calling me saying she's taking my mom to the hospital, few days later she's on a vent. Today I got a call from the hospital, they have nothing more then can do, they allow one vister so my sister is going. Kinda peeved that my sister jumped on the one spot but her and mom have a lot more issues and i guess my sister wants to apoligze to her.  I'm a fucking mess right now and i don't know how im gonna deal with this. I've always been a mommas boy, i'm not ready to lose my mom. My wife is with me and shes being suipportive but I feel strange crying in front of her.  I'm just putting around my house going from crying to just moping. Thinking of taking some weed to make this a little easier for me. I don't have a question or anything in here, just thought typing things out would make me feel better.",06May2020,1

143,"For context, I'm only 28 years old. I'm not actually an ""old mom"". However, I work from home, I have a lot of plants, and I crochet... a lot! And, I'm out of shape so I leave most of the running around/playing up to my cooler half. Our daughter is 5 years old. 

I got a treadmill about 6 months ago, and used it for a solid 2 months. My s/o got my roller skates a year and a half ago. I used them once, busted my ass, and never tried again.. 

Anyway, we go on bike rides every single day. I walk, s/o rides a skate board, and daughter rides a bike. I'm always left behind and just feel like an old mom.

Well, friends! I got a bicycle yesterday! Man oh man, she's a beaut! I got to ride her yesterday and today with the family, and it was just so much fun. 

My s/o caught our daughter trying to ride *LIKE ME*, she also got on and off the bike *like me*. She thinks I'm really cool and she feels cool, too.

I finally feel like more than just a mom that works, cooks dinner, and crochets. Im one of the cool kids now &lt;3",06May2020,1
144,"Suicide is pointless if you're doing it to stop the pain.

The pain won't stop when you die.

It'll either go completely black or you'll be re-incarnated with a good chance of a worse off life than you had before.

Both more or less equally as bad as each other. You might as well just not kill yourself and live with what you have as painful as that may be.

There's a reason you can't escape your problems not even with death. 

You're supposed to *deal* with your problems not push them away.

145,"I still hate school at age 30. I’ve always hated school and I have no academic motivation. I’ll be finishing up my associates in the fall and my SO wants me to pursue a bachelors.

I’ve been struggling so much and getting extremely depressed with attending school for the past years( it’s taken me a long time to even finish my associate). I rather be working then going to school. 
I feel like I can’t do it anymore that I just want to give up but I know my SO would be really unhappy.

148,"Dear diary, 

A more positive day today think I finally took onboard my friends advice.

Managed to reconnect with one of my old work managers that I really used to get along with.

Every time I have been tempted to message her I go back and read over my friends messages.

Helps that people seem to be on my side not that I would ask them to pick sides but they are my friends and they agree she is being out of order to me.",06May2020,1

150,"Dear diary,

Took the first step towards cutting her off today by blocking her and restricting her access to me on instagram.

Kept myself going by rereading over my friends messages.

Opened up to one of my old managers about the situation today and he agreed she is out of order and called her some unfavourable names.

Even when we were civil she didn’t seem to get along well with my friends as one night when we all went out she was behind the bar and gave my friend a dirty look.

I feel that even if she did become my girlfriend I would have liked her to get along with my friends just a little bit she wouldn’t have to be best friends with them but just to treat them with respect.",06May2020,1

153,"I've(16) been trying to get my parents to take me to a therapist for a while now, about one and a half or maybe two years? Before the quarantine, at least. I believe there's something up with my mind and I'd like to talk with a professional to sort it out. I'd rather not go into detail, since this is online and I don't want to share with strangers. However, my parents keep insisting that I don't need it and what I'm going through is normal. I keep trying to tell them that normal doesn't mean okay. I need someone to talk to. They've tried once before, going somewhere nearby, but apparently I need a biological parent there with me, and my step mom isn't. My dad was at work, so we had to cancel. That was probably about 6-12 months ago (I'm not good with time), and ever since then they'd been putting it off. My dad may have been at work then, but its not like he's at work all the time. They don't seem like they think its important. My step mom said she was trying to get an appointment at the town next to ours, but never mentioned it if I didn't bring it up first. I understand that I won't be able to for a bit due to the quarantine, but I at least want to use this time to convince them.

TL;DR- How do I convince my parents that getting to see a therapist is important to me?",06May2020,1
154,"The guy went to school in Sweden and nobody knew who he was at the time. Allegedly he's really into videogames and playing them online (imagine killing the Supreme Leader in CoD) and I'm sure he was probably a relatively normal teenage guy. At least normal for the people he was surrounded by in his elite boarding school. He probably made some good friends in his youth. Imagine one of your good friends from high school turned out to be the next guy in line and he turns out to be just as bad. You have all these great memories of paling around with this guy who just years later turn out to be a monster committing various human rights violations. It must be really jarring for them.

157,"It's my own fault really, started 10 days before deadline. I didnt start from nothing, I had some reason done and general outline but no where near enough that I shouldve had done. I'm writing it all out now and jesus christ it SUCKS. I have 2 days left before deadline and theres no chance in hell of fixing everything. All I can do is double down and try to make it the best pile of shit I can.

All of my models are wrong, theres one model I really wanted to use in my analysis because the theory of it completely matches what I wanted to talk about. But I made a complete fuck up of it. The model is generally used for price analysis, every instance of it uses prices. But since my data only had quantity I used that instead. Honestly, a lot of the analysis still adds up, and none of the research I found stated anything about it needing to absolutely be used in price analysis. But still. 

That isn't the only thing, the whole paper is just fucked. I'm honestly just praying for a pass on it just so I can graduate. Honestly, I'll probably get a big fat zero on it.

I know, it's all my fault. Shouldve started way earlier. And I know theres nothing I can do about it now apart from finish what I have and submit it. But I just have no motivation to finish it now, just those thoughts of ""why bother, you're going to fail anyway"".

160,"I will be starting my senior year this fall. The past few years have gone very poorly grade-wise. The classroom environment is extremely overwhelming for me, and I have a lot of trouble focusing. Before we switched to an online curriculum, I was having daily meltdowns in school and I was on the verge of failing several classes. I used to fall down in the middle of the hallway and scream and pull my hair out because I felt so overwhelmed. Sometimes I ran out of class or even off campus because I couldn't take it and the urge to escape was too strong. Now that I'm working from home, I'm doing way better than I ever thought I could. 

I know I sound a little whiny, but I don't know if I can bring myself to go back next year.  I would rather do anything than go back, even if I have to take online courses for 12 hours a day or even if I have to drop out. I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm just being stubborn and immature, but I just don't know how I'll bring myself to do another year.",06May2020,1
