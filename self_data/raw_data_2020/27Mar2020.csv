0,"For weeks I've been working at a new job and I haven't been liking it, the benefits that my employer provides are nice but the clients I'm dealing with are extremely harsh. When an issue gets to me it's often because it's been worked on by 4 different people and no one can figure it out, so when I talk to the client they often get hostile over the fact that ""it's just another person who has no fucking idea"". I've raised this to my boss and suggested that if after an hour we don't have a solution we escalate it to the next person up.

I feel like I'm constantly failing people outside of work, I make so many promises and I'm always trying to go so far above and beyond what they expect of me. I'm almost addicted to making people happy no matter the price, I'd take friends to events or pay for dinner all of my own volition because I don't care about money. 

But it feels like I've never done enough, I just want to be loved, I want that feeling of acceptance, to know that I've done the hardest part and that now I can fall down and have a rock to sit on, someone's shoulder to cry on and know that they'll always be there.

I've talked to my doctor about these feelings and he gave me the standard ""Keep on your meds, and come to us if you're really bad"" (I was already really bad, how much worse could I get?). I stayed composed, and told him my meds would make me chuck up even in small doses, and that I wouldn't take them anymore if I couldn't try out something different or get tested. Literally trying to claw for any chance of life at this point. Session ended.

Fast forward a few days.

I couldn't take it anymore, I had an outburst this past Sunday at my only friends, and raged, I said things that weren't true, I said they were using me and that once the well went dry they'd leave me forever. I don't know why but I looked at a message I was about to send, and my mind said ""do it, be hurtful, everyone has to know"", so I sent it to them, it was like a final ""I hate you"".

(Skip this next two paragraphs for the squamish)

I went outside, hugged my dog, I gave her the biggest kiss on her forehead and said to her, let her know that everything was going to be alright. She looked at me and I could see she couldn't quite understand the mood I was presenting, we weren't going for a walk or giving her belly rubs, she'd keep trying to put her paw out and get me to shake it like we always do but I just didn't reciprocate. I got in my car with all my Antideps, a 6 pack of Heineken, went to the supermarket and bought 100 paracetamol tablets, chemist warehouse and bought some sleeping pills over the counter (I said I was starting a late shift job and needed assistance getting my sleep cycle fixed). Drove out to nowhere, found a nice tree to sit under, threw my phone and keys away, and then downed it all. I started getting sick, passed out. ""Yes, relief"" I thought. Woke back up absolutely covered and realising I've made a terrible mistake. I reached and chucked up whatever I could to lessen the effects, shoving my hand to the back of my throat and beating my head against the ground.

Fumbled around trying to find my keys and phone, Got in my car and drove to the hospital 25 mins away. Covered in tears and yuck. I thought about my friends and family and prayed everything would be alright. I got there and they gave me all these things to make me chuck up anything I had left in my stomach, it was some of the worst pain I'd ever been through.

I went home, no one was any the wiser as to what happened, went to bed but couldn't sleep. I woke up, worked the next morning, cried a lot, tried to figure out where I stood with my friends, I realised I made a terrible mistake.

I talked to my doc, told him what happened and said I wanted to be reassessed, to get a new psychiatrist who could understand what I was saying too (he spoke poor English, I would repeat myself 3 or 4 times for every question), I wouldn't keep taking the same meds if they made me sick and stop thinking. I was told that due to what has happened that they'd put me in priority for a consultation with a new psychiatrist. Yay.

24 hours later and it seems like neither of my friends ever want to see me again, I was trying to tell them that the person on Sunday who said those things wasn't me, it wasn't the version of me who want to see people happy and appreciates them like the huge part of my life they are. 

My meeting with Headspace which was supposed to be today has been pushed back to the middle/end of next month, the consultant over the phone said that they prioritise younger people first, and that once I turn 26 (in 3 months), I won't be able to receive any support from them. Why though, the one time I'm asking for help as badly as I need it and I feel like I'm talking to a robot bound by rules and without a hint of kindness. I tried calling other psychiatry offices but no one is able to make time for me even next week, I called my old chiatrist and they're only open for three hours today. Why man. Why. Do I need to be bleeding out to even have a conservation. Do I need to hold my body hostage?

I'm heartbroken, why did I come back to be faced with this, I thought things were going to get better, I kept going on after everything that happened because I thought I could rise up higher than that point. My mood is a rollercoaster, I don't want to do this, I want my friends, I hate my brain, I need a hug, I don't want to die but my body is shouting that I need to.

Please, if there's anything out there that can erase the last week of my life I need to know, I don't want any of this.",27Mar2020,1

I’ve been trying to understand who is eligible for the $1200 (or however amount) check. I’m a college student (20F), so I’m still claimed as a dependent on my single mother’s tax returns, and I quit my job right before the pandemic started in February. Before that I was working nearly full-time until I told them to cut my hours. I also haven’t filed my 2019 tax return yet.

28," 

I am writing this from a throaway account, as some of my family relatives know my reddit account.

I am here today to tell you the story of how my mother phisically and emotionally abused and pushed boundaries on me since I was aged 11 years old.

I was born the son to a single mother, who was born a daughter to a single mother as well. Throughout her childhood, my mother was subject to many forms of psychological manipulation, my grandmother would undergo to make sure she ""kept her kid on track"", tactics my grandmom would employ also with all of her partners to make sure she always got what she wanted, such as: pretending she was pregnant, use my mother as bait to get her own, being deviant and often nervous when confronted about her mischiefs and even pointing a gun to one of her partners, because he wanted to withdraw some of the allowance he paid her, in return for NOTHING AT ALL, just cause he was richer than her and wanted to help. I digress.

My mother had it a little better, in the first few years of my life, my father was not her partner, but he was present to me. He would show up every other day to take me to the park to the park, as his way of spending time with me.  
My father had come from a violent upbringing himself, he watched his mother run away from home, after being starved, beaten to a pulp, forbidden to work and almost burned across the face with an electric iron- she ran away to avoid the latter-, which is why it always dazzles me that he was the parent who tought me about love to others, love to the self, compassion, truth and unselfishness.  
My mother suffered a little less abuse, although she was throughoutly neglected by my grandad who left my grandma to build another family and never looked back again, until nearing his death bad, with a stroke at 40 years old. This left on my mom a strong mark of abandonment issues, sentimental issues, severe mood swings, severe anxiety, propensity for violence, either physical or psychological and a severe intransigency to the word ""no"". Whomever was in her life had to love her first, put her first, stand by her above all other and never say ""no"" to her emotional desires, even if they were alternated with severely alternated with borderline sociopathic behaviors.

Everytime she had an altercation with one of my family members she'd tell me all the possible dirty about them. If she was mad at me, she would do it with me to them. If either brought it up in any other time, she would dismiss it and say we had to put away our heartfeelings, even if she had severely hurt our image toward each other or even insulted us. She was always very good at dividing people in the family to tackle them in her own ways: if I went to my grandma's house in the years after we stopped living there, she would start assaulting me and telling me to go live there, since I loved her so much.  
If I went to my grandpa's I would have to listen for days about how he never really cared or fed me. I grew up being alienated from surrounding family and even my friends. There was greater initiative to split me from the world than to let me know it, and if or when I wanted to go to a friend's birthday or otherwise, I'd have to be careful because she might give me sime shit about how I was not wanted in other people's house's and about how I must stay where I belong.  
That means no camping, no sleepovers, no dates out (for quite a lot of time), just sitting besides her watching the movies she chose on the computer, that she monopolized and living life by her side.  
While I was watching my friends go out and live a little, have fun with each other, go to concerts, movies and each other's houses, my mom thought it was okay, to having a social life limited to her, my grandma's house, when they were okay and talking to some friend on facebook and otherwise media.

While this might seem very soft, I promise what follows isn't.  
When I was 11 years old, me and my mom, recently expelled from my grandma's house, went to live in a ghetto at a friend's of my mother. This was during the 2008 recession. At the time, I was in 7th grade and the first signs of vanity were starting to set in. I was almost a teenager, I wanted to blend in, very possibly stand out and while my mom wanted to opt to have me dressed with more conservative clothing (we slept in the same bed), I wanted some of the most flashy clothes I had- I'm not saying she was right nor wrong, it's her attitude that surprised me-, I woud wear boots with my jeans tucked in like my friends and tight denim jeans like them. To this I would wake up various mornings to my mom teasing and mocking me, telling my how much of a show of I was, that I was starting to look like a fagg\*t and if I ever responded to it, she would beat me up, with her hands, her feet, or whatever was available.

We eventually moved to a decent house in a nice suburb in the following months and, though we had little, things went well for a while: I turned 12, did well in school, made new friends and actually started having a ""gang"" for the first time in my life and I was dazzled about it, I had never been treated much like a person before, nevermind being treated like I was equal to others. I belonged, that was okay. In school, my teachers told me, I showed maturity in my reasoning, my skills and my writing, beyond all my colleagues and that they were eager to see what I'd become in the future. Yes I did misbehave sometimes, but I was no demon.

Somewhere along my 12th years, I started to want more and more to connect to others, to be part of the world outside, I had icons and passion and brains, simpathy for others, respect and sociability- as much as a 12 year old can have.  
On the other side, my mom didn't react to this very well. Once while I was 12, my mom wanted to take me to an amusement park in a day to come, but as I had already told my gang, I was going to be with them, since we didn't see each other for a while, I told her I preferred doing that. I know it mustn't be easy for a mother to see her child rather do something with someone else than be with her, however what she did about it, once summer vacation ended and school started still makes me cry.  
She would come home way after I was asleep and go through my notebooks to see if I had notes from my classes. If anything was missing, she'd wake me up with a beating, take she sheets away from my body abruptly and pull me toward her, shouting in my face. I'd wake up already screaming in panic, trying to avoid whatever punishment she had in store for me, such as: beating me up with a belt, beating me up with a shoes heel across the arm, leaving me with huge swollen spots through it, beating me up with an electric wire, a HDMI cable or whatever was at hand, breaking cereal bowls on my head, while I was eating cereal because I would ""dare"" contest her abuse; making me pick up the broken peaces of the bowls with my hands, on my knees , while she sat in a chair telling me that I wasn't going to bed until I did all my duties, telling me what I had to perform better at home, teling me that she was my mother and that, as far as she was concerned, if she took a dump on the floor and told me to pick it up, I'd have to pick it up because that was her house. This would last from 12AM to 5AM some, if not most times. I had to wake up at 7AM to be at school at 8AM. All it took was eating cereal and leaving the bowl on the sink once, I'd gotten of bed to eat, or missing some appointments on my notebooks to be thouroughly punished by her, since she had been rejected.

Other ways of punishment, included screaming at me, about how much nobody else loved me, insulting me if I was slow at helping her do chores like folding bed sheets or something of the kind. Once I responded and she picked up a pair of scissors and cut a pair of brand new jeans she new I liked and told me I must be a faggot if I enjoyed having such tight jeans gripped around my hairy balls and that I should think I was a man just because I had pubes. She would scream it.  
She would come to admit that she did this because she was jealous. She said it to me and nobody else and denied ever having said it ever since.

Offcourse my grades dropped due to lack of sleep, lack of peace, lack of self-estime, self-confidence and my ongoing sleep deprivation, which brought me recurrent sleeping issues ever since I remember, my rage management issues and my constant anxiety, which also helped to make me more and more alienated and distant from people. I lived in my own world, surrounded by my own thoughts, stuck in my own brain, lost in my own pain and as pain of a mother as recurrently my only ""friend"". She knew what she was doing, and she did it well, very well. So much so that once my grades dropped, something she surely forsaw, she took away my computer, forbid me to talk to anyone, locked the house and, for two weeks, whenever she went to work I'd stay alone in my room with my radio/clock, working out, my body and my mind out of crazyness. She closed the living room and her bedroom. I had some 40 square feet of space available to me, for the christmas holiday. Everyday I would wake up and eat, workout, daydream about my gang, listen to the radio, and be in almost total darkness with the blinds almost shut. Light started to hurt me. I had no way out. The door was completely locked from outside, I had no key and, say a fire struck I wouldn't be able to react.

After christmas she became less violent. In the process, she managed to alienate those whom I liked and now successfuly managed me to make me her personal, unwilling best friend, take me to the shopping wanted she, take me to the movies, wanted she, keep me home, wanted she and make me her puppet.

Not all was bad. Throughout my teenage, working out saved my mind and my body with it, I created meaningful connections with teachers, classmates and I even joined a track and field team when I was 16. I had a girlfriend whose religious parents gave her abuse of their own and we could identify with each other. Those were and still are the best years of my life, the two best years of my life.  
Eventually we broke up, life moved on, I left track and field after a knee injury for which I tried to recover for months, before giving up cause I needed to find a job and go to college, in the process dating another girl, which is what started trouble. My mother who was ""open-minded"" about sex and who told all of her friends it was okay for me to have my own intimacy at home for as long as I kept safe, found I lost my virginity and trashed the girl I did it, for being a whore, hit me with a HDMI cable for not telling her that I had a GF and trashed me for about a hour and a half, for having failed to accomplish the ""responsibility"" of telling her I had a girlfriend because she ""absolutely had to know"" everytime I had one. Not doing so was ""a major flaw"" and I deserved being punished for it.  
I exploded and had a rage rant, packed, left home and went to my grandma's. I stayed there for 30 minutes before my mom realized how bad this would all seem and drove there to pick me up to take me home.  
She told ALL my family I lost my virginity, the following day.

After that followed more rage rants, more insults to my gf, blaming her, for my low grades in college admission exams, expelling me out of the house, calling me a liar, texting my grandma telling her how much of a shitty mom she was for taking me at her home and failing to pay for my second round of college admission exams, with the money Social Security had sent her the day before she put me in the street with only my clothes: A pair of shorts and a t-shirt, I had from working as a watcher for kids who went to the beach with their daycare/school. I went to work, the following day after sleeping on the floor of my building's last floor, slept at my gf's for 3 days and then my grandma took me, once she learned what happened.

There have been other similar situations and I left the house atleast 2 times since, but everytime I do, my grandma tells me to find my own place, she tells me my mother always behaved in a manipulative way and my youngest uncle does the same. Or did.

I have been out of my mom's house, now for 3 months, after having left for a week in the summer, cause I left law school and changed college, cause I didn't want that degreee anymore. I budget my own college, I AM entitled to that choice.

Now I am out for a rather sad reason.  
Three months ago, I joined a gym. I had a good job and I could budget my college tuition, therapy and the gym. It went well for 2 months. After that, my mother started controlling my food intake and enforcing over me that I ought to eat less and that I was ""endangering"" her budget: She would be all over me when I was cooking, she would take food from my hands as I did it, she would make nasty comments about how people would never invite me to their houses and started telling me maybe I ought to quit the gym. When I put the time to go to the gym before I had studied, which I always did, she taunted me as my priorities were switched. You get the picture: this time it was about food.

I solved it (or did I?). I went to a grocery store and bought two huge bags of food, I had to give up on paying my tuition that month and my therapist gave in on her downpayment so that I may be less strained. It might seem, here, that I was prioritizing things wrong but mind this: My mom had gotten a new job in which she made about almost 200 bucks more than her previous and above minimum wage and only now was food a problem? This was not about food, it was about control, it was about being able to tell. Why do I say this? Because when I arrived home with my groceries, she did not feel content, she made a fit the whole night, telling me I had neglected to manage my money, criticizing my choice in food and telling me there was ""no need"" to do such. I did not mope, I took responsibility and did my own thing. It was not enough.  
It took 2 weeks before she started controlling my intake of food, my own food, before she started imposing that I was forbid to be in the kitchen after 11PM, sometimes even getting mad at me when I came home, from work, at that time to eat. It took to weeks before it became unbearable to be in the kitchen, being observed, told on, made fun of and told that I was selfish and ate not out of hunger but glutony, it became unbearable. I lost weight, a lot of weight. During the course of 2 months I went from muscular to skinny in the blink of an eye. Did she bat an eye? No. To her, as always, I was fitting, faking and throwing the blame and my rage on her. According to her she wouldn't solve the food issue, because all I saw in her were issues and as soon as this was gone I would pick on something else. She refused. So I refused to give her the money I always wood, first day of the month, to help in the house. Guess what? She told me I was disrespecting here, that she absolutely needed the money, called me fake and told me to leave and never come back. I did. I came to my grandma's house, my father's mom, who was constantly alienated from the family cause, after assaulting her, my grandad told everyone she abandoned her kids, and made her a paria. Turns out I had met her months before, she told me the truth, I met my furthest family and we became friends. I went there. I am here.

My mom took 3 weeks to text me apologizing and then took another 3 weeks, turning the tables on me, telling an aunt of mine who asked her about the subject that I was actually lazy and that I did not wanna cook (then why would I buy my own food?), that I actually was greedy and wanted it to eat it all right then (even if that was true, shouldn't it be solved, when I bought my own food, and does that not make her the one to be actually greedy, since SHE was the one who wanted to reduce on my food intake, even though she made more money, to help her savings?) and that I was a violent son and that she was afraid I would hit her. She cried while at it, took all she had said back and went from apologizing to me to attacking me, once she had convinced everybody I was the one lying about this. Ever since she has been exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to send me texts telling me that me being unnemployed will be bad for me, since there is a coming recession and that I don't have the means to survive without her.  
All and all I am trapped between standing my ground and going back home to be abused again, by the woman, who tried to kill herself in front of me, pucking her guts out in the process, to force me to call her cheating BF back into her life. I am stuck between my stuborness to pursue the truth and lowering my head to a lie that has years.

I am going back to my moms house, but only because I know, that's the only way of making her lower her guard: she won't admit her mischiefs by text, but she WILL spill her guts out in person if she gets me in front of her, specially if she feels victorious. This is illegal, but then so is abuse and defamation, and this is my only option, so listen up: I want to get back home, bug the f\*ck of the whole god damn house and than pressure my mother ever so slightly in a way that will make her feel enough at ease to tell the truth and be recorded. I hadn't thought of this, but, as she is, she will probably be in self-quarantine and missing someone (aka me, if such is possible) and it is a good time to try and force her tell the truth. I want to then, send whatever confession (or confessions) I get to her entire friend- which I do have, because my current phone is her old one- her friends, my grandma and whole family and whomever else wants to listen. I ran away from my mom, it did not work. Pherhaps the best way to end this all and is to expose her, since she exposed me. Pherhaps only then I can stop her continuous harassment. And while bugging isn't per se, admissible in court of law, in Portugal, where I live many courts do admit them, if they serve as prove of accusation, actually most if not all do. And it's really a matter of having one weight balancing the other: if she accuses me of invasion of privacy or wtv, I charge her with assault, defamation and whatever else she did, while making it public through one of those thirsty TV news channels that love a good scandal, which might even concede me a pro bono, since in here there a too much thirsty lawyers for not enough fertil markets and fame matters a lot.

After this, if the supermarket for which I applied accepts me, which it might, cause coronavirus deemed it short-staffed, I'll change numbers and credencials and vanish from her life.

Ths is cold but I think might be my only solution. Anyway I wanna know what you think on this and ask for any other advice you might have on what to do. I know payback isn't healthy, but, in lack of better option, it just might have to be a b\*tch.

29,"I was 18 when I became ill, nobody believed me, I couldnt eat, starving for 3 years, losing everything, but holding through.   
Ended up diagnosign myself right before my mom was about to kick me out, got myself to a specialist, was diagnosed with MALS and 3 other compression syndromes.  


Big surgery, my symptoms disappeared, hooray. I was happy in a way, but I also became all the more depressed, I had come to terms with dying, having all that future now, but not having anything to stand on at 21 felt terrible.  


My only friends, an art group on discord, all of a sudden kicked me out without warning.  


A year into my recovery, working at Burger King, I met someone online, I fell in love over time, he was really sweet, we clicked, I love him beyond anything.  


After 2 months I made the crazy decisions to move to him to the USA, into his parents hosue with his 6 siblings.  
Their house is very messy, dogs and cats peeing and pooping everywhere, little hygiene, the family in shambles, I come from a home like that, I didnt midn it too much.   


We married so I could immigrate more easily.  


Our plans for my immigrations didnt go up, so now I am here illegal, my health is not the best, I feel terrible, I keep feelign lightheaded and have a swollen lymphnode since a month, but cannot see a doctor, as I have no healthcare.  


I dont feel comfortable in our sex life, which bothers him a lot and makes him to to press me more to do more, I keep finding myself escape into my fantasy world, my safe haven, where things are fine and comfortable.  


On Christmas his Brother had a psychotic episode, makign up weird things and beign very paranoid, thinking I am trying to replace his sister because of heir pictures had her look like me?  


That christmas ended in screams in tears of the siblings, grandma and father.  


Now he has another one, but much worse. He will randomly stop believing things, or have gaps in memory, like he forgot who his mom is, or not believe she was wounded.  


He would not believe me it was mornign when I told him it was morning, his credit card he called a knife.  


His dad put him into our room so he wouldnt leave for 2 hours until his appointment at the therapist, but before that he collapsed to the floor hyperventilating and spitting all over the floor.  


He also removed all the yogurt from the fridge whiel claimign that he already had Covid19 so he isnt scared (he didnt)  


Later on the dad tackled him off the stairs when he was trying to hurt himself, both flying off the stairs, my husband screaming in the midst of it. He got a little better for 2 hours, then had to be tackled again when he wouldnt stop trying to leave the house.  


They  called the cops and brought him to a psychiatric hospital, he left it in the morning, strollign aroudn town until the cops picked him up and brought him back home.  


Today at first he seemed better, but then in the evening he was much worse, popping up with one of those lift-up thigns you can put inside the door (made of metal) and flailing it around, makign his sister and me nervous.  


Then he collapsed, before jumping onto a sofa and kicking in a coffe table...  


Craziness proceeded and progressed, until the cops were called again, taking him to the hospital again.  


Stuff is takign a toll on my nerves and my husbands nerves.  


I am just so burned out, I love him, and yet I keep findign myself escaping inside my mind, not only to other places, but also to other people, only fictional non existing ones, but still.  


I even started questioning my sexuality, I am very dominant, I like being able to take care of someone, hold them and such, he isnt really the person to do that with, well he kind of is, btu he also wants to be dominant.  


I miss germany, I miss europe, I miss the good feelings I had a long time ago, I miss having people who understand and connect to me, I have nobody I could talk to, at all, about anything that really matters to me, my husband plays videogames all day and we dont share al ot of interests, well, besides videogaming ,and even then our tastes are very different.  


I dont know what to do, my heart today raced so much I tohught I was fainting at one point during the whole psychotic outbreak thing.

31,The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a six month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship. The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating.My daughter doesn’t seem Scared but rather enthusiastic and excited but I still am not sure it is a good idea. Seeing someone she knows in jail could “humanize” the place. You want to go remain a place for “bad people” and seeing her mom there will probably take away that effect,27Mar2020,1

Picked up the habit at around age 24, about to be 28 in a few days. It’s my birthday wish to finally put this habit behind me for good! I’m not the heaviest of smokers, averaging between 1/2 to 1 pack a day for these past 4 yrs. It all started due to stress and anger from bad drama in past family/relationships. And it spiraled into a habit of smoking when I’m anxious or bored, to sneaking off and having a smoke. I feel like I live my life around when I can go out and smoke a cigarette. I have to constantly hide my habit from those close to me who thought I quit last time I tried and inevitably failed. 

I have tried pretty much everything out there from nicotine gum, patches, books, and yes even Chantix. To no avail. I fall flat on my face every single time. I truly believe it’s in your mind to quit. But for me it seems flat out fucking impossible. Every time I say yeah I’m done, I feel that sense of doom and dread wash over me and like I’m gonna go insane if I don’t have that pack on me. I then break down and buy another pack. I’m really sick of living my life around this ball and chain that cigarette smoking is. I want to quit not only for my health and financial being, but to prove to myself that I can and will overcome this bad bad habit. I’m trying to turn a new leaf here. 

So does anyone have any advice besides the things I already tried to quit? What worked for you? Many thanks kind strangers.",27Mar2020,1

But yesterday, I got an email with a link to the Netflix Movie 'Hush'. I've never watched it but the description is really creeping me out. The protagonist is deaf but the only difference between me and her is that she lived alone while I live with my boyfriend.

I got the email from someone called 'Rahima Oqubay' and the second I replied to the email with 'who tf is this?' the email got sent straight to my bin. I refreshed the bin and now its gone. But I did get a good screenshot!

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

48,"When I was 10, I was invited over to a friends house for a play date and I’d be picked up after dinner. This was the first time I had gone to this particular friends house so my behavior was extra good and I was trying to be extra polite so I’d be invited back. Things were going really well I was having a really good time, she had a basement filled with cool toys I’d never seen and a huge tv for playing Wii, also when I had gotten there, the mom said we were having ham and mashed potatoes with gravy for dinner so I was stoked all the way around and was thinking this was the coolest place ever. My friend and I played until we were exhausted and then her mom called us up for dinner. Her mom started serving us, the ham looked and smelled amazing as well as the gravy, however, the potatoes, when served, were watery to the point of soupy and also very weirdly textured like grainy, but not grainy in a potato way. In my mind I was stuck between the fact that I had to be polite and eat everything on my plate, and that I was completely nauseated by these ‘mashed potatoes’ in front of me. I took a couple bites and tried to use it as another sauce on my ham, but ended up not being able to stomach it. I had finished the ham, and left pretty much all the soupy potatoes. That’s when the mom turns to me and reveals a key fact about these ‘potatoes’, turns out they’re not mashed potatoes at all, it’s mashed cauliflower, with no seasoning and excess milk/some liquid. Later I had gone through the conversation in my head and I’m still 100% sure even 12 years later she introduced them as mashed potatoes. I had never been in such an internal conflict, I ended up helping extra with the dishes to redeem myself for the unfinished dinner, but even though I got invited back I decided a basement full of toys and video games was not worth that internal conflict and the anxiety it induced.",27Mar2020,1

50," Hi Friends,

How are you doing during time of uncertainty? Everyone you speak to, every channel you watch and listen to, every news channel is depressing. Uncertainty and anxiousness is all over.

Has your work or business been affected by this health crisis? Are you forced to work from home?

On top of coping with work and your own feelings, do you have kids who are now at home with you 24/7? Do you struggle to balance your family responsibility and the desire of getting work done?

No one knows how long this situation will last, no one is able to predict how bad it will get until it gets better.

But this is one thing for sure---  
this crisis will pass. Just like any human disaster in history, every pain we had experienced went by. The world wars, the great recession, the 911 terrorist tragedies. There is no difference in COVID-19 threat. Today’s pain, today’s panic, today’s fear will be tomorrow’s history.

By choice,we can shape this historic moment for the future.

For most of us, other than staying healthy and respecting social distance, it is very limited for what we can do to help the world situation.

But, let’s stay here, look at the situation again- we are home with our kids, with our loved ones for at least weeks, maybe months. Is this the life in our dreams? We do not need to beg our bosses to allow us for flexible working hours so we can spend some quality family time. We save hours from daily traffic commute. We finally get what we want, why complain?

There are already too many anxious people out there, let’s stay in the calm zoom and positive.

Let us lend our hearts full of compassion to those who are suffering the most from this global crisis. Be grateful that we are healthy and surrounded by our loved ones. Make this isolated time a precious moment in life. Finally, we have time to finish the books on shelf, we have time to connect with our spouse, we have energy to play with our kids.

Make the time count!

Set an intention on what you want to change, to improve or to achieve through this tough time in human history.

51,"I started online classes about a week ago, and have barely left the house since then. I went on a hike over the weekend, and had to go to the store yesterday for some necessities, but other than that, I've been cooped inside with the family members I live with. All my university classes have moved online, and I'm finding it incredibly hard to motivate myself to... care about anything. My classes feel unimportant and weirdly non-existent.

To add to that, my parents are getting a divorce (feel free to look at my post history to find posts about that situation) and the home I grew up in has been sold and we're moving all our belongings across the country to where I currently live and go to university (where I was born/where family is). Everything is rapidly changing and I feel like I'm losing touch with family and friends (definitely a lot of self-isolation going on there) as well as completely losing my motivation for normal life stuff. 

Not knowing when this is all gonna be over with and life can resume as normal (if we interpret that as meaning corona goes away, since nothing in my life is gonna be ""normal"" again with my family and living situation completely changing) is completely ruining my mental state and I'm doing my best to cope but I feel like I'm going on a huge downward spiral right now.

So, day 1. today is March 27th, 2020, the time is 1am

I'm 15 and my birthday is in about 2 weeks and I have only 1 friend.
all my life I've wanted to do a birthday party, but there has never been enough people to invite. the only ""true"" birthday party I've ever had was my brothers friends coming over and my mom inviting my whole kindergarten class. the only thing I've done in recent years was a ""lan party"" which was super not fun.
a lan party is where people come over to your house, bring their own computers and play videogames with you. not trying to sound selfish, but most of the people I invited did not show up, only 2 did. of those two people, one did not bring a computer and he had to play on mine, (no big deal). the other ""friend"" who we will call ""Jeremy"" from here on, brought along his close friends who lived with him while he lived in another state years ago. they had visited the week of my birthday and I did not know them. he brought them over without asking, and only one of them (there were 3 of them) brought a computer. because of this, I had to give both of them my computer's (I own 3, becuase that used to be my hobby). so at this point, there is 5 people at my house, and I had to give all three of my computers to them to share. this left nothing for me, so we had to take turns. nobody offered to let me go, and I had to ask repeatidely when I wanted a turn. at my own birthday party. one of them asked if they could just play for the test of the night, becuase they don't get to play in person with Jeremy much and they wanted to keep playing. this hurt my feelings becuase nobody stood up for me and I just gave up. for the next 3hours, those people stayed downstairs playing CS on my computers and they left without leaving any gifts (I hadn't asked for them so no big deal). they made a huge mess which I had to clean up, pizza, sodas etc. and they made the whole house stink because none of them wore deodorant. I had to also take apart my keyboards and mice and clean them because of the amount of oil and grease and crumbs in them.

so as you can imagine, that was ""fun"". I'm not friends with one of the people anymore, I haven't seen those 3 kids for a long while, and Jeremy is still a person I talk to often, but I don't really consider him a friend anymore. I just feel so alone. Now, this year is going to be even worse. I have only 1 actual friend, and I'm not even one of their best friends. we've only hungout at school and texted. and on top of that, I'm stuck at home and can't go anywhere because of caronavirus.

57,"Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the fact that we only get one shot at this. It makes me want to drop out, hop in my car and go the distance. I always hated getting existential. So much time lost wondering what our reason for being here is. Far as I can tell, there is none. And I love you all the more for it. I don't mean that metaphorically; it's by no means some kind of ode to a lost romance. I mean you. Reading this. Right now. Wherever you may be. And whatever you're doing. Whether there's a smile on your face or a frown in your furrowed brow, you are a miracle. The manifestation of an impossibly improbable outcome. I don't know much about you. But I know that we're the same. I know we laugh, and cry, and grieve, and smile. I know nothing beats a cold drink of water on a hot summer day. I know nothing beats a hot sip of coffee on a cold winter morning. Nothing but you, of course. Because you know all this, too. And you know everything I don't. And if we're lucky, maybe some day we'll talk about it over lunch. You'll tell me all about the long and winding road. How the flight was uncomfortable and the baby in the back just would't stop crying. I'll tell you all about the weekend specials here. We'll go for a walk after. And you can go on and on and on about everything that's going wrong. If it looks like I'm not listening, I promise I am. More than you could ever know. More than you could ever speak.

61,"I need to vent, and I generally try to cycle through which subs allow that to (hopefully) get a variety of insight. 

I'm subbed to r/applyingtocollege and r/sat and outside of reddit I put a lot of academic pressure on myself. These people on these subs are impressive. Extraordinarily capable and qualified for ivy league schools and high end careers. I just saw a post that someone got a 1570 on their SAT. I feel so inadequate next to them. I've only taken the PSAT and I got 1170. 

My school doesn't offer many AP courses and no IB courses. There is very few academic opportunities but I take advantage when I can. This year I'm a 3.8 GPA (and once quarantine ends to get my B up then a 4.0), but I haven't been all of high school. I'm a junior at a smaller school, with a 3.5 cumulative GPA. Last year, I got an F and two C's. I experienced a domestic violence situation at home that took me out of school for several weeks, and was met with extremely unsupportive administrators and teachers. My freshman year I was a 3.7, experiencing severe depression and anxiety and 2 abusive (mentally and physically) relationships. Because of these years, my dreams of going to Yale are gone. 

School is my life. I'm speech and debate team captain and FBLA president, while in an AP class. I was also editor of my school paper for a term. I know I'm qualified for public university, but my dream is yale. I'm visiting this summer (hopefully) for a conference I was invited to. Their website explicitly states that transcripts and grades are most important. Seeing people I know and people on reddit getting into these schools or even having the confidence to try is hard. I'm happy for them, but it's hard. 

From my strive for academic perfection my whole life (literally. I learned to read at three and never slowed down or had trouble until high school), I also have issues with perfection in other areas in my life. I was recently diagnosed with anorexia. This was absolutely not a surprise, I started restricting food at 12, but it's only gotten worse as my drive for success has strengthened. Due to social influence, I have become obsessed with the idea of pageantry. The problem is, I do not have the money to compete (nor experience), but I am not physically the pageant type. My hair is cut in a pixie, I wear glasses and have baby face, I'm short and not the right shape, and I don't have the clothes or coach or anything to do it. Feminine things don't even look good on me, much less pageant wear. It's difficult knowing that that is something I'll never do, and couldn't succeed in. 

I don't know where this is going. I want to go to the best law school, and I want to succeed in everything I do, and I want to be beautiful. None of that is happening for me. I've already decided my main school is a state university (which feels almost pathetic for me). I feel like I should be tried harder and I've been killing myself over it.",27Mar2020,1
64,"About three years ago I felt these depression symptoms creeping up on me again. I always tried to fight it back and go out and distract myself, but at the end of the day I always felt like shit I could never enjoy myself, and people would definitely notice. I just got tired of always trying to put a front that I’m happy to try and please other people because they’re counting on me. For me I just felt like how was I suppose to be a good friend and be there for other people when I wasn’t even there for myself or even mentally in a good place? I missed me. I stopped talking to my friends because I needed space to try to get myself together. When I would try to talk to them they just never understood which is fine and I never wanted to put my problems on to them. Recently I’ve gotten back in touch with them and I felt guilty for not being there for them, but at the same time I know why I did it. I’ve always made it clear that I was never mad at them, or it never had anything to do with them, but they still make me feel shitty for it. At this point I’m going to stand up for myself and not feel guilty about it.

66,"I’m new to this sub and idk if it’s common to say this here but I am typing this on mobile

So today was “Ivy day” where all the Ivy League schools release their admission decisions and I received a rejection from my dream school, the University of Pennsylvania. Attending this school has been my dream since 6th grade because of an doctor as the school’s hospital who really inspired me. I have been raised by a single mother and when I was in 6th grade she majorly injured her arm and needed surgery and months of therapy. Seeing the person who means everything to you in such pain was so difficult for me, but the orthopedic surgeon that worked with her helped take much of that pain away. He was an orthopedic at UPenn’s hospital and he did amazing work on my mother, she even ended up going back to work several months before she was initially projected to. I’ve forgotten his name since then and I don’t want to know his name as I’ve sort have made him into a mythical figure in my mind. After these events and breaking my own arm in twice after these events, I have decided I want to become an orthopedic just like the doctors who helped mother and I. But now I’ve been rejected by the school that taught the doctor who inspired me and owns the hospital she was cared for at. I know it might but dumb to worry about this one place when I have been accepted to other good schools but I can get over my rejection to my absolute dream.

70,"So if you look deep in some of my post history, you’ll find that about two years ago I was in a very toxic and abusive relationship. It only lasted three months. As a nerd I’m high school, this was my only relationship to date (although being a nerd isn’t what it used to be and it’s chill I’m just awkward) and even though it was abusive, the sex kept me in it until I finally had enough. But for an entire year after that, I just didn’t deal with the abuse and the emotions, and had many crash and burns. This past summer, I finally realized this and sorted things out. I’m a heavy believer in content &gt; happy, and I finally felt content again.

This past December I met a girl and we hit it off. Things have been kinda rough (we both were in extracurriculars that ate up our time and we didn’t have any for each other and it led to problems) and we ended things. We never were formally dating, but it still sucked as it was on Valentine’s Day and I dropped a bunch of money on flowers and candy. But I accepted it and we left off amicably. That weekend however there was a hackathon that I always volunteer at and she attended, and while the homies that were also mentoring were helping me to begin moving on, she realized from seeing me there that she had made a mistake. So that Sunday we began talking and we gave it another shot.

I’m so glad we did. We started making time for each other and she really makes me happy. It hasn’t been that long so I’m ignoring this feeling, but certain words have been floating around in my head and maybe if this keeps up for a while (it seems like it will) I’ll say it.

The big problem is right now we’re both under mandatory quarantine and we’re apart. It sucks being apart, especially since we now are ready to date (our activities ended due to Covid-19 and then two days later we were quarantined so we weren’t really dating yet as we still didn’t have the time) but alas we don’t want to infect others (and our parents aren’t letting us out so).

I know this sounds convoluted and our relationship sounds weird but the biggest reason I felt the need to say this is because of what’s been going on recently. I’m the beginning she had said she wasn’t interested in doing anything sexually. I’ve seen what thinking with your dick can do, and I have a hand so I told her I’m a’ok with it (and I am). The thing is we’ve been talking a lot because we’re both procrastinating on homework and it seems there’s some sexual tension that’s building and it’s ramping up and I just don’t know how to react because it’s unexpected but definitely welcome. She’s absolutely stunning and I feel so lucky to have her (not just because she’s hot tho I’m not that shallow) and I just feel like shouting from a mountain top. I want this relationship to last and I know it isn’t the most practical but as we both have similar interests and want to go into similar fields i wouldn’t be opposed to going to the same college (and from what we’ve talked about neither would she) and yeah. I’m just extremely happy and I really just needed somewhere to share it. If you actually read thank you.

But, i just noticed smthing, im not sure if it is how i think it is, but i hope it isnt

So, basically this girl likes me right? Ight, cool But, the thing is she started liking me after i started paying attention to her. Now, by paying attention i dont mean buying flowers and stuff, not even talking, but just looking at her I dont even mean staring, or just looking at her all the time But just making eye contact, its not any different or longer than other ones, but i just give off the right vibe. Now, it kinda pisses me off, cuz i dont want her to like the fact that i give a shit about her, i want her to like my actual self. I almost even ignore her now, but she tries getting my attention still, tries touching me, talking to me, basically definitely likes me

I hope its wrong, but rn remembering how flattered she felt around me it infuriates me so much cuz it only makes me think that she cares only about herself, like, she almost felt proud that i was looking at her, i could tell it by her face, it only makes me think thst she wants to use me to boost her own ego, feel good about herself, that she doesnt care about me, and honestly it disgusts me, and as corny as it sounds, i think most girls are like that, not sure, hope not, but i had similiar experiences with other girls as well. I did also have girls like me who i didnt even know existed, not even seen them, but still.

Okay, imma be honest, it is more of a question, and i know it will sound like im trying to boost my own ego, but i really want to know what its about: is it about looks? Or just the way i look at them? Do they feel flattered that an attractive guy is looking at them? Or would they have the same reaction to other guys?

I really dont mean to come across as narcissistic

I've been told that where they are, the locals blame white people for everything evil - and now especially - the Coronavirus! 
Apparently they're stuck in hiding at the moment with no food and have already been in physical flights with the locals.
Their embassy is trying to get to them in some way to get them home, however it seems that the local government isn't responding. 
They're scared to go to the shops and last I heard - they had no food or clean water.

80,"The point of this thread is, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking this week and I’m remembering things from my life that I’d forgotten about. Funny or crazy things. I started smoking weed again, you’d think that would make me forget, but it’s actually making me remember a ton of funny shit. Hope you’ll laugh.

So I’m not a drug addict. I only smoke weed, but I got a medical card. I went to rehab because I caught a possession charge and had the choice between rehab or jail time. I chose rehab. 

It was a crazy experience. Overall, I got deeply connected to a few people in there, and I didn’t take it too seriously. I fucked around during classes and I just used rehab as an opportunity to have fun, get in trouble, and laugh, pretend to be somebody else since none of those people knew me. 

I met some very hilarious characters honestly, including a schizophrenic crip, a semi famous gangbanger from the south side of Chicago, a cowboy, a Canadian Barbie....

I became good friends with the old ladies. I don’t know why, but old women love me. They became like my rehab mothers and tried to look out for me, since I was getting into trouble. Relationships were against the rules, but I started getting “involved” (lol) with a girl there. This girl was a meth head from Oklahoma, a real catch. 

But then, I found out she was messing with like every dude in there, like having sex with 8+ guys at rehab, and I jokingly called her a whore. This created huge drama and she got angry at me. This boiled for a few days. We would just be passive aggressive and stare at each other during classes. Rehab was literally grown ass adults acting like children, and I got sucked into it.

Well, she was also crazy AF, and one day shit hit the fan. Somehow she snuck vodka onto the premises, she snuck out to go buy it. She got super drunk and that’s when she tried to fight me in the cafeteria. 

She called me an asshole and I laughed at her, which made her snap and try to fight me 😂 I wasn’t planning to do anything, I’m not suicidal lol, but I was laughing and she became so enraged she tried to come at me like she wanted to kill me. Guess who jumped in front of me?? This old ass lil old lady, I swear to god. She was like “get away from him!!”

87,"I have one vice. Indiscipline.

I've introspected alot and I have come to the conclusion that it is indiscipline that causes me to do stupid, unproductive things and make me go on frivolous pursuits.

Yes it's this lack of self-directed motivation that makes me do things that just fuck with my conscience. I've also introspected that anything in excess is bad. 
Anything. Greed and lust drive this planet nowadays. There is no self control in us and there is no discipline. Your homies are indirectly influencing you to do things that they're doing (and they aren't aware of the harm)

 I'm not preaching or anything. I'm just giving you my opinion on how to stay true to yourself and prevent truth decay. I ran away from things unknowingly. I never thought it was due to lack of discipline. Most of us want that instant gratification and won't see the big picture coz your mind is tricking you into that ""feel good"" activities. 

People often respond to perception and not reality. That's the worst. Wake up guys. Start responding to the REALITY. Having protein shakes after every workout is getting the protein shake company to hook you into their ecosystem. Having a Gatorade after every workout makes you super dependent on that. Even footballers and sports pros don't guzzle Gatorade and redbull at the rate at which you're destroying yourself after your so called ""workout"".

There is happiness at the end of all this. But by the time you've decided to discipline yourself and follow through. None of this will matter coz by that time your definition of happiness might have changed quite a bit and you'd view happiness from a completely different perspective.

Yes, self-improvement is the only way. Discipline is the only way of you want to have the satisfaction and contentment in your life. Nothing else.

89,"I recently lost my grandparents and realised is know nothing of their lives. I don't want that for my family, but I don't know where to start.

I've had a pretty brutal life so far but from it I've learnt a lot and I have coped in healthy ways. I want to share my experiences with my future family, so that they can learn from my mistakes, experience my joy and know that whatever hard times they come across, they can survive and they aren't alone.

[This bit is a little long, sorry, but it give insight as to why I want to do this]

Overview of my life so far:- abused as a child, grew up homeless with a single parent and two siblings, horrendous school experience due to moving alot and bullying, mother had no money and mentally broken down, I raised my siblings, mother got cancer and was hospitalised for a year leaving me and siblings alone, grandparents became stand in parents, did well in school but poverty made it a struggle, finished school with amazing grades because I worked hard but home situation force be to stop my education after, government forced me to move out at 16 because mums funding was stopped, tried to work full time but got made redundant, moved in with my boyfriend, moved away from my family, brother tried to kill himself, mother used my brother's autism to keep him around for government payments, sister and I tried to save my brother from her, it didn't work, my boyfriend becomes abusive, I'm stuck with him for 10 years, made redundant 6 more times, I try to go back into education and I do really well, I go to uni, sister gets pregnant with an IUD that punctures her womb, baby has to be aborted, sister slips into depression, tries to kill herself, someone else shows me affection and I cheat, boyfriend finally lets me leave but then stalks me and causes my student finance to be cut with a lie, my only best friend abandons me and attacks me online, I find other means to make money for uni but it makes me ill, I fall in love with the perfect person, I make it through uni with first class honours, I move to Germany with my boyfriend, I'm happy and love, I get an amazing job that pays low but I'm happy, I go home for Christmas and my brother tells me he's like our dad and he thinks he's a pedophile, I call the police, he tries to attack my grandad and mum on Christmas, he's taken into custody, my mum disowns me because I called the police and now they won't let him come home, he taken away and put into a care facility, eventually he moves into his own place where he is monitored, my mum gets better, my brother gets better, my sister goes travelling with her boyfriend and they get engaged, my boyfriend and I move into a new place, we get engaged, my sister comes home to the UK and get depressed, she can't get work and is self harming, fiance and I try for a baby knowing my endometriosis will make our chances slim, we get pregnant in a week of trying, we plan our wedding, it get cancelled because my birth certificate has my surname as my abusive dad and not my mum, I can't legally change it, new law comes in to say it's ok and we get married, we have a baby girl 4 months later, I'm feeling safe and hopeful for the first time in my life, my grandma died of ""pneumonia"" which later turns out to be coronavirus, a wind storm cancels my flight to the funeral, I didn't get the chance to say goodbye, my sister spirals into deep depressed as she was the only one in the room when she died, my mother was away caring for my sick grandad, 25 days later my grandad dies, coronavirus stops me from travelling, I miss his funeral and can't say goodbye, I'm in isolation for 4 weeks and somehow my asthma causes a breathing issue, I'm rushed to hospital where they test me for coronavirus.....and now I'm waiting.

Obviously there's a lot and if anyone read to this point, thanks, I appreciate it. 
My main point of wanting to do this is, even after all that, my will to keep trying and my sense of determination, has helped me cope. Sure I have a few issues as a result of all that, but I want to show my daughter and future family members that you can survive some pretty hard times but it makes you a stronger person.
I want to show them how I've coped, what impacts it's had and how I've learnt that instantly emotionally responding to a bad situation with panic or worry isn't healthy. It's much better to think of the situation logically, weigh up the pros and cons then plan accordingly. 
I also want to teach them how I learnt to cherish the free things in life, like making happy memories and spending time doing what gives me joy and to not take any notice of other people's opinions of you if you're happy.

My issue is, I don't know where to start, how to go about things and how to get help writing it.",27Mar2020,1

95,"Hi Reddit. I was always interested in JRPG games and wanted to try it out. I was quite good at RPG Maker MV and VX Ace but I still didn't have a story in my head. And, last night I stayed up all night writing one. I would like some comments to be able to further improve this plot:

&amp;#x200B;

I.Story

I took the image from a Japanese net idol. She committed suicide at 14 years of age most likely due to depression from family and friends. She jumped down from her apartment and died. The game started when she woke up in her apartment building in the afterlife. Her head was stunned. She did not remember what happened to her and why she was here. At that time, what remained in her memory was her basic information and her memories disappeared. She stood up and continued on to her apartment building. At that time, there was no one. The elevator of the apartment suddenly opened, inside there was no one. She slowly walked into the elevator. It looked a little weird and ancient than she imagined. There was only a single ""up"" button in that strange elevator. She hesitated to press ... That elevator took a long time ... It did not take her to a certain floor of the building but rather a large hall with three wings. Those doors, she looked strange and familiar. She went to the first door ... on which it said:

""Doors of the past will only accept items from memory"" ....

She peeked a little and opened the door, inside was an apartment ....

&amp;#x200B;

II.Gameplay

After entering the first door, players will have to find suggested items from the game ... In parallel, they will discover the main character's memories through 3 symbolic doors. for the 3 places, she is most attached to family, school, and social networks.

After opening all 3 gates, a black gate will appear, open a little, presenting in it is a part of unexplored memories, that door also leads to the multi-selected ending of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

(yeah, that's relatively what I wrote, there are some parts I don't want to let everyone know. How do you feel about the game's story?)",27Mar2020,1
97,"I was playing a game of cup flip or whatever you call it with my friends and family. Three times during the game I see my cousin cheat. At that point I’m pissed off and I stop playing. At the end of the game, my parents yell at me for being too serious and over competitive. I guess I am asking if it was fair?",27Mar2020,1
98,"I always tell people around me to hold on, things will get better. But what is there to hold on to? I asked myself this question a while back during a depressive episode. I found a few things that I could hold on to. 

Among others, my fursuit came to mind. It has yet to be made, yet to be commissioned. But I feel like it will bring to me endless happiness and an escape from pain.

Sure, there are reasons that are “profound” and “big” reasons. I want to highlight a reason that can be seen as small, but has enormous value to me. It can be seen as insignificant but really that’s the thing that keeps my head up.

Look. It doesn’t matter if it’s for a significant other, child, or pet. It doesn’t matter if it’s for a fursuit, the pleasure of eating delicious food, or just to give a middle finger to the big guy (up to interpretation). Hold on to that thing. Grasp it with both hands. Wrap your arms around it and bring it close to you. Cherish the thing that keeps you fueled and in return let it fuel you.

99,"**Background:**

* Few months ago my boyfriend, who I genuinely thought will spend the rest of my life with, broke up with me out of the blue. 
* My last two remaining friends in the city moved away the next month. 
* I've not been enjoying my work for a while. 
* My family lives in a whole different country. I tried to make new friends, but without luck.
* For the past 4-5 months I've been crying almost on a daily basis, having to go to a work that I don't enjoy, just to come home and spend the evening and weekends completely alone. 
* My only hope was to find a new job and be able to leave this city where I feel I wasted so much of my life and where I've been hurt so much.

**2 days ago I have been offered a really great role at a great company with great salary and beneftis - all this in Barcelona, where I've been dreaming of moving for years, but I feel like I can't be happy about it. Don't know if in the current situation it's wise to accept**.   
**If I don't:**

* If I need to wait for this to blow over and *then* look for a job and *then* spend my 3 months notice period, could very well take me well into 2021 and I feel my mental health would suffer incredibly, not to mention my life is just literally wasting away here.

**If I do:**

* The company is in the mobile games industry, which is doing well at the moment. But I need to prepare for worst case scenario. Could they go bankrupt? Could they just suffer financially enough that they say they don't need me? Could I end up not having a job in either places? What do I do then? I wouldn't be able to keep up my rented place here for too long, but moving back to my parents and then somewhere else again would use up most/all my savings.
* They said if worse comes to worst, I would be able to start working from home (they will have others doing the same before me), but I am afraid of the above scenario.

I guess you only regret the chances you don't take and without this current mess I'd take the job in a heartbeat. But I feel it might be a very risky move, but then staying here for indefinitely all alone does consume my sanity. 

I'm asking for advice as someone might raise a point that I've not thought of!

100,"So a few weeks ago I\[24m\] was talking to my girlfriend\[26F\] ready to break up with her, we have dated for like 2 and a half years now. She had always kept me at a distance and I didn't know why. But when I talked to her she told me she was sexually assaulted and had trust issues and was afraid to tell me. I immediately felt bad but we worked it out and kept dating. 

The next week for the first time we saw eachother every day. She visited my house for only like the third or fourth time because her parents typically want her to hang out with me at her house and noticed how my dad treated me. She told me it wasn't OK for him to yell at me until I cry and beat me. She told me he was abusive and that I shouldn't live there. I didn't think much of it at the time but one day my dad got mad at me and told me I have to leave the house and never come back again a couple weeks ago. She has then moved me into her house with her parents and told me she wants me to just live with her for now on because she is safe.   


She's learned I get constant panic attacks and night terrors. She now smothers me all the time, she never lets me cry or even feel stressed without being held by her. Her parents didn't want us in the same bed together but after seeing one of my night terrors she's already got them talking about letting us sleep on the same bed. She even lays in my bed next to me until I fall asleep at night. She'll even come into my room in the middle of the night when I have a night terror and cuddle with me until I feel better despite it being against her parents wishes. 

Feels like a dream not living with my dad anymore and living with her. I feel horrible that I was in a conversation with her where I was considering breaking up. She told me it was fine and she understood how I felt not seeing her often. She wont even let me move out of her house, I had family say they would take me in but she made me promise her I wouldn't leave. I don't know why she is so fucking sweet to me, nobody in my life has ever been this kind to me. I'm a 24 year old dude that struggles to hold a job and has a slew of problems upstairs. I even told her I was going to break it off with her over getting cancelled on by her until I learned about her. She deserves so much better than me but she loves me unconditionally anyway.",27Mar2020,1
101,So people are always talking about being tracked online. Reality is that no one really is “tracked” online. We are all just put into a folder depending on what we search and look up. I agree that our activity is being monitored but not by a human. It’s all just generalizations. If you take someone who likes a certain person and see the kind of stuff they like you’ll see that people who like that same person likes the same things. That is why I get ads for things I would never want just because I started watching a new YouTuber. Once I start watching their videos the algorithm thinks that I am a person that wants X   Yes we have no real way to be private anymore but it’s not like everything that is being tracked is looked over by a human. It’s just programs and code looking for patterns and they are not perfect.,27Mar2020,1
102,"I recently came across a raceplay video series where white men dominate black women. The black women themselves often view themselves as inferior and hate being black. I know it's all just harmless fantasy. But there is one black woman who said that she wants to be a counselor (for kids I think). This got me to thinking. What if she actually does become a counselor? She would probably deceptively mess some poor little black kid's mind up. Especially if it's a young girl. 

Now, I know what you're thinking. If this was just some role playing fantasy site, she's probably just kidding. It's all a show. Maybe, but then I got to thinking again. What if someone like her is already out there being a counselor/therapist/psychiatrist etc.? There could be thousands of people in the mental health field pretending to want to help, but they're secretly hurting people mentally because of prejudice. It's made my anxiety shoot through the roof. I feel like anyone anywhere could be up to something. I'll admit that watching true crime tv shows may also be contributing to this. I always see stories of mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, cousins, boyfriends, girlfriends, husbands, wives, best friends, coworkers, neighbors, etc. deceiving people and murdering them, or raping them, or murder/raping their kids. It's highly disturbing. Literally anyone can be this horrible person on the inside. You think you know someone and say they could never do those things? Ha! Do you know how many nurturing mothers, loving husbands, and sweet old grannies out there will rape or kill their loved ones? Sometimes it's for hate and sometimes it's money, but it doesn't matter why, it's just that it's possible.

That's what's really bothering me. I have no more trust for anyone. The things that I used to take into consideration when trusting someone are gone. In reality these things don't matter. Everything horrible about a person can be hidden. Everyone is wearing a mask of some kind and we never know who is truly behind that mask. We don't know what their true intentions are and they can hide this for years.",27Mar2020,1
103,"The chances of Congress passing the stimulus bill is really high and the media is really saying as long as you filled your 2019 tax returns and you didn't make a lot of money, you are eligible, but no one is telling you if someone filed you as a dependent, you are automatically ineligible.  

Why I am saying this?  A lot of you probably didn't catch [this question. ](https://imgur.com/a/22i1FF1).  Make sure you chose NO for someone claiming you as a dependent, even if no one like your parents are not filing as a dependent.

Because I put the question yes, and my parents didn't claim me as a dependent, I'm ineligible :(

Don't be like me that's struggling and putting the wrong question that will ruin your chances entirely.

So this week, one of the admin decided to start spreading BS about the Coronavirus like:

- Lockdowns are bad for economy and shouldn't be done and won't help us at all. We shouldn't follow lockdowns.

- We should not protect ourselves and let it spread exponentially and kill millions of us (because common cold also kills and we don't care about hungry kids in Africa).

- Coronavirus will solve on its own as soon as the temperature goes up.

113,"I (26F) met a guy on tinder (27M). It wasn’t until I met him in person that I noticed he really didn’t look as good in person. I was not physically attracted to him but I felt terrible for being superficial. So I went though with the date and discovered he has a good personality. But then a couple other things bothered me:

1) In a conversation we had, he slipped in casually that he used 3-5 year old pictures mixed in with recent ones. He was significantly thinner in most of them. His eyes looked different. In person they were deader... smaller. His face was a different shape. We had sex, and I also noticed he was a lot heavier and I was NOT attracted to the shape of his body. I felt nauseous afterwards. 

2) He got clingy real fast. There first time we met in person, he wouldn’t stop saying things like:
— “I have a really good feeling about this”
— “My mom would really like you”
— “Lets see where this goes” but also hinting at a relationship constantly
— “I will apologize and do anything I can to rectify my mistake if I upset you or you don’t want this”
— Opening up about anything and everything is his past without reservation
— Opening up about his insecurities but making them a joke or the center off conversation

3) He clearly stated he has manic depression but refuses to get help, and says medication will turn him into a zombie. Therapy is out of the question for him. 

4) He was constantly texting me, constantly calling throughout the day. Replied to me in seconds. It was nice at first to get such an engaging and interactive person. But in actuality, he just wouldn’t stop talking. I was more of an accessory to his conversation rather than an equal participant... I’d try to say something, he’d listen, and then redirect it to whatever he was saying prior. I’d get calls at 5am before his shift and he wouldn’t stop talking. He’d call me in the middle of the day. At night. I desperately wanted to like... eat, go to the bathroom, practice my viola, exercise, have me time. It really impeded on things.

Despite seeming like a great person, so many other things rubbed me the wrong way. But I kept thinking “Maybe I’m being too picky and superficial”. So...

We planned our second date. He drove an hour to see me. When I saw him again, I didn’t feel anything. My stomach turned, and it confirmed for me I was NOT going to compromise my needs or feelings. (I did it before in a four year relationship) So I sat down on a ledge on our walk to my apartment and was completely honest for one of the first times in my life. I told him that I’m not physically attracted to him at all but that he deserves to find someone who wants him that way. I also told him he’s an admirable person for experiencing everything he’s been through, and still coming out kind hearted and empathetic. We went our separate ways. (He offered to drive me home but I said no) I know he had a weapon on him because he carries his gun wherever he goes.

It was terrifying. But I think I’m proud of myself for starting to honor my gut feeling more. I feel like my mistake here is in light of thinking I was giving someone a chance, since it was actually compromising my instincts, I unintentionally led him on. Next time, I’ll say something sooner, spare an hour drive, and I won’t be so nice as to cover up how I really feel because I’m scared.

Today is 3/27/2020

In the last week I lost my Mother to a fall, got laid off because of COVID-19, and must stay at home because of the quarantine. I am in the United States working hard for the things I have earned in my life but now life is upside down, and this fragile government finally had an unflattering light shone upon it and just makes me depressed. I had an outside sales Representative job and switched careers to a inside sales job for a bigger company which they let me go a month into my job, COVID-19 tanked their sales hard, 80-90 leads a day to just 5.   
 

I had friends reach out to me and get me a job for changing peoples electric and gas rates from home so I can get paid. It is easier than I thought since the customers I would be helping don’t have to pay for this change at all, but they would be locked into a one-year rate plan.   
 

I am still grieving the loss of my Mother; she was a strong woman raising three sons that where hardheaded. She dies from a fall, landing on her head causing a brain bleed that killed her. I can’t believe it was something so random in life that killed her. She was an amazing person and really cared about people, animals and her family. I am staying contact with the family I disconnected from since I am gay. (American’s and gays still have friction) They all accepted me in which was jarring to me and blew my mind when I was treated like a family member. After mom passed, we all connected, caught up, and are still grieving together over her passing. I know it’s been just a week, but the pain is massive compared to a hole in your chest that is infected and burning. 

The good news doesn’t stop there, I lost my job 3 days after her passing and I broke down. I didn’t know what to do other than make sure I don’t go out to protect others. Which I am doing with my brothers here at home and my husband. My husband can work from home he is a software engineer for an AGV company, and he is doing so much to support and protect me. I felt guilty, ashamed and lost because I always carry my own weight. So, I started to work with this electric/gas company that helps with rates. 

I am asking family and friends to send me their electric bills so I can get paid, and they don’t have to pay a thing. (States I cover are Texas, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, New York, Delaware, Illinois and D.C the capital.) Literally the easiest job, but hardest job I have had to do to get people to send me an electric bill to get them better rates for a year. (We call to ask if they would like to renew) But it’s weird I haven’t had time to separate work from life so far in this whole thing….

It’s no secret that the United States is a crap show for its health care, and I am happy it’s shown a light on how bad it is, and how much we have fallen from grace. The United States….what a country it has the chance to be something amazing but it’s not doing that, it’s compliance and complacent nature kills me. I was always taught to do more and get better, for years I hated the fact I would vote for the things that we need but nothing ever changes.  
 

So TL:DR :  
 I lost my world, my mother and the country I live in is going to fall apart, ask me anything.

And if you are in the Texas, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, New York, Delaware, Illinois and D.C the capital areas and would like to help a fellow American out, DM me about how. It doesn’t cost you any money, it saves you money.",27Mar2020,1

137,"I'm 13 in seventh grade right now and as such, I've begun to watch adult shows like American Dad, Beavis and Buttthead, and Family Guy.

The other day, I watched an episode of We Bare Bears. I forget the name, but it was about the bears ordering a package, it not coming, and working with a local officer to figure out whose stealing all these packages, as their package was one of several packages being stolen.

I then watched even more episodes and I'm in love with the show. It has such a cute, light-hearted tone and art style. I love the adorable interactions between the sociable Grizz, the pragmatic Ice Bear, and the effeminate Panda.

I can't tell whose my favorite bear: Panda or Ice Bear. Ice Bear is so cute and funny and I relate to his nerdiness so much! But Panda is so cute with his mincing, girly ways, which I relate to as well.

Speaking of effeminacy, We Bare Bears is really important to me on an emotional level. The show gives me a way to feel girly for a little while, and I really like feeling girly.

I wanted to come home to him every day and sit on his lap or hold onto him. I loved his eyes and beard and lips and when he would smile or laugh with me. I wish i could hug him every day again and hear him laugh. I loved the shows he would recommend to me or the way he would touch and kiss me and sleep with me. I just really, really loved him.

 SCENE  VI: 
 Checkmate!

 ReAmazing but true 

Two videos have passed between yesterday and today that convinced me of something I suspected, but had no basis.  It was just my speculation.  Now I am convinced that the coronavirus was purposely propagated by the Chinese themselves.

 At first they were too prepared.  Three weeks after the start of the roll, 14 days and a 12,000-bed hospitals were already under construction.  And they really built them in two weeks.  

Awesome.

Yesterday they announced that they had stopped the epidemic.  They appear in videos celebrating, they announce that they even have a vaccine.  How could they create it so quickly without having all the genetic information?  Well if you are the owner of the formula it is not difficult at all.
 And today I just saw a video that explains how Den Xiao Ping gave the west a half stick.  Due to the coronavirus, the actions of Western companies in China fell dramatically.  China I just hope, when they went down enough they bought them.  Now the companies, Created by the USA and Europe in China with all the technology put in by these exchanges and their capital they passed into the hands of China, which is now rising with all that technological potential and will be able to set prices at will to sell everything they need to the West.  How are you?

 None of this could have happened by chance.  China who cared that a few old men died?  Fewer old-age pensions to pay, but the loot has been huge.  And right now the West is financially defeated, in crisis and stunned by the disease.  And without knowing what to do.

Masterfully diabolic.  It had to be the communists.  |

 How come Russia &amp; North Korea have Low or Zero incidence of Covid- 19 ? 

Is it because they are staunch allies of China

On the other hand USA / South Korea / United Kingdom / France / Italy / Spain and Asia are severely hit

How come Wuhan is suddenly free from the deadly virus? 

China says that the drastic initial measures that they took were very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas

Why Beijing was not hit ? Why only Wuhan? 

It is interesting to ponder upon.. right ? 

Well ..Wuhan is open for business now

Covid - 19 needs to be seen in the backdrop of the arm twisting of China by USA in the trade war

America and all the above mentioned countries are devastated financially 

Soon American economy will collapse as planned by China. 

China knows it CANNOT defeat America militarily as USA is at present THE MOST POWERFUL country in the world. 

So use the virus...to cripple the economy and paralyse the nation and its Defense capabilities. 

I am sure Nancy Pelosi got a part in this.... to topple Trump.... 

Lately President Trump  has always been telling of how the GREAT American economy was improving on all fronts and jobs were coming back to the USA

The only way to destroy his vision of making AMERICA GREAT AGAIN is to create an ECONOMIC HAVOC. 

Nancy Pelosi was unable to bring down Trump through impeachment.....so work along with China to destroy Trump by releasing a virus.

Wuhan's epidemic was a showcase. 

At the peak of the virus epidemic....China's President Xi Jinping...just wore a simple RM1 facemask to visit those effected areas. 

As President he should have been covered from head to toe.....but that was not the case.

He was already injected to resist any harm from the virus....that means a cure was already in place before the virus was released

China's vision is to control the World ECONOMY by buying up stocks now from countries facing the brink of severe ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.....Later China will announce that their Medical Researchers have found a cure to destroy the virus

Now China shall OWN  the stocks of All Western Alliances and these countries will soon be slave to their NEW MASTER..... CHINA",27Mar2020,2

OK I'm finally going to say this. I know this is going to be a bit of jealousy and I hate that I am but I'm pissed off. I was going through google news, and I came across this girl who was playing the Sims 1. I have that game on my google hard drive, on my mega, on my computers. I've been playing video games, doing videos, doing vlogs, doing what the masses are doing and everyone else is getting famous but me. I have been going around trying to get famous off of something.

Genuine famous. Not fake shit. I want people to like my work. I have a few hundred followers but not like this 1 girl I saw. She has over 300k of people that love her videos. You know why? Cause she's a 20 something year old cute girl. That's what it amounts to. No one wants to watch men play video games unless they have already gotten famous.

Markiplier, Pewdiepie, Game Grumps, and more. I'm not going down the list cause there's a lot. My point is that I've been struggling for years and years and years and years and years with no results all because people care about a stupid ass face more than they care about Game Play, more than they care about the video. I do the exact same shit and sometimes better.

I have literally made ""3 minutes or less"" videos doing things people have done on purpose to prove that when I need to find something you will find it. I went on to youtube to find out how to pair 2 things at once, 2 headsets, a dude did a 5 minute video how to do it and here I am going, ""bro get to it!"" I had to skip to like the middle of the video cause he was talking about nothing anyone cared about. So then I saw what it was, I copied it and it worked. Then I said, ""fuck this guy I'm gonna do that video shorter!"" guess what, I did it in a minute explaining and showing and DONE.

I get that you need a certain amount of time from youtube to get it but fuck that.

But yes, to answer that burning question 1 more time, yes I'm fucking jealous of people doing the shit I've been doing for almost 12 years and getting more notoriety than I have gotten. I'm jealous of the fact that no matter what I do I cannot get anywhere on the internet . I try not to beg, I try not to ask for followers, I try not to ask for views, I send my link out and ask people to share it. Do I need to be aggressive with it?

I've done nothing but workout and play Doom Eternal for the last week, and it's been great because it's what I want to do.

157,"I'll get straight to the point. I (17M) have never had a friendship good enough to open up and share my feelings. And now whenever I get close to someone I instantly get utterly terrified I'll lose them. Just in these past 6 months my first emotional friendship started, it's a non-platonic long distance relationship. I met them on discord and I talk to them every day. They love me and tell me they do all the time but there's like, something fundamentally wrong with me. I constantly panic and think that there's this giant plot where all of my online friends secretly hate me and are laughing at me behind my back, even this person with whom I have been romantic with for more than 6 months. I have these thoughts so often and it sucks.

The conspiracy thing isn't new, even when I only had superficial friends a couple of years ago I had this fear that they were all laughing at me behind my back. Now I don't have any friendships in real life, only online. 

I don't even want more friends, I feel fine on my own. I do think that friends would help me, but with this experience with this online person I never want to be friends with anyone more. I'm just constantly in this state of mind where I feel helpless and like I'm losing them. 

I had a great childhood, I have no reason or excuse to be like this. I don't know what's wrong with me and I just want to feel okay every once in a while. Sometimes I even want to go back to the apathetic state of zero friends. Just thinking about losing the few online friends I have hurts so much and I could never handle even more of that.

159,"I live in Louisville, Kentucky. In a third floor attic flat, in a hundred year old house, in a popular area of our downtown. I used to only go to work, come home and cook a nice meal, and walk the dog around the neighborhood. Now, we don’t leave. We can’t. I have a compromised immune system and a heart condition, so I haven’t seen any friends or family in two weeks. 

But that’s okay; I still have enough to make nice meals for myself. I’ve gotten creative with how to exercise the dog. I have a fire escape that I can sit out on, and see all of the little gardens and balconies of my neighbors. I can watch my one neighbor, who takes care of all the neighborhood cats, paint in her garden. I can watch another play with his toddler. Another couple has been sitting on their balcony and playing music together. From my fire escape, everything seems so safe.

And our city seems to be in such high hopes; our governor is being recognized across the nation for his calm and collected demeanor and leadership. Our local businesses are adapting to safer ways to stay open and serve the community, and our people are rallying to support them and others in need. 

The real difference comes at night; I can no longer hear traffic noise. No more music from the nearby bars. No more parties from the local college kids having fun on spring break, or a little last hurrah before finals, or excitement about graduation. There’s even been less noise from the airplanes coming in, and the nightly count of them in the sky, circling for landing at our logistics hub is dwindling every other day. I’ve lived in this city for my entire adult life, and it’s never been this quiet; it would almost be peaceful.

Except for the sirens. Every night, more and more frequently, ambulances seem to be rushing through the city, and helicopters are becoming more frequent. The sirens have always been there, but the silence makes them so much more deafening. Where are they going? What are they responding to? And when they eventually stop, will it be because we’ve beat this thing?

Or because there’s no one left to help?",27Mar2020,1

162,I’ve wanted to be a kart driver in a racing series for a while now and I was going to make my debut this September. I’ve been feeling down recently because of all my current races in a less important championship being cancelled and my  engine exploding after I got screwed by my team. I’ve had a bit of spare time on my hands so I binge watched drive to survive and it all just clicked. I never thought I could be so motivated by a tv show and sure I’ll never get to f1 as I’m starting way too late for that and have too little experience but I can see a future in touring car and LMP racing for myself. I’ve gotten a cohesive plan together to how I’ll approach the season and how I can get my shit together. I know I won’t set the grid on fire since I’m starting from the back for the first three races with a dinosaur of a kart from 2016. But me and Herbie will get through this and I see it as more of a challenge. I’m starting to work out and do a lot of physical training in preparation.

163,"I don't know where else to post this. We got a huge shipment of toilet paper (3 skids, which is big for my store) and instead of putting it on the shelves we were told to lie to customers and say we have none. I asked my manager why and he said 'the reason doesn't matter'. This pissed me off because it was seniors day and lots of frail old people come into the store to buy toilet paper and we have to tell them we don't have any. I asked one of the assistant managers and he said the reason is they want the toilet paper to last all week. 

How does this make sense? The same number of people will get toilet paper (1 per person). The same number of people WON'T get toilet paper. It shouldn't matter if it's put out today or tomorrow...

I did some more digging and it turns out we have a sale tomorrow and the profit margins will be higher. So they are literally withholding a necessity from old people, to make more profit.

The store is **Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada**.

For Canadians, don't be fooled into thinking that Shoppers Drug Mart is handling this crisis well, or that it treats its staff fairly. They've recently announced everybody will receive a $2 raise, and not to sound ungrateful but that's it? **Only $2?** Shoppers Drug Mart and its owner Loblaws is profiting massively off this pandemic. Before COVID-19 our daily sales were ~$30,000 now they are ~$50,000. I can't even imagine how much money people in corporate are making. Where was this raise when Shoppers Drug Mart cut hours but kept the same workload? I have to skip my (unpaid) breaks to get work done sometimes. **This wage increase is nothing more than a PR stunt to give people the impression that Shoppers Drug Mart cares. Don't fall for it.**

People from corporate came in this week to help stock the shelves but it turned out to be a photo-op to show that 'no job is beneath white collar workers' and they left 3 hours in after they got the photo evidence.

My dog Eli was fairly old, we don't know precisely how old because we rescued him 7 or 8 years ago when he was already an adult dog. He was a miniature schnauzer. 

He was behaving normally until yesterday. He threw up both of his meals, but otherwise was acting ok and pooped and peed normally. This morning we awoke to see he had puked on himself again, no blood in the vomit, just puke, despite having not kept any food down in over 24hrs and was very weak, had a hard time getting up, and walking very slowly. He pooped and peed normally. 

We took him to the vet normally, they had a no contact check-up and suggested they put him to sleep. My mom sat on the lawn in front of the vet, wearing gloves and a mask, and held him until he passed. 

We've been in quarantine for 13 days now, my whole family has been very on-edge because of it. This is just such a jab to the heart because it happened so suddenly, 48hrs ago he was acting like his normal self and now he's dead. I feel so weak and vulnerable if my family and I are going to get COVID-19, we're going to get now that we are so weakened by this.

And I have conspiracy theories in the back of my head telling me that the dog somehow caught this horrible zoonotic disease we're all spreading. I have 3 other younger dogs and 1 cat, and I don't want them to get sick too, nor do I want my family (especially my mom who was the dog's closest person by far) to get sick too.

I have been looking for an apartment since january but it's a very hard time to buy a house for a couple of years now.

Just a couple days ago I was scrolling this website where every house for sale in the neighbourhood is on.
And I saw the house for sale where we lived before this house.

It's the house where my daughter was born, where she said her first words, learned to walk and where I spent countless nights singing her back to sleep.
It wass a mess when I moved in and we spend so much time, energy and money to make it our dream home, even though it was just a tiny apartment.
And now that it is for sale again I want to buy it back sooooo bad.

They put up this webpage where you can bid money on the house, and the one who bids the highest will get the house. Now as a soon to be single mom I don't have all the money in the world ofcourse.
Now what usually happens is people wait till the closing day right before the last couple of minutes you can place your last bidding and they all start spamming the site and bid more and more in the hopes of getting it.

The closing date is march 31. I haven't been able to sleep and I'm nervous all day long. I want to move back to that house with all those good memories so bad! But I know I have a really really tiny small chance of actually getting it.

I shouldn't even say it, but I studied computers and I'm very good at everything logical. I have officially 136 IQ, and I score 33/40 at the Mensa pretest. (Just stating the facts)

- universal basic income
- better relations with China
- no more school bullying

I feel like my ego is weak, and I can't take the hit... So I am ""write-only"", as I call it. 

Here's the thing. I'll try to read every reply to this thread, at least until I meet a negative reply... And if this goes well, I'll try more and more to read replies!

Then one day maybe, I will have the means to my ambition. I just want everyone to be free and happy, fed and with a roof of their own...

And that, no matter what you might say, I will never give up! 

I'll read replies *very slowly*, and I can't guarantee any answer at all. 

If you think I would be a bad leader, then do say it, but try not to denigrate everything that I am. I'm sensitive to these deep rebuttals. I swear I just need a little karma and then I will change the face of the world!

I remember the day I went into school, 20 fanfictions at home and 3 more in my backpack and our teachers formally applauded a girl a few grades under me, for publishing her first book, which was a kidsbook. I was so unbelievably jealous. It's always been my dream to do, what she did.

But for the next few years, I procrastinated too much. I've started a few projects. Bad projects, not nearly thought out and outlined, destined to fail. Of course I dropped them.

Then came the time in my life, where my bipolar got a hold of me and for several years I was sure I wouldn't live to see the day of my first book. The progress of working on my mental health put a full stop to my poor tries of producing something of quality.

Now, Covid19 is ruling the world and to not only protect myself, but protect the hospitals and elder people, I decided to completely quarantine myself. During this quarantine, I decided to use my time to study because I'm currently getting my high school diploma. I had to drop out of school in 2016 due to my mental health.

While going through my schoolprojects, I found an old 7-page beginning of a story I wrote over a year ago and just dropped.
Reading through it, made me realise it wasn't that bad. I needed to be tweaked here and there and a lot of editing has to happen, but it has a good outline.

For two days, I've been working on it almost non-stop. I'm currently at 54 completely edited bookpages, while simultaneously sending out two tests for my school. And it feels good.

This doesn't feel like a project I'll drop. It feels like a well thought out concept that's just writing itself. I love it and I feel like my life long dream is getting closer and closer to fulfillment.

The quarantine is the best thing that has happened to me. I'm gonna stay home for the next two months, at least. This is the right time, the right place and the right feeling. I'm so excited.

There were never more than 10 people there at a time and much farther than 6 ft away.

27 M here. I have a strong medical/surgical mask fetish since the days of SARS (grew up in Asia). My teachers, nannies, close female friends often wore masks and I guess thats why I developed the fetish.

I get turned seeing women (properly) wearing a surgical or medical mask. I love the way it muffles their voice and only shows their eyes and covers their nose. I especially like it when they are wearing it because they have a slight cough or flu.

I do not like bandanas, niqabs or any other face covering strangely enough

It has not been too adversely bad on my life, but I have definitely had a mask porn addiction for sometime now. I can spend upwards of 30 minutes a day scouring for medical mask porn or photos of cute beautiful women wearing masks on instagram. I have spent perhaps $2-3k dollars on surgical/medical mask porn over the last 8 or so years.

I have a fiance now and she is moderately supportive of the fetish. She sometimes sends me photos of her wearing a mask and we occasionally have sex when she wears one. Ive had 2 past partnetd whom I've told this fetish to and all have responded with initial mild confusion to being supportive.

Since COVID/Corona hit, its just been so tempting to walk around seeing women wear masks around. Places like the supermarket or the park.

I mean I don't follow them around but I occassionally take a look or peek longer than I should. I am consciously perving out, but its hard to focus not on my fetish when I'm out in public.

I now can spend upwards of 1 hour looking for mask porn.
