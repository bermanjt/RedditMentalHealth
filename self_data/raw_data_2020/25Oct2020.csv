1,"I (23f) find that many guys in my age range (20’s) approach me and then nothing ever succeeds due to their lack of understanding about communication.

I don’t want someone blowing up my phone but I also don’t want texts that are super boring where I feel like I’m carrying the conversation. 


I worked 50 hours and studied 20 units so the “I’m busy” excuse is really tiring and burnt out. 

If the conversation is dragged out for hours, it’s at least appreciated to have CONTEXT and stimulation versus “wyd?” “How’s work?” “Oh what plans do you have tonight” then not replying till the next day.

2,"Kinda want to get this off my chest and see if anyone has something to say. A bit about me is I’m a pretty quiet person with new people unless they begin good conversations with me, I kind of struggle with making new friends , especially close friends. I barely meet new people because all I do rn is go to work/ gym / then relax at home or hang out with friends when we are free. 

At work there was this really pretty and nice coworker, and our conversations flowed so good and upon knowing more about her I find out that we share a lot of the same friends and she actually lives a block away from me, BUT is in a relationship of a couple months now. I became great friends at work with this girl and she now is the reason I look forward to going to work and I now subconsciously am always trying to be with her during work and when we go on break we always sit together. All our coworkers thought we were together till I told them she has a boyfriend, and even they still joke with me like one day she doesn’t show up to work and they all ask me where she is like I’m suppose to know, and when I told her this she found it funny. 

I’ve met her boyfriend and he’s a great guy and we’ve all hung out together as a group outside of work with our friends, or I come over to their place to hang out a lot. I compliment her when I can and make silly jokes with her which she actually laughs and pays attention to our conversations and seems like she enjoys talking to me. I don’t really have any other female friends that I can talk with and joke around with like her. I have complimented her relationship and stuff and I guess she see’s me as a great friend but she is just the actual definition of my type of girl. Her appearance is my exact type of dream girl with body and everything, she’s a party girl which I love because I love to party and she’s just very friendly with everyone and makes me so happy to be around with and best of all she has goals and is a very independent girl.

I can’t get her off my mind and all I want is for her relationship to end so I can ask her out as it looks like I have more in common with her then her actual boyfriend because I invite them to some stuff and she says she’d love to but her bf isn’t into that kinda stuff. She even mentioned an argument they had where he demanded to see her phone and she said that’s the first time their trust in relationship was broken, but like why would she tell me that? I’m guessing she just trusts me or maybe hinting at me? And another time I asked if they were watching this sport game and they said they wereat another friends place so I said have fun , that I could watch it with some other people , and an hour later she texts me saying the plan got cancelled and invited me over to watch it with her boyfriend. Why would she invite a guy friend instead of just watching it alone with boyfriend , she could’ve easily just not tell me the plan got cancelled and I would’ve just imagined they still went.

What can I do? It’s hard to meet new girls and when I do meet new girls from my friends, we just all talk as a group but it’s impossible for me to actually become closer friends with these girls, I only hang out with them when my friends invite them. I get home from work and I just feel so lonely and get sad as now she goes home to her bf and I have to wait for the next day to see her again at work. 

I have many hobbies I do but even when doing them I can’t get it out of my mind how badly I want to be with her and it’s tearing me apart. Wanted to get this off my chest and idk if anyone has some advice or has gone through the same thing?",25Oct2020,1

The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. Is that ok for a 15 year old to see?

16,"Its so, so nice. 

Im not going to sit here and whine that nobody loves me. Im a single mom to one boy and I know where my priorities are, but its been so long since Ive been in a relationship, let alone a ""loving"" one. 

My mom died in June. The three of us lived together for the past 6 years and now with her gone, every day just drags on in this pandemic isolation. I certainly know I have family that cares about me. But its not as if anyone comes by to check on me. Just a few texts from relatives to ask how things are once in a while. I dont always want to be the mopey person that everyone has to be careful around.

I plowed through summer, after the initial grieving period. The sunshine always brightens my spirit no matter whats going on. Now that the cold, gloomy months are setting in, its getting harder to trudge on. My son is missing her more and more. When he cries I cry. Christmas will be here eventually and for the first time Im dreading it as it was a special time of year for my mom. She always went all out.

I digress.


I keep having dreams that someone is nearby who loves me dearly. Its not my mom, not a relative, no one I know. I know they are male but I dont get a glimpse of their face. But I know they love me and understand and are patient, and its unconditional. Ive never felt that before in my life, at least not all of those things at once. I cant even desrcribe the feeling. Its light, and unburdened. A deep level of trust, which is unfamiliar. It might even bring tears to my eyes if I think about it too much.",25Oct2020,1

It's funny how fake internet gangster say 6ix9ine's a snitch, he's a rat, he's a pedophile, he's a bitch ass nigga. YET, if they were in his situation it would be different. People really don't have empathy and they don't give a fuck about what you've been through, they don't give a fuck that you're human. Everyone hates this man and it pisses me off because the ignorance is crazy. No one takes ANYTHING into consideration. If you make 1 mistake it's over. That's why I never want to be famous or popular because there's too many dumbasses that are quick to hate just to hate.

People make fun of me because I didn't grow up in the hood or projects and I sound like I grew uo with money, I sound educated and sound like I have morals. Yet It doesn't make me black enough. I can't help the way I am. Just because I didn't grow up in the ghetto, talk unproper, have a record, and say nigga alot doesn't make me ""not black enough"".

27,"I can't really afford therapy at the moment and I don't know who else to talk to about this.

I deal with ptsd, adhd, bipolar2, general and social anxiety   and I've had a shifty childhood that makes it hard to trust or open up to anyone.

I've been in a relationship for about 6 months with bf(21) and friends with him 9 months before. 
It started great until it felt like he was constantly hiding something from me. He always hid his phone when someone texted him or of a sexual photo of his friend showed up in his news feed on snapchat and instagram.
He said this girl was his best friend and was only friends with her. We go to a party she invited him to and he spent most of his time with her and the girls only. He left me too, by myself.

I confronted him about it and everything was okay again for a while. Until this coworker at our job continously flirted with him, always calling him cute, pretty boy, petting his hair and hugged him from behind even after finding out we were dating. I told bf it bothered me and he shrugs it off saying she's like that with everyone else. And then proceeded to add her on Facebook and liking her pics. 
I told him it feels like I can't trust him and he storms off without telling me during lunch break and continued to ignore me until the final break. We talked again, he apologized not considering my feelings about the flirting situation.
But even so as time passed he barely seems interested in me anymore. I know people are busy sometimes or have something going on but, when it's more than a couple weeks and barely a sentence of a response makes me feel like I'm not worth his time. I see him online all the time not bothering to respond to something I said over 8 hours ago. 
Even when I'm at his place he's more into playing videogames and only pays attention to me when he's horny. Afterwards he barely touches or cuddles me and goes back to gaming or whatever.

I asked him if he was even interested me at all and he says yes and asks why. I tell him he barely talks to me and it feels like he doesn't want to be with me anymore.
He accused me of trying to find something wrong with the relationship and says he gives me enough of his attention when I'm over at his place. 
BTW, he sleeps like 80% of the time when I'm there, and plays games  or is on phone 15% and spends the 5% with me. 
At this point I'm drained of trying to make it work, it feels like he only wants to be with me on his own time. 
Or he's a little too rough with me, I tell him to stop or say ow but he tells me to stop being a baby.
I don't know if he's playing with me at this point, no matter what I say he mocks me or says calls me 'bitch' or 'cunt'. I'm no stranger to joking around but when it's constant, it really starts eating at my confidence.

So basically, last night I had a Dream, although I guess it was more of a nightmare. There were a bunch of random things that didn’t really make sense, but hey, that’s dreams for ya. 

Anyways, near the end of my Dream, it basically ended with my being trapped in a hospital where I was kept against will, and forcibly injected with some kind of drug. I don’t know why. But what I remember most clearly is that I would often ask to see my family. The doctor took me back to a room where I was forced to stay alone and kept locked in. Before leaving he told me I would never see my family again. 

Now, this was one of those dreams which I hue stilt thought was real. Like, I’ll have some dreams where I know I’m dreaming, and some which are just random and don’t really bother me.

In this knee however, I remember feeling extremely scared and panicked, and I’m not even kidding when I say I thought it was real.

When I woke up, I robs my spent around thirty minutes lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, forcing myself to calm down. 

I felt really anxious when I woke up, which ended up putting me into a sour mood the entire day. 

Anyways, it was just a couple minutes ago that I realized just how lucky I am to have them. I mean sure, we argue and we have our disagreements, but I love my family so much and wouldn’t give them up for almost anything else in the world.

39,"When I was 18 and considering which feild I wanted to study, I remember stumbling upon a Ted talk video about how passion is not important and you need to have discipline. I remember resonating a lot with that video, I utterly believed that you don't need to do what you love to succeed, passion doesn't bring you a good result but discipline and hard work are what guarantee the good results. And I picked my university feild not out of pure love and passion, just out of convenience and believing that effort is what's going to make a difference. I'm in my fourth year now, I'm not entirely miserable and I don't fully regret my decision, I know that given my life circumstances even if I ended up studying what I really loved I wouldn't be completely happy. But I realize now that passion is what keeps you away from burning out, it's what pushes you one step further out of your comfort zone. With discipline you will always get to a point where you just say ""fuck it, it's not worth it"". But with passion, you love what you're doing so much you can't simply turn your back away from it and say ""fuck it"".
I know it's stupid that the thing that moved these feelings in me and inspired me to write here is the song ""Non stop"" from the musical Hamilton.

44,"So I’m a 2nd year college student. I’m learning jack shit in my classes. My chosen degree is to do 3D modeling, digital design, etc. kinda stuff. But I really don’t feel like I’m learning anything with my class I’m taking for it this semester. Don’t even start with my other classes, they’re fucking jokes. One of them is literally a 10 question open book quiz (aka Google) each week and that’s it.

So I’m in college basically because of the “you need to go to college if you don’t want to work at McDonald’s for the rest of your life” reason. I’ve won no scholarships, so it’s being paid for by FAFSA and my mom. But I feel little interest in college and I’m either just half-assing my way through or just looking up answers to things.

So in all it feels like a waste of time and money. Ok, let’s assume I drop out. What then?

I currently work at a grocery store deli weekends only. Part of last summer I worked part time throughout the week there when I was first hired. I mean, I’m capable of doing the job, but I don’t feel much motivation to actually do it. I still do what’s expected of me, but that’s because if I don’t keep the job or do something else, my mom will force me to work for her home restoration company, which is fucking hard work, and I wouldn’t say I’m in the most fit condition to do it. I had to do it for two weeks before I got my current job and I felt like I was gonna die doing it. I was outside in 90 degree heat for several hours most days going through several liters of water. I REALLY don’t want to do that kind of work.

But even if I looked for another job, I don’t know what it would be. I feel like there must be something I could do I would have at least some semblance of enjoyment in, but then again, I feel like I have very little motivation to do any sort of work.

Before I started working last summer, I came out to my mom as feeling kinda suicidal. Actually I completely broke down and bawled my eyes out, something I hadn’t done in years. It was more along the lines of losing will to live kinda thing, not actually attempting it. I don’t want it to come to that but I feel lost and don’t know any other way to go. My mom said working would help me feel better about myself, what a load of bullshit. I feel the same as ever except working slightly distracted me from how I was feeling for some time. Recently that feeling has returned. I don’t believe I’m in any imminent danger to myself though. I just feel really depressed sometimes.

I don’t know what to do. I either am going to college, which feels like a waste of money and time, or force myself to work when I have little will to do so, and it feels like I’m wasting my life doing that too. My hobbies aren’t anything productive so I don’t think they could help me in finding what to do with my life. I’m well aware I’ve been given so much in my life, but that doesn’t mean I am happy and have it all together. I don’t want to throw that away either, but I just feel like I can’t do anything else.

I’m not really sure what I expected to get out of this post. I just felt like posting it. I guess any  advice would be nice, but I’m not really sure what anyone can say to me to help. I don’t think a therapist would help either. What would they do besides sit there and listen to me ramble on about the same shit as in this post. I went to therapy for depression before and it never really helped, but I stopped going because I saw it as a waste of time and I eventually grew out of that phase. I always thought that while I was with the therapist I was wasting his time from helping others with *real* issues. Back then my problems weren’t as bad as they are now, but I think maybe now I do have real issues and probably need some sort of help. I just don’t know what could help me.",25Oct2020,1

Yesterday and today I've spent a lot of time in this room, just sitting against the wall thinking. In reality I was sitting on my bed, sitting or pacing in the shower, and busy at work, but I've just been imagining myself there instead of focusing on reality because it feels like my own safe room.

Nobody except me knew this room existed until I posted this. I just wanted to know what others thought of it. Do you think this is normal? Do you have your own version of this? What do you think of this?",25Oct2020,1

50,"I have no real friends and I know it. Not the “they care about you more than you think they do!” Kind. And it’s only my fault because I can’t be vulnerable. My mom would be happy to get my life insurance money.

I’m not suicidal, but some of us really could die tomorrow and no one would care. A couple people might be like, “aw, really?”, but their lives wouldn’t change at all. It’s like I don’t exist.

Some people find it so hard to believe that to be true, but it just is. No, there isn’t a single person that would care if I just disappeared one day. It’s not exaggeration or hyperbole or my thoughts being clouded by depression. It’s just reality. Ngl it really sucks. I’m not looking for advice, I’ve been in counseling since the age of 11.

51,"I'm a professional athlete, who when there were at college was falsely accused of sexual assault and wasn't treated to any sort of fair due process during that time
This caused me to have to leave the school I was attending and turn pro much earlier than I expected.
I am now it a place where I want to start branding myself, however I feel like this part of my career is shrouded in mystery for the people that are not close to me. I recently did an interview where the my college career is mentioned and I stayed v light on the subject (mainly as I don't know if this will affect me if I wanted to pursue something legally in the future). However, while I don't want this incident to be my identity, I also don't like the idea of having past filled w ambiguity that people can say whatever they like about.
Is it smart to address this issue head on as I have nothing to hide, I was just done so wrongly by the school I was attending or would it be better to just keep things shrouded and left alone",25Oct2020,1

54,"Hi all, 

I work in retail and so does my boyfriend. I have two jobs so I’m around a hundred or so different employees every week. Masks are “required” but you’re not required to wear them over your mouth or nose. I try to social distance but both stores get very crowded and one store actually requires me to be 1-2ft away from customers even if they aren’t wearing masks. 

I feel guilty every time I am at work. There are so many people that do not wear masks and I know that logically I can’t do anything about it. Logically I know that it isn’t my fault if they get sick because they choose not to wear a mask. 

I am so scared of being the reason someone gets sick or dies. I don’t visit any of my family or friends who have underlying health concerns and if I do visit a friend we either stay outside 6ft apart or I wear a mask. I always wear my masks correctly and avoid being within 6ft of others even with a mask when I’m not at work. 

I’m struggling to understand what my personal responsibility is here. I can’t be the sole person responsible for the health of a medium sized city. Is it my fault if I catch covid at work from a customer not wearing a mask and then unknowingly transmit it to other customers who aren’t wearing masks? What if I give it to my boyfriend (the only person I don’t social distance from)?",25Oct2020,1

76,"I'm 46, I grew up in the late 70s and 80s. I remember when I was young I would have my mom paint my fingernails and she would make me hide it from my dad. I wouldn't understand until many years later, I just accepted it. My parents wouldn't let me wear pink because it was a ""girl"" color and my dad's friends would always ask me when I was going to get a girlfriend. When I was around 10 I was caught playing doctor with my best friend, his mom walked away shaking her head and made me go home. We used to hold hands, kiss, show each other our privates, all the things 10 year olds do. They moved shortly after the ""doctor incident"", it was the first time I remember crying because of emotional pain. 

In 8th or 9th grade I remember watching MTV and saw 2 guys kiss. It was the first time I'd ever seen it or even knew it was a thing. I remember it was controversial at the time, showing same-sex affection. My closest friends had always been guys and I would fantasize about kissing them. Around this time my best friend with whom I spent all my free-time suddenly stopped hanging out with me. I didn't understand until years later he told me it was because he got a boyfriend and the boyfriend was jealous of me. In 10th grade I got my first girlfriend, lol all my friends were doing it. She broke up with me because I was prude. I was constantly badgered in high school about being a virgin and eventually lost it to a girl on a dare. I still liked boys. 

I discovered drugs and alcohol around this time. I became homeless at 19 and my parents would only take me back if I joined the church to become sober. So I did. And like any good addict, I fully embraced spirituality and all the tenets of 1990's fundy religious culture. I went hardcore into evangelical christianity in my 20s, earned a degree in church ministry, and worked as a youth pastor at a large megachurch for 5 years. I married when I was 29, not exactly sure why other than it was a part of the culture of the church and it's what you do when you're a single youth pastor. She was a devout fundy and still is to this day. The church loved it but like the song says, I was saying all the right things at exactly the right time but it meant nothing to me and I didn't know why. I was burned out and left the ministry around this time, I also started drinking and getting high again. 

I was married for 10 years. I don't want to share much about my marriage other than it was loveless, sexless, and transactional. We have 2 kids that I adore and love more than anything in the world. We've been divorced for 5+ years and I have them 50% of the time. 

So anyways I'm and still discovering who I am and learning about my sexuality. I had my first boyfriend. I love guys who run down the road shirtless and crush on black guys. I'm attracted to masculine women; Ruby Rose is my TV girlfriend. I'm a top with men but a bottom with women.

84,"I sit here, on a Sunday. The thought of work tomorrow flickers through my head as I get ready to get high and do yoga. I spend my mornings on the weekend stretching and meditating. Sometimes I drink coffee prior to starting. Sometimes I just let my head buzz with the recent opacity of smoke inhalation. Everything becomes murky, the edges of my life and in my mind softening. I flick the lighter, and I breathe in. Afterwards, I go to the bathroom and wash my hands, hating the tell tale smell of lingering smoke. The panic about tomorrow starting to recede. 

I hate my job. And it scares me, because I am not sure if I would hate every job. Would there ever be anything out there that is right for me? An overgrown Peter Pan. Job hopping every two years learning the ropes somewhere else. Law school because I was too bored and uninspired to follow any other path in life. Years later, and here I am. Still undecided about what I want to be when I grow up. Is it as pathetic as it feels, or am I just noticing something that everyone I know is not? Analysis paralysis stiffens my joints, my sap drying to immutable resin. 

Is middle management the pinnacle of life in my early 30's? What happens when that sleep of death takes me? What dreams may come when I have shuffled off this mortal coil. What if this is all there is. Would I be ok with that? Am I ok with that?

Stuck in this loop of what's next. Chasing after high heel dreams, closets in every color of the rainbow. Is that really what matters to me?

Sometimes I catch myself staring at my face in the mirror. Assessing what others see first when they see me. Do I look happy? I think often that I look sad. Bored. Yet I rarely fight back against the people in my life who frustrate me. I rarely fight back against working in a job I abhor. Living a life I cannot say feels fulfilled. Why does it take me so long to scream out how I feel. As far as others go, that is something I admire most. 

I roll out my mat, and I put on my headphones. I start, breathing in, breathing out, with each of my movements. For a while mind, heart, and body beat as one. When I'm done, I feel wrung out like a sponge. The lactic acid of stress and anxiety filling me up every day, finally releasing until they start their slow build again. 

I close my eyes and breathe in and out, in my mind saying my first, middle, and last name to myself with every inhalation and exhalation. I picture my thoughts like cars on a highway; instead of chasing them I pull up a chair on the side of the road and I watch them go by. I feel empty, like you could rattle around my chest inside, a sound emerging like dragging a gong around a Tibetan bowl. 

Like I do every time, I emerge from my cocoon. Listing ten things in my head that I am grateful for; five that have happened already; five things that I want to have happen. 

And I wonder still - am I close? To something? To everything all at once? Happiness. Peace. Fulfillment. Not all who wander are lost. But I am. Anyone else?",25Oct2020,1

86," Using my throwaway account for obvious reasons. It is going to be a long post.

2012 - India

My story starts 8 years back when I was 16 years old(Male) and had a great social group in my colony (where I lived). At that time 2 girls who were my neighbours joined our social group and played badminton/soccer with us. That's when I started to like one of them(13 years old). We interacted on daily basis and I fell for her. I used to tease her and said that I like a girl and will probably ask her out any day. I got to know that one of my closest friend(let's call him X) also liked her.

He asked her out and she denied him.

10-15 days later, we both had skipped school and started texting, when she asked me about the girl I liked. I confessed that it was her and then I proceeded to ask her out. At first, she resisted(Conservative family), but she said yes. We started meeting daily to just sit together quietly holding each other's hand. But, most parts of our conversation took place on text(SMS). But I loved her. She told me she didn't love me but liked me. It went on great for 3-4 months and she reverted and said she loved me too. We used to meet in the Basement/terrace and hugged/kissed each other every day. But at that time she was going through some personal problems(her father had died when she was 8 years old and she used to miss him, her friends used to ignore her), but I was not able to understand the intensity of her emotional problems. I was over the clouds and started taking her for granted. Sometimes she used to tell me her problems but I used to belittle/not understand exactly what she was going through. I had no intention of ignoring her, but I just didn't understand her problems well enough. After all this, she talked to me even though some days I ignored her. She also did self-harm(I was not aware). Once I even confessed that I liked another girl but never made a move on her. But then I got to know that, she also talked to X(read para1) on a weekly basis. So I started talking to her again, and listened to her and provided her support as and when needed(Very selfish of me).

I was in 12th grade at the time and I failed one of my prelim exam 6-8 months before my board exams(equivalent to US SATs). My parents also got to know that we were in a relationship, but they didn't pressurise me, but also didn't encourage me of my relationship with her. But I didn't communicate this to her as I was ashamed of my failure in the exam.

2013

Our relationship continued, but there was a communication gap. I started studying hard for my board exams, eventually, I talked to her less and less. She still was going through emotional problems and once she showed me cuts on her palms, which she did intentionally(self-harm). But even then, I didn't understand the intensity/severity of her mental/emotional turmoil. I know I come out as a bad guy, but it wasn't my intention, I was just fucking immature to understand any of this.

But she didn't know that I had failed my prelim exams and still didn't tell her.

I also studied harder for my exams and cut contact with her 1 month before my Final exams(didn't tell her the reasons). I was under the impression that she would wait for me until my exams are over.

As soon as my exams got over, I thought I will communicate with her maturely. Before I could take any step, she broke up with me on the text. A month later, I got to know she is with X guy(read para1-the guy who asked her out before me).

I was devastated. I loved her. Even after the breakup, I had to see her daily and it killed me to think that she is with my best friend(i stopped talking to him too). But I resisted.

2015

My life went on and thought that I was over her, I had to see her every day and had small talk with her. (She was still with X). But my feelings for her never went away.

Then came a new neighbour, let's call him Y(Male). I introduced Y to my ex. I told Y everything about my relationship with my ex. They started talking to each other. I told Y, to ask her about me, whether she misses me or not. I told Y to set me up with her. Voila. She started talking to me again. But she still was with X. I asked her why we broke up &amp; what she thought about whose fault it was. She told me that I was not with her when she needed me the most, and it was my fault that we broke up. This all was conveyed on Whatsapp. I said sorry to her, she said it was fine, but I know she didn't mean it(Also conveyed on Whatsapp).

After 2 months she broke up with X. Y started talking to her more. But I trusted Y being one of my closest friends at that time. Me and my ex grew distant again.

2016/2017/2018/2019 - We talked every 6 months but I was busy with my life and so didnt bothered her. But at the back of my mind, I still had a feeling for her. I met many girls but didnt feel for anyone as I had felt with her.

I was pursuing Chartered Accountancy course(One of the hardest course in India) and again drowned myself in studying for 4 years. I went into deep depression from 2017-2019(for various other reasons such as study load/hypochondria/extreme low self confidence-as I was bullied in 7/8th grade). The doctor prescribed me antidepressants, but still, to this day no one knows that I was bullied for 2 years(which I think caused me extreme low self-confidence/hypochondria).

I was not in contact with either my Ex or Y(neighbour).

She never messaged or texted me.

2020

I WhatsApp'd her in March, but she didnt respond, we talked for 5-10 mins but nothing special.

Then came lockdown but we didnt talk. Was coming out of depression gradually.

After lockdown, I saw her again, and ALL the feeling came rushing back to me. I fell into depression again. But this time with the thought that I will never be with again even though I loved her so much and she didnt reciprocate. I will never be able to love someone as much as I did. I started regretting that it was because of me that we broke up. Had I not shown such immaturity I would still be with her. I started crying every night.

I contacted Y. I told him everything I was feeling. But he said that it won't happen again and forget her, its been a long time. Y confessed that he has feelings for her too. It crushed me again. At that point started having thoughts of him &amp; her being together and made me extremely anxious again.

I don't know what to feel. I don't understand why I am not able to get over her even after all these years. Is it love? Is it because of loneliness? Is it infatuation(Extremely charming girl)?

It also hurts to think that when she went with X(Old close friend), she never apologized or conveyed/acknowledged to me.

I miss being close to her and holding her hand. I miss seeing her face. She still is the most charming/beautiful girl I have ever met.

Would really love some great advice on what I should do?

Really hoping to get some replies here.

TL;dr - My Ex broke up with me 7 years ago, because of my mistake. I have to see her weekly/daily basis as she lives in my society/colony. Sometimes I think I love her. Sometimes I think its infatuation/regret/loneliness. But I still miss her to this day. Don't know what to feel.",25Oct2020,1
87,"How is that the media conglomerates of the world are censoring and oppressing ANY view point that goes against what they want? How is it that for four years 95% if any publication has been negative (for Trump?) How is that false claims, anonymous sources, and items with no evidence are broadcasted wall to wall for months, BUT the device from hell (you know what I’m talking about) is being actively censored?

Do we really think we’re any better than Nazi Germany when we start removing people with voices and dissenting opinions? I hear all the time that the right is fascist. I believed this for the longest time.

That is, until I realized what the definition of fascism actually was. And you know who fits the bill? Anyone on the left.

I wouldn’t have ever considered voting for Trump until the media wouldn’t cover this laptop story.

It’s no where on Reddit. Twitter is locking and removing accounts that post about it. Facebook as well. Google hides and actively manipulates data.

At what point do we decide as Americans that we don’t want to be lied to? Why is it when the FBI confirms the validity of the scandal that every news publication carrying any kind of narrative decries their decree as false?

I can’t, in good faith, support the actual fascists any longer. I’m voting from Trump.",25Oct2020,1
88,"So this whole pandemic has left schools scrambling to figure out new ways they can make sure all their students reach their education goals and let's say not all of them have made the transition smoothly.

I constantly see pictures on Reddit of getting the wrong answer on online quizzes because the teacher put in the answer wrong or classes where the teacher tries to record their whiteboard and no one can see it.

But in my case, I think I've had a better experience than a lot of other students. I'm submitting all of my assignments on time, I'm understanding the material better, and I don't feel scared to ask questions during classes.

I think this is because, with Zoom, I can turn off my webcam whenever I feel the need to stop sitting down and walk around (My ADHA can make sitting in a class a bit unbearable at times), though I understand a lot of students may have teachers that require them to have their webcams on during class.

I also have a lot of extra free time as I no longer have to take the hour-long train and bus ride to and from campus every week, which also lets me pick up more hours at work and saves me a bunch in the fare.

Finally, probably the best thing I've noticed. Mid-terms and exams are a lot less stress-inducing. No longer do I have to write THREE essays in the span of an hour and a half, now I have like 1 or 2 days to submit them. This is a GODSEND.

So overall, I'm having a much better time doing schoolwork with this online set-up. This is just my personal experience and I know a great many students aren't having the same type of experience as me.",25Oct2020,1
89,"So I have a question for everyone in this subreddit. I’m sure plenty of you guys and gals have had plenty of issues with family and what not. I’ve had issues with my father for the past 21 years. He has crippled my mental health and I do not know how to get better. I’m seeing a therapist through the university I go through to try to get better. Due to this constant verbal beat down from him, my grades have plummeted and I have developed depression and anxiety disorders. I want things to be fixed of course. Unfortunately he is the type to only see things through his eyes and never see a different position. He has almost put hands on my sister and my mother before. This was years ago but it shows the kind of person he is. He has another son who is 16yrs older than I am and he is the favorite by far. He wanted me aborted at the beginning of my mother’s pregnancy and he would not give me his name for about a month and due to this stress my mom stopped producing milk for me after a month of having me. Just a month. He has had it out for me since the beginning of my existence. Even an embryo. He is now setting down ultimatums about things that are not nearly as important as our relationship is. I am tired of doing everything to make him happy and I’m tired of shaking every time I see his name pop up on my phone. I cannot play this game anymore. He has also made me suicidal. My own father didn’t want me why would I want to be here? This is not a cry for help, this is not me seeking attention. This is me seeking help.

90,"So I met this guy online, we talked. But for the first few days I sensed that he doesn’t wanna talk or get involved with me after our long ass phone call. But as a girl who doesn’t quit, I tried flirting with him. And yes, I think I got him, we flirted and SOP until midnight. Gawd he is so good with it. But then PLOT TWIST, I did that just for fun. I don’t wanna get involved either. I just want to talk and maybe have some fun. He asked me if we can do it and date already. 

Now after I got what I wanted, I don’t know what to do. How can I break it to him that I only wanted him as a friend. Seriously, right now, I wanted us to be friends. Please suggest, I don’t wanna leave him hanging or what. I still have a heart, really..",25Oct2020,1

94,"I (27F) am living alone for the first time and I noticed that I really enjoy it. My mind feels so peaceful.

However, when my partner (30M) comes in, sometimes I get so stressed and all my energy gets zapped right out of me. It's not his fault and I do enjoy spending time with him, it's just exhausting. 

There's a thing that he does where he'll sing all the time. Cooking and singing. Showering and singing. Lying in bed and singing. He's a bit of a metalhead, so he'd start screaming. Then, I'd try to have a conversation with him and he's singing and screaming over me. When I'm around that much noise, it makes my head throb and I just wanted to cover my ears and cry until it stops. Even thinking about it right now is making my eyes water.  

I've recently noticed that I'm very sensitive to noise in the home space. When I used to live with my parents, my dad is partially deaf, and he shouts everything. Whenever he spoke to me inside the house, my ears would start to throb and my head would feel like it was about to explode. Weirdly enough, I'm fine outside the home.

98,"I started college straight out of high school and ended up dropping out my first semester and taking an unintentional gap year. I didn't know what I was doing or what I wanted out of college and I wasn't making friends and it just got to me in a really bad way. Afterwards I returned and things were going okay, I still wasn't making friends at all but I was at least attending my classes and passing them. Then I transferred to another university to finish my degree, and suddenly it was like my first semester all over again. I chose computer science as a major just because I remember liking AP Comp Sci in high school, but I absolutely loathe it now. I don't know what else I'd choose but I felt like I needed to choose something to give my parents the impression I was progressing. After all, I took a gap year, so I was a year behind at that point. That ended up being a terrible idea on my part. I've been ""attending"" for about a year now and I've literally only passed 2 classes, everything else I either completely gave up in or just dropped out of discouragement and disinterest. I've wasted thousands of dollars on tuition and I every semester I go in with the same mindset that I'll make things different but then I'm reminded of how much I hate my major and how alone I feel and I just can't focus. I haven't spoken to a single classmate or professor my entire time there, I feel like a complete outsider and unworthy to be a student. I'm too embarrassed to try and make friends because then I'd feel obligated to lie to them about how my academic life is, I'm too scared to tell people how it really is because 1. who wants to hear about my problems and 2. who wants to be friends with someone like me?

Then there's my parents who have no idea that I'm like this. I lie to them that things are fine and that I'm graduating in a year because I'm afraid of how they'd react to know how things actually are. I live with them still and commute to and from campus, they feed me and let me stay with absolutely no obligation on my part but to be schooling and I can't even do that properly. It's gotten to the point that just being around them makes me feel horrible because I feel like they'll ask about school and I know I'll just lie again and make things worse. 

I'm not really looking for advice when I post this, but this has been my life for the past 5 years and I feel like I'm approching the point the truth will come out, and I'm afraid. I know it's my fault and this post will probably just come off as pathetic, but I've been feeling especially hopeless lately. I haven't worked in a year (I quit my last job becuase of a wrist injury and just haven't found the will to apply as aggresively as I should) and I just spend all my days listening to music and playing videogames. I actually had multiple interviews in the past 2 weeks and literally none of the jobs I got.

I haven’t visited Reddit in a while. I created my account with the aim to get out of my comfort zone and search for some friends online more than a year ago.
Today I received a notification that it’s been a whole year since this account was made and it made me look back at all those things. 
I am proud of myself. I am happy. I was able to find some great people. 
In fact, I was able to find a person who became my best friend. A person who reminds me every day about how beautiful a life can be. Since the beginning, nothing ever felt forced. We are just potatoes doing potato things and I am so grateful for that. I feel so lucky, having some amazing people in my life.
I can honestly say that even when times are bad and I feel terrible, I always find the happiness. Slowly, step by step. 

I hope you all are doing good and will eventually find your way back to happiness. If you are struggling, know that it might take a while, but it’s there, waiting for you to reach it.

But I simply cannot understand how she didn’t think at the time how demeaning this would be and how much she would regret it. Which I read that she now does. I am not in any way against nudity, pornography, freedom of expression. But why on earth a serious model would do this for a stupid pop video.  It doesn’t add anything artistically at all in my opinion. Just her boobies shaking.  If it was a video for Playboy and she got paid real well I would say good for her.

104," 

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'll try to recount everything from my perspective, I would really appreciate some honest answers on this as I've been desperately trying to wrap my brain around it.

So I meet this man, and for the first month its a whirlwind of dating (lunches, dinners, sleepovers, hiking, etc.) and sex. Lots of really great sex. Everything is fine til the last few times we see each other.

List of incidents:

\-For context, we've seen each other at least 10 times prior to all of this. One time he snapped at me for hugging him one morning, saying I was needy like his dog and was stressing him out so much. This was without any warning, but of course I stepped back and respected that boundary.

\-He gave me chlamydia, and disappearing for a week until *I* asked how *he* was. When I confronted him about not checking up on me, he said he felt really embarrassed.

\-The second to last time we saw each other he immediately started saying my 'anxiety' was stressing him out and making him react in a very negative way. I felt super calm with him, so again, I was confused. He later apologized and said he was cranky and overtired. Then after this I saw him last night, we had great sex and conversation, and started opening up a bit more. We had a ton of banter which I guess made him reach a breaking point. We were on the couch holding hands and he suddenly gets up and starts raising his voice saying I'm stressing him out so much and he needs to take me home, and 'how many times he needs to bash \[my\] head in before I realize that enough is enough' (mind you he has NOT gotten physically violent with me). He proceeds to take me home with music blasting and at a very high speed. We get to my house and he apologizes for raising his voice while still raising it, and I apologize for joking with him so much and realized how much that could have upset him. As he usually does, he then belittled my interpersonal skills and said I have zero emotional intelligence and don't know how to interact with people or my limits and that I have 'so much to learn'. I bring up the times he's made me feel really low and he got even more upset saying I'm just doing tit for tat. Then he said he needed to go home and get a pain killer and how he can't imagine this would ever progress.

I think what worries me the most is that the times he blew up there was zero warning sign and zero communication beforehand, he just suddenly starts raising his voice and accusing me of having really bad energy and making him feel uncomfortable. Is this my fault? Or is this just a sick power dynamic? And am I right in feeling confused or do I just keep messing up?

TL; DR: the man I'm dating has blown up at me multiple times and I'm not sure if it's my fault",25Oct2020,1

107,"I’m a woman in the early twenties and I don’t know if I’m ready for relationships. I was never a girl that got to parties, partly because I was ashamed, I’ve never felt pretty, and also because I’ve never had much company.

I think I’m lesbian, I definitely am attracted to women, and I think I’ve tried to block this from my mind since I was a kid due the repression I was goind to face if that was true (that’s also my psychologist opinion) and that made me guard myself from the world. The first person that I ever talked about myself is my psychoanalyst, and I think that not being able to have a true conversation about myself made me never have a strong friendship with anyone. I’ve had friends but none that could resist time, we always just stopped speaking.

Some years ago I gave my first kiss to a guy just to know that I wasn’t someone that never kissed, but it didn’t happened again.

Recently a girl have shown interest in me and besides not liking her, that kind of lead me to this area of my life and I’ve been more concerned about how I look. I wasn’t really ugly lol but I never took care of myself to look my best, and that’s something that happens to teenagers so I feel that I’m really late to this manner.

I try my best to be kind to everyone, help them out as much as I can, give my all even if it makes me worn out, not because I’m supposed to but because I want to. 
No I’m not looking for any kind words in return when I do all of this neither I want to be praised for it. But please don’t call me selfish. 
I’m sorry but I’m losing faith in being kind to one another. Sometimes I feel being bad is so much better. People don’t expect anything from you.. even when they call you selfish it doesn’t matter because you really are.

113,"I've always had complicated relationships with people. I'm an idealist by nature, so imperfections, misunderstanding and indifference hurt me a lot during childhood and teenage years. I also had some anger issues, so it was lots of drama.

But time flew, I became more emotionally stable, self-confident and less needy. Now I have another problem. I don't give a fuck. I stopped falling in love completely. I don't miss people. When I meet someone who's interesting for me, it doesn't last long. Once I get to know them well, they start to irritate me. I become cold and detached.

Having pleasant conversations and spending time with those you like is still important for me, but I can't, because I don't like anyone enough (except my best friend).
