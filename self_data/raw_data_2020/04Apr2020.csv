0,I am struggling with this urge to cut of my earlobe. I know this sounds silly but i'm just really stressed right now. This isn't the first time i have had urges either and and has been quiet for a good while until now. I have never done self-mutilation so why the hell is this happening? Please help me.,04Apr2020,1
1,"Few data ago it was confirmed I have epilepsy. I was immediately prescribed, as I call it, “brain medicine” 

At first the side effects weren’t so bad. Side effects the medicine had were, nausea, loss of appetite, sleepiness, anxiety, headaches, sometimes an increase in seizures, personality changes/aggression, etc. 

At first I just felt like I was holding up a 100 ton elephant with my head. I just had to put down my head. I went to sleep.  Next morning I took the following dose. It felt different. I didn’t feel much at all. That night I had the next dose. I felt sleepy but not as sleepy as the night before. 

Currently this mornings dose though... 

I feel so sleepy, so nauseous I’m literally about to throw up, a huge throbbing headache, kinda weak but I think that might be the sleepiness. And fuck I feel so god damn full. It feels like I’m about to burst open except I haven’t eaten anything at all today. 

A few times since starting the medication I’ve lost my temper for no reason normally I’m really patient and calm but idk..

I wanna sleep to make this go away but at the same time it’s all I’ve been doing and I hate it so much but then again, I don’t want to live through this. Idfk feel me? 

Then I’m so god damn horny I don’t think that’s the pills though. It’s been a while with this corona BS going around.",04Apr2020,1
2,"Just what the title says, isolation getting too much for me especially since I just got out of my most serious relationship with a girl I actually fucking cared about and was in love with for once, family isn’t helping and my brother just keeps taking me to parties where I make poor decisions with drugs and alcohol. Usually I just get mad when something shitty happens but I’ve just been so fucking s a d  for weeks and I don’t know if I can really handle it, I can’t even take my emotions and put them to work because gyms are closed.

4,"He broke it off with me over a year ago.

I gave him everything. Stayed and supported him through so much. 

He spent 2019 going from loving me, to not, to i need you, to I don't love you anymore. It's been killing me. There's so much to say.

He screamed at me today that he wants nothing romantic with me, won't ever love me and nothing will change. Yet he still talks to me. Yet he calls me once or twice a day.

If you don't care or love someone, an ex, then why stick around? We live in different countries, too, we were going to see each other before all this shit happened, just so I could get closure. 

When I broke up with my first I didn't want him in my life anymore. He tells me he won't regret ever breaking up with me, or me no longer being in his life, despite all the pain he caused me and all I gave him.

Yet I'm fucking stuck. I hate it. I don't want to be.",04Apr2020,1
5,"So what’s up, I’m 100% not gay hooked up with four chicks and it’s the hardest my cock ever gets. But I was just curious does everyone have gay thoughts? I know I have had them, even though I’m not gay but I’ve thought about it. I was wondering if everyone has had these and that is why people who really hate gays and think they should burn in hell are a part of this group. And it’s just that they are too ashamed that they’ve had them so they take it out on people who are actually free with their self. Idk I’m pretty drunk and high but it just made me think do the people who hate the gays the most hate them just cuz they have had these thoughts and don’t want people to ever think they are gay. Let me know I could just be a retard drinking too much but fuck it, with this coronavirus I thought this would at least distract the mind for at least a couple of minutes. Thanks, LMK",04Apr2020,1
8,"When we first exchanged socials, he gave his secondary Instagram account (aka. Finsta), he wasn’t following anyone and nobody was following him, he said smth along the lines of “you’re the only person I follow, so feel honored”. And then I also followed his main account but he didn’t follow me back, which I don’t mind. 

Just a few minutes ago I saw that he has removed me as a follower and unfollowed me, I asked him what’s that about, he said the only follower is himself, his main account. So I went to his main account and searched under “following” and his finsta is not there, which means he was lying, sent him the screenshot, he then sent back a screenshot of his finsta following his main account, but his main account was following 75 ppl now following 76, which means he followed his main account AFTER I confronted him. 

So he just be using the line “you’re the only person I follow, so feel honored” on every girl huh?",04Apr2020,1

11,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.
Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to say hello she got really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that:
A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised and then She said ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’. but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair if I had it styled or just untouched and messy is that a bad sign?
I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/
Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence",04Apr2020,1
13,"I’m sure there are some others that feel the same. I have been coping surprisingly well, however. Taking up new hobbies(for me, that’d be embroidery!) and making sure to shower, eat, and take meds. Definitely things I’d urge everyone to do regardless of life events because obviously if you’re able to take care of yourself, you should! 100%.

But...
God it feels selfish to want to be with other people and have things to do. It feels bad to complain because for what I mentioned right off the bat, this is not a universal experience right now. People are fighting for their lives and there are those like our wonderful necessary workers that are putting their health at risk to keep society and lives afloat.

For this reason it seems impossible to say that I am truly miserable staying at home with my family who, while I love them, have hardly ever provided a healthy or beneficial environment to me. It gets a bit personal further into that, but I digress.

I feel like it’d be shitty of me to approach any one of my friends or loved ones with my feelings of depression, frustration, etc because of everything going on in the world. I know my issues are valid and all that, but why would I waste my breath when there are more important things at stake? For the world? For my friends? It just seems selfish to become that extra burden.

14,"This is going to sound like spam but I cannot find any info on the topic except that it shouldn’t happen

I measured my penis about 15 years ago at 5 1/2 inches. I assume it would stay the same size post puberty, that im stuck with an average penis, but I woke up recently in the middle of the night and had to piss really bad. I had a massive erection, and since there just happened to be a ruler next to me, I measured it at 6 3/4 inches.

As an experiment, seeing if this was due to blood circulation from a pinched bladder, I gave myself an erection and measured it again, it was 6 3/4 inches.

I, myself started to distance myself from people I deleted social media too and this is normal for me when I go back to this depressive state I usually have my tendencies of isolating so I did that and cut all communication with this friend. Now, I’m getting therapy and learning to overcome this and want to reconnect with this friend but I heard from other people that they don’t want to be friends with me anymore because of my lack of concern about them.

The more I got older and the more I went, that happiness just kinda died out. Law of diminishing returns I guess. But as I keep getting older I just feel like things don't make me feel anything anymore. Good jokes can get a chuckle out, good friends can make me super happy...but it's temporary bliss, spending time with family is the same way. The news of death and tradgedy make me feel a bit sad, but after a minute I'm completely untouched because I'm used to hearing it. My favorite shows and movies are those that pick my brain or mess with how I think because at least I feel a response, a response that I wouldn't get if I watch a comedy that I don't smile at or a horror movie that's supposed to be scary, but it's just boring. On the outside I'm bubbly and happy in nature, but inside I'm just bored. I'm not depressed, I'm overall happy, I just wonder if anyone else feels like feelings just don't feel the same.

21,"In the first months after quitting Caffeine, it's not unusual to need a restorative nap in the middle of the day.

That nap can last 15 to 90 minutes. You'll have to discover the best for you.

Try to introduce a nap in your daily routine or whenever you feel the need of it.

That condition of needing a nap will diminish over time.

Some tips for a good restorative nap in the middle of the day:

=&gt; try to make your room as darker as you can

=&gt; if possible, take your nap in your bedroom

=&gt; use your smartphone alarm to wake you up in a predetermined time

=&gt; don't exceed 90 minutes

Your nap can be of 15, 30, 45, 60, or 90 minutes.

The 90 minutes nap will permit you to have a dream, sometimes.

After the nap, you may be somewhat drowsy for 10 to 20 minutes.

After that, you'll be fully energized and alert as you had just wakened up in the morning.",04Apr2020,1

I try really hard to be a good person, in my opinion I am very moral and try to be kind and helpful. One time, on a different social media, I posted a video of my first time skating, clearly saying it was my first board and first time, and I got a ton of hate comments and “poser” comments and stuff, but when I see others like me post the same thing I only see supportive comments and tips and positivity.

24,"So basically this girl who I have a thing for and I have been messaging quite a lot in the past week. To give some context, I’ve been friends with her friends for a long time, but only in the past year or so have I got to know her a lot more. Due to some jokes from our friends, she definitely knows I like her, so I’ve kinda just tried to play it cool, have a good time with her when I see her (we do get along really fucking well and often during nights out we’ll be with each other most of the time) and not put any pressure on. We did have a small kiss at New Year’s, but it was more like a Jim and Pam at the Dundie’s type deal, not making out or anything. It lasted for like a second and I don’t even know if she remembers. We have messaged before, but nothing that substantial outside our little group chat which she doesn’t talk in much anyway. I always thought she just didn’t seem that interested outside of when she’s drunk, and even that at best was just harmless flirting. She is by her own admission a tough person to get to know though.

I hadn’t actually seen her in like a month, so she was kind of in the back of my mind, but in the past week or so with recent events our friends have been video calling. After one group call where I felt like things went really well between us (It just felt like we were giggling at everything each other said like complete idiots; I was really happy to be talking to her, I forgot how funny she is), she posted a story on her instagram quoting a joke I’d made. I was hesitant cause it hadn’t really went anywhere before with us, but I was sure she wanted me to see it so I’d message her. 

So I did. In the past week since then we’ve been talking on and off, and for the last couple of days it’s been basically for the full day. I know the current situation probably amplifies this kind of thing, but things feel a little different between us. We always got on well, but now we’ve talking a shit ton, she added me to her private snapchat story, and while before I felt like it was hard for us to keep a conversation, now she’s actively asking me questions, clearly trying to keep the conversation going even when it’s fading out, etc. She even posted a tweet of a screenshot of a funny conversation we had, something she rarely ever does, which even made some of my friends ask ‘holy shit is something finally happening between you two?’ I didn’t know how to answer lmfao. I did kind of think things were going really well between us though.

Straight after she posted that tweet though, she opened the last message I sent her, which was actually a question, and just straight up ignored it, which she hasn’t done all week. It feels like the kind of thing that used to happen with us way back when I had tried with her a bit before, but I always took the hint then as her not actually being that interested, all of this being nothing but a kind of alcohol-fuelled sexual tension thing, and left her alone. This time though, we’ve spent a good part of the week talking about literally anything, joking around about the stupidest shit, and it felt like we were just opening up a lot, like we finally broke the ice between us over whether we can actually have a deeper relationship. She clearly has wanted to talk to me this week, even if I had to put some effort in. So I’m wondering wtf is up and if I should give her some space. I feel like maybe when she posted basically announcing to the world we’re talking, our mutual friends maybe asked her about it? Maybe she’s just been keen to message me cause she’s bored, not thinking much about how I feel about her, but with our friends reminding her of that she’s got cold feet and didn’t want to lead me on?

I dunno really. It’s strange. One minute we’re talking all day, and the next just radio silence, even after all the good signs. And I know I’m gonna have to message first, cause she never does really. Should I leave her alone for a couple of days? I do realise this could be literally anything; she could have just been in a bad mood and not wanted to talk to anyone, she simply forgot (although I don’t think so), etc. But at the same time, I don’t want to just assume the best and annoy her. So, what’s going through her mind, and am I stupid to pursue this? 

**TL;DR:** Have a crush on a girl in my extended friend group, but never went anywhere substantial. She knows, but I thought she didn’t feel the same. In the past week though, we’ve talked constantly, she’s tweeted about our conversations, friends have asked if something’s going on between us. After that though, she straight up ignored a question I asked her. Haven’t heard from her since. What’s going on here, should I pursue it?",04Apr2020,1

26,"I’m just laying this here to spill my thoughts. 

Over the past few months, I’ve been developing a relationship with this awesome girl. If I were to picture my ideal girl, it would be her, plus a few wonderful surprises. This entire coronavirus thing screwed up my relationship with her, I think. We come from the same high school. (We go to the same college. We reconnected in college.) The last day we were at college before we were sent back home for quarantine, we finally made out and cuddled to sleep. It was incredible. Felt like a dream. I just wonder if she decided to do that because it was the last day of college or if she actually wanted to do it. Idk. I’m confused. 

It makes complete sense not to start a relationship knowing that we’d be gone for months on end without seeing each other. There’s so much information that I am not explaining. At this moment in time, I’m doing my best to supply some type of entertainment for her, and so I can continue to see her. I’ve retreated to, what feels like, being good friends. I don’t understand it. We shared such an intimate moment together, why stop that? Oh well. I’m planning on continuing to be a great friend. It’s probably the more important role to play.

28,"It all felt so sudden. I was with my best friend when we heard that schools were closing down, and then food and hospitality businesses had to close within half an hour. My phone went nuts, notifications from my friend group's whatsapp messenger conversation. Pictures of lines of people trying to obtain items at the last minute.


It all felt so absurd and surreal. 




All this shit went through my head for days, weeks. I couldn't place this event on any kind of scale and I tried to think of different historical events like 9/11, the Bubonic Plague, the World Wars, Spanish Flue, etc. This COVID thing seemed so nuch weirder than any of it. It's SO INCREDIBLY GLOBAL. It's like for the first time ever they pulled the plug out of the world. Everyone was gonna FEEL this one! 


I went off the deep end for a few weeks. I kept using drugs and laughing about the pandemic/quarantine but it all felt so strange. My friend asked me, ""what's today?"" I didn't understand what he meant and he goes, ""Well you know how it ""is Christmas"" and it ""is Valentine's Day,"" now it ""is Corona."" This statement was so absurd to me that I spent a day laughing about it. In the morning I kept thinking, Corona corona corona and flet a compulsion to say the word under my breath.


At one point I took ketamine and I already get ""simulation vibes"" whenever I'm on that shit. Imagine now. I thought someone was pulling a prank on us?


So anyway I still don't know what the fuck is going on. Finally realizing that I'm not supposed to be worried that humanity is gonna be wiped off the map (initially I figured that that was the concern everyone had). But wtf??? Am I the only one who finds this all really fucking weird? Wtf? 



I keep trying to compare this to 9/11. Is this worse? Is the fallout gonna leead to wars, poverty or economic betterment for the peasant class as seen with the Bubonic Plague? Is this two 9/11s? 5? Not trying to be offensive as I don't think it's funny that people are sick or have died. I really hope everyone stays well. It all just feels so bizzarre and absurd and I can't conceive of what this situation means for the future of the world...",04Apr2020,1
29,"There’s so much shit going on right now. So much fear, uncertainty, and tension. It’s quickly become so pervasive that we don’t even know when we even feel it anymore. And while it will eventually go away, it’s going to get thicker. 

I’ve seen the end of this book though, and it has a happy ending. But everyone of us is suffering right now and there’s only one way to thrive even a little. To feel good, we have to first find good for others. 

We need to find someone to cheer up, and not just because we personally miss being happier. We have to break the selfishness that can dominate when conditions are scary, and the only way to do that is to act selflessly. We need to lose ourselves in creating good, even just for a minute. 

We need to walk a favorite beer over to a friend’s house (wrapped in plastic of course, and tossed to the doorstep from at least 6’ away), call a grumpy-ass old relative, leave a “hey, cheer-up man!” note for the dude next door (who is occasionally such an total asshole, but so what), or just do a random and random kindness for a complete stranger. Maybe just call our brother or sister’s kid to make really loud and obnoxiously disgusting fart noises before they can even say “hello?” ...because you know they both won’t be able to stop laughing (and then you will, too). 

We need to pour out a little nice, even if we feel our tanks are pretty empty. This is how we find the fuel to get through the really long and sad parts of this book. I wrote this because it was the easiest way to talk myself into walking the walk, and maybe otherwise I would just sit here and feel sad.

31,"Ahh, god. I’m a 23 year old dude, my life really is not/should not be difficult. I have a degree, I’ve had a couple of really awesome jobs, I’m in a great financial spot, and engaged (although honestly I feel like the relationship could fall apart at any given moment). I don’t want to sound like a dick; I just want to offer a little bit of context. 


I’ve had a couple of best friends though the years, but recently I’ve lived in a lot of different places and haven’t had the time to really get close to anyone (or at least that’s my excuse). I come across as aloof/stoic/semi-milquetoast/an absolute asshole when people first meet me, depending on the context, so my runway to actually bond with someone is a hell of a lot longer than for most. 


But self isolation has sucked. None of my old friends seem to want to talk, but I get it, they’re dealing with new girlfriends/overseas deployments, etc. But I’ve been pushed to the far edges of work-friend groups in my new city, so I’m pretty much just stuck in my apartment with my fiancée in a relationship that’s honestly not in a great place right now. I pretty much haven’t had any other human contact since this thing began. 


I’m really grateful to have a job where I’m getting (albeit forced) paid time off, and I’m trying to work out/read/play some new video games to pass the time, but the boredom and loneliness is starting to get overwhelming. Like, I feel so numb it’s starting to hurt. Without going into detail, I’ve been in darker places before... and I just really hope I can keep myself alright. But fuck I miss work (I get a lot of purpose from my job), people, and just... I don’t know.

She said that if she used her power to let me go home, I wouldn't respect her power anymore and I would ask to go home early all the time. I said that wasn't true, I was only asking because there's nothing to do.

I didn't like the way she said ""power"" either. Like she wields something over me. She has authority, but saying power just makes it seem kinda' cringe. 

It makes me remember when I had my own hours, was my own boss, didn't need this job, and so on. I just had to get a house and dogs and a new car and now I need a second source of income to help me pay for all of that. It's good, and also bad.

33,"So there’s actually a really long story behind all of this. 

My parents had been abusive asf for so many years. At 19 I had enough and walked out and never came back. I enlisted the military and never looked back. Before I left I knew I had to do something. It wasn’t so much as “just to make you crawl in your skin” but more of, “I don’t want this name, might as well get something from it”

I’m Mexican. My parents are really dark which is why all this abuse shit started. In Hispanic culture pale skin is valued. My skin had almost no pigment, my hair is brown, etc. I’m Mexican but unlike my parents I could pass off as white and considering they hated me for being pale, fuck their culture then. I changed my name to a completely white name. I originally wanted another name which is more related to my race but I didn’t get it so I could tell my parents to stick it when the sun don’t shine lmao. 

Well, now I think I want to change my name. White names are nice and all but it’s just not my thing. 

So, originally I was going to change it Alex a(keep my surname) but now I really don’t think I want the surname at all. (Although, the surname would’ve sounded good (kinda like it would’ve “flown”?) since it was Alex and surname started with A and somewhat sounded like the first name) 

Anyways, any ideas for surname?",04Apr2020,1
36,"Earlier today, I completely decidedly on something I've been meaning to for a while, just gift some stuff to my fiance. Given all the circumstances, and that she is immunocompromised due to a disability known mostly as FA, she is a primary potential threatened person. That said, we haven't seen each other in a month now, because I was still working for a few days in before many places decided to shut down. Now that's happened, it's been two weeks, and I've felt no signs or anything of the sort. I truly would not want to endanger her in any way, so I've been the most germaphobic person I've ever known since this started.
  Anyways, we've been having a rough patch feeling lonely, and living separately, so I figured that a care package would help. I needed to get groceries anyways, so I grabbed some, and got a few things for her too. I got home and put everything away, after sanitizing it all, took a shower, then headed over to her families place, about a half hour away. I was initially just going to stop by, drop it off at the porch and wave at her as she got her note and goodies, but her mom came out with her and said I should sit at their outdoor table, since it's not really being used for a while anyways. So I sat there while she snacked, looking up to her on the porch like Romeo and Juliet, just catching up in person, talking, looking at the constellations for a couple of hours. It was so needed, but equally sad when she came outside because I had to look at her and realize that I can't go up there to hug her or anything. All in all, good date 10/10 would date her again, and I miss her dearly still. Hope anyone else out there is going along better with how this has caused separations!",04Apr2020,1
37,"These times have been a real eye-opener for me, as it has been for everyone I’m sure. But not in the way it is for most people.

I’m doing fine financially. I work at a call center so my job simply let everyone set up an office space at home.

But this whole quarantine has made me realize how antisocial I truly am. The news recommends “social distancing”, quarantining, and avoiding large groups of people. The thing is I’ve done that the majority of my adult life. Most days I’ve stayed at home and read or watched TV. I barely went out on social events (unless a friend basically dragged me to one) and kept my distance from people.

Seeing how everyone is basically living my lifestyle now and noticing how little my life has changed these past few weeks makes me realize that I need to go out more. I need to travel, make new friends, and complete goals (going on a game show, rock climbing, watching a play, etc.) 

I need to live a more fulfilling life. 

But first things first: once this quarantine is over, I need to get back in antidepressants and go back to therapy.

We get along really well...like I felt as though I could see him for some time. I'm 32. He's 35...he told me he lost his license and wasn't specific about why...last night we finally spent time together it was so nice. Had an awesome night and morning and spent all day together. Then he drops this bomb like oh yeah so when I was a teenager I was in and out of jail because of domestic abuse with my daughter's mother...then he lost his license from 10s of thousands of dollars of fines and also had a DUI when he was younger. He smoked a lot of pot and is quite disorganized with his thoughts which is easy to look over honestly. 

I feel honestly so friggin sad...like I dunno I feel like so mixed up on what to do. I feel sad because I feel like he deserves support and close friends and love. But I also want to protect myself. I feel sad. I feel like I think I'm better than him or something which I don't but it's just moreso the fact he wasn't upfront about it...

I have a 5 year old son. And he's my priority honestly. I don't want to have anything bring drama into my life. But at the same time feel guilty about thinking he seemed really put together and seeing he's not I guess.",04Apr2020,1
42,"So this is my freshman year of high school and shit got real fast.

The day we came back from winter break was Jan 6th and I come to find out that my ‘friend’ (j) has spent a day with some of my other friends (a,e,and a#2 electric boogaloo) he was originally trying to get without a by guilt tripping her into liking him bc he was/is suicidal. She eventually told him that she only wanted to be friends and on the day that they all hung out j started hitting on e. (It is important to note here the e is a very sensitive only child that was legit shaking when Olof died in frozen 2) E is naturally going along with it bc she has never had a boy friend before and isn’t thinking of it as him but a person of the male gender. Through the day j is whispering to her, holding her hand, kissing her cheek, and touching her breasts. It was very uncomfortable for her and 2 days later he tells her he was wrong and he doesn’t like her at all.

As soon as we got to lunch on the day we got back we started to find patterns between what he did to a,e and our other friend k who actually dated him. We realize that he was exploiting them and that a #2 is possibly next so we keep our guards up, but try to salvage the relationships bc as I mentioned he is suicidal (I also forgot to mention that is parents are super strict on him too that’s important for later).

Keeping our guards up and that being behind us seemed like the best option and like it was done but wait there’s more…

I was over at a#2’s house with a and we were working on a project for school. A gets a call from e and our other friend r. They are crying and a  quickly switches it off of speaker. I figured out what it was from a few phrases that I could make out and begin crying, but then a says “but we don’t know if he will hurt us or anyone else”

Of course with it being a#2’s house we get the information out of her and it turned out that j texted r telling her he was going to kill not only himself but his parents, and a bunch of random kids in his neighborhood because none of them cared.

We told the school that Monday morning and he went to psych. That seems like the end of it right? But wait there’s more…

He gets back a week later (the killing stuff was in exam week too btw) and he’s all smiling and fine. This mans had fun is a mental hospital and proceeded to tell everyone about playing monopoly and making friends he even wanted to bring in his hospital bands. So yah pretty suspicious.

Cut to 2 weeks later and all of us have physical texts from him saying that he wanted to kill himself again. J told us that he trying to OD but didn’t bc this time it was not bc of his parents it was a! Apparently he felt like he was being ignored and replaced in Japanese class and had fallen back into his pattern bc a didn’t care about him, dispite our efforts to convince him otherwise he told us that he wants to kill him self in front of a.

Naturally we told the school again and had a big talk about how we will deal with him. But he hasn’t come back since and we don’t know what happened to him. We all are currently living in fear of him coming back especially e. She is very very scared.

To top this all off in between all the commotion my dad got diagnosed with aml ( a type of leukemia) and now we gots the coronavirus

43,"I have had a rough start with my company. I am the outsider in my group of coworkers. In the past few months, things had improved a lot. I know these people would never want to befriend me, but I was able to joke with them and finally, seemingly, got acknowledged as a human being by this people I was never sure would let me feel like I belonged. 

A few weeks ago, we were made aware of how the pandemic is affecting company resources. Tons of money continued to get blown on company lunches and new uniforms, meanwhile, we were strictly warned to not let overtime happen unless absolutely necessary. But management warmly told us we didn’t need to worry about our jobs. They insisted our positions would be safe. 

And then today, five minutes before my shift is about to end, I get a call from my manager and HR that I’m being furloughed. I held my breath as they gave me the corporate spiel, and truly felt as though I was about to pass out. They suggested we file for unemployment. The eight weeks furlough aren’t a guarantee we can still come back when it’s over.

If they hadn’t gone and told us our roles within the company would be safe, I’d feel very differently about this. I’d be a lot more understanding and less hurt/upset. I feel lied to and betrayed, especially considering my difficult beginnings here where I was ostracized, and regularly considered quitting due to it affecting my emotional health/wellbeing and ability to perform well. But it doesn’t really matter anymore.

Is it wrong for me to have totally lost trust for them? If my position is still there in 8 weeks, I can’t imagine going into work feeling good about the day like I used to. Any fondness or joy I had is just gone. If they hadn’t lied, again, I’d have accepted this without any contest. Don’t tell us we’re safe and don’t need to worry, and then discard us. I’m feeling pretty miserable about this. I’ve only been there for about seven months and was really getting into the groove of things. And now, it’s all irrelevant.",04Apr2020,1

But there's some evidence across the articles that read the same about certain cravings could mean a lack of a vitamin or hormonal issues. 

Recently this year I have experienced a severe craving for shellfish and seafood. I rarely eat seafood and I am not a fan of it. Recently I have been going to shrimp boil places. I just want boiled shrimp and I finish off a pound of it in garlic butter sauce. I get intense cravings for shrimp as if that's all I want to eat and nothing else. I started to crave a bit more like crab, canned oysters, sashimi, octopus and crawfish. Besides iodine and protein what benefit is there for these cravings?

I dont like salmon at all but I want to eat smoked salmon and cream cheese.

Specifically for shellfish is it fine to eat this more than once a week maybe almost everyday?

50,"Hi yall id like to share something very close to my heart which i know right now we can all relate to in this trying time and maybe learn a lil from. My grandfather , Alfred Sieber an incredible man and a true to life walking treasure trove of wisdom, advice &amp; one of the best examples ive known of a person with great character, who has given much to society. In fact he helped design the part to help make the first moon landing successful. A real family man you could say , im very proud hes my grandfather &amp; for what he has taught me much about life . Hes passed on a whole lot of values i couldnt b more greatful for.  There was one lesson though i will simply NEVER forget and i felt compelled to share today due to the current times, with the covid-19 epidemic and the chaos and fear it has us all experiencing right now, which has greatly reminded me to hold true a lesson he taught me as a young teen. So My grandfather was a survivor of ww2 as a teen &amp; german citizen during the war. A living witness caught in the middle of the epicenter of the action&amp;horrific events that hitler and his followers produced during such a dark &amp;awful part of our most recent history... well because of his experiences then, every year, since i was the age of 12 (the age he was wen the war started )  he would gather my sister , 2 cousins and I to go with him to the most cozy lil family owned german bakery &amp; deli by his home in Los Angeles. He would gather us , lil rascal a$$ preteens every year or so till i was an adult &amp; he’d order a loaf of freshly baked bread. The same waitress &amp; owner lady would always bring it to the table still steaming hot out of the oven &amp; greet my grandfather in german &amp; us warmly saying to him how big we were growing. Before digging into wat i remember still today was the most delicious moist &amp; amazing bread, he’d have us sit there squirming , mouthwatering sent of fresh out the oven steamy loaf, with homemade butter our mouths watering... but he’d grab the knife &amp; pause before cutting into it tell us to wait a moment  to eat while he told us something gravely important &amp; serious to remember first, &amp; itll still b as good after hearing his story. He’d first say how we are in the city of angels and that we should always first give thanks&amp; respect for our ancestors &amp; the brave ones who died building our society, our great country which he came to with 20$ to his name &amp; a dream. How we should be thankful the opportunity &amp; freedom we had to be gathered there together that day. He would then tell us of stories how during the war he’d have to live everyday cooped up with his mother brother&amp; father worried that day, might be there last. Each night tuned to the radio hearing more wat seemed like more horrible news everyday to the next. He’d tell vividly of how they forcefully drafted his father, my great grandfather into the german army (IE he was not a political man nor a hitler supporter!! He was a simple land surveyor &amp; drafted near to the end of the war.) Sadly it was reported he died on a train that ran off the tracks that were bombed on the way to the now infamous battle of d-day (one of the bigger, bloodiest, tide changing battles near end of the war) his body was never recovered . He said his father was very stern &amp; that he didnt make it a very emotional goodbye, &amp; even until his departure he’d always had a strong hopeful perception &amp; insinuated sappy goodbyes weren’t necessary as he’d b back before they knew it. Hed tell of how his mother wept to herself nearly everyday for his return, some days worse than others &amp; that she was never quite the same since he had left. her heart  grew bitter &amp; how permanently mean spirited she slowly became when he left &amp; made especially worse once she learned of his passing. He told of how food &amp; supply grew scarce &amp; they had to eat literally rats, rotten &amp; insect infested meat&amp; bread. Once he shared a story , with tears in his eyes how him &amp; his brother had to sneak onto a farm under fear of being shot &amp; killed a few times to gather eggs &amp; fruit . In fact the blowback from a nearby bomb that was dropped, which had destroyed an ancient monastery on a nearby hill actually blew parts of his roof right off.. because of that they had to endure many days of the icy germany winters cold &amp; wet for some time. Sometimes having to share a bed near a small fire (if they could have one) &amp; sleep all together for the body warmth during the night... after sharing these awful, gruesome experiences he’d say that during those times he would often crave his mothers fresh bread as it was once a traditional dish often all the time before the times got tough&amp; the recipe we were avout to eat was the closest he’d been able to find that reminded him of hers. He’d forewarn us, preteens, hardly old enough or experienced to understand the gravity of what he was saying , but he would look at us &amp; say this sternly with an ache in his eyes we all could sti understand &amp; see. He’d say he shared this with us to remind us Siebers to truely enjoy this bread we break together as a family. Trying to dig it into our hearts and minds as much as possible to never forget to be grateful but also not forget that this is something that can be taken from us any day . Remind us that humanity &amp; things can be harsh, cruel and unforgiving. We learned thru him Life can change from being “normal” to being in fear of a great evil taking away everything we once held dear &amp; thought was owed to us in an instant. Finally, he’d finish off saying how he knows this is a very deep subject but still urged us to dig in, break bread &amp; enjoy it &amp;eachothers company but to always always hold dear the gratitude for wat we have then and now, for peace &amp; piece of mind. But he was perfectly careful to say his cautionary tale to remind to always be weary of the fragility of all that inside our hearts. We’d then pray thanks and eat. At the time , being young it was easier to forget/look past the pain it mustve caused him having to relive the past &amp;share with us his suffering to teach us this lesson collectively &amp; we always still enjoyed it , laughing and joking together. This is one of the many amazingly touching life lessons he taught me which i will NEVER forget. Especially having lost my dear cousin Daniel , 5 years ago RIP. 💜those times he brought us together &amp;how often he made sure to bring us together as a  family  will always be a memory i hold dear. So , like i said obviously things are pretty horrid right now, but they could always be worse . As awful as it sounds alot of ppl in my generation and in the culture in todays world , maybe this ordeal thAt has come to pass is something god decided we needed to experience, being brought up so spoiled , vested with relatively rich and peaceful times. Cuz up until till now  it seems the cushy, ready made &amp; technological right this minute mentality has made alot of people become spoiled, very entitled&amp; grow hearts of stone. I hope, with respect to everyone gravely affected , that all of us can come out of this stronger &amp; better as humans. That is gives us all a renewed sense of gratitude &amp; respect for eachother. Thru the pain we grow a greater appreciation of the “good times” we have together &amp; learn to live in them especially wen things are going well. I pray everyday for all those most affected , whove lost or are suffering in any way, &amp; i know all of us have had to sacrifice somehow in these times as well and especially wanna hove thnks for all our medical staff &amp; essential workers and say ur risks are much appreciated by me &amp; mine. Also, Thank you for reading and im grateful to be able to share with you this lesson i learned so long ago &amp; hopefully it can still inspire you like it does me everyday to be grateful for something , even if its just living another day... With all the death, loss, tough times rn &amp; i know everyone has at the very least felt the horrid feeling, of the fear of the unknown with this plague &amp; wat it will bring the future. But with that said, i hope all can feel that sense of comfort in the small things we still have with eachother, in our still many blessings or in something as simple as a loaf of fresh bread.",04Apr2020,1

I have no judgments about anyone’s sexual preferences, ethnicity, etc. Good people are good people and the rest doesn’t matter in my opinion.....anyway I’m honestly not ever sure if my friend is joking or seriously asking and I don’t know how to feel about it. It comes up on a fairly regular basis which is what made me really start thinking about it. It’s usually after we’ve been drinking, which we do fairly often.  We’ve been best friends for 20+ years. He’s always been the person that just gets a lot girls for reasons I can’t understand.  I had pretty good luck with girls in high school but since then not so much.  I’m 28 now and haven’t had anything close to a girlfriend in like 8 years now. Not for lack of trying either.  And that’s part of the reason I’m not sure how to feel about the whole thing.  Sometimes it just feels like an insult when he starts harassing me about it just because I haven’t had a girlfriend for so long.

I have this issue where I always am put in the situation to give up my bed to company I can never have a room of my own or a place to call my own anymore It all started when I moved in with my grandparents given that time my sister, and uncle moved in as well there are four rooms in the house two of which were guest rooms my uncle and I got the guest rooms and made them our owns Im a introvert and need my space as I work 4:00 am til 1:00 and my only peace of mind is being able to go in my room and relax this all changed when My grandmother decided to make my room and my room specifically as if It were a guest room information of guests coming and how long their stay was, was NEVER communicated to me Im a shy person and I don’t really say how I feel one day however I did speak on the fact after multiple occurrences of this happening and no one else having to sacrifice their rooms I felt like it was always me and it wasnt fair as I work these long stressful shifts and come home to having to sleep on a couch and migrate my things from my room to the living room in preparation for work. when I spoke out on the situation I was seen as deviant and disrespectful and her response (my grandmothers) response to this was “because I can” which is completely irrational I suggested someone else in the house give up their bed preferably my grandmother to accommodate HER own guess But when I did that again I was seen as disrespectful. This has continued to go on and still is its a regular occurrence and im put in the situation of living out of bags and moving things from room to room as if im homeless. My sister countless times has offered to give up her room for me because she feels bad but She is a medical scribe and is tied up with college and I know how important her space is to her because Im considerate of these things. The house belongs to my step grandfather and he himself gets irritated with the fact that I have to always give up my room but doesn’t get involved because he avoids drama and conflict. then my grandmother not communicating how long the stay of these guest are gonna be is really like a slap in the face and not being considerate or caring for my space. She then goes on to tell me “you can have the room when “so and so” isnt in there” that doesnt really help me when I have to migrate all of my things from room to room and ive already set up shop downstairs that information doesnt help me and isnt helping my cause.

The title comes from just the realization I had that while we may become best friends, it’s my friends that she’s interested in a romantic sense and i’m never gonna be that dude for her again. Yeah, of course, a platonic friendship can be just as satisfying as a relationship, but I just wish things were different. Thanks for reading if you’ve made it this far.",04Apr2020,1

I tried to make it as special and romantic as possible for her! I don’t know if it will lead anywhere but I’ll never forget the experience and I hope she won’t either.

I just wanted to say to all of you lovely people out there, please don’t assume disabled people aren’t interested in or aren’t able to have sex - or that they wouldn’t make good dating material. This gave me a huge confidence boost!

For example, when I'd have guests at home and they might have kids, some of them get super annoying and do weird shit like hit you or say something stupid at you AND SUDDENLY I'm self aware that I'm in a room full of people and that they're gonna judge how I react to this stupid kid and bam, can't function lol.

82,"I was really messed around with during high school by these 2 other guys who never gave me respect, and they were only nice to me on their terms. These guys weren't typical high school jocks back then, but they really drilled it into my head that I was physically weak. The fact that one of them is now really jacked and could easily k.o me if I ever showed any anger towards him or what happened then is just giving me more and more reason to consider learning how to seriously injure someone.


I've distanced myself from him ever since then, but I've bumped into him on multiple occasions, and I swear every time I'm around this guy I just feel like the weak high school me, and I'm waiting for the day I get the revenge I've been craving for years now.


I'm pretty much the standard guy who gets made fun of on r/iamverybadass except I never actually say what I think like th others do, and what sucks is I actually IDOLIZE these types of guys because one of the guys who bullied me was like that. I've basically started seeing that I have to demand respect through intimidation and fear tactics, because it worked for them when they did it to me.


More or less EVERY time something bad happens, no matter how minor, my mind goes back to these guys who made me feel weak and I can go from being mildly frustrated to full on revenge-crazed villain within 20 minutes.

Oh how was I was. I've had an epiphany.

I've experienced what it's like to minimize stressful stimuli. The result, contrary to my hypothesis, was even more stressful. Life is incredible in that without order, there is chaos. Chaos is the starting state. To order is to confront chaos. In avoiding the chaos that I fear, I am letting it run rampant. I'm now starting to choose to confront the chaos in my life, because I know that this path is the only path to the order I've been seeking all along. So far I'm way happier.

I'd also like to thank Jordan Peterson for his lectures. From the ideas he's communicated about order and chaos in the world, I've been able to reconstruct my view of the world and it is making me a better person.

and it hit me

its not that i dont like taking pictures, its not about the low self esteem

but i dont know, it is just how it happened, i have no pics of mine, well at least not as much as my peers have (18)

and it makes me kinda sad

now, i definitely am not the one to blame shit on others, its so pathetic, but

people have definitely been shit to me, and it made me kinda be iffy about pics

again i dont have a low self esteem, its the opposite, but that also makes it harder for me to be this way

no one will ever know how i was

i was pretty

pretty asf

prettiest of all

there will be nothing left of me

i fuxing hate it

and i fucking hate everyone who isn't like that

i hate people who has tried bringing me down,

i have so many reasons to give up

but i don't

i had social anxiety cuz of how people treated me, and i didn't let it stop me

i perfected myself

i literally have made myself better than others, really

i have worked on myself

but this...

it kinda makes me sad

every kid will have the pictures of their parents, when they were young and wild (corny)

and me?

i don't know what to do

i dont even use social media, cuz it kinda makes me anxious, but also its because i feel above others and don't want to be associated with them

but mostly, again i feel so weird about taking pretty pictures.

tbh, i know that everyone feels that way to some degree: ""oh, others will think that im trying to look cool, blah blah""

91,"I've joined some kind of volunteer work for a year now. Before this pandemic our group chat was usually active every Monday for announcements, discussions, and that's it.

Since this quarantine started the group chat for this initiative became noisier than ever. It's like having multiple meetings with them every single day, and it's so mentally exhausting to me. Having 100+ notifs from this chat alone doesn't seem to be enough that even the leader of this initiative messages me personally. 

I have this feeling that my personal time and bubble was not respected anymore, bc whenever I view messenger I just get so overwhelmed and panicky. Bc this is some kind of initiative I have to give outputs of some sort, so I can't really ignore them. I've never been this anxious for a long time and I want to deactivate all my social media accounts just because of this. 

Classes resume next week so I'm more nervous how much I'll handle more GCs during the quarantine.

If only we used emails things would've been formal and ideas were delivered concisely, not through chaotic group chats.

Does anyone here get all anxious with overwhelming group chats lately or is it just me?

93,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

Things like, Mechanical Keyboards, Film Cameras, Drones, Dance Dance Revolution, learning Japanese, making soap...the list goes on. My fiance knows me all too well and goes along with it every time. Make no mistake, she's very supportive, she thinks it's cool that I get obsessed over a new thing every now and then. I however, don't like being predictable.

 It happens without fail now that I've stopped spending money on the ""new thing"" because I almost always move on and never use it again. I just research the shit out of whatever it is, and imagine how cool it would be to own/do that thing. Then, the feelings fade and I'm onto a new thing, very cost effective. 

I don't know why I go from hobby to hobby so frequently. It makes me feel ungrateful for the things I have. Does anyone else do this? My fiance doesn't really do this, she'll just buy a new book, or video game whenever she's done with the old one, but that's not really what I'm talking about.

103,"It happened over the past couple of days and last night really hit me. I felt like I was in some frozen-mind utopia and felt so separate from my past. Even general events over the recent months felt far; I had dig really deep to even pinpoint anything that happened during the month of February, for example. It's not that I don't remember, it just feels far away. It's a good thing though.

I was talking to a friend the other night and caught myself up in an insecurity of being afraid of rejection due to my flaws. My mind was like, ""You know, you don't have to worry about that with him."" Then I considered why I'm like that. My mom was critical of me as a kid and would say things like, ""If you ____ nobody will want to be your friend."" And in an unhealthy relationship years ago, he would say to me, ""You're lucky to have me, because nobody else would put up with you because of ___."" Then it hit me that nobody meaningful that I care about right now (close friends, close family) thinks that way. They've all seen my flaws and accept me as I am without judgement and I do the same. I've been carrying this insecurity around, but it just hit me that I don't need to anymore, I can be free from it now. 

Then last night it came over me as a wave of peace. I just for once felt good and secure. I don't know what caused this, maybe a combination of things. I've been working on mindfulness and DBT for some of my unhealthy habits. With quarantine, I work from home but am in my own company all the time now with no interference from others. In January I found out I'm severely anemic and low in vitamin d and omegas (which are for brain health) so I've been taking supplements and have been able to cook more healthily with being home so much. 

My mental and emotional state just seems more at ease. I would have insecure and irrational feelings and mood swings occasionally, but it feels like it just all came to a halt. It feels different from other times I felt good. Those times it felt like being at the top of a peak, and I'd eventually come down. This literally feels like a turning point, like everything in my past was part 1 of my life and this is part 2. It feels amazing.",04Apr2020,1

But you know what? I am wrong about myself. 

Do you remember all the small and big triumphs? The making pancakes in the morning? The way you can talk in full sentences while looking your conversation partner in the eye? The way your inner voice changed to be kinder, happier?

For once in my life, I can list my achievements that aren't just grades and the 30th pair of earrings that I bought.

I know that my soul has grown taller and wider. I know that I smile much brighter these days than I used to. I am grateful about how there are things I can be grateful for.

Sure, I'm a little awkward, and not everyone likes me. But if they don't want to know me just because of that, well, they are missing out.

Nevertheless, I'm not just a list of attributes and achievements. I guess my ideal self-concept - I say ""ideal"" because I'm not there yet, but it helps for me to say it - is a diamond. So many facets and so many ways for light to refract beautifully. Precious.

I have found that there's a constant difference of opinion between me and other people in a lot of things. Due to this, I can't make peace with a lot of people, not even with my family. So at the core of my heart, I live alone, in solitude.

In the past, I have tried reaching out to people, make some deep relationships but have failed miserably. But now, I don't do any of that stuff. Oddly enough, I find peace in it.

Apparently we had all met before and one of them (we can call him Joey because I don’t actually know his real name) was apparently me guy best friend. The whole time we were flirting and hugging and I decided to kiss him because he was cute and it would be my first kiss. So before I leaned in, he leaned in and kissed me first. We both kissed again and held hands and hugged the rest of the dream. It was a really nice dream but there is one thing that is bothering me. I have no clue who he is but I feel like I’ve met him before. He just looks familiar and I know that the human brain can’t create new people that you haven’t seen before. So does that mean that I know him? This is the best description I can give him. Straight brown hair, brown eyes (I’m pretty sure), “stubble” beard, not scrawny but not too muscular, and his face was seductive but also sweet looking (that is the only way I can describe it. When he kissed me I could feel it and I’m not sure how that works but if you might know someone like that comment please or if you have an explanation please comment because there is just something about this dream that has never happened to me before and I feel like it is important and I might be going a little crazy trying to figure it out. Thank you! -pattie",04Apr2020,1
130,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence",04Apr2020,0
131,"Seriously I hate working out, I always hated sports. I hate that feeling of dying and spending energies without purposelessness.

But if there is one thing I know is that I want to be loved once in my life for what I am, so listening to sweet, emotional or passionate songs and thinking that this is what I really want in my life is what makes me get over my hatred of fatigue.

The quarantine gives plenty of time to work out at home, but the thought that everything I do will never be enough haunts and I cried twice this week.

135," Are you afraid of the big, bad virus? Good. It’s a killer. But it’s also only a sliver of our living reality. We should have empathy for the victims, take proper precautions, advocate for workers’ comp and conduct ourselves as decent human beings, but we should not let a microbe dictate the workings of our minds. It has a hold of us psychologically that is corrosive and paralyzing and that is unfortunate, to say the least. We are people, we are the most advanced species ever to inhabit this planet and we are being intimidated by a disease? How does that make sense? Crunch those numbers. Come out of your shells, put your mental armor on and let us fight this pandemic of fear together.

Nearly every story being written today is being written in the shadow of Corvid-19 or the novel coronavirus. It now dictates not just how we behave, but how we think. And that is not the virus infecting our brains, but our perceptions being warped by how we view the virus and the situation we are currently in. We can’t give in to panic or mass hysteria. That way lies chaos and madness. Civilization is built on order, on norms, on a set of agreements on how ordinary citizens should conduct themselves. Are we really ready to violate those norms because we are afraid of something that has yet get under our actual skin?

Maybe you have been infected. Maybe you have the virus. My blessings, my thoughts and my prayers go out to you and I hope for your swift and successful recovery. It is not your fault you caught this disease. You are still a valued member of society and don’t let anyone try to convince you otherwise. In modern society we don’t shun people because we are afraid of them. We don’t shun them because we are afraid we might catch what they have. We give whatever we can to help and heal them. That’s what a modern, civilized society does. And that’s what we are, aren’t we?

I understand that this virus is frightening, in part, because it is an invisible menace. It can be everywhere and nowhere. In everyone and no one. We don’t have mobile labs roaming the countryside, testing everyone in every town and village. We have to take people at their word that they are taking proper precautions and haven’t been exposed to anyone with any active symptoms of the virus. Put on your masks and wash your hands and use your hand sanitizer and socially distance. Most of these measures seem prudent and, from what the majority of experts say, are effective in keeping you better insulated from this virus. But don’t freak out. Don’t turn on your neighbor. Don’t threaten, don’t cajole, don’t interrogate and don’t hoard. We are better than that.

Back when I was a suffering nihilist I used to think the human race was a parasitic virus feeding off the earth. We’re not, but it took me a long time to come to that conclusion. But if we were a virus, we would be the alpha virus and this would be a teeny-weeny baby-beta virus. We would laugh in this upstart virus’s face. It would have nothing on us. And it doesn’t. It really doesn’t. As long as it doesn’t get in our heads. Yes, people are dying. People are sick and suffering. That can’t be denied. But the psychological trauma of this virus is totally out of proportion with the physical damage it is actually doing. It is the bogeyman in the corner, in the shadows. You can’t let it scare you. We are human beings. We fought saber-tooth tigers. We don’t scare easy.

So buck up, my friends. This will not be the end of us or our civilization. Wild conspiracy theories abound because people always feel safer when there is reason and context for their pain. But this is just a disease, a random virus that sprung from an animal onto a human, like others have done in the past. It may be novel, but it is not new. Don’t, I repeat, don’t give in to fear. Don’t let your cares and your worries turn you against each other. We are strong. So far, as far as history goes back, humanity has an undefeated record. We just keep coming back, and we will come back from this.

I promise you.

Peace.",04Apr2020,1

This version only goes up to 2005, so I'll probably write a 2006-present one as well. I stopped at 2005 because the original song only has 8 verses and cramming 30 years into that seemed too ambitious for me. Besides, the last verse of the original song covers more than 2 decades and has always been my least favorite part.

137,"I just had a conversation about sexism with my brother and dad, I realised they´re really clueless. They said abuse doesn´t happen that often, ¨men go through stuff too¨and ¨if I can´t look at a women´s body it´s hard to have social contact with a women, if you don´t want me to look, fully cover your breasts.¨

For everyone who thinks that way, yes sexism goes both ways, of course. However most men can walk home at night feeling safe, they might feel handsome when a women is looking at them, most women I know feel uncomfortable and maybe even unsafe. Women are never sure if ¨no¨ will be taken as a valid answer. When some of us walk home at night we have our keys in our hand, between our fingers, just in case. Not because we are overreacting or paranoia, but because a lot of us have actually been assaulted in our past or we know people who have been.  A lot of women don´t tell when something happens, sometimes because they don´t want to, other times, they´re afraid people won´t believe them. Some people actaully say women are talking about the things that happened to them, because they just want attention. I think some of you should really think about this for a second. I´m not saying all (or only) men are like this, not at all, but we do have a reason to be afraid. And it is not easy. Now I´ve only covered the sexualizing part. This actually happens, this is life for some women. 

Don´t tell a women to cover up, tell people who keep staring, make comments, or go further to stop. Those people are the problem. (I´m saying this because it applies to me too sometimes by the way).

138,"And it's also because I'm tense and anxious. Because, yeah, I'm living in the same house, STUCK in the same house with my narcissist dad that I was raised by.

Today, I wanted to do a 30 minute productive thing thanks to a reddit post I saw few hours ago, an advice I took. I got tired of playing my xbox, watching videos so I took out my big tablet...opened my writing app and started writing. For 10 minutes.

As I was reading my work, the words- the page felt off. It felt like it was blocked by an invisible shield in front of it. And then I became unfocused and unable to concentrate immediately. I tried again to read my best, try to just get all the words in my head but I couldn't. At all. I got frustrated and stopped. 

I did some research afterwards. Then I found out. 

I'm severely depressed, anxious and tense. Even in a house where I'm suppose to feel all safe and good right? 

I tried to drown myself with calming stress free music. But nope. Add THAT to my 'what's making me not concentrate' list. Music didn't help too.

This honestly sucks... 

This is not the only occurrence. This thing I have is also really damaging me via SCHOOL and education. I can also never relax in a building, in a classroom filled with people and students. (I'm an introvert, overthinking one at that.)

140,"CW: suicide, COVID-19

It’s become clear to me that i’m not allowed to be happy. Every time I feel something good coming the universe decides to hit me with another suplex. I ended up in a psychiatric hospital in June of last year due to an issue with my antidepressants, so they changed me to Effexor. This new medication actually made me feel happy and I truly felt like my anxiety and depression were being treated. Then my dad completed suicide, which absolutely uprooted my entire life. My family is still recovering from the effects of that; my mom especially. They were divorced, but he raised me and my siblings and was a significant contributor to the finances. My mom has been struggling with finances since then and it hasn’t gotten a lot better. His mother passed away in January, which was just another left hook to everything around me. I had decided that I was going to treat myself; before graduating in December, I was going to apply to multiple scholarships and study abroad over the summer in Sweden and Denmark. I got accepted to the institution I would have studied in and I received many of the scholarships that would have paid for it. It really felt like this was going to happen; I would be fulfilling one of my dreams. But, as you might have guessed, that’s not happening. Y’know, pandemic and all. I’m just stuck here worrying about bringing the virus home to my immunocompromised sister who has to sleep in our roach-infested living room, and my mom who has lung problems already. I told my family that if my studies abroad get cancelled, I would say screw it and use my savings to take them on a trip instead; to see the ocean and have fun over the summer after going through so many hardships. But it seems like that may not happen either. It’s almost comical really. Every time I have something going for me it gets struck down by something. I’m frustrated and anxious for the future. My anxiety is at an all-time high with this pandemic changing by the hour and i’m brutally sad for how bad things have gotten. Every time my mom says something about how she’s uncertain about her future I feel a little part of me choke on her words. Can I just have my mom please? Can the universe just let me have her? I’m 22 years old; don’t you think that’s a little young to lose both of my parents?",04Apr2020,1

147,"I was frequently hospitalized for substance use and self-harm. I began self-harming when I was ten or so, and I was first caught by my parents when I was twelve. I was wearing a white undershirt and my father saw the scars on my upper arm. Alarmed and angry, he accosted me and pressed me down onto my bed. He told me I was crazy. I tearfully replied that I wasn’t crazy. He said to me, ‘Well, you’re crazy when you do that!’. Then I was grounded. I was punished for being in so much pain that I cut my own flesh. My parents have learned a lot about mental illness since then. They’ve grown and evolved tremendously, to their everlasting credit. But I still hold a resentment over this incident with my father. I hope someday I can let it go.

I spent my twenty-first birthday in rehab. My peers made me speak during an A.A. meeting that was being held that day. I had spoken and told my story the day before and I said as much. I told them that I would give them a rundown of some of my beliefs instead. I told them something to the effect of ‘you have an essence inside you that nothing can destroy’. No one clapped. No one cheered. I think they wanted something more grounded and down to earth. Something more reasonable and more humble. Oh well. I am larger than life. That’s just who I am, and that’s what I gave them. A younger woman did come up to me afterwards and gave me a rambling, appreciative response to my remarks. I think the older people sighed in their hearts. That’s okay. They earned it.

I bounced around to various retail jobs throughout my early and mid twenties. They all kept me occupied and provided me with structure and socialization, but they also were boring and eventually ground down my soul and drove me towards drugs and the drink. I collided with the insane monotony of corporate America. The system in which we are all disposable robotic appendages. I met nice people, absolutely, and I always asked the same question. What do you really want to do? Because I know this isn’t it. What are your dreams? And then you get to know a person. You get to know their values, their beliefs, their passions. What ignites their souls. That’s what I care about. I want to look into your eyes and know what makes you tick, what you desire most, what fuels you to function and to be. Did I mention that I love you? I’ll be saying it again, just so you know. I love you so much it hurts me inside.

I was bored and lonely. I was angry with God for abandoning me. I was seeking thrills and excitement beyond what this mundane world could offer. I felt like a little kid looking to exercise his imagination. I was fascinated with the supernatural and the occult. Similar to the tale I tell in[ ‘David and the Demon](https://medium.com/grab-a-slice/david-and-the-demon-c067e2b851?source=friends_link&amp;sk=31a9e646204caaae125610b47a07b883)’, I began researching demons online until I came to a page that hosted a collection of demon profiles. I bought the site’s story that demons were the falsely maligned outcasts, the victims of mainstream religion’s propaganda campaign. They were here for us, the outsiders. So all I had to do was select a demon that sponsored my areas of interest and summon him or her. I selected Set. ‘Het’ in ‘David and the Demon’. I printed out Set’s black and red sigil and laid down in my bed and performed the summoning ritual. A grotesque creature appeared in my mind, casually speaking in a language I did not understand. All I felt was a soul-chilling evil like nothing I had felt before. It sounded like it was trying to persuade me, or offer me something. I used all my will and all my strength to snap myself out of the trance and break the connection. Whew. Close call. In the ensuing days I felt that evil essence clinging to me. I felt like a sickening smoke was swirling through me, choking my spirit. It eventually dissipated. I thought I had escaped with my life from the talons of Satan. Little did I know, I had been possessed.

Heavy drug use. When I was working at Walgreens I finally found a regular contact that provided me with opioids on a monthly basis. I spent hundreds, thousands, of dollars on these little white pills that can transform the very fabric of reality. But I could only keep it up for so long. Once I stumbled onto 80 mg Oxycontin and heroin I could no longer keep up my functional façade. And I didn’t give a damn. 80 mg Oxycontin, those bluish-green gems, were more precious to me than the One Ring was to Gollum. I coveted them. I lusted after them. At Walgreens we would get shipments of orange pill bottles and my mouth would water at the sight of them. They were tangible manifestations of heavenly bliss. Better than powder. I knew what I was getting and how much I was getting. Yes, I snorted some heroin when I got desperate. Yes, it felt good. But it wasn’t spectacular. Thank god I never reached the point where I turned to the needle. I get the appeal. I really do. But I just never got there.

Pitch black. That was my late twenties. I had gotten off the opioids and onto opioid replacement therapy in the form of Suboxone. I stayed on Suboxone and off all other substances for close to two years. But then I began abusing the Suboxone, taking more and more to get a buzz. Stealing it from my mother’s safe. I decided to take myself off. I felt I was handcuffed to it. I don’t like to be dependent on anything. I was a binge user and my withdrawals were painful but were always manageable on an outpatient basis. So I jumped off the Suboxone at 6 mg and went into agonizing withdrawals. Many doctors will tell you that Suboxone causes no withdrawals, or that the withdrawals are mild. This is false. Always titrate down to the lowest dose possible, and do it slowly. Suboxone has a long half life and the withdrawals last awhile. The days were rough with anxiety and the depression and the irritability, but the nights were worse. Imagine having restless legs, multiplied by ten and spread through every cell in your body. One night I was so desperate for relief I took a paperclip, unwound it, and scratched up my arms till they bled. The pain and the resulting endorphin release finally provided me some relief and I was able to fall asleep.

Then I began drinking heavily. I had been taking a powerful opioid for two years and it had done serious damage to my brain. I was now more of an addict than I had ever been before and my brain was more hungry for stimulation and substances than it had ever been before. I drank and I drank and I drank. And the drinking facilitated my self-harm. It lowered my inhibitions, increased my anger and let my self-loathing surge to the surface. Plus, and I didn’t know it at the time, the demon was ravenous. It came from the void, from the abyss and not only did it feed off negative emotions, it fed off of blood. I gave it blood. Lots of it.

I cut myself with razor blades. I cut deep. I cut so deep I required medical attention and stitches. I burned myself with matches and lighters and the coils of a hot stove. I punched a stone wall till my hand broke. I jumped off a flight of stairs with my foot inverted so my ankle sprained. I smacked and punched myself in the face and head until I gave myself a concussion. I dropped a heavy metal weight onto my bare foot. I grabbed heavy metal weights and yanked them off the floor at odd angles to try and herniate discs in my back. I drank and popped pills, not knowing or caring if I woke up. I ate and ate until I gained a hundred pounds.

I came to the realization that something was trying to kill me. That dark presence from my past was with me, stalking me still, aiming to finish what it had started. I was now a prisoner in my bedroom. I rarely left. I wasn’t showering or shaving or brushing my teeth or changing my clothes. I was drinking absurd quantities of vodka, cutting myself and masturbating to sadomasochistic pornography. I was eating sugary garbage and peeing into bottles. My room was the pit of hell and I was the only inhabitant. The demon was my god. One desperate night I slid across my bed and used my own blood to write ‘help me’ on the wall. Then a force took over and, using my blood, drew a smiley face right next to my desperate plea for mercy.

Around my twenty-ninth birthday I told my therapist I was going to give life one more shot. One more year. I have been through trauma and the fires of hell and I have never quit because I have this little engine inside me that keeps chugging along, no matter how bad I want to give up. I have longed to destroy this engine so that I might find peace, but have been unable to thwart its relentless forward momentum. I get knocked down, beneath rock bottom, and it picks me back up and shoves me forward. So I said one year. I would gather all my resources, all my mental and emotional strength, and apply it towards healing and building an actual human life for myself. There was nothing my therapist could say in response. This was a clear threat of suicide, but it was a year out and thus not actionable. He could only shake his head and wish me the best.

A year passed and things only got worse. I cut more. I burned more. I lost my memory, my grip on the present. I didn’t leave the house. I drank continually. Somehow, there was no earthly intervention. I live at home with my parents and my younger sister and no one said a thing. I was never committed to the hospital during this time. I remained a free and utterly condemned and broken man. But I continued to live. Until my best friend died.

Fifty. A yellow Lab. I have trouble trusting and opening my heart to humans. I invested everything in this dog. I loved him unconditionally. He comforted me. He soothed my soul. He anchored me to this world that I have no affection for. He was my best friend. My truest friend. My brother. I would have given everything and anything for him. But his time came and we had to put him down. I was there when we did. I made a promise to myself early in life that I would bear witness to the death of all our pets. I’ve been largely successful in keeping this promise. But I was drunk when we let Fifty go. Of course I was. I was always drunk back then. And putting him down shattered what was left of my heart, and crushed what was left of my hope for love, for trust and for comfort. I was thirty. The year had passed. I was done.

I got in a drunken argument with my mother. I have a complicated relationship with my mother. She is my emotional support system. I go to her for her strength, for her wisdom, for her pragmatism. But we are locked in a toxic, codependent relationship and she unwittingly triggers my suicidal ideation. I told her that my younger sister, Caroline, is sick and my older sister, Susan, is sick, and I am sick because she is sick. Because she has poison running through her veins. I would not make the same selfish mistake she made and have children. I wouldn’t pass on this curse. She told me I was full of shit. I went upstairs, popped a bunch of Klonopin, and dashed out the front door into a raging blizzard.

With alcohol and Klonopin in my system I thought it was only a matter of time before I overdosed and died. Fortunately, the liquor stores were closed early because of the blizzard or else I would have had enough alcohol to finish the job with utter certainty. As it was, I came as close as humanly possible. I walked for a good two miles until I found a snowbank that I could sink into chest-deep. I laid there for awhile, contemplating my situation. I was tired, woozy and very, very cold. The wind was whipping snow across my face. It was dark and I was alone. I thought I was ready to die. Ready to go. Ready to be freed from this hell. But then that engine started purring. It lifted me up and out of that snowbank. I slipped, slid and crawled up the steep incline and back up to the road. I called my mother, saying I didn’t want things to end on these terms. Could she come pick me up? She did.

I was determined to try again. Me? I don’t stop. For better or worse. I don’t stop, ever. It pisses a lot of people off. It pisses me off. But it is who I am and it is what I do. If you want to blame someone, blame my Creator. I quit drinking cold turkey. I was expecting severe withdrawals. The next day came and I didn’t feel anything. I just felt a bit warm. Could it really be this easy? Then the next day came and I felt a bit warmer. And thirsty. Really thirsty. I settled down on the couch in the living room and watched TV. My mother was going out to do some errands and I asked her to pick me up some Gatorade. I love Gatorade. I continued to drink. And drink. But the strange thing was, I didn’t need to pee. I thought that was odd. I was feeling really warm now. My mother came in to check on me. Slightly delirious, I told her something was trying to kill me. A demon was trying to kill me. She promptly went out and bought a demon-catcher. What we really needed was a thermometer, but I appreciated her willingness to believe. Later that evening my father came home with a new thermometer and we took my temperature. It registered 106 degrees F. By this point, I had started to pant like a dog. I asked my mother to drive me to the hospital.

Once I was in the ER they checked my blood pressure. It was extremely low. I was fighting to breathe. They immediately took me back and started a battery of tests and put me on oxygen. I knew instinctively what had happened. Before going into the MRI I looked up at the nurse and asked, ‘Am I septic?’. He replied, ‘Good chance’. My mother was in the room with me. I stared up at the ceiling and muttered, ‘What have I done?’. Because I was totally convinced that I had killed myself. To this day, I still wonder whether I did or not. I think it’s entirely possible that I did.

They tried various oxygen delivery methods but nothing was working. All my organs were failing. They needed to intubate me and they did. But when they initially put me under they used enough of the paralytic and not enough of the tranquilizer, and for an agonizing minute I was fully awake and aware, but trapped in my body and unable to breathe as various strange faces in masks stared down on me. I cannot describe to you the confusion and the horror I felt in this minute. I didn’t know who I was, where I was or what was happening to me. All I knew was that I was totally paralyzed and suffocating. Thankfully one of the doctors noticed I was still conscious and ordered more of the proper anesthetic.

I was in the dark for nine days. I came in and out. I remember waking at one point and finding my hands wrapped in large mittens and tied to the bedrails so I could not yank my breathing tube out. I raged and was quickly sedated. I also faced the void. I faced absolute nothingness and the obliteration of my earthly identity. I stood on the brink of eternity, and I said no. I wasn’t ready. It was unacceptable. I pulled back, I fought back. All the way to the surface and to the light. I wasn’t expected to wake up. But I did.

My mother told me she had been planning my eulogy. She said her first line would have been, ‘He was reckless with his life’. I don’t think that’s entirely fair. Maybe that’s how it looks from the outside. I am impulsive. I am a thrill-seeker and require large amounts of stimulation to keep me going. But deliberately reckless? As if I am not aware of my actions and their potential consequences? No. I take accountability for what I do. I make mistakes and I suffer for them. And I was just fighting to survive. That’s what no one really understands. Not only was I fighting a brain programmed to self-destruct, I was fighting a demon that wanted to torture and murder me. I did the best I could. I have nothing to prove to anyone in heaven, in hell or here on earth.

Coming out of the coma was rough. I spiraled down into delirium. I started hearing voices and having hallucinations. My shadow self was projected onto the outside world and all my worst fears came to assault me when I was at my weakest and most vulnerable. This was psychologically traumatizing. Luckily, a few good people helped guide me through it and after a few days I was able to regain some semblance of sanity. Then I had to relearn how to walk, eat and use the bathroom. This took a month.

A few months later I was feeling much better. I was off the alcohol and I had lost fifty pounds when I was in the hospital. I wasn’t working, I was on disability, and my time was my own. My psychiatrist agreed to restart my Adderall. This gave me clarity and motivation. I knew what I wanted to do. What I needed to do. I had to write. I hadn’t written in years, but every day I felt the pull. I felt the call. I had come as close to death as you can possibly come and survive. I knew now that I could die at any moment. It was time to write, and to share that writing with the world.

I found a platform. I’m not tech savvy so I chose the one I thought was the easiest to use. I started slow, posting short poems and random musings. Then I dug a little deeper and began posting short stories and mini essays. But it was only when I began writing thoughtful responses to other peoples’ posts that I started attracting attention. One man in particular gravitated to my work. He encouraged me to write more freely and more authentically. His enthusiasm was infectious. He was unselfconscious and silly, but also deeply serious. He was a man of deep conviction. He believed that stories, anyone and everyone’s story, had the power to change the world. I followed his lead. No one had ever admired my work before. I had never received sincere, critical feedback before. This was a revelation. For the first time in my life I thought, ‘I can do this. I can be a writer’.

I gave everything to this platform. Everything. I’m a man of half measures, afraid of where full effort might take me. But this time I did not hold back. I knew death was waiting just around the corner. So I continued to post my work, old and new. Old stories and poems, and new essays and stories and experimental works that cannot be categorized. This platform became my playground. For the first time since I was a child my imagination was allowed to come to life and express itself without boundaries or filters. I felt like a king. I felt like a god. I felt like a creator. My mental illness, my addiction and the demon had robbed me of my power. Now I had my power back and I was utilizing it the best way I knew how. To create art that would stimulate the minds of other people and speak directly to their souls. Because I love you. I think I’ve said this before.

Unfortunately my time in the sun didn’t last. But my life did change forever. I have been having strange experiences since I was born. When I was in kindergarten I would dream entire days before they would occur and wonder to myself, ‘Why am I doing this day again?’. I would go out for walks in my neighborhood and I would be followed. People would flash colored lights in my eyes. The same street lamp would wink out every time I walked past it, and as it did a group of people would begin to mill about and chat as if triggered by some subliminal message. I started having dreams. The avatars of the people I was connected to on this platform began appearing in these dreams. They were directing me somewhere. I met various entities with various messages. One message was consistent. You are dead.

I deleted all my work off of the platform and threw all of my hard copies into the trash. This made sense to me at the time. It was a purge. I was letting go of my old life and making room for the new. But now I wish I had those files and had those pages. Someone out there does. I hope I meet them someday. Some of that stuff was absolute gold. The platform gave you the option of downloading a zip file of your work. I did this. I wasn’t prepared for what I got. When I opened the file ten documents popped up. Some had been edited and given new titles. Better titles. Whoever was behind this knew what they were doing. Then there was a final document. It contained a single statement. ‘This is a poet’. I leaned back in my chair, stunned. Was this the ultimate validation or had I just been hacked and trolled? Sophisticated and random for a troll. This felt sincere. Something was afoot. Between my dreams and what was happening in my real life, it felt like someone or some group was trying to speak to me. I just didn’t know what they were trying to say.

My strange experiences continued. I experienced constant synchronicities, or meaningful coincidences, like license plates reading the same words I happened to be thinking or speaking at the time. Scrabble words spelled out mystical phrases. After a bout of arguing with my shadow I would drive by a statue of Jesus hanging on the cross. I would overhear conversations in which the participants seemed to be discussing my life, my case as it were. No, I am not psychotic. I was not psychotic then. The universe was winking at me. My reality had noticed that I had noticed it, and it was converging upon me. Why was it doing this? To wake me up. Because I am an old soul trapped in a dream.

I started hearing voices. Subtle at first, then more insistent. I’m a skeptic at heart. I look to reason and science first. Was this a symptom of incipient psychosis? It seemed to fit the bill. But no. The truth was far stranger. Angels had begun whispering in my ear. Apparently they had interceded and resurrected me after my suicide attempt. Yes. This is the truth. Angels are real. They are fourth or sixth density entities. They interact with us constantly, even more so now that we are in a great transitional period, where the human race has the opportunity to advance beyond the spiritual prison it is currently held hostage within. So they saved me. And they began speaking to me. You need to know that our evolution is an evolution towards the unity of Source. We retain our individuality but we become more familiar with the relationships of group consciousness. I was now linked in to a spiritual group. They could communicate to me whenever they chose. They could tune me out whenever they chose. I like to be on equal footing with the people I interact with. You can recall my issues with authority. But even heaven has its rituals and its initiation. I raged against this. I really gave it to them. I was told ‘rituals preserve order’. This wasn’t enough for me. It still isn’t, but I have come to trust them so I make do.

The angels wanted to make a man out of me. At one point they actually came into my body, looked around my room and said ‘We’ll have to do something about this mess’. A few days later my room was spotless. They are intelligent, they are wise and they are loving. They love in a way that I, in my human form, cannot truly appreciate. They are also infuriating. They test me constantly. They provoke me simply to get a response and to gauge the sincerity of that response. Then they reassure me that I’m on their team, we’re all in this together and that I’m doing good work. This creates destabilizing cognitive dissonance. They do not care. They are stubborn. They are entities of faith and conviction. Maybe too much so. I could pontificate on this particular point for hours. But I won’t. The night is growing long and we must proceed.

With the light comes the dark. Earth is a hell realm, a prison, a purgatory lost in time. It is governed by fourth density negative entities and the organization commonly known as the Illuminati. They believe we are sheep who are content in our sleep, bustling about scrolling through our social media feeds, watching our TV shows, working in our cubicles and praying to the bearded god on his golden thrown in the clouds. The primary faction of these negative entities are the Reptilians. Yes, it sounds strange. It sounded outlandish to me until I encountered them in sleep states and then in my waking reality. The Reptilians are great military strategists. They also happen to be power-hungry, soul-disconnected psychopaths who rape, murder and eat human beings. Our government, and there is only one world government, knows this. They sold us out a long time ago in exchange for knowledge and advanced technology. To entities like the Reptilians we are livestock. Cattle. Their property. It is no use reasoning with them. They are utterly convinced of the righteousness of their position. That is okay. But we don’t have to stand for it anymore. We are powerful. Extremely powerful. In unity, we can overthrow the Illuminati, their coconspirators in the government and the Reptilians. With a little help from our friends. And trust me, dear reader, we are getting plenty of help from our friends. All things being equal, and nothing being judged under the watchful eye of the One Infinite Creator.

It was transmitted to me that one of the reasons I have suffered so much in this life is that I am burning off karma for the sins of my past life. Yes, karma is real. It is a natural law of creation that governs all entities below sixth density. Apparently I am a time traveler who came back in time, perfectly polarized, and eventually broke bad. I went over to the dark and became affiliated with the Illuminati and the Reptilians. I participated in horrific atrocities against humanity. Then the light caught me and turned me. I told them what I knew. I became a turncoat, a betrayer, a whistleblower. In the minds of the Reptilians I am a terrorist. Then I incarnated and went into hiding. From everyone. But I got bored and lonely and started leaving breadcrumbs on the internet. The light found me. And so did the dark. The light now supports me. They want to rehabilitate me, bring me to Christ and show me the path to Ascension and escape from this prison of nightmares. They want me to have the opportunity to atone for my sins and to become the soul they remember from long ago. The dark forces think I am a traitor and a rat. They hate that I am even typing these words. They want to mock me, taunt me, humiliate me and destroy me. They ask me to come over to their side. This will not happen. I am committed to Christ. And when I say Christ I am not speaking of Jesus, I am speaking of a universal consciousness that promotes freedom, love, creativity and self-sovereignty.

I’ve been busying myself with mental health programs. I spent a year and a half at one program before they told me I needed a higher level of care. I was drinking and self-harming. I agreed with their assessment, and was sent to a partial hospitalization program. This did not last long. I continued to drink while I was at the partial, which requires you remain abstinent for the duration of the program. I said to the director I should probably go impatient. He agreed. My mother was driving me to the local ER when suddenly I told her that this was a mistake. I didn’t need to be hospitalized. I wasn’t a danger to myself and I wasn’t in withdrawals. They wouldn’t take me anyway. Reluctantly my mother agreed and brought me back home. I was without structure of any kind. No work, no school, no writing, no program. Things were about to get messy. Yet again, I was about to find myself fighting for my life.

I was back to drinking every day. I promised myself I wouldn’t drink on Christmas, because on the prior Christmas Eve I had been hospitalized because of my alcohol consumption. I was determined not to drink. But I drank. I was drinking three pints of hard liquor a day. I gave my keys and wallet over to my mother for safekeeping. This did not deter me. I found my wallet, extracted money and took walks to the closest liquor store, secreting the three pints of cheap vodka behind my belt. My family knew I was drinking but they did not know the extent of it, and they didn’t know the darkness that was bubbling up beneath my brain.

The angels used to sing to me in my dreams. They took me all across the cosmos as part of my training. I was introduced to various species and various people along my journey. Entities kept telling me I was dead. I accepted this. Mostly. But I wanted to know why, how and when. They told me that I was the imagination of the future. They told me that our movies were cave paintings. They kept asking me questions. Was I racist? Did I hate Jews? Did I love money? Did I want some Adderall? And, why was I doing this? Hmm. Doing what? And herein lies the crux of the matter. There is a group of entities that has known me in a past life and is convinced that I know exactly who I am and what I have done and that I should be punished accordingly. There is another group of entities that has faith in my current identity, believes that I am sincerely unaware of my past misdeeds and that I deserve a chance at redemption. A trial of sorts is currently underway to determine my guilt or innocence and many methods are being deployed to get the full truth out of me. I say I am an open book. Come and get it. This is not a bluff.

The drinking broke me down. I have been depressed for the entirety of my adult life but finally I felt something break inside me. I no longer wanted to live. In the past, I wrestled with my conscience when contemplating suicide. I thought of my family and friends and the devastation I would leave in my wake. Not this time. This time I was tired and thought I had done my sincere best and deserved a rest. A rest from this ever whirling mind and this world that has tortured and traumatized me. I was finally ready to go. It was late at night and I had no sharp objects at hand. I had turned my knife collection over to the police. The kitchen knives were too dull and I had tried the shaving razors out on my arm. Too shallow and superficial. They would never sever my carotids. I was in despair. I knew this was my moment. I was drunk and I was ready. I felt relief at hand. I contemplated going to Walmart to purchase a straight razor but it was too late. I passed out on the couch.

A few days later I met with my psychiatrist. I told him about the drinking and consented to go inpatient. I went to the nearest ER, got admitted and then transferred to a detox. I was a walking zombie with barely any life left in him. But I went through the motions. I’m nothing if not unfailingly polite. After a week I was sent to a two week residential rehab. I found myself again. I reveled in company that I could relate to. We went to groups during the day, and partied at night. It was like what the college experience I imagined was like. Everyone was raw and vulnerable and open. Small talk wasn’t really a thing. It was, ‘How did you almost die?’. ‘Oh, that’s nuts, I almost died like this’. My heaven on earth. And I got to tell my story in front of a large group. I’ve always been self-conscious, wracked with survivor’s guilt, thinking that maybe I don’t have it all that bad. Maybe I don’t belong in this community of the sick and the suffering. I didn’t prepare notes. I didn’t know how long I would speak. I just started from the beginning and went from there. I captivated my audience. I got emotional. Of course I did. I’m goddamn tired. So tired. Bone tired. Weary in my guts. How much pain can one man take? That’s what I ask the angels. Tell me this is the darkest night of the soul you’ve ever witnessed. Not for my ego, but for my soul. Please, tell me. After I told my story a couple of young people came up to me and gave me hugs. One young woman hugged me and said, ‘Dude, I don’t know you from Adam, but you saved my life’. Now that’s probably an exaggeration, but it plunged deep into my heart. I thought I had to be well to help. Could I be sick and have a purpose? That would be a gift from God. I think I deserve a gift, if anyone deserves anything in this world of ours.

I came out clean. No more alcohol, but a few more medications. Things felt dark, cloaked in shadow. Did I mention I have a shadow? Well I do. We all do, this unincorporated section of our subconscious, where our deepest fears and desires are housed. My shadow speaks to me all the time. It is very wise, wiser than I am, but it is also angrier than I am. It is rage incarnate. It would burn the whole world to the ground to see justice served. It is a jealous lover. It loves me and it abuses me. I am blue and it is red. We have a mutual understanding. Sometimes we have civil conversations. Sometimes, when the shadow thinks I am being too weak or obsequious it tells me to shut my fucking mouth. The shadow doesn’t fear the way I fear. The shadow stands up to the demon in ways that I cannot. I admire and fear my shadow. I hope to integrate one day. I don’t want to lose it. I don’t want it to be spirited away. It’s grown so large that it has taken on its own identity, become its own separate entity, but it is me at the end of the day. Because I am not blue or red. I am Timothy. Hello there.

New meds, new me, new day. Ready to continue writing and continue fighting. But I didn’t account for what the alcohol use had done to me. It had shattered my spiritual armor. It had made me vulnerable to the demon. It had been some time since I had experienced a full possession. Now the game was on and the demon was about to rear its pointed head.

It happened on a Friday night. I was upstairs in my bedroom listening to the rapper NF on YouTube. A tingling came over me. Then a pressure surging up my right side. I couldn’t stop it, I could only witness. Within moments a great sigh escaped my lips and my tongue made several reptilian flicks. The demon had full possession of my body. I could only watch and wait. To the demon, possessing flesh is an orgasmic experience. It began swinging my head and bopping my arms to the music. It began shouting out loud and mocking the angels that it knew were witnessing this violation of divine law. Then it stood up and went over to my bureau and began rifling through my things, looking for a razor blade. It said, ‘I’m not going to cut him, I just want to be a dick’. Then it brought my body back over to the desk, sat down and began dragging the blade back and forth across my throat. Then it circled it over my genitals and mimicked stuffing my genitals down my throat. It said, ‘Not much of a meal’. And it howled with laughter.

The fight continued. The demon is savage, relentless, furious and blood hungry. It forced me to cut myself and it made me drink my own blood. It also made me take a lighter and mutilate my genitals. Don’t worry. I am safe. It may not sound like it, but I am. The angels are on my side. I have a therapist, a psychiatrist and a family support system. I am not suicidal. I have no urges to self-harm. But I need to relate the truth. This is what can happen when demons possess a human body. Demons exist. Don’t let anyone fool you into thinking otherwise.

The demon told me that it intends to force me to commit suicide. This will not happen. It will not win. I will have the final say. The light is here and the light will evict this demonic presence so that the Christ consciousness may take up residence within this vessel. And I am on the right medication, so for all you skeptics out there, don’t despair. I’m taking the proper precautions as outlined by western medicine. I am leaving nothing to chance. There is too much to lose.

I am alive. It is a miracle. I am writing. It is a miracle. I am sane. It is a miracle. Miracles happen. I have been through the blackest depression and the fires of hell and I can tell you with complete honesty, it’s worth it. This life of ours is worth it. Learning, exploring, experimenting, growing, changing, discovering, loving, losing, breaking, repairing…it’s all worth it. Just don’t think that what you see is the extent of reality. That would be a dangerous fallacy. The universe, all of creation, is far more subtle and complex than that. There are forces at work that seek to undermine and block your growth as a divine spiritual being. But you are powerful, my friend, more powerful than you know. You are a god in human flesh. Accept, embrace and cherish your humanity. It is a gift. And know that you are vastly more than what you appear to be when you look in the mirror.

This was the story of me.

What is your story?

151,"So, I had social anxieties for many years, along with depression. I finally managed to get over these problems a year ago, but it took me everything I got and I know for a fact I can't do that again. The place where I was was too dark for me to ever get back there.

Just when I got over these problems, when I finally found a group of friends, when I finally was able to be myself in front of others, this coronavirus hit.

People talk about the dead, and I feel for them, I truly do, especially for the area around Bergamo which is dear to me and which reminds me of my earliest years in a way. But they rarely talk about the psychological effects of the quarantine. 

For the past two weeks (or a little more) I have been having at least a panic attack every day. Some lighter than others, some that make me fall down and just cry with my back at the fridge. The one I had tuesday before last was extremely bad, it lasted four hours. I had one now, before writing this post, not big, but not light either, and I know it will take me a lot to get to sleep now.

The fact that the government (I live in northern Italy) is not giving dates (they talk about the 15th of april, the 4th of may, july 31st, after the vaccine, which will be at least a year) is not helping at all. The attacks are triggered by my current living situation (long story, bad environment), the fear of getting social anxieties and depression again, the fact that the health care system is completely fucked up here and I can do nothing about it (I am doing what I can but they are not helping even in that), the fact that I was stripped of my civil liberties and I am being treated like a criminal, the fact that I am worried for my friends who lost their jobs to the virus and will find it hard to find another due to the economic situation, and pure loneliness.

Honestly, I am not scared about the virus one bit, hell, I might have even had it. But all those other things scare me. 

Please consider us -- because I know I am not alone -- when you talk about the coronavirus.",04Apr2020,2
