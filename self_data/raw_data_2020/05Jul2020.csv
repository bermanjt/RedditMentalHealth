1,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a year &amp; a half. We clicked naturally, we were friends first, and generally things have been awesome. But, I met someone else, and I’m really, really, into him. I could (potentially) see myself falling in love w/ him too. I’ve considered maybe being in an open relationship, but I don’t think either of them would be down for that. So my question is this - because I’m having doubts, and I’m into this other guy, should I break things off? It’s just scary because the new guy and I are still getting to know each other, and I don’t want to ruin a good thing for something that may or may not work out.

3,"This was over an hour ago but I still feel awful about it. My stepdad had his son and his son’s wife over today. The wife has PTSD from her childhood and has a service dog because of it. 

They’ve been over at least ten times before and normally, the dog isn’t working. I guess today was different. I didn’t realize that the dog had her vest on before I was like “hey [insert dog’s name]” and gave her a quick scratch on the head. The wife said something like “hey, her vest is on she is working” and I immediately said “oh I’m so sorry I didn’t notice”. 

I’m not stupid. I know that you can’t distract a service dog. I didn’t think to check to see if she was wearing her vest or not because she never has at our house. I am a sensitive person and I can’t stop crying about this because I feel so bad.",05Jul2020,1

But ultimately, I believe things will eventually return to a sort of normal. That normal will involve changes. But I don’t believe this will last forever. I don’t believe every other person is some right wing racist or some left wing Radical Marxist. It seems to me that these individuals are a remarkable minority and just get the vast majority of media attention because of the ratings and the attention they get. It really is a dark time. But the Nation is more than just these dark times and the dark parts of our history that isn’t pleasant. But there has been remarkable good done by the people throughout history.

Well I sure do! And just thought I needed to tell strangers
So basically when I was a kid (say maybe 6 or 7, I’m 19 now) I always had a feeling that life was one of those big old arcade games, like the ones you’d play Pac-Man on. And in my head I could see myself playing this game and one day, in my kitchen, just thought to myself “well I think I’m ready to unplug this game now” or “I’m tired of playing how do I switch off”. Like wtf was I girl thinking about😂 I was totally ready to just switch off for the rest of my life as a 6 year old. It probably was a little innocent thought and I’m overthinking it but my mind does wander and that’s a good explanation for a vivid weird af memory. Since I can’t really tell the ppl
I know irl, Just felt the need to share one of my weird tales of what is appearing to be a somewhat odd childhood!",05Jul2020,2

11,"Today has just been a terrible day. You ever had a day where everything is just going wrong? That was today for me. I currently working a part time job at a coffee. Today, I was 30 minutes late to my shift because I had accidentally set my alarm to the wrong time (PM instead of AM). Co-workers made snarky comments to me as I was running in (“YOU’RE LATE! you were also late yesterday!” “Um, I wasn’t working yesterday...?”) My manager told me I might be fired for being late (as is is my second time since I started working in March, the first time I was 15 minutes late). I’ve been scolded for not remembering to do certain things and not being able to remember all the recipes for drinks. My co-worker has complained to my manager about my customer service (although no one will tell me what I’m doing wrong).

 I just feel so dejected because I really am trying my best with this job. I smile and make conversation with customers, I apologize when I mess up and take ownership and responsibility over it. I only work 10 hours on the weekends and I can’t even manage one good shift a week. I know that this job is only a temporary thing for me (I was planning to quit in August due to needing to take full time university course in the fall) but the idea of getting fired is terrifying to me because it’ll affect any future job applications. I can’t even do this simple coffee job. I work hard but I just feel so stressed because despite my efforts, I’m still not working up to their expectations. I’m starting to feel like I’m just not good at anything and I’ll never be successful in life. I’ve been rejected for many job interviews before this one. I want to do a master’s program in the future as I am currently working on obtaining my BA in sociology but I get mediocre grades at best (like a 3.2 GPA), I’m very average looking so gaining success due to my looks is definitely a no go (it doesn’t help that I accidentally shaved off part of my eyebrow yesterday :/ ). I don’t even think I can get by with my personality as I am a bit socially awkward and don’t have a close friend or connections in the “real” world. 

I know, to some people, it may just sound like I’m being dramatic and it’s not a big deal but it’s just causing a really big hit to my self esteem. I tried really hard at this job but I’m just not getting it. The worst part is that I’ve been a barista for the past 3 years but I’ve never had a coffee job that has such high standards for their employees as this one before. If I can’t even do this job, how can I succeed in any future career? Or anything at all? I’m 20 years old and I’m still not a fully functioning adult. I can’t even drive a car. IM SPIRALLING. 


I’m just feeling really down about myself and I don’t have anything positive going on in life. It’s to the point where I feel like I’m just so useless and I have no purpose. A couple months ago my therapist asked me what makes a human being valuable. At the time I answered that a human being is valuable simply because they are a human being. Even though I said that, I definitely don’t believe it for myself. I’m so sad. I’m now going to take a bath as I cry in the tub.",05Jul2020,2

13,"I have a job that pays well enough for me to afford my own one bedroom apartment. I am so ecstatic and I’m afraid I’m driving everyone around me crazy because I can’t stop talking about it! So please allow me to brag a little bit here :)

It’s a one bed, one bath ground level apartment (not garden level, first floor) with BEAUTIFUL hardwood floors. It’s a little over 700 square feet. It’ll be my first time living alone and I am so looking forward to the peace and quiet. My family is very loud. My little brother has autism and he’s as sweet as can be but DAMN he is LOUD. He verbally stims all day and he’s going crazy with being housebound - he’s usually very sociable and loves talking to people (more like AT people but ya know) but with the pandemic going on he hasn’t gotten to socialize and he’s getting restless.

My stepdad is deaf and he doesn’t realize how loud he is. And my mom is just loud lol she always has the TV at almost max volume. Our dog is very old and she’s gone deaf herself so when she barks at people/animals outside we can’t use a command to quiet her down.

I’m so ready to be on my own. My family is wonderful and it’s not like I want to leave because I’m mistreated but damn I want my own space.

I already have whole decoration schemes in my head and a shopping list of the furniture I want. Now my job doesn’t pay THAT well so it’ll be a slow, slow process to get my apartment looking how I want but I don’t care because it’ll be mine (well, I’m renting but still). My living room will be beige and sage green, my bedroom will be blush pink and white, my bathroom will be lavender and I’m not sure about the kitchen yet but I’m feeling like blue.

It’s far enough away from my hometown that I’ll feel independent but not so far away that I can’t run back home if I need something. I’m sort of terrified about giving a little under a third of my gross income, a little under half my net income, away each month but I’ve run the numbers a million times and I can afford it. I discovered that I had been waiting for someone to give me permission to move out but no one is ever going to do that. I know my mom would rather have me stay at home forever. So I took matters into my own hands and gave MYSELF the permission to look for an apartment and I found one. 

I start repaying my student loans next month (grace period + covid forbearance will be over) and I got a credit card so I can start building my credit to one day hopefully buy a home. (I know, always pay off the balance each month, never spend more than you actually can afford...I’m not worried about losing control with it).

I just feel so independent and like an adult it’s exhilarating. I’m 24 and I’m trying my best and I think my best is pretty damn good.",05Jul2020,1
14,"

Basically him and I had been flirting for around a month and he was constantly gushing to my friend about me and he’d blush and everything and it seemed like he really liked me. Than one night he told my friend he wanted to invite me to formal and asked her if she really thought I liked him.. and he flirted with me for like an hour that night. But when I was talking to my friend he walked up with his friend and than my friend asked me to go find someone with her and I did. I think this made him mad because he sent me a picture of a girl in his room so I was rude back. Than the next day he was angry and telling my friend he wouldn’t take me to formal and him and I talked about it but it was kinda a play fight. 

We tried talking about it the next day for over an hour but we both lied about what made us mad. So we made up but we didn’t discuss the real issues so it didn’t help. Him and I ended up getting in huge fights because of drunk texting and getting really mad but still not communicating why we were mad. I think he got so fed up with me and was over it and he ended up dating the girl he brought to formal instead of me. Him and I didn’t see each other Over those two months.

Eventually, after my winter break him and I started seeing each other our again often and he was obsessively trying to get my attention. He was trying to come up to me or whoever I was talking to every second. He was always smirking or staring at me or walking by me. He would get upset and be cold to me some days and some days he’d be really nice. But it seemed like he was using the girl because he would stare at me while he was talking to her out of the corner of his eye and than he fully turned away from her to talk to me. And when I didn’t want to talk to him he got super upset and stood there looking heartbroken broken than ran away. He also was super rude some days. But basically he was always kinda obsessing over me. These weird hot and cold games lasted for months but I didn’t really respond to him or try to talk to him because I respect relationships. Now they’ve broken up and I’m sure he will try to contact me again when quarantine ends and we are back at school. I just want to be able to communicate with him about what he did and why. I’ve kind of been pushing him away this past semester because I didn’t like that he was trying to get my attention while in a relationship.",05Jul2020,1

16,"I wrote the following several months ago, after a long day of listening to morons mumble misunderstandings, musings, and misinformation and watching intelligent, intelligible individuals suffer from the perceived social pressures of providing pertinent postulations and persuasions to the predominantly ignorant. In other words, I was tired of watching ignorant imbeciles egregiously erode and disingenuously dismiss the intelligent input of others without suffering the pertinent shame of stupidity.

The following is not a guide to constructing coherent  intelligent discourse, it is a diatribe of actions and understandings that I hope will provide the persistently persuasive people a prescription for perverse pleasure and intellectual indemnification.  

**The 5 Steps to Arguing with Idiots**  

***Step 1: Understanding Ignorance and Opinions***

You are ignorant. I am ignorant. We, he, she, them, they are all ignorant. Nobody in this world is ignorant of nothing, to be so would make you omniscient. Are you a god? It’s OK to be ignorant because the entirety of human knowledge is currently beyond the sole possession of any individual; that’s not even including what we haven’t yet learned or have already lost.

Willful ignorance however, is the abject rejection of verifiable knowledge for faith in one’s opinion and the abandonment of reason. It’s not OK to be willfully ignorant because it’s destructive and counterproductive to the advancement of human society, and we’re all in this together whether we like it or not.

Opinions, contrary to popular belief, are not like arseholes. Although everyone has one, and most are full of shit, opinions are just the cumulative result of the information an individual has chosen to accept as fact. Opinions are the sediment buildup on the sea floor of your ocean of knowledge, opinions are built up and eroded over time as the knowledge they are influenced by changes. If you fill your ocean of knowledge with garbage then you will develop garbage opinions.

The strength of one's opinions are only bolstered or broken by one’s own willingness to let them, and opinions are impervious to the will of others; as such they are entirely irrelevant unless verifiable, no matter how strongly held they might be. It’s OK to not have an opinion about something if there’s no verifiable knowledge of it in your ocean, that just makes you ignorant and that’s OK; only choosing an opinion, rather than developing one, makes you willfully ignorant.  


***Step 2: Understanding Your Opposition - The Troglodyte***

A troglodyte is willfully ignorant by definition, they have already chosen to neglect their ocean of knowledge, the sediment that makes up their opinions is garbage, and they are not willing to let those opinions erode. You CANNOT easily change the opinions of a troglodyte. There’s a number of well known euphemisms relating to the very topic, “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make them drink”, “You can’t reason a person out of a position they didn’t reason themselves into”, “Stupid is as stupid does”.

You can't argue with a troglodyte in the conventional manner because they don’t utilise the same tools for discussion (understanding, respect, compromise) as an intelligent and rational person. You can't oppose willful ignorance with compromise, because the only result of compromising verifiable knowledge IS ignorance.

Knowing that you cannot “win” in a battle of opinions with your opposition is important! The impossible rigidity of their poorly developed opinions defines their personality, and it takes a serious war of attrition to erode someone's self identity. To wage war on the opinions of another takes a prolonged and intensive multi-faceted approach.  


***Step 3: Understanding Your Audience***

Irrelevant of any conflict of opinions between you and your opposition, the one thing you must be focused on is your audience.Your audience should be the true target of any attempt to change an opinion, not necessarily the person you’re conflicting with. Remember, they may be a willfully ignorant troglodyte with rigid unchanging opinions, but the numerous people who are privy to your conversations may not be, and may just pick up what you’re putting down, especially if it’s verifiable knowledge. An example of this can be seen in the movie Thank You for Smoking - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuaHRN7UhRo  


***Step 4: The Art of War***

Now that you have a better understanding of yourself, your opposition, and your influence or lack thereof, it’s time to discuss tactics. As mentioned earlier, it takes a prolonged and intensive multi-faceted war of attrition to change an opinion.

It’s important to keep the following in mind:
Opinions are only as valuable as they are verifiable.
You can't oppose willful ignorance with compromise.
Opinions are only as strong as the one who holds them.
Argue for the audience

In any given ‘battle’ where there is a collision of opinions the goal should not be to change your opponents opinion as only they can do that. The goal instead should be to destabilise the foundations and supports that allow them to maintain their opinions. Attempting to support an unintelligible opinion requires 3 core pillars of support; Ignorance, People, and Pride.  

*Ignorance*:

To attack the Pillar of Ignorance is to attack their opinion head on. The only weapon effective against ignorance is verifiable knowledge. Ensuring that any arguments you choose to make against their opinion are backed up by verifiable resources is the cornerstone of dispelling ignorance. No matter how hard one holds an opinion, it’s value only lies in its verification, so as you erode the ideas they hold true about their opinion, so do you erode their pillar of ignorance. This leaves us in the difficult task of attempting to educate someone who does not wish to be educated. The only way to teach someone who refuses to actively learn is to expose them to the appropriate information passive aggressively.

To passively erode ignorance requires a brute force attempt at knowledge provision, you have to continually, and repeatedly, broach the subject of their opinion, this can be done through bombarding them with conversation, articles, pictures, links, memes, anything that keeps your ideas about their opinion within their field of perception, whether direct or indirect. Listening to appropriately related audio media, or constantly posting on their social media feeds can be fantastic for indirect passive education.

Despite filling their ocean of knowledge with nutrients, it’s going to take time and persistence to build up some quality sediment for them to start forming opinions with. Eroding the pillar of ignorance won’t change their opinion on it’s own, but it gives them the appropriate tools to change their opinion once you erode the other two pillars.  

*People*:

To attack the Pillar of People is to attack the outside influence of any third parties that support the opinion that is held by your opponent. This is accomplished not by discrediting the opinion directly, but the sources from where it is obtained. This can be done in numerous ways, from providing counter sources for information, opinions of influence outside of their usual exposure, exposing the failures and misdirection employed by their sources. Even little things like developing subversive and subconscious feelings of discontent when mention of said sources arises. In practice this could just be as simple as insulting the media sources that share their opinion at every opportunity. And this brings us to the last pillar.  

*Pride*:

To attack the Pillar of Pride is to attack the respect that your opponent holds for their opinion and the sources that gave it to them. How willing will someone be to espouse their opinions when their pride in their sources dissipates? How often will someone rant about their misheld belief if they know their audience is no longer receptive to or respectful of their ideas, and will actively use the opportunity to retaliate with verifiable knowledge? How long can their pride hold out against being bombarded with reasoning and facts before they have enough verifiable knowledge to change their opinion? To erode the Pillar of Pride is to attack the very strength that they think their opinions provide them, to attack any idea that their opinion is respected, and to replace their pride with shame. This can be the hardest (both in practice and emotionally) as it requires being able to enact actual emotional damage to your opposition so as to affect an appropriate shift in opinion.

The pride of your opposition cannot be eroded without first eroding their ignorance, and support. Only when they are alone in their opinion, and aware of the alternatives, will they be susceptible to losing pride. Once pride finally crumbles, the troglodyte dies, reborn, re-educated.  


***Step 5: The Battle of Opinions***

Now that you have a more comprehensive understanding of your opponent and their opinions you can learn to counter their immediate ignorance. When dealing with people in person you will have to play to the relationship and situations you have to work with but by following the ideas of the 3 Pillars you can build the required groundwork.

For online interactions and social media we need to understand and utilise the tactics of the common troglodyte; misrepresent, misinterpret, dismiss, and insult.

The immediate response to a well thought out argument in the idiot playbook is to counter with unsubstantiated opinions and widespread quips that are usually emotionally charged and partially correct at best, and straight up dismissive and outright wrong at worst. They aren't trying to have a discussion, they aren't trying to persuade you with information, they are trying to anger and annoy and dismiss your ‘authority’ of knowledge over their 'sense of self'.

The trick is to state your facts and frame your argument as best you can with verifiable information, but only do this for your initial arguments because fact and nuance are about to go out the window, remember, we're arguing with an uncompromising idiot. You've already delivered your facts and supporting information, you’ve shown the audience your hand and you’ve already been silently judged. The audience has chosen their champions and only await to be entertained.

It's time to duel.

Like a duel, you choose the weapon (knowledge, wit, logic, literacy) and the opponent chooses the arena (analytical conversation, emotionally charged debate, dismissive insultation).

Your run of the mill moron will choose emotionally charged debate, dismissive insultation, or a combination thereof. They will reply with the tactics they know best misrepresent, misinterpret, dismiss, insult, because they lack any sort of verifiable sources or logic for the garbage they opine. But you have made your argument, you provided facts, and sources, and you are verifiably correct. You have attempted to erode the Pillar of Ignorance, maybe not theirs but hopefully the audiences, you no longer need to defend your opinion because your defence is indisputable.

Now you need to attack their pride, this is where you’re free to attack and bully their ignorance into submission. Don’t feel bad about causing emotional discomfort, their ignorance does plenty of that every day to many people. They won’t change their opinion, but I can guarantee you’re better equipped to use their own tools against them. Use your wit, logic, knowledge and literacy to misrepresent, misinterpret, dismiss, and insult their opinion and their mistakes in trying to express that opinion with brutal savagery. Unleash your creative side in an unmitigatable barrage of demeaning, disingenuous, displeasure. Twist their own words into insults like they twist facts into lies. Insult them in completely hypothetical and hysterical ways. Play against all of their ingrained insecurities and make them squirm and swear and yell with all the lack of comprehension and grammar that they possess, and your audience will love you.",05Jul2020,1
17,Reading has always been something I've strayed away from as I always have trouble following along whenever a read something and usually I never remember or acknowledge what I just read. However the game that I am really into has a lot of reading material and I need a lot and I love the lore of the world but I can't go more than a few paragraphs without getting overwhelmed or realising the last couple paragraphs I completely forgot what they were even about. I also just want to be able to read in general but I can never do that. Is this even something that can be fixed?,05Jul2020,1

i just don’t know how to feel. i cant get the image of it getting hit out of my head and i know its conscious is in like the fourth dimension or something and that its body is safe out of the road. but if still crying over how horrifically it had to die and about how shitty its body was treated immediately after it had passed. it didn’t have any wounds that were visible according to my mom but still.

23,"Basically, I worked a day shift with 5 other people. I work in food service as a driver and one of the insiders had covid and came to work despite feeling sick. I vividly remember this girl (we will call her Joanne) coughing a lot and complaining of allergies. She even made a joke about having covid. 

Anywho, skip to today, this dayshift was a week ago as of now, and my boss called to let me know I needed to be tested as soon as possible, as Joanne had tested positive for covid 19. 

I asked what protocol would be for me, am I supposed to show up for my shifts or stay home until I have received test results. Her response, verbatim was, I am still allowed to come in for my shifts even if the testing results take a few days or more as “everyone has already been exposed, so staying home wouldn’t do anyone any good” 

I told her I would prefer to wait on my test results to clear that I am healthy and not risking others. I’m aware exposure has already occurred, I could likely have covid 19 because of this and so could others. I haven’t exhibited any symptoms thus far. I intend on being tested once a clinic is open in my area tomorrow. 

I’m mortified because I could potentially have this. I could have spread it to others. I could have spread it to loved ones or the elderly people I’ve come into contact with through work. I feel awful and terrified in so many ways. I haven’t told my immediate family as I want to be tested first before I freak anyone out. My mother would have an absolute melt down, and I just can’t handle that right now. 

Anyway, I thought it was very odd the way my manager has handled this. I thought if exposure FOR SURE occurred, those people need to be tested and quarantined until the test results have returned. I’m also bothered by the absolute recklessness of her, and corporates, response to this. Maybe it will unfold and become more than this, I don’t know. It’s a fairly busy location in a decently large city of sorts. This girl was blatantly sick and barely wearing a mask and hacking all over the place. 

I’m angry and terrified right now. I have no one I can talk to because it’s still unconfirmed on my end if I have it, so I just needed to vent.",05Jul2020,1

I need to remind myself that I have been on this journey of recovery for years, but it is not quite over. Maybe it will never be over either, but I know that I have the strength to keep going. I have survived so much abuse. I have survived the people I love repeatedly walking out on me. My biggest fear is being abandoned by the people I love. Recently that fear came true, and it hurt me worse than anything has ever hurt me. To lose your partner and your best friend all at once is not something I would ever wish on anybody. I feel so weak at the moment. I feel so much guilt, too. I know I am more than the diagnoses I first received three years ago. I have made so much progress since then, progress that only I have been a witness to in its entirety. Sometimes I just wish to be accepted, and if ever I could dream of being understood - I would like that too. I never claimed to be perfect. I never hid my flaws. I, you, and everyone else. We are mere works in progress for all of our lives, and our only hope is to be better than we were a time ago. Try to be good to one another. Try to not hurt one another. Try to not betray one another. Try to let go of any hatred in your heart, and let love fill its place. I love you all so much. Whoever you are, wherever you are, I love you. I love you.

skin. i don’t say anything because he’s not my little brother. The other annoying thing is that he sleeps in the bed with us. Which is fine we have enough room but i’d like to sleep comfortability with the way i sleep. (i like to sleep nude). 
Today, my mom came by and she got
food for me and my boyfriend but still
managed to sacrifice her own hunger for my
bfs little brother. (she gave him her food she had). 
he did NOT say thank you ONCE to my
mom nor did he greet her. After she had left but she got mad, my bf decided to have a beer and almost finished. His little brother knocked over the drink on accident on my WHITE blanket but NO “i’m sorry”. he’s impolite and i’m so fed up but don’t wanna say anything.

28,"So I got these shoes and they are really good for my feet. The thing is, I’ve been scared of wearing them because they make me pretty tall.

I’m naturally 5’11”, and I’m scared of being taller than guys. These shoes make me about 4 inches taller. They are some comfort memory foam ones, and they are good for my ankles. I do a lot of standing and things with my feet. 

I haven’t worn the shoes in 9 months, but I know I need to.

I finally said “Fuck it” and I wore them for the first time.

Anyways I’m getting medically separated for having epilepsy. In marine corps logic, having literally anything wrong health wise means you’re weak. 

So, this annoying/obnoxious guy who absolutely cannot handle his alcohol is 100% of the time drunk yelling at random people over random shit. Yesterday I was coming back at like 9. The dude was outside yelling like he always is. My roommate was waiting outside bc he forgot his keycard. 

The crazy dude is like “that’s your roommate?” To him. Then he just starts blabbering off about how I’m a bitch and how bitches are below others etc etc. (oh.. that guy is gonna wish he were dead the second he lays his eyes on his workplace) anyways my roommate is new so he’s there all awkward like “yeah” “yeah” “yeah” lmao all while I’m inside clearly hearing all of this. 

He came in and he’s like “dude the group of people out there is calling you a bitch “ lmao I’m like “oh I know”

Im not bullied, in fact, i know and have relationships with a LOT of people. But unlike other people, I dont really feel close to anyone. I dont feel like i can really indulge in how i feel to anybody. 

Im skinny, short, unathletic, overall not the brightest, I have no real talents. People say im funny but i cant help but feel unliked. Maybe I just crave approval I dont know. But i objectively feel like shit all the time. Like a voice putting me down whenever it has the chance. 

It hasnt helped that ive started having to cut off a lot of people, typically because I recognized that they were hurting me. Some even outright talking shit. At first I felt fine, i mean im cutting off the toxicity, but now i feel even lonelier. 

As said before, im not the brightest. I CAN get stuff done, but when things get complicated I just tune out, and lack any form of determination. At the same time I fear growing up and becoming nothing. Just another average nobody. Sometimes I have spikes of determination, both academic and health, but they always end with me crashing even harder than before.

32,"I wanna talk about a concept called ""The Social Contract"" and what being a patriot and citizen means. This was in response to a comment of: ""I don't disagree with wearing a mask, I just don't like the idea of the government requiring people to do so.""

The social contract, AKA - Civics 101.

Society is important because as a whole it gives us law and with those laws we get Rights. Rights are important because obviously they protect aspects of our lives from encroachment from the government and others.

That being said, Rights come with Responsibilities. Part of what is called ""The Social Contract."" There are plenty of things that are not illegal, that MOST PEOPLE don't do as members of society because doing them damages others or society as a whole, even if it's in small ways. Enough of these actions done together start to damage social coheasion.

Small example - Putting the cart in the corral at the grocery store. Will someone not putting their cart back cause the collapse of society? Of course not; but if enough people stop doing it then other members of society will either have to deal with that inconvenience or shops will have to install the ""quarter"" systems we see in some stores today.

It sounds silly/insane right? But let's look at a more serious example.

Being Sexist - Damages other members of society, makes their lives harder, impacts the individuals ability to change their station/grow financially. Can result in physical harm.

Being Racist - Damages other members of society, makes their lives harder, impacts the individuals ability to change their station/grow financially. Can result in physical harm. (often does, look at what Black Lives Matter is actually protesting)

I think we can agree, being Sexist, or being Racist are bad, right? I think you can see the point that breaking the social contract might harm society. More importantly, not being Sexist/Racist costs you literally $0. If too many people are Racist, you get lynchings. If too many people are sexist, you get things like Domestic Violence, or even just job discrimination which is bad enough.

So we have two extremes, Grocery Carts and Sexism/Racism

What's in the middle?

There is a pandemic, the government asks you to wear a mask to protect your fellow citizens, and yourself. Not wearing a mask means the virus can spread more easily, this damages other members of society, could make their lives harder (as they work to avoid you while going about the lives they have to live in public) or could even kill them. Impacts their ability to function in ways that would change their station (If you're high risk, people not wearing masks are literally a danger to be around).

If we can agree that refusing to wear a mask breaks the social contract, what can society do? Social contracts are primarily enforced by social pressure, ""Do the right thing"" ""Be a good citizen"" and in previous governments they were subject of major speeches. (This is a long part, please stick with me)

""I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."" - Racism.

""Ask not, what your country can do for you! But what you can do for your country!"" - Civil Service, Building a better society for the poor.

""A free nation has the right to expect full cooperation from all groups. A free nation has the right to look to the leaders of business, of labor, and of agriculture to take the lead in stimulating effort, not among ether groups but within their own groups. The best way of dealing with the few slackers or trouble makers in our midst is, first, to shame them by patriotic example, and, if that fails, to use the sovereignty of Government to save Government."" - FDR 4 Freedoms Speech.

Our Government at this point (through Trump, who has failed to make calls to action like other leaders have) has failed to pressure it's citizens to abide by this new (and temporary) part of the social contract, and as a result the people are in disarray. Where social pressure fails, but the matter remains an issue that threatens the health and well-being of the entire country (As well as the economy), the law must intercede to ensure the continuance and growth of civil society.

The thing that should make you the most uncomfortable about there being laws requiring people to wear masks, is that the laws are required at all because people refuse to be good citizens and uphold the social contract. They know the masks are the most effective tool to stop the virus, and choose to value the freedom to risk harm to others, over the safety of their fellow citizens.

Refusing to wear a mask is literally one of the least patriotic things one can do right now.

33,"So for context I was in a cohort of sorts in a girl dominated profession. In fact I was the only guy in it. A lot of the girls From that group have gotten married or are getting married and here I am at 25, and never dated before. 

I will be honest, I feel like an absolute failure because of that. I have a graduate degree, I have a great job lined up that is also unfortunately affected by this stupid pandemic. I’ve been through hell and back with some of the things that have happened in my life. 

Yet despite it all I still feel like I’ve failed in life. I don’t get why I’m not attractive enough for someone to actually like me romantically? Yeah I get that I did not inherit the best genetics when it comes to looks. But at the same time I can count a lot of positives about myself. Not to mention too that I’m open minded about things and I’m always willing to learn from my mistakes and to become better at things in life.

I have revisited the videos on YouTube, but only for my self-learning. I have not responded to them except the very earliest ones. Now that I am fully aware, any ""free will"" of mine towards negative polarities is null and void - and certainly into the future, there won't be any more coming your way.

Thank you for providing a polarity, so that I know the STS path is not to be chosen. Tracking me online is only doing you a disservice. There is no reciprocity - thus, you are only the observer.

37,"Posting this because I see a lot of threads with someone questioning if they should break up with their S/O or try to make things work. Daniel Sloss (specifically episode 2, titled ""Jigsaw"" on Netflix) provides a different approach to this topic which can be incredibly helpful! Daniel Sloss is a stand up comedian, and although comical, how he adresses the subject of relationships comes across in a very serious yet funny way. Whether you are single, dating, or in a long term committed relationship, I cannot recommend this enough! Itll force you to confront potential problems in your current and future relationships, and, if nothing else, is still a really funny watch. 

About 6 months ago I (M21) was in a relationship (2yrs 6mo. at the time) when my girlfriend (F21) suggested we should watch this comedian one night. We watched the first episode, laughed a lot, she grew tired, and I ended up watching the second episode myself while she slept on my chest. That shit changed how I thought about our relationship, and by the end of the hour episode, I was convinced I had to break up with her. I gave myself the night to think about it, and in the morning reflected on my idea and thought about how foolish it would be to break up based on ideas I learned from a Netflix stand up special. However, like Sloss said in his show, he planted a seed in my head which  grew and grew. 

I spent the next two months trying to forget his stand up routine and convince myself I was in a solid relationship. Admittedly, this is two months I wish I could give back to her, and I regret not facing the truth sooner. I eventually came to my senses and broke things off with her. Looking back, I'm incredibly  glad I did! Daniel Sloss was not the reason my relationship didn't work; there were many aspects of the relationship that I now know were very toxic but didn't realize at the time because I was complacent. However, Daniel Sloss planted the ideas that lead to my breakup. He quite literally changed my life and helped me avoid a potential mistake (had plans to propose to her in the summer. Had sent as far to talk to her close friends and my parents about it). 

That's all I've got! Hope this helps some of you! Also a great way to eat up down time during quarantine! 

TL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend of almost 3yrs who I was planning on proposing to because of a stand up routine by Daniel Sloss.

Edit: I wrote this a few months ago and forgot to post and after reading through it it sounds really advertisey and scripted. But I'm not I'm the mood to change it so try to look past that! I promise it's not an advertisement!",05Jul2020,1
39,"I love my long nails but they’re getting too long and I need to cut them because they’re constantly bending and it hurts but I don’t want to cut them because they’re pretty and they make me less insecure about my hands.

My hands are the only things I’m secure about right now. I’ve been eating shit for four months and I’ve gained 15 pounds. I’m now obese, and because of my shitty eating, I’m breaking out on my face and shoulders. To make matters worse, the cream my doctor prescribed makes my skin burn. To top it all off, I recently started shaving my cheeks because I’m Indian and have dark peach fuzz. I just wanted to be more confident and now I look like a walking pimple. Awesome.


I confronted some old friends of mine who hurt me. They apologized and claimed they wanted to be friend but only talk to me if they need something or if THEY feel like talking. Otherwise they never read my messages or they leave me on read/seen. It’s painful. And one guy who used to be my best friend/almost bf, is dating one of the girls who hurt me. And I recently found out that he started dating her a week after our date went sour. Cool. I think I started catching feelings again but I’m shutting them down because I cant let myself go through that hurt again. 

I have no friends. No one to really talk too. I journal from time to time so I don’t explode. My mother cared about my depression for a day but quickly moved on and started acting like the same narcissistic mother I hate. My sister is naive and is the golden child of my family so she has it easy. I have no support system. I’m alone, unloved, and uncared for. Virtually undesirable. 

I live in a shitty apartment with bugs and mold and I’m always responsible for cooking and cleaning and keeping everything together while my sister and mom complain about how they’re always doing all of the work. It’s infuriating.

My 14year old brother who just because he is physically bigger thinks I’m his bitch

My brother makes me look like a child


I am 17 year old male and my brother is 14 years old. Last November when he was 13 I remember we were measured and we were both 5,7 we also both had almost no body hair and basically looked the same, at the time I was 16. Well he had a HUGE growth spurt. I still look exactly the same as before. But my brother is HUGE. He is now 14 and 6,2 he is now a full 7 inches taller than me. Over the summer he grew a TON I remember swimming in the pool There was no bulge in my underwear and my brothers bulge was huge. He never showed me his penis before though. But earlier this week we were home alone and he cornered me and forced me to pull my pants down. He is stronger than me so he pinned me down and took my boxers off .He measured his at 7.5 inches and He laughed as mine was barley half the length of his at 4 inches. Also now he has huge forests of pubic hair and armpit hair. He now has been shaving. And today he told me had chest hair growing and I said he was lying. And he showed me and he does have chest hair growing. He is always bossing me around now because he is so big and he is powerfully built and wears a men's large clothes and weighs 200 pounds of muscle. My brother has become the man of the house and is always wrestling me down. He is supposed to grow more soon and will be 6,7 or taller fully grown.

It's so ridiculous. We go to the same school and its horrible. Yesterday he teased me in front of my friends. And at home he was acting stupid so I told him to stop and he just grabbed me and pinned me to the Floor. I can't fight him. I tried 

Oh and I forgot to say that I have small feet and wear a size 8.5UK shoe and he wears a HUGE size 13UK.My shoe looks like a baby's shoes next to his. Like when both of our shoes are at the doormat his look like giant shoes compared to mine. And we were sitting on the couch yesterday and he mentioned how small my feet were. He then proceeded to put his foot up against mine and my toes didn’t even reach his arch. He measured his foot and told me that his foot is 30cm! That’s the whole freaking ruler! Mine were barley 25cm. Mine were like little baby feet compared to his. I wear WAY smaller clothes than him too I get his hand me downs, he once gave me his underpants which had cum stains in them. Also the other day my parents friends came over. And they said to my brother "" look how big you have gotten wow you are bigger than your dad now"" and they said to me "" you need to eat more to be as big as your older brother"" then my dad told them the truth and they all laughed. My brother made me stand back to back with him and it was horrible. My head didn't even go up to his shoulders. It's so unfair. He looks 17 and I look 14. But I am actually 17 and he is 14. What do I do?

I hope he doesn’t grow anymore as at the moment my head doesn’t even reach his shoulders, I’m older than him and he gives me his handydowns and half the time they are too big for me, he has given me many socks and underwear that he used to wear, many of which have cum stains on them. , the other day in school I was in the toilets just coming out after taking a piss and washing my hands my bro sees me and shouts”this guy right here has a smaller penis than me!” for all the people in the toilets and outside the toilets to hear

I try to be nice, but I mean I can’t be a dick to him or he’ll literally beat me up,

He is usually like that. I was watching tv last week on the couch, he walked into the room and sat on me and positioned himself over my face and farted ,I could barley breathe and he wouldn’t get up till I said “you are the bigger brother”. When I said that he put me in a headlock and gave me a noogie. Before he walked out he took a pillow and put it down his trousers and rubbed his junk with it before putting it on his ass and once again farting on it and holding my face to the pillow before he walked out",05Jul2020,1

53,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

In the last 2 years (post breakup)  I’ve lost 70 lbs and have been doing things that most people probably don’t think twice about.  Little things, like putting my hair in a bun and going shopping or wearing a swimsuit to fit my new shape. It all feels so new and exciting. 

I feel weird with my hair up but I guess it’ll feel normal one day. I hope everything that seems new or intimidating right now feels normal one day... it should’ve never felt any other way. 


TL;DR: I finally put my hair in a bun and wore a swimsuit after a decade of not doing those things. It feels good. I feel free.",05Jul2020,1
57,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? When i do eat i are fried eggs and bacon on toast is that bad?

I drank a lot of water today and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal? I’m 11.4 but hardly any different at all

58,"Let’s call him Rory.

Rory’s dad used to beat him which is why, on this very rare occasion, I was alone in his room. Rory was kind of an overbearing douche of a kid and I was not allowed to touch his things for risk of getting beaten myself. 

He had these tiny action figures on his dresser. Pocketing the little Batman was thrilling. But I remember the moral conundrum playing out in my head. The threat of hell was very real as told by my grandma who had told me that if I did basically anything bad the devil would jump up through the floor and grab my leg. 

But I took Batman anyway. And nothing happened. And although the lingering fear of retaliation from Rory and the looming threat of hell were still a possibility for me, I didn’t face any consequences aside from the torture I put myself through at the hands of an imaginary beelzebub. 

On a probably unrelated note, he did run me over with a four-wheeler 6 months later and I ended up in the hospital. I suppose that was retribution enough for my actions.",05Jul2020,1

I know it's nothing and lame and you're probably wonder why am I posting this. This is my first ever edit after I started learning to edit and I'm proud of it",05Jul2020,1
73,"I wanted to post about what I’ve learned about myself in the past few months through therapy and hard introspection. I wanted to share what I learned, in hopes maybe if someone else feels the same way (and I hope no one ever feels the same way I do), it might help them learn, and get professional help if needed. I have Avoidant Personality Disorder, and Social Anxiety.
 

My mental health issues make it almost impossible for me to interact socially like I think a “normal person” should. I constantly feel like people are going to reject me out of hand, have already judged me a loser, I’m not good enough, that I just don’t know what to say or do to just feel normal, like I have friends. Imagine if you’re on a stage, in front of an audience of thousands, with a giant glaring hot spotlight on you, and you know you have to say something, do something, ANYTHING RIGHT NOW!!! but you don’t know what, and you can’t think straight. You can feel people in the audience getting annoyed with you, silently growing to hate you because you are boring and not good enough. Now imagine if you felt like that all the time: Walking into a store, talking to friends, going on a date, texting someone. This post is doing it to me right now. The constant never-ending fear of complete rejection, of not being good enough, of the pain of always being on the outside of the circle, never being invited to do anything…and it is painful. It’s the small silent pain that just never goes away, like a rock in your shoe that is there in every step. It hurts, and at times I just don’t know how to express how lonely I am, how I miss people. Yes, taking medication helps, but it only fills the pain, not makes it go away. 
 

But it’s worse than that: My mental illnesses leads me to be dishonest. To lie and cheat and wound the very people I hold so dear. I’m not blaming my mental illness or using it as an excuse, my actions are my own, and I feel horrible at times for some of the things I’ve done, how I have hurt people, and it is my fault. But I understand why it happens better. I’ll be in a normal conversation, and I’ll lie, I’ll say something that’s entirely untrue, because in my haywire brain, I’m worried that telling the truth will make me not good enough, and this person will just hate me. So I’ll lie…but then I’ll get stuck in that lie, because I’ll now think if I admit I lied, the person won’t like me anymore, so I’ll have to keep lying and lying, digging deeper and deeper, lying worse and worse, getting more anxious about being caught, worrying that no one will ever forgive me…until that person either breaks off contact with me before my lie is exposed, or my lying comes down around me. I know I’m lying, I know it’s stupid, I know it’s destructive, and yet…I keep doing it…because I think I’m not good enough, and I can’t break this no matter how hard I’ve tried in the past. I keep finding myself thinking me, the real me, just isn’t good enough, and everyone will reject me. It’s a vicious circle, one I’m trying to break, but it’s not easy, or simple. Especially when your brain keeps telling you about how you suck, and people reject you, even when you do tell the truth. Again and again.


It manifests itself in different ways as well. If you are my friend, I’ll attach to you incredibly quickly. I’ll do anything for you, ANYTHING, even things I know aren’t okay, because I’m worried if I say no, you’ll reject me, and rejection hurts. I’m not just the friend that’ll help you hide the body, I’m the friend that’ll shoot the guy for you. I’ll lavish you with gifts and presents and attention, because I think that’s the best way to show you I care. I’ll quickly fall in love with you, and promise you the moon and the stars, even if I can’t make it happen. It’s not because I’m a liar, or I’m trying to take advantage of you, it’s because I don’t know how to express myself otherwise. I’ll do dumb things because I think that’s what you want, even if I’m horribly misreading the situation.


One of the few outlets I had was TTRPG, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Shadowrun, board games. I felt safer sitting around the table with friends, with a set of rules, and roles to follow. I felt connected to people playing, I could express myself through a character in ways I could never away from a table, I could put on a mask of sorts and be different, more confident…but I haven’t had a chance to play in forever. Most of my friends have moved on, or moved away, or just don’t want to meet anymore. I tried to find a new group, but my mental illness rises up, and I feel so uncomfortable it’s impossible. I once went to an open table night at a local game store, and couldn’t even get out of the car. I tried to play over the internet, but then I see my face staring back at me, and I get panicked and I hate it. I tried to be a different person in real life as well, make up a different persona, be different, more interesting, but I found when I put up the mask, I can’t take it off, and when I get close to someone I want to, so badly just say this is me, but instead I have to hold up this mask until it breaks, and people hate me for lying. I don’t know if they would have hated me regardless, but they do now.


My mental illness makes it hard to say goodbye, or to let friends go, even if it’s clear the friendship is over. I feel loneness and rejection so hard, so deeply, that it’s hard for me to accept things are just over, or that people move on. I mourn friendships that have been gone for decades, people who out and out say they hate me, hope I die alone, people that I just can’t connect with anymore, people I know want nothing to do with me, because the rejection just hurts and aches so badly inside, it feels like I was shot in the stomach. But I’m trying, I know in my head it’s not okay to hold on, but at times I just miss my former friends, because for a moment I thought we had a connection…and I don’t know what to do. I want to do the right thing, I want to do right by them, but it’s hard. It’s like I know I’ll never find a people like them again, I could never replace them, I know, but it’s like there’s a permanent hole in my heart where these people once were. Sometimes I feel like there’s so much compassion in the world, except for me. 


My wife loves me, and something I think I’m the worst husband in the world to her. Sometimes I make incredibly stupid decisions, I get stupid defensive and touchy over trivial things, I become very introverted to her, because it’s hard to admit how I really feel out of fear of rejection. I’m trying to be better, to be acutely aware of it, but it’s not easy. I know I’ve hurt her, I know I’ve lied to her, deceived her, cheated on her even, and I’m trying to be better for her. I’m trying to be better for me.
 

Again, my mental illness isn’t an excuse. It’s not a “forgive me” or a “not my fault” card. It’s not okay the way I’ve treated people, hurt people. But I understand a bit more why it happened. I understand why it gets so out of control so easily, how it just spins out into worst and worst until I feel like everyone hates me. I am trying to be a better people, but it’s not easy, and I hurt badly because of the pain I’ve caused others, and the loneliness and rejection I feel. Please, if you feel this way, get help.",05Jul2020,1
74,"But the people on the internet are real shits towards anything kid related. It’s like they completely forgot they were a kid once or are trying to get revenge on the world by being as shit to kids as the world was to them as a kid. I mean, I get it. I was treated as shit as a kid. But it doesn’t mean you shit on kids.

I tried to share some pictures my daughter made because that’s what she puts out into the world as a way to connect with it and connect with people. But because Covid has us all in the house she can’t share these things with her friends or at the art studio. Plus club penguin is G.O.N.E, there aren’t any other safe places for kids under 16 to socialize on the internet, and we don’t have any family. So I figured I’d share my means of socializing and provide a little surprise positivity for my daughter by sharing some of her better art. 

People were so freaking horrible towards her on the post I had to take it down. I am so utterly disappointed because I had wanted to give her a little pick me up because she has been sad lately and distant from the world more than usual. 

And yet everyone is always so surprised that teens and preteens are committing suicide. Like, this is why. My kids have positivity from me at the very least, but then there are all these other kids stuck in shit situations trying to find some positive feed back only to get this shit thrown at them.

76,"My (48F) boyfriend (42M) of two years broke up with me a week and half ago and I cannot for the life of me get over it.  I have been in so many crappy relationships.  One was an abusive relationship that I let go on for 6 years.  The next was a guy that started grooming two of my four daughters so he had to go.  Then I met Mike.  He was so good to me. He is so honest.  He never yelled.  He constantly validated me. Encouraged me to do my best and to do the right thing. When we first started dating, I thought that he was too good for me. It was definitely something that I struggled with.  We did so much fun stuff together and he showed me so much.  He told me that he loved how much I loved to go on adventures with him.  He was always there, no matter what.  When we first met, he lived in the same state about 15 minutes away.  About 5 months into our relationship he got a new job in another state about 2.5 hours away.  We would see each other on the weekends mostly and do a lot of fun stuff and we liked to party.  Sometimes we would meet halfway and get a hotel room.  Mike makes about 4 times as much as me, so he paid for a lot of the activities and I would pitch in as much as I could.  I am a single mother of 4 daughters, ages 12-20 so finances for me are tight. He always told me that he did not mind paying for things and he just loves making me happy.  We talked about moving in together once my youngest got a little older and in the meantime we would continue the LDR.  

During quarantine he stayed with me and my girls from March to May.  Mike does not have any children of his own and is a very neat and orderly kind of guy.  Living with us for 2 months made him realize that there is no way he would be able to live with my girls.  I have really good kids, but they're kids and they constantly need reminders to clean up after themselves.  It is something that bothers me as well, but, you know, I've been doing this for 20 years.  Sometimes when I would get home and the house was a disaster I will just cry.  I want my house to be nice. I want to make breakfast without having to clean the kitchen for 15 minutes.  Since I rent and I don't make a lot of money, it was difficult for me to make the house nice, like painting, decorating, and getting some new furniture pieces.  Mike decided last month that we needed to do something about that.  We spent 3 weekends painting and installing shelving and buying pieces for my home.  He paid for a large portion of it and we worked tirelessly and I am eternally grateful of how it turned out. 

Then, we took a long weekend to do some camping and we had the best time. I even cried at one point because I was so happy.  He said he was glad and gave me a hug.  All weekend we swam and explored and he professed his love for me several times.  I thought about how lucky I was to have such an amazing person in my life that actually loves me.   

When we got back to his place he was anxious.  He told me it was about work and that he was overwhelmed with the amount of work he had to do in order to catch up and he didn't know where to start.  I had some work to do as well and went upstairs to give him some privacy.  A short time later he came up and broke up with me. He said the distance was tiring and that I did nothing wrong, but he was missing something from our relationship and was not sure what it was. He tells me that I'm a great girlfriend and apologetically said that ""it's me, not you"".  Since he's never had kids, he doesn't know he can handle that. He pointed out some things that irritate him about me (I'm a little bit nervous sometimes and pick my cuticles, and shake my leg).  He told me that I have been a great girlfriend.  

So of course, now my thoughts are that I am not good enough, because I'm older, I've gained 15 pounds during quarantine, I don't have enough money, he wants someone younger and that makes more money and has less kids.  All I know, is that I cannot stop crying and praying for him to come back to me.  This whole COVID thing has got me fucked up.  Normally, I would go and do stuff to distract myself but I'm a big believer in masks and social distancing.  I wanted to hike this weekend but I knew that it would be too crowded.  So I have just been cleaning and organizing my home.  My girls constantly check on me and I'm so glad they're here with me.  I started therapy last week, so hopefully that will help. I quit drinking, since when I'm really sad I tend to drink too much and make poor decisions. I also have been waking up early to exercise and I have been trying to eat healthier.  I'm 48 and never have been so heartbroken in my life.  I just have this idea, and I don't know if it's valid or not, but if someone as great as him doesn't want me, what am I stuck with? 

I'm sorry.  I'm just so sad.  And the handling of the pandemic has got me feeling even worse. I can't see my family or friends in person. 

 I don't know why I decided write this here.  I guess I was hoping it would make me feel better. Anyway, if you've gotten this far, Thank you.",05Jul2020,8
77,"I'm 30 years old. When I was done with university is when I first got serious about dating. That was 9 years ago. After a few failed dates I took some time to self reflect and came to the conclusion that I wouldn't want to date myself. I didn't have many hobbies, friends, the ability to hold a conversation and wasn't even happy with the person who I was at the time. I put off dating entirely and focused on becoming someone I was proud of. I picked up a couple hobbies which lead to developing an amazing circle of friends.


My most passionate hobby (rock climbing) lead to travel, adventure opportunities, meeting more people and before I knew it every opportunity to get away from work I was hanging out with people, going to parties, planning trips and being social in general. I am now able to strike up a conversation with anyone. All I need to do is find common ground and connect about one topic (food, athletics, movies or art). I  didn't even notice when it happened but I was happy and proud of the person I had become. After probably 3-4 years of not putting any attention towards dating I started thinking about what my future would look like, and wanted someone special in it.


I started spending time with a girl in my social circle (in 2016). After probably 2-3 months of constant messaging and hanging out 1 on 1 she asked me how I saw our relationship. I let her know I liked her and wanted to date her exclusively. She didn't feel the same. She said she enjoyed spending time with me but didn't want to date. That was fine with me. I figured I have this awesome person in my life that I get to spend time with and I shouldn't be hurt that she doesn't want to date. Our friendship somehow strengthened after that; we had deeper conversations, were seeing each other more and after another 2 months we started having sex. I made a stupid mistake at this point and assumed we had started dating at some point in our relationship. After about a year (now 2017) I tried to break up with her and she was surprised as she never saw us as a couple. This should have been clear to me as she explicitly told me she didn't want to date. I had assumed we were an item because I saw the things we were doing as things a couple would do. We stopped seeing each other; while we were on good terms we almost entirely cut off contact at my request.


I kept putting myself out there and kept finding myself in similar situations, where I would start developing feelings for a girl, who I thought felt the same way about me. After ~2-3 months I'd ask them if they were interested in going on a date and they would say no. I'd remain friends with them for a bit to see where things would go and I always got the impression that we were going on dates. For example we would go out to dinner, I would pay, we'd go for a walk though a park, share a kiss. The thing that hurts me is that all but one of these girls let me know they don't want to date but were still interested in doing these ""couply"" dates, sometimes for a number of months before I'd remove myself from the situation.


Out of the last 6 women I've developed feelings for since 2016 (and I thought had feelings for me too), 5 of them did not want to date when I asked them. The other one did result in a short but great relationship. We are still great friends to this day. I have tried online dating in this mix of romantic interest but can't say any positive things about it, so I have given up on that. I'm at the point where I feel like I am doing something wrong but can't put my finger on what it is. I don't think there is a point to continuing going through the same steps I'f I keep making the same mistake. I'm starting to feel like women don't want a relationship with me and I won't find someone to share my life with. I'm feeling like there is something wrong with me. I feel pathetic that despite thinking women are interested in me they wouldn't go on a date with me. I don't see a point in continuing to put myself out there.

82,"Last night was the 10th time my date ghosted me from tinder. It was going so well, we had a chemistry where she actually initiates the conversations and we were chatting non stop for a month. Then one day we were supposed to meet up for our first date. But then, when she saw my face, gave a disgusted look and turned around and left.

Ill admit this, im an ugly person physically, based from experience from women that i met or heard from. So i followed others advice to "" improve myself"" and i did after my 2nd ghosting.

Baby is fed and animals are fed so I try to settle everyone so I can eat....... nope.  One cat finds some plastic and proceeds to choke on it so now I’m saving it’s life just for the other cat to immediately choke on the same plastic I just pulled out of her brother all while I’m pumping milk from myself. I wish I could say it ended here.

Go to change babies diaper and give her a bath and she goes to the bathroom in my hand. Fun right. I give her a bath and get her changed which is another struggle because she don’t lie still unless I’m singing and dancing.

Ok, everyone is settled it’s my turn to eat. I just heat up some leftover with some salsa my dad made for me. And a cat runs across my plate splattering chicken and salsa everywhere. My food sits there while I clean the mess and baby cries and screams when I don’t let her eat the floor chicken. Alright clean. I sit and then notice the litter in the center of my plate.... can’t eat that anymore.

You tried so desperately to help and fix others** **when your own heart was broken, you were screaming out for help but I didn’t let you. You are such a strong person, always overcoming obstacles in life, but these wounds were too deep.

I let you get to a point, a breaking point, that you couldn’t handle your anxiety, your pain, your depression. Im sorry I didn’t give you enough time to heal. Im sorry you gave all your time and effort to people that didn’t give the same amount back. I love you more than ever today, and we won’t go down that long road of destruction ever again.

I guess because of quarantine I have been able to heal myself from a lot of traumatic experiences. I had a habit of going after unavailable men. I realized this was due to the relationship with my father. He was the type of dad that would shut off emotionally and i would try to overcompensate and “give” my dad whatever to make him talk to me, however nothing would ever work. My mother on the other hand is a perfectionist, and she would expect perfection from me and I could never deliver. I’m also an only child) Fast forwarding to dating, I never got the proper lesson of how to have men treat you bc I didn’t think my parents would want to know...I didn’t think I had the relationship with them to talk about it boys/sex/dating etc. This took me down a long dark past of having men degrade me, r*** me, and emotionally abu*e me. I just got out of one of my most toxic “situationships” of two years and was absolutely rough. (I got in fights over this guy, I depleted my savings just to buy him expensive things, wanted him to want me SO bad I engaged in sexual relations that I did not even want too) now that I see my friends getting into relationships, and for the first time in my life I am so deathly afraid of dating again. I am afraid of going back to that period in my life where men treated me like I was nothing. I am afraid of getting hurt and loving someone who does not have the capacity to love. I am afraid of letting people in. I’ve worked so damn hard to GET my peace and I will never allow someone to mess it up again. I just needed to get that out. Please feel free to comment advice as I want to find love one day, but right now I’m very cynical which is unlikely for a hopeless romantic.",05Jul2020,4

I've always been scolded by my step mom when I was little cause my step brother chose to run home crying every time we were out playing. (Me and my brother was forced playing with our step brothers). That happened about 6 years in a row. Little introverted me held all my problems to myself and haven't told anything. (Later I did say it to my siblings though.)

We're at a summer camp at the moment.
Today my step mom called me provocative for taking the canoo on the camp when my step brother asked my step mom if he could use it behind my back. That is so stupid and childish of her. I got stumbled and had an anxiety attack where I got dissy and my heart began pumping faster. My hands started to shake and I felt like fainting.

103,"My GF (34F) and I (32M) are running into a situation where we don’t do anything when we are together. She is a pediatric surgeon and is on call 18-25 days per month because her department is short staffed. In addition to this, she also runs a normal clinic so she’ll be at work from 7:30am to 7-8pm, and sometimes when on call well past 11pm.

Before COVID, I would go into my lab and work for nearly the same hours. Since, I’ve been doing a lot of work from home, so I don’t nearly get out. Instead, I’ve been working on writing the textbook chapter that I’ve been asked to do. And, when my work is over for the day, I’ll play video games, or work on opening and emptying boxes from when I first moved out here (8 years ago).

Normally, we try to travel somewhere do go diving, but that has been postponed for the foreseeable future. And, we really don’t have that many friends in total, as we don’t have kids so neither of us can relate to friends who do have kids. I end up calling my mother, who is a narcissist, which doesn’t help my mental health since I already am diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety and OCD.

It’s just getting really lonely during the day and at night, and when she comes back home, she will want to eat and go to bed, which is completely understandable. But, even today, when she is off work, we largely just vent to each other about the current situation (people not wearing masks, etc...). We both understand that we are just releasing our pent up frustration, but this is probably not ideal.

Does anyone have suggestions as to how to otherwise handle the stress, or just anything in general to help?",05Jul2020,1
105,"As a child, both of my parents were on govt assistance programs the entire time I was alive. They both were severely disabled and honestly, probably should not have had me because their disabilities made them worse parents, but they were still ok considering the circumstances. Since I was raised on govt assistance, I've never been middle-class or anything like that and never had much responsibility instilled into me; it was passively expected of me because I had to take care of my mom (my dad died when I was very young), but that's it.

Despite my circumstances, things worked out where I was able to graduate from a top-50 university this year. I start my first professional job tomorrow and it puts me solidly in the middle class (I'm a software developer so I'll make decent money). That also means I won't be on any assistance anymore, which is a good thing - but it's also a bit scary. I'll be a full-fledged ""adult,"" but I still feel the same as a 16-year-old. 

To be completely honest I don't think there will be much of a difference. I already run my household and have worked full time before, so the difference will really just be more money and less time at home (when I was in college I had a lot of time at home, but did more work because I was studying all the time). But people always say things like ""the real world is going to destroy you, just you wait, you'll be miserable before you know it"" or ""your life has been easy up until this point"" but... I'm not really seeing it. Either way, in some aspects I wish I could remain in my childhood for a bit longer but I really want to enter the middle class now, so I'm going to do it.",05Jul2020,2

I obviously read the little card sticking out and it was for someone’s Grandmother’s birthday. So I pull up to this small little house and see this sweet old lady sitting in her front room. Her and her five little dogs all see me at the same time and she got up to come greet me. As she opened the door I say, “I hear someone has a birthday today!”. The amount of excitement she showed melted my heart. She was profusely thanking me even though I told her someone else had sent them. Then this sweet woman asks if I have time for her to go get her camera for a picture. I assured her I had nowhere better to be. She finally came back and asked if I could get a picture of her and her flowers for facebook and I did gladly.

I no longer enjoy the things I used to. There’s a show I’m watching right now that I love and can’t wait to finish, but I don’t have the energy to pick up my phone to watch it so that I can get a good laugh in for the day. I want to learn how to draw or refresh my language skills, but I can’t bring myself to do any of it.

113,"**For the TL;DR check the highlighted section at the bottom of the post.**

I have been slowly building my way out of a long period of physical and mental adverse state and among the areas of my life that I feel the need to address and improve is my sex life. It is non-existent now just as it was non-existent before and my goal is for this to not continue being the case for very much longer. Or to the very least to try and figure out what I want out of this aspect of life.

Without going into much detail about my past, what I think is the most relevant here is the fact that I have spent all of my teenagehood and early adulthood (25 currently) in a state of moderate to severe depression and moderately severe physical health issues coupled with various inadequacies and insecurities. These contributed to me living in an uncommonly reclusive fashion for someone my age. With the above in mind, I hope you will have a larger context for understanding and easier time relating to what will follow.

Trying to grow more socially aware and see how people spend their time and interact with each other and find out about their life experiences in general, I started browsing a much larger array of subreddits including the sex and relationship related ones and I underestimated how much some of the stories detailing sexual encounters and random acts of sex with strangers or relative strangers would impact me.

Some of them felt like a true punch to the gut, they evoked strong feelings of envy, resentment, and regret in me. If felt controllable (to some degree) how much I permitted these feelings to last and grow in intensity but I think that suppressing them (as I have been doing the whole past decade) will keep me frozen in the same state boredom and low-level depression that I have been living under all this time and as far as that goes I am glad I can still have the ability to experience these strong feelings even though they are of the painful sort.

**Now, I am 25 and I feel that I have truly missed out (a phrase that always sounded cringe to me and never imagined saying it myself) and that I am past the point of trying to fulfill certain sexual experiences that might not be thought of as particularly inappropriate for teenagers and college-aged people but which would be seen as impermissible for 25+ year-olds which are generally expected to act in more mature and considerate ways. What am I supposed to do? To re-enroll at some university (which I was considering to because I would like trying going into a more ambitious professional direction than my current occupation) and try to live that university experience in a manner in which I did not when I was 19,20? Does not the fact that I am even thinking this make me a creep or imply that I am disturbed in some fashion? Imagine going to parties, clubs and similar settings, which I have zero experience of, alongside people with an average age maybe even 6 to 7 years younger than myself and trying to hook up, I think I would feel like a loser creep and that what I am being transparent to everyone. And would not that actually be an accurate view?**

**Most people of my generation I know personally are either entering long term relationships or have been in one for some time, they had their fun in their teenage and young adult years. On the other side, I feel like I missed that train and that most people I know would want me to forget it and try to get into a serious committed relationship and this feels like the least exciting and infuriating decisions that I could take at the moment. Concluding this, I let you know that I do not know how to sort all of this out.**

114,"So about three months ago, my (17 F) friend (16 M) came back from some kind of exploring event in a national park. He was with 4 of his friends. He returned quite a while later and was found unconscious. Seems reasonable yeah, but here's where things just get...really strange?

When he woke up in hospital, he was apparently ''hysterical'' and he immediately told the authorities what had happened. He then gave an extremely detailed story about how a ''fifteen foot'' tall dragon appeared out of fog, which then proceeded to chase and eat his friends, one by one, but he got away, leaving him the sole survivor. His description had no room for misidentification because of how stereotypically dragon the entire thing was described, down to the mane at the back of the head, and he also drew a sketch of what he says he saw, and it looked exactly like typical fantasy artwork of a dragon.

He gave some oddly detailed imagery in his story, such as the exact color of its skin (''brownish green'') and the shape of its pupils, as well as the length of its teeth.

A search was underway pretty much immediately. Only one body of one of his friends was found, but the cause of death was drowning (they were near a lake) and there were no teeth or bite marks etc on the body. The body belonged to a 14 year old. According to his dragon story, this boy was eaten/killed by the dragon, as he says he remembers hearing one of his friends scream that the dragon got him in its mouth, followed shortly by a ''blood curdling scream'' that lasted ''around half a minute'' before going silent.

When he was interviewed by the local newspaper, he said he was told that they ''wouldn't allow for a monster story and the monster part is best left unmentioned'' and in the newspaper he gives a very different story - he says his friends fell into a lake and got swept under by strong currents. No mention of a dragon or anything else. But later on after this he starts sending letters to dragon researchers and other people, and using the dragon story everywhere else.

He keeps writing to all these paranormal researchers and dragon researchers and I believe he's developed an unhealthy obsession with this dragon thing and he says his life was changed by encountering a dragon. Would I come across as an asshole for telling him dragons aren't real and his obsession is unhealthy and he should seek mental help about this? He told the parents of the 4 other boys that a dragon ate them, and one of the parents actually believed it (that a dragon ate them) with a straight face.

He quit school, he basically lives as a recluse now and refuses to talk to people in person most of the time.

Lately he has been spamming online forums about how dragons are real and people who don't believe in them or are skeptical are ''idiots''. It's getting out of hand.

130,"I  have always been a romantic. With that comes longing and passion and yearning… I found while looking through my old journal entries that sometimes I get caught up in toxic things because they are high risk and high reward. I thought of Shakesphere when he said “these violent delights have violent ends” because truly the things that brought me happiness in the past few years were the same things that brought me the most pain and trauma. 

My therapist had encouraged me to try to figure out who I really was and what I wanted. He wanted me to tap back into the things that really brought me joy in life in an attempt to get my  self esteem back. This was when I learned the concept of slow living-- the idea that perhaps it is the little things that give your life purpose. 

In the last year or so, I have gotten back in touch with my creative side. My art was no longer about perfection or attempting to paint the next Mona Lisa, but I enjoyed every evening when I sat down with my watercolor. I found joy in listening to my art playlist while painting and the process of finding inspiration, sketching, mixing the colors, failing and learning, and finally holding the finished piece. 

My favorite part of the day became when I would sit down with my knitting and let my cat curl up in my lap while we watched trash reality television and I knitted love into every stitch. I fell in love with the process of photographing my work, and I met a lot of cool people once I started uploading to Instagram! 

I planted herb seeds and grew them in my windowsill, and every afternoon after my virtual internship, I’d water and prune them, and today I’ll be enjoying my first cup of sage tea from my sage plant! 

Happiness wasn’t in the places where I was looking for it. It was with me all along: with my cat, when I wore my favorite dress, when I was with my friends, and actually inside my heart.
