8,"I'm getting tired of journalists deciding whenever something is good or bad. At times they do their job proper, check something least 5 minutes and give us a nonbiased report on a book, movie or in this case a game.

But then there's thr Cyberpunk reviews. Overhyped, twitch is filled with channels streaming the game but I don't see many getting past the 30 minute mark due bugs, crashes or simply losing interest. (76 anyone? Played it until level 300 and lost interest, ditched it when Bethesda decided to delete 500 fluxes on a rollback) I have the copy of Cyberpunk, but I won't play it until a few months in.

Which brings me to The last of us 2. A game with a enjoyable story filled with emotional scenes, a reflection of the same world looked through different eyes, and how it tells us that every action has a consequence. Other parts were ok but it wasn't the fucking second coming of Christ like the judges think it is.

Was it the counterbombing by journalists made against the haters bombing metacritic? Are awards decided on things that go beyond their category, influenced by politics, corporations or an aggressive country that takes control of the previous by threatening to shut down their market if they overstep their boundaries by things that would be considered as bigotry in the western world? Oh but the irony that CDPR are the baddies now.

So many good games deserved a win, with No Man's Sky taking one might be a wake up call for the industry that your product is your child, Sean could've run away with all that sweet money like many did before him but here we are, the lies he said back then are mostly features that are now on game.

11,"I really don't know where to ask. I'm not a strong believer of supernatural forces but I don't disbelieve it. 

A couple months ago I had a dream, not necessarily nightmares but not pleasant at all either. I commonly had ""labyrinth"" dreams, or what I'd call them, where I'd be inside of a dream, waking up into another dream, and then another dream, and so on. But that one dream felt extremely long. 

When I had escaped the labyrinth of dreams, I had this overwhelming sensation of something inside of me, gathering together and leaving my body upwards as I was laying in the darkness. I have no clue how long it was, but it felt like a split second and I felt an overwhelming, physical sensation throughout my entire body. The best way I can describe of it is a magnetic force feeling, ripping something away from me. Not physical pain, but a strong sensation. I then was drawn to the right and looked, and saw my first sleep paralysis demon. It was just a skinny, lanky black shadow with a very slight white light outlining its silhouette.

I said to myself ""It's not real, it's not real"" and closed my eyes, and after what felt like 2 seconds, I was finally back in the real world. The whole experience had shaken me up and I sat feeling like a shell of a body for the rest of the night.  

I tried to do research on this, I tried to find what it might have been. I read many different things, astral projection, or the fact that I might have actually lost something that was a part of me. I do feel a change - but I have no clue if it was ""from"" that experience. I feel as if I haven't felt genuine happiness nor sadness since then, but I used to have strong emotions. I just feel more ""numb"", it feels that I should be feeling something but I feel nothing. 

I remember that when I was younger, I would wake up in the middle of the night ""feeling"" something standing in my room but I wasn't scared, it almost felt comforting. I would just drift back to sleep, acknowledging this unknown presence standing beside me.

I (16M) got my license about a week ago, and have been very excited about it. Today I drove for the first time somewhere by myself. I drove about 25 minutes to a friend's house, then we drove 15 more minutes to get food and sit outside with another friend (socially distanced). After that I drove my friend home, which was another 10 minutes, then drove back home 25-30 more minutes. That's the most driving I have ever done in a day I think.

The craziest part to me is that I successfully did it. At first when I was going there I was so nervous to the point where the only thing keeping me from freaking out was singing out loud to music while driving. After I made it to my friends house and I was driving with him, I felt a lot less nervous. Then when I was driving home I was in sort of rush hour traffic on the highway but I still did it. I sang out loud a little bit on the way back but I was generally more at ease than going there.

I'll be honest in saying I have had suicidal thoughts like no other recently, I don't feel comfortable sharing with my friends and I have started to cry myself to sleep.

During the middle of the semester I had around a 3.3 (I am a sophomore and was a 3.7 student before this) , and then my hunt for an internship happened. Coming from a state school it was borderline impossible to find something  (with COVID), so I had to go in like no other. I completely ignored school for a solid 5 weeks in the hunt to get an offer, I eventually received a software development internship at a F100 company and I'm looking forward to working with them. I am so immensely terrified that my company will ask for a transcript and then take my offer back, this thought causes my to weep when I go to sleep to the point where I get migraines. 

I completely ignored school for the 5 weeks, I am talking tests / assignments / everything (yes lectures)... after landing my offer I came back and attempted to redo late work but in most of my classes it wasn't enough. I had the opportunity to pass my CS class but I didn't do any of the late work.

I feel like I am addicted to video games and pornography, I used to be super disciplined and during my freshman summer I even started my own website that had decent success (20k upvotes on a reddit post helped it). My life consists of playing League of Legends, thinking about schoolwork, crying, and then jerking off. It is seriously a sad existence. I don't have anyone else in my life that I could tell this about and I feel more depressed than I ever have.

My goal is to get a job at a top technology company, but I feel like this semester really fucked my chances... not even just my GPA but instead the fact that if I want to graduate on time (4 years) I am going to have to do a next level grind. I feel like I am at a crossroads of becoming an absolute beast or being a desolate piece of shit for the rest of my life. I've had serious thoughts about distancing myself from everyone I know for months and to just focus on myself, I don't know if this is healthy or not.

I'm struggling with sth for a couple of months.
The thing is I'm 25, live in one of middle east countries and have a bachelors degree at mechanichal engineering
I have some plans to study in Canada and immigrate to there after a while so that i become a Canadian (I have enough good reasons to immigrate from my country).
The problem is i really don't enjoy mechanical engineering
I remember when i visited some factories and manufactories that makes me ask myself am i going to endure these places for the rest of my life? 
I mean i don't even remember a single complex mechanichal equation right now after two years.
Although i like industrial design and things that only related with creating things with 
computer.(not analys parts or working with a lot of guys to create a submarin or car parts)
.
In the other hand I've been working with Photoshop for a long time and I love to learn drawing my own sketches instead of only editing others
. 
And  I've been reading some philosophy theories these last years that really absorb me about big philosophers (from plato to Nietzsche and other big ones)
.
I don't know which way should i choose
It seems like governments accept engineers better than a graphic designer or a philosopher
And I've got more chance to become a Citizen

**Why some of us fall victim to constant mistreatment from others and how to address it by changing our own behaviours.**

Strong title, right? Well, guess what? It's actually an Oprah Winfrey quote.

Ok, I lie. Oprah's quote was a lot more eloquent: ""you teach people how to treat you"".

However you say it, the sentiment is applicable to almost¬†every single relationship you have with others.

*When I say almost every relationship, I mean - some people will continue to mistreat you, regardless of what you do to put an end to it, but I'll cover this later.*

**So what does it mean?**

In essence, it means: the way people treat you is based on how you subconsciously teach them to treat you. People mistreat you because you have permitted them to.

Now, 'mistreatment' is a broad term. In its most obvious form, it's when somebody constantly, deliberately picks on you and manipulates you. It can also come in the form of a partner who throws a tantrum every time they don't get their way.

Another less obvious form of mistreatment is people who do it subtly.

An example of this is the annoying colleague at work who always tasks you with their annoying IT needs: 'hey, give me a hand reformatting this word document to PDF' or 'hey, my computer's telling me I need to update my password, can you sort it out?' You know, the type of stuff they could sooner Google, but hey, they know you'll always help them, so they come to you instead.

Why does it keep happening?

The reason people are continuously mistreated is that they habitually react in one of the following, ineffective ways:

**They do nothing**

This is the most common reason why mistreatment continues to happen. Some people do nothing about it when they feel they are being mistreated.

They believe that if they satisfy the needs of the person mistreating them, then the mistreatment will eventually end.

You see this in relationships where a man physically abuses his partner. As time goes on, the abuse gets worse, but all the while she believes 'I know he's been bad, but I know he'll get better'. Spoiler alert: He won't. He's a piece of shit.

A popular saying that comes to mind here is 'if you give someone an inch, they'll take a mile.' Accepting and justifying mistreatment from others only ensures the mistreatment will continue. Or worse, get worse.

**They become passive-aggressive**

Reacting in a passive-aggressive way can involve:

* Acting visibly annoyed when you're being mistreated
* Giving somebody the silent treatment after you feel you've been mistreated
* Getting frustrated and making a small fuss when someone mistreats you, but eventually accepting it and never actually calling it out.

The problem with passive-aggressive reactions to mistreatment is that it never truly addresses the issue. It also rarely puts an end to it.

It may seem effective to be passive-aggressive when you're being mistreated - 'surely once they notice I don't like it, they'll get the message and stop doing it'.

Wrong.

Let's look at it from the abuser's angle. They mistreat you, you put up a small fuss, but you eventually relent and accept the mistreatment.

All this has taught them is that 'if I'm willing to put up with a short period of unpleasantness from them, I can continue to mistreat this person.' After all, brief periods of passive-aggression are a small price to pay, for them to get what they want.

**They pay it forward**

This is the most cowardly of reactions to mistreatment.

Similar to bullying, it involves accepting mistreatment from one person, and projecting it onto somebody else - normally someone they see as weaker.

An obvious example of this is a man who gets treated like shit by his boss at work, does nothing to stop it, then hits his wife when he comes home at night.

This is clearly among the most horrible examples of how mistreatment can be paid forward.

A lesser example is when you get mistreated by someone, do nothing¬†about it at the time, then spend 45 minutes whining about it later on to your partner or a friend.

They cop the abuse, then they pay it forward in the form of three-quarters of an hour of moodiness and complaining. This may seem fairly innocent, but it's still essentially taking mistreatment from one person and dumping it on another.

**They seek revenge**

This seems a suitable solution, but there will be no conclusion.

Seeking revenge for mistreatment will only result in revenge of¬†the revenge. If you're not prepared to engage in a game of one-upmanship until one of you give up or die, then seeking revenge is not the answer.

**So how should you deal with it?**

We've put together 10 techniques to end the mistreatment you face from others:

**1. Change the way you treat yourself**

The adage 'Nobody will love you until you love yourself' best describes this one.

If you don't show others that you respect yourself, you're not giving them much of a reason to respect you.

Now, treating yourself with respect can often be confused with being arrogant. If you fear you don't know the difference, refer to some of these attributes that command respect without exhibiting arrogance:

* Humbleness
* Quiet confidence
* Assertiveness
* Reservedness

**2. Consider how you want to be treated**

Have a good think about the way that you wish to be treated by others.

Do you want to exude authority, or do you like being the go-to person that always does things for others? Maybe it changes depending on your mood? Or maybe based on who you're dealing with?

Do you want your boss to treat you exactly the same way your partner treats you? If the answer is no, then you need to custom fit your strategy to the individual and the nature of your relationship with them.

**3. Treat others as you'd like to be treated**

It's easy to recall a bunch of times we've been mistreated, but we can often neglect to realise when we have mistreated others.

Think about the last time you got annoyed by your partner because she wasn't listening. Maybe you were trying to tell her something important that happened at work, and she was distracted on her phone. You felt you were being mistreated, right?

Well, you have every right to feel that way, provided you give her your undivided attention every time she tries to tell you about something that happens to her at work.

This is a healthy reminder to observe what hypocrites we can be when we reprimand others for the behaviour we too are guilty of.

If you want to earn respect from others, you have to lead by example.

**4. Learn to say no**

This one applies to mistreatments involving requests, like that annoying colleague who treats you like¬†his personal IT technician.

You need to learn to say no. I don't mean 'not right now' or 'sorry mate, I'm just responding to some emails, so I can't'. I mean, no.

Offering an excuse as to why often elicits a response like 'ok, when can you help me?'

When the person mistreating you inevitably questions your 'no', tell them 'I'm too busy getting on with my own stuff.' Don't be specific, it's none of their business.

At first, saying no can feel incredibly difficult. Especially when the person you're saying it to starts pouting or acting upset about it.

Be assured, the more you do it, (provided your reasons are justified) the easier it will get and the more respect you will earn from these people.

**5. Realise the difference between nice guy and push-over**

Some of you will be reading these methods and wondering if they¬†will make you seem like a selfish asshole.

It's ironic, but being disagreeable at times and standing your ground will only positively affect your overall like-ability with others.

You need to be aware of this when you fall victim to being a people pleasing push-over in search of acceptance from others.

**6. Have a conversation with those whom you feel mistreat you**

For those of you who hate confrontation, this can be the hardest one to implement.

Unfortunately, it's also often the most effective.

If you feel you are being mistreated by someone, pull them aside and have a casual conversation with them about it.

Ensure you keep a calm, rational tone, and avoid getting emotional. Simply explain your unhappiness with the way they mistreat you and ask that it stops.

Don't be surprised if the person mistreating you gets defensive or acts offended. Depending on who you're having this conversation with, phrases such as these can be effective:

'I don't mean to single you out with this, but I respect you enough not to resent this situation in silence'.

'I felt you would do the same thing in my situation, so I decided it was best to address it with you.'

*Disclaimer:¬†If the reason you are being mistreated by somebody is due to your initial mistreatment towards them, then you need to offer a give-get solution that ends mistreatment for both parties.*

*An example of this might be your girlfriend who gets really angry at you every time you go out with your friends.*

*Now, the reason she gets angry and moody is that when you do go out with your friends, you have a habit of getting wasted and coming home at 1am and snoring all night. Tell her that in exchange for being more accepting of you hanging out with your friends, you're going to drink less (or, more realistically, that you'll set up the couch, so she doesn't have to hear you snore when you come home to sleep.)*

**7. Call out future mistreatment when you see it occur**

If you've had a conversation with someone who is mistreating you and they continue to mistreat you, don't get emotional about it. This is to be expected.

Just as Rome wasn't built in a day, nor too can the foundations of your relationships with others be rebuilt in one.

When it does happen, calmly acknowledge it with the person doing it. Remind them of the way it makes you feel and ask them to be aware of their behaviour moving forward.

If it continues to happen, this person may be a lost cause.

Depending on your relationship with them, you should decide whether or not you should continue to pursue it.

**8. Give credit where credit is due**

If you have had a constructive conversation with somebody around their mistreatment of you and as a result, you begin to notice positive changes in their behaviour, let them know.

The key here is to be sincere and thoughtful when you show your appreciation.

Avoid phrases like 'thanks for being nice to me' in favour of more suitable phrases like 'I appreciate you taking our conversation seriously'.

*Disclaimer: Being too overly appreciative of their changed behaviours can be overwhelming. Keep it brief, say it confidently and deliver your appreciation sparsely.*

**9. Consider if it's worth it**

This one applies to relationships you have with people who sit on the peripheries of your life. Maybe they were an old friend from school, or perhaps a colleague from a job you worked in many years ago.

If people like this mistreat you in some way - decide if it's worth actively trying to repair your relationship, or if you should just cut them loose.

Confronting them for their bad behaviour could give them false hope that you genuinely want to continue your relationship with them. Some times it's better just to let the relationship run its course, be mature when you speak to them, but emotionally detach yourself from them.

If they don't get the message when enough time has passed, then you can air your concerns. Use that conversation as an opportunity to cut ties amicably. By this I mean, don't get emotional, don't tell them you just need some time out and don't say anything you'll regret later.

**10. Do nothing because you secretly enjoy it**

This one needn't apply to those of you who genuinely want the mistreatment from others to end, however, it is still worth being aware of.

You see, some people who regularly get mistreated enjoy playing the victim and whining about the mistreatment more than they would enjoy putting an end to it.

Consider this about some of the mistreatment you have faced. Do you secretly enjoy it?

**What will the outcome be?**

Before you go about putting an end to your mistreatment from others, you're probably wondering, what will this mean for your overall relationships with these people?

Executing these methods will garner three possible reactions:

**1. You will earn respect**

Good-natured people will almost instantly begin treating you with more respect once you've addressed the situation properly.

They may initially be a little offended or confused by your changed behaviours at first, but will ultimately respect the fact that you respect yourself.

**2. They will push boundaries at first, but eventually come around**

Some people will initially see your changed behaviour as a challenge. As such, once they identify your decision not to put up with it anymore, the abuse may get worse.

If you can confidently stick to your plan, and repeatedly prove you won't accept the mistreatment, they will eventually come around and overall your relationship with them will be stronger.

They will see you as a peer instead of a push-over.

**3. They'll ghost you**

Some people won't accept you once they know they can no longer mistreat you. Once there's been a couple of instances of your intolerance for their mistreatment, they'll toss you away.

But, come on, let's be honest, if the only thing keeping them around is their ability to mistreat you, is it actually worth keeping them around anyway?

*Disclaimer: Be wary of manipulation from the ghosts. They'll say stuff like 'you aren't being a team player', or 'you're acting like a selfish asshole' when you put an end to their mistreatment. Don't let these bastards convince you that any of it is true.*

**Final thoughts**

I wish you the best of luck in mending the relationships in which you feel you're being mistreated.

Whether it's minor mistreatment or physical abuse, if it makes you uncomfortable, it's best to put an end to it.

Just remember to be patient.

Longstanding learned behaviours can take some time to change.

Keep calm, stay confident and trust the process.

I thought I was gonna change myself after going into college but that first semester I stayed just like I was and hardly left my single dorm room. I had to come home on weekends and didn‚Äôt have my car there so I couldn‚Äôt go out to do anything during the week and couldn‚Äôt do clubs or events on weekends. Next semester the virus started and ruined everyone‚Äôs school lives, not that I had one. I‚Äôm half assing my classes now, I don‚Äôt care what my grade is as long as I pass. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm learning anything and that college is a waste of time and money for me. 

Was forced to get a job by my parents in July and have been working at that place since. When the new semester started I switched to working weekends only. It‚Äôs so boring and sometimes tiring. I never had a will to work in the first place and I‚Äôm just doing it because I don‚Äôt really have a choice, but I feel like I‚Äôve about had it. It‚Äôs not a bad work environment, I just don‚Äôt enjoy it. And I‚Äôm extremely stubborn, and don‚Äôt tend to do things I don‚Äôt at least partially enjoy.

And there‚Äôs not many things I do enjoy, and those things aren‚Äôt anything you can realistically make a living from. All I do is watch or stream stuff and play video games. At least that distracts me from my uncertain future. Being a streamer playing games is very difficult, and I don‚Äôt know why anyone would watch me anyway. I don‚Äôt even think I would.

Not to mention the fact I feel lonely too. No one would want to be in a relationship with me like this though. Again, I don‚Äôt think I would. Unless it was someone super dedicated to fixing me like a project, but I don‚Äôt think those people really exist. My friends are always busy and don‚Äôt really do much with me anymore. 

I dunno what I‚Äôm supposed to do with my life. I got nothing to go for it feels like. No real goal. If I had a relationship going maybe I‚Äôd have someone to live for. In any case it feels like I have noting to live for anyways.",12Dec2020,1

My sister was dating a guy who had the same last name guy that I matched with. Keep in mind, this was a relatively unusual name. I eventually asked my sister‚Äôs BF if he knew Jack Gaw, and he said that Jack was his brother.

I honestly wanted to tell them for April Fools, but lockdown ruined that. I also entirely forgot about it until Thanksgiving. He was invited and no one else was. I just made a passing joke that that this was a family Thanksgiving and I winked.

Everyone wanted to know what I meant, and I told them everything. My sister even began to cry.

I mean, should I have not told them? I think that they would want to know. Also, incest isn‚Äôt that bad as long as you don‚Äôt have kids, and she‚Äôs proudly child free.

I couldn't find what I really wanted to do when I was in high school. after I graduated I tried to balance stuff out but I wasn't very successful, I had the opportunity but I wanted a girlfriend and dated because I was lonely, I made the mistake of dating this girl that wasn't really that good for me. but I still state with her. I had a job and I wasn't really a goo job for me and i tried to make the best of it, i was 19 what i supposed to do?  i went to college and isarted fucking because i was more focused on her then on me and i was trying my  best to balance the 2 but it was had seeing thateverything was not int he right flow of things it cost me dearly i got my financial aid taken away and i started to make some pretty ad decisions. at 21 when i got a new job i broke up with her. and the lady who hired me just wanted to fuck me, but i was shy as hell i didnt wan that game or that type of person but only took it because it paid me more they used me and in my nativity and fear i got fired. i was left without a job and took what ever i could, and i ended up lndign a job in American airlines but I quite shortly after. it was to stressful. so i spent about a year without a job until my friend got me a job a jungle island thats when started smoking weed, because i couldn't belive my life had gotten the way it did. I couldnt go to school and and I tried to make the best of what i could by paying for it out of pocket, I still had no idea what i wanted to do i just kept taking classes and hung out with anyone that would give me attention. that messed me up even more they weren't motivated to grow. i hated the fact that i was being left behind I didnt want to be involved with people with my age because they had their own agenda and I was left out, I couldn't find my own group of RIGHT people. so I just started to stay alone. and I ended up getting a job with my grandfather as a janitor because it paid me more then the 8 dollars i was gettign paid, that's when I started drinking i ended up going back to school at 24 but the girl i got with got with me out of her own self interest she did it with the best intentions but it was nasty it a little controlling because i had OCD and my mind was not in the right place most of the time. i took phylosiben for the first time with her because i heard it could cure ocd but I what I hadn't completely registered was that this girl was a drug addict, shes been doing it since she was 15. but i had it engraved i nmy head that i had to make the relationship work no matter what. i ended it 9 months later because i realized it wasnt healthy for me. ive been single ever since, so slowly but surely I started to work my way to an associates dree towards communications, i never really spoke to any of the people i was in class with because i felt that they were try to dominate me or constantly look for some sort of validation to feel superior and i just did everything myself. i got a job at an autoparts store worked there for 2 years quite because i got at the airport again, and then got fired because i was fed up i started to work for my dad at 26 i finally got my associates at 27 and when i ended up going the university i always wanted to go because i had a misinformation and misunderstandings about what all the college thing was really all about. i ended up hating it, i felt like i was back in high school, i turned 28 the first semester and tried to take some classes but it was horrible and slow and i felt like i was just going to get older if i stayed there. i would of fallen for it if i was younger. but i was already stricened with life. so not knowing where to go or whom to talk to about my situation i just started to withdraw.  and kind of gave up a girl i knew at the gym knew something was off about me and i tried to hide that fact but i ended up look like an imbicil instead. and had the shame guilt put on me of worthlessness. what a great timing.  and the cornoa virus hit and fucked everything up.

70,"Been talking with some people that went to my high school on facebook and got reminded of an English assignment our teacher gave us.

We where giving a story about what would we do if we where in a characters shoes.

The story kinda when like this:

A 15 year old girl has a much older boyfriend who spends more time with his friends then her. She is on the bus when her BF comes one and wraps his arm around her and had on her thigh as she wears a short skirt... he just reaches into her purse and gets money out to go buy him a donut and then just leaves her crying for some reason(I forgot) the bf only got a donut for himself and she is crying and using her mini skirt for some reason? To dry her tears and not ruin her makeup? She knows he‚Äôs not good for her but stays with him because her mom tells her that she will never win any beauty pageants.

Well the teacher had a student look over some papers and he corrected/graded the papers for her. (He is a teach now too.)

At the time she told me the guy seemed scared to mark my paper because of what I wrote.

It was something like:

Oh hell no! This BF, would be tossed off the bus for touching me let alone taking money out of my purse/wallet. Never mind just getting himself a donut, more like a Do NOT! I don‚Äôt know how to put on any thing but chap stick so that wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. I carry a small pack of tissues because of allergies to tree pollen. Also the mini skirt is a big NO from me. My mom telling me I would not win any beauty pageants, fine! That shit is rigged as fuck, it‚Äôs not surprising that one of the judges always seems to be a gay man, and one a woman.

That was pretty much my angst filled teenaged self being outraged by the girl being a door mat to her ‚ÄòBF‚Äô.

I found the guy last week and he uses my paper as an example of not caring what others thought of you and just be happy being your self. Then again he and many of his students thought I sounded like a B. Then he talked to me and was surprised I was so nice?

If you have concerns about receiving the vaccine, please read. 

From a physician: 

. 

The FDA is likely going to approve the Pfizer Covid vaccine when they meet on December 10th.  The Moderna vaccine will probably be approved shortly thereafter.  This is an incredible feat of modern medicine, and our best chance to hopefully get our lives back to near normal  relatively soon.  However, it is new and it was done quickly, so understandably, people may be hesitant to get it; even people who vaccinate against all other diseases.
Will I be getting the vaccine?  ABSOLUTELY.  
But, it is a new vaccine technology and done in record time, so aren't I worried about its safety?  Nope, not any more so than any other vaccine or other medical intervention.
Why?  Let's start with how this vaccine works.  This is an mRNA vaccine.  Past vaccines typically use a live but weakened ""attenuated"" virus, or dead viral material ""inactivated"" virus, or a piece of the virus's protein or even a toxin produced by the virus.  The Covid vaccine is very different.  It contains mRNA (messenger genetic material) that encodes for the Covid spike protein.  This causes your cells to then produce the Covid spike protein.  In contrast, when you are sick with Covid, the virus hijacks your cell to produce many copies of the entire virus.  Then it destroys the cell, busting it open to release its newly formed viral particles. When your cells release just the spike protein, it will stimulate your immune system to form antibodies to the Covid spike protein without you getting sick.  There is no possibility of getting Covid from the vaccine.  When your body is subsequently exposed to Covid, it will quickly recognize the spike protein and destroy it before it can make you sick. This was 95% effective in preventing Covid, which is an even better percentage than most other vaccines.  However, you must take both doses (about 3-4 weeks apart).  
Am I concerned about it being new?  And previously untested?  No, I'm not.  This type of technology is not entirely new.  It has been studied and used in cancer research.  They have been making mRNA vaccines and studying them to specifically target proteins on tumor cells and train your immune system to then destroy the tumor.  In this case, it is not a vaccine in the preventive sense, as it is targeted to a tumor that you already have.  It is not currently widespread because it has to be custom made for each tumor.  But, it has been ""around the block"" for a while now.  The technology was also being studied for other Coronaviruses.  It never came to fruition, because the diseases never reached pandemic proportions, and then the funding dried up. The mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell, and it does not affect your DNA, and therefore has no lasting impact on your cell.
Am I concerned about the speed with which it was developed?  Weren't significant corners cut in order to get this out so quickly?  No and no.  What was cut out of the equation was mostly red tape, and what was added was technology and funding.  We were given the genetic code by scientists in China to start vaccine production in January; before Covid was even documented to have reached our shores.  From there, the vaccine was developed from the technology we had from the prior Coronavirus and cancer research, and was completed in March.  Normally, there would be months of waiting for the FDA to even look at the work done prior to approving Phase 1 trials.  Because of the urgent nature of this, it was essentially put on the top of the wait pile, which cut out months of waiting, but did not cut any corners.  Between the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines (both mRNA, with a slightly different delivery system), they were tested in 37,000 people in Phase 3 (and an additional 37,000 received a placebo).  That is on par with, if not better than the vaccines currently available.
Aren't I concerned that the FDA is about to approve it, and there may be side effects that haven't been seen yet?  Nope on this one too.  We know from decades of vaccine research, since you typically just get 1, 2 or 3 doses and then you are done with it, that nearly all side effects from vaccines occur in the first 6 weeks.  Like other vaccines, minor side effects may occur(soreness at injection site, muscle aches, fever).  Severe adverse reactions are extremely rare, and again, occur quickly if they are going to occur at all.  As a healthy 50-something year old woman, my risk of dying from Covid is about 1 in 250 to 1 in a 1,000.  That is not a rare event!  And even if I don't die from it, I could have long term lung damage and other issues that affect my quality of life.  Because vaccines are given to healthy people (unlike medications for treating a disease that is already present) they are held to a much higher standard for approval.  My risk of having a significant adverse reaction from the Covid vaccine is minuscule in comparison to my risk with Covid.  In fact, there have been no severe reactions to the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine to date.
For the rest of the population (outside of healthcare workers or those in nursing homes), who will likely be able to get the vaccine in February or March, there will be even more time passed and more people who have received the vaccine to be the ""guinea pigs"" here.  
Anyone who is pregnant - it has not yet been tested in your group (although I do know that many pregnant front line health care workers are planning to take it).  For those under 18 years old - it is also not yet tested.  Moderna will be starting a trial shortly.  Hopefully it will be approved by summer.  But for everyone else, I highly recommend getting it as soon as you can; for you, for your loved ones, for those who cannot (perhaps because they are immunocompromised), for the many businesses that are on the verge of permanent shut down, and for kids to safely return to schools.  I will be rolling up my sleeve for it as soon as it is offered.
If you'd like, please do feel free to cut and paste on your own social media sites.  Sharing of information is so important to combating this pandemic.  We have now surpassed 15 million documented Covid cases in our country (5 million of which were in the last 30 days) and over 2,000 people are dying per day.",12Dec2020,1
