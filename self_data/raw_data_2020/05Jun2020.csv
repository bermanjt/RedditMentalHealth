- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 
- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 
- [ ] 
- [ ] I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.
- [ ] 
- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bite to me about how much she smells.

Edit: she’s Normally really  nice to me in a friendly way and she seems pleasant etc with me never had a problem with her before",05Jun2020,1

3,"I’m a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’ 

Edit- the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again",05Jun2020,1
5,"She has super crazy mood swings so whenever she talks to me, she acts like shes entitled to whatever she wants, and thinks she runs shit.(which she doesn't because I'm the only one who's been paying rent. So its technically my apt.) She threatened to kick my cat when he was 9 weeks old because he was in the living room (which had zero furniture so why the fuck did it matter?) She has banged on my door so hard that I thought she break it more than once) i actually bought a new doorknob and changed my bedroom doorknob out so that it was a key lock. But shes made me so paranoid to the point that I get up multiple times a day to make sure its locked.

 Which it always is, because she cant lock it and most the time she just leaves it wide open. she'll take my wet clothes out of the washer and throw them on the floor so she can do her own laundry. She starts verbal fights then tries to call the cops who dont even do anything. She talks shit to people about me in front of me and my friends. Too which I had to leave the room so I didnt snap. But my friend and my bf called her out on her shit and made her cry. (Friend is 6'0 mixed and is scary when hes mad.) 

And yesterday I got a plastic 3-drawer organizer to keep snacks in in the pantry so I'd have more room. (I cant even use the kitchen either, I have a toaster oven in my room just so I can cook in there.) But because it was like 1cm to long, the sliding door (metal folding one) couldn't completely close, she broke the anchor part and now the door is folded in the middle of the track. I had to take a picture to send the office an email. Still waiting on response.  


TL:DR
Roommate is crazy, I check multiple times a day to see if my door is locked. I never even leave my room. She threatened to kick my cat. Broke pantry door because the shelf was on the track. Constantly starts fights for no reason. Talks shit about me in front of me. My friends snapped at her and almost made her cry.",05Jun2020,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

15,"Hi, so I've been staying with my boyfriend since last week and I flew up by plane to see him. He lives with two others, and there's no pets. I think from Tuesday or Wednesday onwards I noticed I was getting a lot of itchy bites, there's really just one spot that's significantly noticeable and they're all clustered. One of the days there was some small spots of blood? Quite dark too on the sheets. I'm unsure if it's flea bites or bed bugs. I'm pretty sure it's one of the two otherwise I'm unsure what it could be. We went to a cat cafe on the Sunday, by the way.

Yesterday we washed all the linen in extremely hot water, we steamed the mattress, thoroughly vacuumed and set off a flea bomb. I'm pretty sure I didn't get bitten at all last night but I'm still extremely nervous.

The pharmacist who I asked antihistamine cream from said they looked like flea bites but I'm still freaking out that they might be bed bugs. And I feel like it's my fault because I travelled here and I bought my suitcase and I heard they travel? I've never dealt with them before either.

I'm constantly paranoid and upset, and I feel so guilty about it. I've looked everywhere in corners and in the bed frame and I haven't spotted anything so far. My partner also hasn't been bitten at all. I'm just overthinking EVERYTHING at this stage when I'm not even sure if it could be bed bugs or not.

What can I do here, do I continue checking for anything? Do I need to hot wash all my clothes or chuck my suitcase? I'm going back home in a week, and would really like this to be over. I'm just so upset and guilty, it's so horrible.",05Jun2020,1
16,"Worst part about it is I feel blindsided. I'm 27 years old and I met this amazing girl in college. We got along so well and perfect and this year felt amazing. Everything bad started to happen in the world but we stood strong until the ending of last week. Last week I open more to her and we had a great week. This week she completely changed. She wasn't acting like her normal self, she said I was acting weird randomly, and she said she feels lost. 

Here I am trying to make shit better and even ask around for ideas due to corona and lockdown situations for nothing. She called me up today and broke up with me while she was crying. She said she didn't want to hurt me and has been crying the last few days.... WELL I'm hurt. Here I am trying to do everything I can to keep her happy and she said I'm amazing and shes has been always happy...... So what gives?

I never felt this hurt in my life. We was suppose to be a team, move into an apartment this year, maybe have a baby in the next couple of years, everything felt so secure and great. To take all that away from me with a simple phone call has my heart in my stomach and I feel sick as shit. 27 years old and 8 years wasted it feels like. I feel like I been lied to my whole adulthood with a girl who i thought was perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow I'm going to talk to her in person one last time and I'm walking away from her for good. I'm not interested in being friends. I know it's going to hurt her and I do care for her but after this bomb dropped I feel like I don't care for her no more. I just want to know when it went wrong and for what, she mentally fucked me up.",05Jun2020,1

20,I'm so done with giving space and time to people who aren't openly denouncing this. Done with the people in my life who are privileged and white and choose to stay quiet and not speak up about the insane racism/discrimination that has existed not just in the US but all around the world for so many years. I'm a WOC and while not black my ancestors were enslaved by white colonizers till well into the 90s. There's no humanity left and it's so depressing.,05Jun2020,1
21,"Sort of a vague journal entry of my thoughts, coming from an admittedly privileged place. If that understandably doesn't appeal to you just ignore this.

I just landed my first ""real"" job. I dropped out of college which I hated and managed to get a job in my field of IT, which I went to high school for.

Everyone is thrilled for me: my family, my friends, my girlfriend. Even I can't find anything to complain for about it. It's in my field at decent start pay and everyone there is really nice.

(Insert dramatic turning point) for some reason I can't escape the feeling that I've killed some part of myself. I've always done everything to please my family and my girlfriend who can never have enough control. I live and bleed for them and do whatever is asked of me and they see it and take more control.

And it's not even their fault, I know it's my fault for having no self esteem but living EVERY moment of my life according to other people's desires for so long I dont even feel like I know what I want anymore. I'm so out of touch that I cant even see my own thoughts or dreams or what i need to feel content. I feel like a zombie.

Maybe this is just the latest manifestation of my depression which has kept me down my entire life and it just goes to show that no matter how good i have it I'll never be happy and I'll always hate myself.

And people are dying and being beaten in the streets fighting for their rights right now and i know they say playing the suffering Olympics doesnt do anybody any good but I cant help but laugh at how self absorbed and petty I am.

22,"I (19F) just want to preface this by saying that in real life I do not feel attracted to children. 

But recently (and I feel disgusted with myself saying this) I found this anime character that I really connected with and found myself attracted to. So much so I masturbated to him. But he is 12. 

Oh god just writing that out is gross.

He doesn't look like he's gone through puberty so there is no excuse. I'm still attracted to him.

He's the cool type of character and he gets so much character development throughout the show, I wondered if maybe I'm just attracted to his personality. But I know its definitely his aesthetic too. He’s so cute, but can be so hot sometimes but *gag* he’s a fucking kid, but it doesn’t matter to me in the moment like wtf. 

Worse is that I especially like the parts when he's crying, like when he's going through a breakdown. I am sickened by myself. I am getting turned on watching a 12 year old anime boy crying for his friend, like what the fuck is wrong with me? 

I have not been attracted to a character this young before ever. And l've never been attracted to kids in real life either. It’s just this one fucking character.

I am still attracted to people my own age and older and I would never ever touch a kid in real life. But I googled it and you don’t need to to still be considered a pedophile.

27,"Here is a story about my past relationship and why it nearly put me over the edge.

For context, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aijgvb/i_26m_took_a_look_through_my_girlfriends_24f/) is a link to a post I made last year asking for advice on the situation I was currently in with my now ex-girlfriend. For some of this story to make sense it would help to read that first.

Every single person that commented on that post told me to leave and some (quite rightly) said that I should grow a spine, stop letting her treat me like a doormat and get the hell out of there.

Well, of course because I was spineless and still in love. I stayed, and guess what? It only got worse.

I am going to share with you what happened to me in the hope that if you read all of this and see anything AND I MEAN ANYTHING at all which sounds similar to your current relationship? Get the fuck out.

**Love makes you blind and it is not until after a relationship is over that you are able to see the reality of the situation you were in.**

Anyway, so carrying on from my previous post that I linked earlier. I decided that I was going to stay and work through the problems. But right from the get go there was huge issues. She was raising hell that she couldn’t trust me anymore as I had looked through her phone and seen all the messages.

“You knew how much I hated people going through my phone and yet you did it anyway”. 

We argued and argued. I wouldn’t consistently say that I was sorry for breaking her trust and looking through her phone but I also believed that the terrible things she said about me were heart breaking to read and wanted her to understand that. Eventually after weeks and weeks or arguing it started to settle down, but occasionally the whole ‘me looking through her phone’ would pop up again as a defence towards something else.

Valentines Day 2019, we are in a taxi on the way to a very nice restaurant, I hadn’t told her where we going as I wanted to surprise her. But in the taxi she starts discussing us, and mentions that I am trying to avoid issues in a façade that everything is ok. I told her (and then had to reiterate about 3 times, which often happened during our relationship) that I wasn’t trying to avoid issues and that I felt fine with our relationship. I did say though that I would like this evening to be a positive one and discuss these things later. She huffed, got grumpy, and then the rest of the evening was spent with me getting the cold shoulder.

As the months drew on I was started to go crazy. I struggle to remember everything but we argued fairly often, once every 2 weeks and in each of these arguments I would tell my side, apologise for upsetting her and clarify that it had never been my intentions and then I would listen to her side.

Now once this was done I would suggest that we try to resolve these feelings we are having. But it was never enough. She would not stop putting her feeling across until I completely withdrew anything that I could say and took full responsibility for the current issues in our relationship.

I started believing (and she was convincing me) that I had a huge issues with confrontation, that I would always avoid any issues and just smile through a situation. At first I didn’t believe it was true but eventually I accepted it.

I started to believe that I wasn’t being attentive enough to her, that I wasn’t dedicated enough to her, that I was being rude in conversation and not listening to her enough. I started to completely doubt everything about myself. It got to the point in which I didn’t think that I deserved her.

This all lead eventually to me looking for therapy. I was starting to feel extremely low and my self esteem was at almost zero.

When it came to Summer she had applied for a university in UK. It required her to have an interview and then if she was successful, a 3 day workshop 1 ½ months later. She decided that as we lived across the world and the flights would be expensive that she would live in UK from the beginning of July (around her interview time) and then return home at the end of August (just after her workshop).

I had some contacts that she could stay with in the UK but she didn’t want to burden me or people that I knew. I offered to give her some money to help her out while she was there, but again she was persistent that she would be ok. In the end she only let me give her a small amount which she could use as an emergency fund. 

Her plan while she was there was to use couch surfing for the whole time to have accommodation. I was worried for her safety but in the end just asked her to contact me for ANYTHING.

After her first 2 weeks there we had been texting with occasional call until one day she texts me that she has something to tell me that might upset me.

She told me that during her move from one accommodation to another she had been struggling with her bags in a train station and a ‘handsome’ man had helped her with her bags and then went on his way. Well, a few days later the same thing happened again with a different man but this time this guy offered to walk her to wherever it was that she had to go. She accepted and they walked to her accommodation. Once they arrived, he said that he wanted to hang out again and asked for her number, she agreed and then gave him her number.

They decided that they would go for a coffee somewhere nearby the next day. 

The next day arrives but apparently all the shops in the area were closed (Sunday and everything closes very early in UK) so they decide to go to the guy’s apartment. 

She tells me that they had just been chilling in his place when they ended up ‘wrestling’ into a position which involved her laying on him with her head resting on his chest. They stayed like this for a few more minutes continuing to talk until FINALLY she decided to tell him that she had a boyfriend.

The guy’s response went something along the lines of “Well, I don’t want to you do anything that you are not comfortable with so we can stay friends”.

For reference everything that has been said so far is what my ex-girlfriend had told me over the phone. She told me all of this and my first question was “why did you not tell this guy earlier that you had a boyfriend? He was clearly interested in you.”

“I didn’t think it was necessary, why would I tell him something like that?”

I was understandably upset and asked her not to see this guy again.

Carrying on, a few days later they meet up again. She told me that they went for walks around the area, in the park etc and then decided to go back to this guy’s place again. Apparently it ended up with him claiming that he couldn’t just be friends and that he wanted something more. He said that her boyfriend (me) didn’t need to know about it. Apparently she told him that she didn’t want to cheat on me and that they couldn’t be more than friends.

Again, a little while later she told me about this second meeting and I was very upset. But this is when she began turning everything towards me.   
 “I am hurt that you are upset with me. I have told you all of this in confidence and I had no idea on his true intentions but you decide to still get angry with me? How dare you.”

Sound manipulative? Trust me, it gets worse.

A few weeks later she starts telling me about something else that had happened. 

She had decided to join a sugar daddy website and try and find some sugar daddies to date. Her reasoning behind this? Apparently I was always super tight with money and was never offering to help her, this was supposedly her way of getting some money to help her get by while she way there, although she assured me that she would never of had sex with anyone. 

When she told me about her first date I was obviously extremely pissed off and hurt. But once again she turned it against me claiming that I wasn’t helping her with money etc etc. How else she supposed to survive blah blah.

Remember, I had absolutely zero self esteem at this point, I thought that this girl was unbelievably beautiful and that I didn’t deserve her. So did I end things there? Of course I didn’t.

More weeks go by and it’s getting towards the end of her time there. She had been staying with a guy called Gary, they had been out to many places together and I had suspected he also had developed feeling for her. She insisted that he hadn’t and that they were just friends.

Well on the morning before she is due to leave the UK and fly home, she texts me very upset.

She had stayed with Gary that night before and slept in his bed… WITH HIM… Apparently they woke up in the morning and he had run his hand down her back and squeezed her butt which upset her a lot. She couldn’t understand how her friend could do that.

How did I react? “Did you tell him you had a boyfriend?”

“Eventually yes”

“Why the hell were you sleeping in his bed?”

“Oh my god, I knew you would get angry. This man touched me and all you can do is get angry and blame me? You are the one person I thought I could tell about this, how dare you.”

Still following all these insane stories? Good, there is one more which put the nail in the coffin.

She comes back home, but I was late to the airport by about 10 minutes to pick her up. She gives me the silent treatment, barely saying a word.

Obviously it ended up with us arguing and her just repeating what she had already said in previous texts.

Now, at this point I had finally had enough with the way I was being treated. Hooray! A spine was growing! I had stopped trusting her and I wanted to see what was going on so I knowingly looked at her texts on her phone.

If you read my last post that I linked at the beginning. Remember Matt? That dude that she had a previously relationship with who she talked shit about me to?

Well here is an example of some of the texts that she had sent to him about me during her time in the UK.

“I’m miserable with my boyfriend who isn’t smart enough”

“Dude, I wish my boyfriend was as smart as you. This is horrible”

“Dude. I’ve been grumpy all week. My boyfriend is dumb. He thinks friendzone is a legitimate term, men are such trash”

“I totally got scammed into this”

“I would rather date (Sugar daddy). Emotional capacity or not, at least he’ll spend money on me and woo me with his charm and humour”

“I feel good when I talk to you. I feel good when I talk to (Sugar Daddy). Anyone but (me). I’ll go home and try again for a few more weeks. If it doesn’t work I’ll have to call things off with (me).”

“I examined it today, I’m with (me) because I find very handsome sometimes – yes, only sometimes.”

And the final thing? I read that the sugar daddy had invited her on an all-expenses paid trip to Korea with him, she said yes but then hadn’t told me anything.

I imagine you are reading this thinking that this is ridiculous and frankly it is just sad. Well yes, you are right. But this whole time was filled with huge ups of her adoring me and telling me how much she loved me etc.

These small ups were enough to convince me that it would be worth it. Despite the lows and the way I would constantly accept faults for our relationship driving me close to the point of insanity.

During one session with my therapist, she realised what the cause of all my trauma was. It was my girlfriend. After telling my therapist everything that I just mentioned, she guided me (without telling me what to do) in a way that made me realise enough was enough and it had to be ended.

So I did. I ended the relationship.

My ex was distraught, started talking shit to me for hours on how much she has put up with while packing her things away. Until she went to say goodbye to the cat and then just broke down. She had a complete breakdown. She was gagging like she was trying to be sick but nothing was coming up. 

I was beginning to panic. I didn’t know what to do as this kept going periodically for an hour, she was struggling to breathe at times. I called her best friend, explained the situation and told her to come take her.

When her friend finally arrived my ex was completely delirious and barely making sense but when I mentioned the idea of a hospital she became terrified. So she stayed the night at mine with her friend. The next morning she was still not great but insisted that she was fine to go to work.

I had a long talk with her friend that morning which made me realise that I was not the horrible person that I had convinced myself that I was. It was a breath of fresh air.

There is honestly more. Eventually we got back together but it involved me being a doormat some more until FINNALY we both mutually agreed to end the relationship. That was at the beginning of this year.

I thank you for reading this whole post. I know it was long.

Since being out of the relationship, I feel amazing. I had planned a lot this year and although COVID has stopped a lot of those plans I still feel great.

Like I said right at the beginning of this post. **LOVE MAKES YOU (ME) BLIND**. I let everything that was hurting me go by because I loved this girl but inside it was tearing me apart and driving me crazy. Removing this horrible, manipulative woman from my life was the best thing I ever did.

Does it still affect me? Slightly yes. I am worried to get into another relationship and find out that I might become as naïve and spineless as I was. I hope that I carry enough lessons learnt from my past relationship.

**TLDR: Didn’t break up with ex girlfriend even though I should have**

**Ex started to manipulate and gas light me**

**Ex went to the UK. Saw a guy, a sugar daddy, and slept in the same bed as another dude without telling them she had a boyfriend**

**Ex manipulated me more**

**Ex had a breakdown after saying goodbye to our cat**",05Jun2020,1

31,"As the title states, I live in a small racist southern town. We moved here five years ago due to my dad’s job from Houston, Texas and I have never seen so much racism, homophobia, and sexism. I remember one of my first days in public school here I said I wanted to be president one day. The teacher told me that a woman should never be president. I remember being absolutely shocked that a WOMAN teacher would ever say something like this, to a FEMALE student. For years, I’ve seen white “holier than thou” people say they’re not racist, but proceed to call blacks racial slurs (some of which I never heard till moving here). They claim that they’re well-rounded, diverse people, but yet they believe a woman’s true purpose is to have kids, shut up, and go to church. My high school was 88% white. Only .01% hispanic and like 10% black. As a hispanic girl myself, i’ve had people tell me that “I need to stay out of the tanning bed” (i’m super white looking with a slight tan). I remember people would tell me the only reason why I have such a high grade in spanish is because I’m hispanic, and it’s just in my blood to speak spanish. I don’t speak spanish at all. 

And you would think that with all the protesting going on, these people would be more self aware of their own racism and their own privilege. But that is not the case. Just today I witnessed some fat drunk trashy white woman call the cops on a couple of black high school athletes for playing football at the pool with her WHITE nephew. I wasn’t completely aware of what’s going on, since I was working out at the gym with headphones in and just saw what was happening through the window. But my apartment ended up kicking out the black kids, and let the white people stay at the pool. She proceeded to call the cops. What a disgrace. Funnily enough, the cop ended up being black himself, which ended with the women calling the cops AGAIN. 

Basically i’m so sick of living here with a bunch of stupid racists who don’t listen when you call them out on their own racism.",05Jun2020,1

It's a necessity of human evolution to adapt to our own technology and transcend instincts like tribalism that no longer serve a purpose.

Ok so it’s been a while and everyone’s forgotten about it. Currently in Hawaii where the state has practically opened up again. People are flocking to the beaches, stores are open, restaurants etc. 

Since like Tuesday? But especially last night and this morning I was feeling really really hot. I thought the temperature at work was just going up, it has been getting hotter in Hawaii so I thought that’s what was up. Around 2pm one of the guys I work with “unofficially “ lives with his brother in law (also in the military) to not be in the barracks. Well brother in law has confirmed to have corona. 

Now, said guy I work with lives with the guy and in the office we have maybe 10 people working with many many more coming in and out. The office was designed for max like 5-6 people.

41,"I hope this is a good place to ask this. I’ve never heard of this sub until now.

I’m 21 years old and entering my 4th (and hopefully final) year of university. I go to school about an hour and a half away from home, but I don’t really go home often since I work in my college town and honestly enjoy my life there more than I do coming home since I have all my friends there and can do whatever I want. When I do come home, it’s usually less than 2 days, unless it’s the holidays. Normal college experience, so to say. 

However this weekend I decided to come home since I had a free weekend and haven’t been home since Mother’s Day and felt like seeing my family during the crazy times we’re all living in. I don’t hate coming home, I’m just old enough to not want to return every weekend or month since I have my own life at school - something my parents understand and respect since they went through this with my older siblings.

Early last year my grandma passed away and my mom began cleaning out my grandparents house. A lot of the furniture that was in my grandma’s guest bedroom started going into mine and it was something I was okay with since I took my bed with me to my first rental and coming home made it feel like a part of my grandma was with me since we were super close.

However things began feeling different every time I returned and I never really thought about it until just a bit ago. My mom and I were in my room chatting and she mentioned the lamp on the bedside table (that came from my grandma’s guest room) and it kinda made me realize what was happening. Then she mentioned that I should take some more of my things back to school and then said she put some new towels in my bathroom for guests, which really struck a chord with me. I basically realized that this was no longer my bedroom and that I’m just a guest in my own mom’s house, and realized the main reason I stopped coming home often was because it didn’t really feel like my bedroom anymore. I knew my childhood town wasn’t really home anymore but for some reason the changing bedroom hit me like a train. The only thing that’s stayed constant in this room is my desk which has remained in the same spot and looked the same for nearly 4 years. All of my material things, like books, old toys in my closet, trophies, etc, are all still here but everything else is unrecognizable.

I know this is common for most young adults. I always realized and accepted I was growing up - it’s natural and everybody does it, but for some reason tonight was different and more emotional for me and I know nothing will ever be the same for me when I go home to visit.

Technically we were just hanging out we friends (and my best friend was with us since my parents don’t want me hanging out with a guy by myself although I’m 18). We went to eat sushi, he paid for mine and half of my friends, drove 30 minutes away to get a slushee from a place i wanted to try (paid for mine, my bff’s, and he didn’t get anything??), then we went bowling but we tricked him and my friend and i paid for it. We went to target and were silly just going around. I bought a game named “phase 10” and he came to my house and stayed until like 12 while we played and my other friend came over.

47,"I (30F, Korean America in Illinois) was told by someone who is a white veteran with a half black teenage daughter that I was being too obsessive about the turmoil in our country and over reacting. I was trying to discuss with her what happened in Lafayette Park in Washington DC because I’m really worried and scared about what’s going on. Every day I watch live streams and news for hours (mostly focusing on what’s going on in Chicago Los Angeles, Brooklyn, Washington DC and Minneapolis) and it seems like every single day I see some instance of police brutality or new videos of someone being horribly beat or harmed while protesting.

I fear that things will continue to escalate and more people will die. I’m worried about protestors because they are not equipped to deal with abusive heavily armed police and military personnel. I’m also worried that after all this destruction...nothing will have changed.

I also fear of the affects of Covid during these protests. The police tactics using tear gas are causing people to crowd together and start coughing without masks because they’re trying to breathe. 

Am I truly over reacting? Am I wrong to be this concerned and scared about the future? Should I back off the live streams I’ve been following because it’s causing me to be more concerned than I out to be?

I've already had him fuck my lungs once and I'm hoping the articles about insufficient antibody counts to prevent re infection are true so he can visit me again and tickle / have sex with my lungs again.

He has redeeming qualities, such as he sedates his victims while he suffocates them, so if he does kill you it's calm and peaceful - https://www.physoc.org/blog/hypoxic-happiness-covid19/

I’m self destructive because I’m trying to make something bad enough I can complain about or talk to someone, ANYONE about.  But even when I make one of those things my brain tells me to shut up. That I’m annoying, that no one cares, that it’s not that big of a deal. It hurts to move it hurts to think, I’m so tired.

64,"I asked for advice a lot and tried to follow it. I did the things I love most and tried to be happy by myself. But that only works if you can enter a relationship and feel companionship from time to time, if you can't do that, then it will come back every time until what you love isn't enough.

I'm 33 now. I get to  see people grow as persons and partners, and while I like the positivity around virgins and people that have never been in a relationship, I'ml still someone that hasn't learned a single thing about it and lags more than a decade behind on the matter. People grow,  learn, get to know what they can give and want, I know none of it, I'm basically a cowardly teenager. Every person I asked out turned me down, I don't blame them, I am not interesting.

I learned things in my free time, I can cook, build a library at home, read a lot, but it means nothing if you're dull. And being always alone makes hobbies feel empty. I'm not traveling anymore, I have nobody to share souvenirs with, I come home to the only room I like with books around me in the hopes I can forget my own worthless existence.

I look back fondly upon the books I've read, and that's it. I have good  memories from fantasy, none from my actual life. I can build connections to fictional characters, none to humans.

I dropped the clubs I was going to, seeing people just reminds me I don't  have what it takes to be worthy of friendship or companionship. If I can't have the basic part of the human existence that is companionship, then I'm fine with stopping it altogether.

74,"Note: for the sake of this story I would rather not say his name.

I already messaged him so many times about my feelings about it, I don't want to annoy him messaging him 24/7 because I'm just crying with Joy.

It all started in Sept 2018, (I was 15 and he was 16) at this time and I went to his house and his parents told me that he can't play for now and didn't tell me the exact reason why and just told me ""He doesn't want to play right now"" I thought he was mad at me because we fought about who has hotter boobs between Daisy and Peach the other day. (I chose Daisy because I'm into redhead girls, then he disagreed and told me that Peach has hotter boobs) -okay going off-topic.

I went home without playing with him, Then I started to call his phone but he's not picking up (I thought he was grounded) so I called their phone number he didn't pick up so I just left him a voicemail telling him that Peach has better boobs than Daisy (because I'm not gonna lose my Best Friend over some dumb shit over boobs) and I said sorry.

I didn't play with him for a week and starting to get worried and I miss him so much (I miss punching his cheeks and tickling him until he cries) then I asked my Mom about it. ""Mom, do you know what happened with [my friend's, name]?"" My Mom told me that he has Leukemia.

My initial reaction,

""Huh?"" My dumbass brain didn't know what that is, I barely paid attention in my Science Classes. Then Mom told me it's Cancer in the Blood.

I know Cancer is a serious matter because my Grandma died from it, then my dumbass face starts to turn into my ugly crying face. I cried and sobbed so hard, Once I learned about it. I immediately rushed through the phone and called him and left him countless voicemails telling him that I'm not gay but I love him wholeheartedly and I can't imagine life without him.

I went to his house the other day, and it seems like his parents listened to my voicemails. And he was actually in the Hospital at this point. (I felt embarrassed because I talked about Boobs in one of the voicemails)

I convinced my Mom to visit him, My Mom immediately agreed and went to visit him with his parents. (My Mom rarely allows me to go somewhere but seeing how my Mom reacted to this just shows he is not just a friend but a Family)

Then I finally saw him and Awake, I rushed crying and started holding his hand and started saying things like ""I've missed you! Don't leave me"" My Mom watching is also crying but she was laughing by how I'm reacting.

He was really happy to see me then started teasing me gay but he told me that he's gonna be fine. And turns out he was already suffering from early symptoms of Leukemia and it was just starting to get worse at this point.

Of course, I visit him and bring my toys, then I'm starting to get scared because he's skin rash is worsening every visit, he looks different, and everything.

He opened up that he is being insecure by the way he looks, and I just cursed at him and told him ""That's bullshit! Who cares about your Skin? You're here and that's what matters. And you will be fine!"" 

I meant every word, but not sure if he was gonna be fine because it's starting to get worse. But I stayed optimistic.

Fast forward, Of course, I have other stuff to do but I would always put the plan on visiting him in my planner very often.

I can't keep up with the medical progression of his Leukemia at this point, but I just remembered talking to him and tell him that you're gonna be here alive and healthy, I'll curse at God every night and tell him to F*** off... You're too young and you can't die as a Virgin because you're not Mary. Then we laughed.

Of course, I'm just kidding but behind that, I just want to say that he doesn't need to worry and he will be healthy.

After a long fight in Leukemia, he was starting to give up and he was starting to feel hopeless and I immediately called him a Dumbass and told him to just keep on fighting because I know he will live and I love him. After countless lab tests, procedures, fighting, praying, or whatever.

Fast Forward, May 28, in the midst of the pandemic, When I first find out he is now going Home and now HEALTHY... It was like my heart is now formed again. 

I can't visit him for months now because of the pandemic and due to circumstances of the COVID-19, but I CAN'T SEE HIM PERSONALLY.

Then just yesterday, my friend is now CANCER FREE and HOME. I sent him countless messages of how much I missed him and how much I want to play with him again.love you dude. (No Homo) can't wait for this quarantine to be over.",05Jun2020,1

My dad’s mother just passed and I drove 5 hours to get here for the viewing to honor her and be with my family. Immediately when I get to the house my dad wants to start talking politics and race. I told him point blank, I’m not doing this and he continued to grill me over and over about why I didn’t want to talk about it.

76,"I must say, this whole thing that's going on in America has been fascinating in that it's got people talking about seemingly unrelated things and true to form, it's got me thinking about my own character. 

It's made me look at all the things that are going on and I've genuinely learnt a lot, even acknowledged that I may be wrong or misinformed on certain things. And the thing is? I refuse to change or acknowledge it publically! Like at all. Not just about this issue but even in my personal life when I have argued with my partner or parents for example. 

For me, to acknowledge to anyone ""yeah I may have been wrong about that"" or ""I'm sorry, I didn't consider that"" makes me think in my own head that it would make me appear inferior or that people would laugh and say ""AHH see, we were right anyway"". Or that it would mean someone was better than me for being correct when I wasn't and I had to take a back seat to someone. I'd rather dig my heels in, defend my wrong position and even make myself look worse rather than concede defeat. I've done this so much that I think I've lost a lot of friends and acquaintances over it. So I even cut people out of my life first before they do so I can appear that I look that firm in my resolution. 

Definitely it stems from when I was younger, being bullied and then one of the ""fat kids"" at school not having a voice and essentially treated as a freak.

I’ve finally wrote this all down, not in the hopes of channeling what I feel so I’ll feel good, but instead as a plea. I feel like I want some sort of help, from an elder sibling, or a parent. I can’t say all these things to them because that would tarnish their expectations from me. That’s what I’ve always been to them, I hate that they think I’m good at studies and how they think I’ll figure everything out, I’ve tried to talk to my parents once, a while ago, and during the conversations they say something like, I’m a bright guy I shouldn’t be so tensed about these things. But I am tensed, and I don’t know how to proceed from this. I am not as good as they think; real life is much harder than university, and although it seems like commonsense now, I was stupid for not knowing it before.

&amp;#x200B;

All day, I try to learn new things, freshen up my basics, trying to sponge in everything or anything I can in the hopes that I will get better at what I’m supposed to do. And if I tell anyone about what I learn, they say, “why are you even doing this?” and my reaction is only self-doubt, “Am I supposed to be content with how less I have accomplished in my life?” I don’t want to stay in this monotonous job waiting for promotions as it sucks the life out of me in exchange for income. I just want to learn new stuff, but finance gets in the way. I don’t know what careers encourage this sporadic attitude towards learning something one-day and learning something else the other. I want to be able to use the knowledge I get, and the only way for that is to pursue for the masters and maybe, just maybe, my direction will be set, but as I’ve said before I can’t afford it. These self-doubts lead to doubts about even getting a masters, and just stay in the job I’m currently at. Maybe find some other path, maybe start a blog or a YouTube channel, or freelance, but I just don’t know sometimes. Is this even an age to be confused? I should’ve figured stuff out by now, right?

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve seen people who keep interests and jobs separate, and I don’t want that. They have their lives figured out somehow, or maybe they act like it. I feel awful each year that I haven’t done anything about it yet. I’ve asked them for advice, and one the hints I get from them is to cut down my dreams, and I don’t know what to say after that. Are they right? Is it stupid to learn new stuff; hoping that one day I will too become a researcher, and actually apply the theorems I learned it university, unlike them who brushed them aside saying that they’re useless without even realizing that the jobs they are currently in is just as useless? Their jobs pay well though, and it just makes me feel like an asshole because I don’t want to sound like I’m better than them, I never intend to, because considering their success in life, I am, in fact, a failure.",05Jun2020,1
82," Got in from my first bike ride in months earlier this morning. Was nice to snap some nice trees and inhale their life-giving farts!

Forests are more like people than I first thought. It's been so long since I've been to the local woods and so much growth has taken place in the meantime that I felt like I was discovering new areas despite having taken the usual route in. It was like the forest had grown its hair and beard out. 

I was like ""Jim? Is that you??""

Trees want the opposite to us, and that's what makes us so tightly connected and reliant upon each another. A tree prefers to be naked in the winter (each to their own)), while during that season humans prefer to be clothed. A tree clothes itself most during summer, a time when humans prefer to prance about naked. Trees need our waste gas. We need theirs. If this relationship isn't born in mind and respected by enough people each day then we die very quickly. Trees - Cherish or Perish.

But back to this bike ride I was going on about...

I must admit that I was a tad tentative going outside today. Riding around as a big black man in a village which is 99% white. I mean, nothing has actually taken place between me and the passersby along my journey, but in another sense, everything has changed.

Oh god...I can already feel a huge waffling sesh coming on....I don't want this message turning into a novella as I need to go and check on Diego and Lance, so I'll just say that by the end of my bike ride I was feel heartened, maybe even mildly elated! 

It was nice being reminded that at precisely the moment I feel my most fearful, is the time when I ought to open up completely to what's coming next. Turn of the mind chatter for a second and walk forward without thinking. 

I think because I'd been ingesting so many of the emotionally charged narratives and stories surrounding the death of George Floyd over the past week, together with the growing sense of cabin fever having spent 9 weeks indoors, the landscape that now lay outside my front door had become a product of the horrors, fears, chaos and uncertainties people all over the world are experiencing right now. It's so easy to give yourself a bloody good heart attack these days! Hahaha!!!

I left the house at 7:30am, in the rain, so as to minimise the number of dog walkers. Heavy rain is like Kryptonite to a dog walker. I reached the local country park and had the place to myself, so I got off my bike and walked along a path while taking in deep breaths, filling my lungs with lovely fresh air. I stumble upon a nice scene - a really climbable old tree next to a bench which was facing an open field which itself was being lit up by the morning sun. It had to be snapped.

As I was tinkering with the exposure settings, I sensed a dog walker entering my peripheral vision. As they continued ambling past I could see they kept on turning around to look in my direction but I was still concentrating on getting the perfect pic so I ignored them. I got the shot I wanted in the end and carried on with my walk. I could see that the dog walker up ahead was a short bald young fella who was now 30 metres yonder, but he did turn around again and gave me one of those reassuring looks. You know that look where you almost hide your lips inside your mouth, making them look as thin as possible! 😔 

We tend to use the expression at funerals and other sorrowful occasions when we want to commiserate someone or convey our respects to them. ""I understand how you must feel right now"", the look seems to say. Or, ""I feel your pain"". It's quite a powerful expression and gesture. It was nice to get one from the first dog walker of the day so I sent him one back in return.

I carried on walking in the direction of the sunlit open field and out onto it, aiming to cut right across and head towards the part of the woods where all the biggest trees live. On the other side of the open field is the entrance to them which I could see had rather a yappy looking dog standing close by to it. The dog wasn't yapping at that moment in time, but I could tell that if it did ever bark, then it would be very yappy bark.

The dog seemed to be transfixed on something coming from my direction and its owner, an old frail woman who had been forced to stop and wait until her dog's curiosity was fully satisfied, I could see had a very friendly face. By this point I'd reached where they both stood, and whilst trying to walk in a manner which signaled that I was a person who took social distancing most seriously, I glanced over to her to make eye contact and we both exchanged good mornings almost at the same time. ""This is going great!"", I thought.

I started reflecting upon how before I'd even left the house, I had been thinking about the possibility of me needing to make myself look even less intimidating than I do now to strangers I pass. 

To reassure them that I pose them no threat. I come in peace, I am not your enemy! 😊 But then I poo-pooed this idea, firstly because I already look like a large child, and so if I make my appearance seem even less threatening to people then I risk making people want to pick me up to cradle me like a baby  👼. And secondly, because it's just never a good strategy to cower in fear of your own fears. I'd only be making myself weaker and more petrified in the long run, and for no good reason either!

The rain had started piping up again and even though my coat was waterproof, I didn't bother putting the hood up. I toured around the big trees taking pictures of how hirsute with foliage they'd all become and decided to head back home, walking my bike along a path in a very quiet and intimate part of the woods which is stirring and transports me back in time as the procession of dark overhanging trees that was providing a temporary shelter and safe passage, led me safely towards home. 

At a certain point I came upon a tree scene whose composition of darkness and light really moved me, so I got the old camera phone out and snapped it like it was about to disappear any moment. In the far distance a young woman of slight build was on her phone walking towards me, and I thought to myself ""This is going to be important!"". 

Although I was walking with my bike along the path, the young woman approaching gave way to me and stood to the side in order to let me through without any impediment. It seemed a bit comical because the path was wide as shit! I mean, it was at least 6-7 metres wide. Maybe even 8! But perhaps she was feeling somewhat apprehensive, which would be understandable. 

As we neared greeting distance, I thought it might be a good idea to up the ante and return her gesture by also walking to the side myself and vacating the path for her entirely; walking both myself and bike around a large beech tree in order to out-polite her! It worked! She laughed! There's a time and place for politeness and this felt like a good one.

So after just those three interactions the world felt like a totally different place for me than the one I'd built myself up to expect just an hour earlier. It's odd how definitively our worldview can change based on so few meaningful interactions.

I rode home feeling like everyone driving on the road in their cars were people like the ones I'd been fortunate to meet this morning. And they probably are too!",05Jun2020,1

86,"I don't know what to do, this has happened before a few months ago but it feels worse now.

It starts with thinking about a recent mistake and feeling ashamed intensely, and I'll go down a shame spiral and remember every mistake I've made and who I used to be and hate it. I have changed a lot but I used to think lying was more okay and gossip behind people's back, but I don't even know who I am or what I stand for anymore.

I had a problem with drinking and getting blackout drunk and have said nasty things to people I love on a few occasions, I have apologised profusely to all of those people but now I am thinking back and wondering if I did other fucked up things while blackout drunk and I just don't remember them.

I don't know how to forgive myself and I managed to bury it for months but now all the obsessive ruminating thoughts are back, and they are my fault.

I have a really nice life and don't think I deserve it, I have tried to help people and change who I am and I am still messing up and bowing to peer pressure or avoiding confrontation at 22. I can't help but compare myself and feel I have done worse things than others even though I don't judge them as harshly.

I find it hard to take compliments because I don't think I'm lovely and don't think it's true.

I really don't want to worry my boyfriend and feel bad for making it about me when so much is going on in the world. He doesn't know that I've hardly eaten these past 5 days either, don't understand why I'm not but I just don't have the motivation to do much because there isn't much to do.

88,"I know this sounds asinine but just give me a few paragraphs to get some momentum.

You can't exist in 2020 and not intuitively just know what a meme is. Even those that exist totally cut-off from the online sphere would easily understand with a few examples. Most typically we think of image macros like [this](https://imgur.com/Sc1nBL7), or [this](https://imgur.com/yW2QUqt), but these are just a couple of modern, digital memes and don't begin to scratch the surface of just *exactly* what a *meme* is, and why the answer to that might be really fucking important.

For example, a picture doesn't need any text to be a meme - similarly, a picture can be *only* text and still be a meme. A phrase can be a meme, or even a single word. A sound. A [symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_S#/media/File:%22Cool_S%22.svg). The structure of the building you're in and the design of the device you're reading this from are memetic artifacts. Musical subgenres, fashion and style trends, social patterns and institutions including family, marriage, property, law, crime, and punishment. Even complex ideologies - religious, political, and philosophical - are essentially very nuanced and enduring memes that span hundreds and thousands of years. 

It's difficult to think of anything that is not a direct result of memetic repetition, as this is the way in which all information, beliefs, and ideas are shared and become socially entrenched - this method of transmission reveals something specific about the origins of power, authority, control, and choice, and how we relate to those concepts.

Human behaviour and response is also memetic - a product of pattern, repetition, and context rather than a series of conscious “decisions” we make at every moment - this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate, but only that we are bound to act only in accordance with our own character - we are not *something* responsible for our decisions, we *are* our decisions, and for those we bear responsibility.

Can you imagine Trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure, dimwitted evil? 

That’s his role - his constitution.

I think the belief that he, or you, or I, ""make decisions"" is backwards, partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world, and partly just our basic instinct - it's obvious that I am aware and alive and can consider many possibilities, so it only seems to follow that I may exert some influence over my choices.

To me, there is little distinction between *Me* and *My Choices* - I am those choices, not a separate entity that chooses - that stands separate, considers, and then finally pulls the equivalent lever corresponding with the **'choice' I’ve made.**

Those final three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized *happening* from my specific perspective.

Language has an implicit kind of magical quality - by that I mean much like the imagined casting of a spell, it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination (and order) can influence and compel people to act, and this *action* is the source of change. This is why great orators have always possessed great influence over the course of history - someone must be able to give power to an idea or concept that can move masses to act as a single, unified force of nature.

I don't believe human action is the true catalyst to change - I think it is human action predicated on and driven specifically by the memetic concepts we have at our disposal - most importantly, ""What is good, right, valuable, and true?"".

Language is itself inherently biased, limiting and divisive - **Black Lives Matter** means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted, and language is always loaded with the judgments of the interpreter. As much as it is the primary way we communicate, ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world. It is not a matter of merely being Peterson-ianly ""precise"" in our speech, because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible.

How many proponents of any ideology have *actually* read and engaged with its foundational and supporting texts? 

Probably very few.

How many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context - culture, family, friends, media, and memes?

Probably almost everybody.

These repetitions of pattern connect us to something far greater than any single one of us - our *collective* human ideas about value, function, and purpose, and their relation with each other - memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge, experience, and feeling. Memes are threads sewn into the fabric of our reality, connecting us to the past, present, future, each other, and something totally separate - something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of.

Memes are innately communal and creative. Memes are meant specifically to be shared, to translate a feeling or thought into a format that can be used, related to and understood. Memes are also innately creative, a quality that has a direct connection to both art and play.

Memes are artistic, and the human desire to create art is something that offers insight into our nature. Art is itself a distinct form of language that transmits ideas and feeling only through its interaction with a third party. Art is our way of speaking to one another without words - a way to convey and share something enormous and infinite contained within a finite object.

Memes and artistic expression both reflect something crucial and universal in the spark of our human spirit - both are inherently creative and communal - they represent the human need to share, something intimately linked with community and altruism. Art can of course be done selfishly, but there is no artistic expression at all without the memetic patterns that allow that expression and an audience to engage with it.

You may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary, yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now, billions of distinct and separate simultaneous happenings, disconnected and separated only by virtue of the limitations of their own collective conceptions of what us real, what is true, and what is possible.

Memes are thus quite a bit more significant than just funny and relatable pictures we share - our current shared cultural conception of them is simplistic and, as a result, limiting. If we don’t fully grasp what a meme is, we lack the capacity to both comprehend their true power, and the ability to wield that power to our own collective benefit rather than for only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this is the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the current ordering of it, as if we can trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to objectively consider how it might be meted differently.

Is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class, or to the current institutions of policing?

From where is their authority and power actually derived?

The primary source is our shared belief that these institutions are legitimate and just.

The secondary source is their ability and willingness to inflict violence on us if we do not accept the first source.

Violence is of course a very powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power - both literal violent actions and indirect violence facilitated by a system that regards the principle of one person's right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth, power, and influence as a higher and more just one than that of providing the material necessities of life for all people.

Do we really believe those with obscene means deserve it?

What about those with such means that they could lose a hundred thousand yearly salaries in a single day and not have it impact their quality of life in the slightest?

We are meant to believe this is just The Way the World Is?

I find that idea just as intolerable and narrow-minded as those that believe it.

Society bears little proof of functioning properly anywhere - properly as in for the common good of all people.

If we define ""properly"" as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else, then it is functioning tremendously properly.

Individualism is, unfortunately, too often championed by those who don't understand the distinction between it and selfishness, and this crucial error acts as the basic foundation for an entire wing of political and philosophical thought which insists might makes right, and value is directly related to money and money alone, where everything can be spoken about in terms of its value equivalent in US Dollars - a currency that can, in an instant, become practically worthless.

Now I want to make some statements that are broad and general, but ones that I think are fairly common and subconscious. These are not meant to be statements of fact, merely word and concept associations.

The relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine, which itself is like the relationship between individual and community. 

Consider this disharmony between two opposing - or complementary - principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical (and thus political) thought. Also consider opposing principles as really a **single thing**, as opposites always exist only in relation to each other.

This sounds a lot like some meaningless new-age woo, but I think many people make these associations subconsciously anyway, even though we may often be tempted to argue against them.

Just conjure up some typically conservative imagery and symbols in your head - what kind of qualities are emphasized? What is deemed valuable, good, and of worth ? What foundations precede these symbols?

The global and inescapable adoption of the Internet and the smartphone was a pivotal shift in human history, opening up capabilities that compare and perhaps far surpass those opened up by our discoveries and use of fire, agriculture, steel, or the combustion engine.

The Internet and our constantly connected culture has allowed us to, in a sense, act as a very rudimentary hivemind. Our access to, and saturation of information, media, and communication is both constant and instant - it is possible to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is - our friends and family, their friends and family, people we don't know and never will, people in another country, and people who perhaps don't even share the same primary language as us - a single sentence tweeted out can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of hours. 

You, me, and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other consciousness
there is on this planet - what could we possibly use that for? 

Memes, of course.

To tell the President of the United States he’s a fucking idiot.

To crowdsource the question of 'what is good?', because that is what lies at the centre of all action and belief. The fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and polarized politically is not to be wished away, but rather acknowledged as the only way in which an outcome - Truth - can spread, copy itself, and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly absurd.

Accepting all of this, it is possible to understand Humanity not as an abstracted collection of separate individuals, but as a single, unique happening of organism/environment that can, given certain factors, act in unison. The most important factor is, of course, each self knowing and feeling that they are a part of this greater self, which is not something that itself can be forced, but something that happens spontaneously - much like the act of creation. You can edit and correct every detail, but inspiration strikes, it is not conjured - it is never willed into being, it is being itself which then acts on our will.

Those advocating for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise, not because the facts are in disagreement (although that is true), but because what comes **before** the facts cannot be agreed on - that is, the way the world is structured and ordered, or The Way The World Is, which always itself acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse.

The idiom *'seeing is believing'* is actually totally backwards -  the truth is that **believing is seeing**.

So, if memes are the true catalyst of human action, can we then ""meme ourselves"" into a better reality? Can we, together, engineer, build, or construct a meme to
transform our shared, collective consciousness and ideas about not only what is true, *but what is possible*?

I think so, and I think a good place to start is to understand the illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth, and their direct relationship to power and authority and the distribution of these things. Money is a real thing that performs a necessary function, but our shared understanding of it has real power over it, and in this way we can collectively shape its power and influence over our lives. We can't function without money, but we absolutely can function with a novel way of distributing it so as to lessen the total amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the inability to provide materially for oneself.

Does Jeff Bezos really have billions of actual, tangible currency, or is his currency of billions really in the form of power and influence *as represented* by money?

Is the standard work week from Monday to Friday, or Monday to Thursday?
 
Is that because this is simply The Way the World Is, or is The Way the World Is directly related to our collective ideas about it?

The state-sanctioned brutalization and modern lynchings of black men at the hands of “Law Enforcement” in the U.S. is a memetic pattern - a disgusting one, but a memetic pattern regardless. “Law Enforcement” tactics are memetic, including the violent response to protest and organization. The video of George Floyd's horrific and senseless death was spread memetically, and so too were the calls for organization and protest all across not only the U.S., but the entire world.

The ""legitimized"" armed wings of the state - police and military personnel must stand with the people, not opposed to them - stand with them in demanding social equality for ALL PEOPLE and the dismantling of a system which treats people as resources, and just like its treatment of every resource, exhausts them to the point of annihilation.

**A single officer taking a principled stand, crossing the illusory barrier to protest with the people can be the crumbling brick that begins the collapse of the whole structure. All it will take is a single officer of good conscience to do something difficult, but something correct, to memetically begin a shift towards a better, more equal society.**

If you cannot bring yourself to do that, you may be an enemy of the people.

See how compelling language can be? Nested within every word is paragraphs of subtext, assumptions, and implications.

Enemies of the people are just that - enemies to a free and emancipated existence - does this imply violence? Only to preserve life.

Violence can be lessened memetically. You cannot kill a concept, and it’s just as futile to try and do the same to those who espouse, exemplify, or believe it , not to mention, a wee bit of a moral grey area to say the least - we can, however, convince those that would be used as agents of violence to stand solidarity with the people through memetic repetition. 

The global economic reaction to the Coronavirus pandemic is proof of this shared power our collective thoughts have over the world we inhabit. It has also laid bare that the distinctions and lines in the sand we use to divide and categorize are mostly illusory - the global community - the aggregate of every other community, group, and faction is where we must focus our efforts. To shift our reality in the direction we want, it will take collective effort, and the emancipation of all humanity will happen together because of the memetic nature of change and our connected world.

There is no freedom until we are all free.

Imagine what can be accomplished together by simply altering our beliefs about what is inherent and immutable, and what is merely a byproduct of antiquated memetic artifacts and methods of ordering and structuring society?

We can meme ourselves better.

Black Lives Matter
Nazi Lives do not.

Land matters.
Landlords do not.

People matter.
Profits do not.

Billions matter.
Billionaires do not.

Collective ownership over the instruments of profit, production, and class stratification is **OUR** right.

Food is a right.
Water is a right.
Shelter is a right.
Healthcare is a right.
Education is a right.

Freedom of expression is a right only so far as the expression is not a genuine threat to our collective existence.

These things are only true or false based on our collective ideas about truth and value.

Justice should not be owned by anyone, it is owed to everyone.

WAKE UP!

Humanity is an organism. a unified field of conscious relationships and patterns from micro to macro, comprised of each one of us.

KNOWING WHAT WE ARE IS THE FIRST STEP TO BECOMING WHAT WE CAN BE.

The Lie of White Privilege
I’m a 31 year old white male. I was born into homelessness, crime and poverty. I have always cringed at the mention of “white privilege” as I would look around and wonder, where was my privilege? I always thought that programs supporting women and minorities were precisely excluding people like me, and it felt like anti-white racism.
As political, economic, and technological pressures push more and more middle-class white men into deeper levels of poverty and desperation, they too are looking around and wondering, where is their privilege? They too are feeling like they are being left behind while more and more programs are being rolled out to support everybody but them. I can’t speak for all white men, but for the ones like me, I think it’s safe to say we haven’t felt very privileged at all.
But here’s what I’ve realized since the murders of Eric Garner and George Floyd, who both died with the exact same words on their lips: while I have feared the police I have never feared for my life at the hands of police. Unlike Ahmaud Arbery, I have never had to worry about summary execution while out jogging. I’ve never had to worry about being lynched. I have committed crimes, some out of desperation and some out of depravity, and I have feared justice, feared being arrested, but I have not once had a mortal fear that any interaction with police would result in my death. I could expect to be ticketed, or even arrested, but not executed.
This peace of mind, is that what you mean by white privilege? You can talk about white privilege as an abundance of opportunities and social bias in my favor, but those things are less obvious to white people who are at the bottom of the caucasian social ladder. The road to the trailer park is not paved with obvious privilege, and poverty stricken white people are sick of hearing about white privilege in the midst of their own multigenerational struggles.
I’ve come to believe that the most fundamental expression of white privilege is the peace of mind white people unknowingly enjoy in not needing to worry about being murdered by uniformed officers. The Oxford dictionary defines privilege as a special right, and therein lies the fault in the term white privilege, because that peace of mind is not a special right. It’s a universal basic right, an inalienable human right, a civil right, but not a privilege, never a privilege.
We can not allow basic human rights to be referred to as privileges, because privileges can be taken away. When you use the word privilege to describe something that I don’t see as a privilege then we are not speaking the same language, and that’s a big part of the divide that is still preventing some white people from fully supporting movements like Black Lives Matter.
As all Americans re-evaluate their places in political and socio-economic systems that are incomprehensibly flawed, we need to understand that for too long we’ve acted like peace of mind is a privilege most black people have yet to earn. It’s not a privilege and it doesn’t need to be earned.
We need to stop referring to human rights as privileges, because privileges can be taken away but human rights are things that should never be taken away from anybody, even those suspected or convicted of crimes, regardless of their guilt or innocence. We need to start social reforms that provide universal and basic support to all people. And it is tragically obvious that we still need to be reminded that black lives do in fact matter, and that the peace of mind that comes with universal access to basic human rights is not a privilege.",05Jun2020,1
90,"I am an extremely liberal white woman. I have always been a huge supporter of Black Lives Matter, gay/trans rights, women’s rights, etc. I honestly didn’t think I was capable of being racist. I grew up in a very white area and only had a few black acquaintances growing up, for context. I was in an upper division college class. It was my first day, and we had to sit down in sets of two. Whoever we sat next to was to become our lab partner for the semester. I sat down next to an empty chair at a lab table, assuming I would probably not know anybody in the class. A large, muscled, tall, black man with thick dreads walked into the class. I didn’t think much of it until he started making his way to the seat next to me. For a moment I was taken aback, I was actually scared I realized. I immediately assumed we would have nothing in common (despite being in the same upper division class in a very specific lab). Looking back I realize now that that was my inherent racism speaking. I’m very ashamed, but I think it’s really important to own my racism, be aware of it, and use it to change myself. Anyways this young black man sits next to me, gives me a huge smile, and introduces himself. He then starts gushing over the cat necklace I’m wearing and we start talking about our cats together. I immediately relax. He turned out to be the best lab partner I ever had. We helped each other tremendously with a very hard class and became fast friends. He is one of the few people I have remained friends with after college. I cry over the killings of young black men imagining it was him instead. I cannot thank him enough for teaching me about my own racism. He is one of the best people I have ever met. And I swear I will stand with all the black men and women. I will never be silent again. For my best friend, and for all of the amazing people out there who deserve to live and love without fear. BLM!",05Jun2020,1
91,So I set my alarm for 5am! Because the CVS truck comes every friday! Waited an hour outside before the person opening the store told me the trucks come on monday morning now. No rubbing alcohol. No toilet paper. Gotta wake up at 5am monday. Well I got a coupon for a free hot dog so that's ok! Wrong. Got a free plain hot dog. 7-11 had no cheese. No chili. No tomatoes or onions or relish. Just a plain hot dog and a sad pile of ketchup and mustard packets. It broke me. I've been hoping and praying for things to go back to normal but no. Everything is going to return to a shittier version of normal.,05Jun2020,1

95,"Inspired by a post from r/fcbayern, where a player was quoted to say ""no baby was born a racist""

I live in a very racism free area, I didn't understand the concept until (relatively) late in my life.

I had a Drama teacher in high school who was from Texas. She sometimes brings her 3-ish year old daughter when there's a performance or rehearsal (when there's no teaching), or after school.

Her daughter once brought her baby doll with her. We all laughed a little bit (not mockingly, mind you), even the black folks in my class.

This is when the teacher (white) stormed in and started wagging her finger on us. First thing she asked, with a very stern face, was ""what's funny about this? Is there something wrong?""

We answered ""It's the first time we've ever seen anything like this"".

She went on to wag her fingers further and tell us about treating people nicely, and that it doesn't matter what colour you are, and that we shouldn't find this weird, etc.

The baby doll was black.

We didn't laugh because we thought it was weird that a white child was carrying a black doll, or that black babies are funny, it's because it is literally the first time we have ever seen a baby doll that isn't white, the doll was literally just like any other white doll you'd see, but black toned, this is literally not available in markets near us, she bought it from Canada.

If it was a black Barbie, different reaction, we've already seen it. But it's the same reaction you'd get if you saw a black Superman. It's the first time you've ever seen it, but it's not funny within itself, if you walked into a few other stores and saw other black Supermen, it'd be normal.

That said, it was something I'll never forget. She took a good slice of our rehearsal time to talk about this. She never addressed the issue of racism, of which we were quite oblivious of (as there was no Internet and none of us cared to read about local US news like we do today), she talked more about discipline. 

Racism in the US wasn't as international as it is now. 

Muhammad Ali was a huge black American figure (he's labeled as so even in Wikipedia), to us he's just a huge American figure. OJ Simpson? Ask any non-American about the case's brief, they'd tell you ""the most famous American athlete killed his celebrity girlfriend"". It's not that we don't see colour, of course we knew he was black, but we didn't think it meant anything. I shit you not, even Michael Jackson's Black or White song was interpreted to be about African struggles, others thought that it was about his skin transformation. Even I thought that it was about liking both Black and White girls, but it's probably because I'm stupid and I thought he said ""I want you to be my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white"".

I mean we've heard of the Apartheid, it was huge at the time, and we acknowledged it as a concern, but somehow the US hasn't made it to our agendas. We literally were taught about it as a history lesson, with the pictures of the segregated fountains, Rosa Parks, MLK and Slavery, it was in History books, as in ""this was then, but it's over now"".

I'd watch Eddie Murphy movies that touch a lot on black folks problems, I swear to God I wouldn't even get the racism hints and the struggles.

...

Back to my teacher, we were all looking at her like ""you okay? Stop being crazy"", she talked her heart out, and we understood very little.

A few days later some of the girls in my class asked where they can buy the same doll, and she told them that she bought the doll very very early in her daughter's life, so she could get used to seeing other colours and accepting them, and she treated the baby the same.

Like I said, right now, this story touches me deeply, she's a wonderful woman. At the time? I understood absolutely nothing, there was 0 meaning in all that happened in that incident.

It's a fucking crazy world.",05Jun2020,1

98,"Not romantically, but I've come to the realization tonight that a couple of the people I consider my friends aren't as caring as I thought. I personally try to be a listening ear whenever someone comes to me with a rant or problem to talk about. I try to motivate them and make them feel better, or if I can't do that, at least remind them that it's okay to feel how they do and that I understand how they feel. However, tonight I was feeling a bit down and asked my friend if I could talk to him about it. He left me on read. He always does this, and it annoyed me a little bit but to have him not reply this time around just made me so sad. I can think of at least 10 times where I listened to his problems and had lengthy conversations with him to lift his spirits. But the first time I wanted to talk to him about my feelings he ignores me.

What is even worse is I recently found out he used to have a crush on me but he since then got a girlfriend and from then on he has acted very disinterested in me. This just makes me think that he was only nice to me because he thought I was cute or whatever. It makes me wonder do my other guy friends only befriend me because they think I'm cute? Do they not care about who I am as a person? 

Another friend recently started insulting me too, calling me a loser and saying that I am a boring person. Of course I don't talk to him unless I absolutely have to anymore for this reason but it was very sad to go through, since we used to spend so much time together I thought of him as a genuine friend.",05Jun2020,1

If I wanted to look for new movies I would use Google or ask a subreddit for recommendations. I feel like a majority of people don't care about the trailers and want to get straight to the movie they paid for. Can't imagine how the people felt that paid full price for the movie.

105,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick because I’m ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ a lot more than once too.

I appreciate that they are very different times but that being said I see a lot of similarities between Rome of the mid Republic and the USA today.

The Gracchi brothers in Rome wanted to address economic inequality by helping the poor with land reform. Those land reforms included taking some land from the wealthiest members of the senatorial class and giving it to peasants. They also introduced a grain dole to help the needy. The senators of Rome beat him to death. 

Today in the USA Bernice Sanders wants to resolve economic inequality though medicare for all, a tax on trades in Wall Street and other means. It is plausible that the DNC actively hindered his campaigns. 

In both cases the wealthy upper class had actively campaigned against those reforms as they would severely hurt their person wealths. 

That's leaves a lot to speculate over about what happens next. But in the case of Rome all the senators that showed opposition to Tiberius Gracchus' reforms were met with hatred from the people.",05Jun2020,3

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

138,"Title explains it. I am an asian american adult female who has lived outside my home state for the past 3 years. I come from a very rural, southern, traditional white family. I love my family and we are all super close. I am also a christian woman who was raised with christian values. Now that I look back at certain ways that I was raised though, I get disgusted. Like for instance, I was NOT under any circumstance allowed to bring a black person home. Period. That was just the rule. And while I've always had POC friends throughout school, I abided by the rules and never brought any of them home. I grew up thinking things like wearing the confederate flag on my shirt was ok, and basically having the same mindset as the one I was raised with.

Even though this story is a little ironic because I myself am not white, I come from an all white family. I am a fist generation college student, I moved out of state and I make pretty good money and live a pretty good life now. I grew up in a white community where I would get mocked, teased and made fun of for being asian a lot. My family knows what I went through and they were always there for me through it. That's the problem of this post though. They know it happens.

Fast forward to now, I am now 3 years living in my current state. Being where I am now has been a total culture shock from where I'm from, obviously. I have honestly never felt more comfortable being around other asians and other people of color, something my white family will never, ever, understand. This has been a change for me and I've learned so much, grown and opened my mind. I feel like I look back at my old mindset and I get pretty disgusted at how I used to think (due to how I was raised) and how blindsided I've been from all of the issues going on. But now I know, and I'm vocalizing my opinion to everyone trying to educate them on the issues.

I am very close with my family still. I talk to my cousin and aunt (basically like my sister and mom) on the phone every single night. Not going to lie, the past couple days I have actively avoided them due to the fact that I know the issues will come up and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Now I know that uncomfortable situations are important to speak up about though. But I wanted to share with you all the conversation I had with my cousin so you can see why I hung up and cried for 30 minutes. I just needed to get this off of my chest, the things she said to me. The things she thinks isn't racist, but 100% is. I wasn't even going to bring any of it up, but she did. so I reacted.

C: ""wow, they put a giant sign down the street to the white house that says black lives matter. just wow""

Me: ""hey if it gets their point across""

C: ""I don't understand I'm so sick of it now. The 4 cops were charged, the main cop had his charge upped and they got what they wanted. it's over now""

Me: ""no, actually it isn't over. This isn't just about Floyd. It's about justice. Police brutality. Things that need changed""

C: ""umm well ya can't change the past""

Me: ""no but you can change the future? and prevent it from happening again?""

C: ""but it IS going to happen again. it will""

Me: ""but why does it have to??? you just talked about the other day how you thought it was ridiculous how the cop you know got away with domestic abuse just bc he's a cop. you know they get away with stuff and you are ok with that?? you are just ok with it happening again""

C: ""no that's not what I said. I just don't think this is a race issue, this is an issue of somebody murdering somebody. it didn't have to do with race, they never said it was about race"" Me: ""how come they have to say it's about race for it to be about race?""

C: ""it could've been about anything.""

Me: ""then why did he kill him?""

C: ""I don't know, maybe he just wanted to kill somebody that day?""

Me: ""oh so that makes it excusable and better.....??????""

C: ""no, i'm just saying it's not about race.""

Me: ""ok, lets go with what you say then. it's not about race. but what about the people who are crying out, telling their stories, trying to reach out to us to help them but we aren't listening. We are just turning our shoulders, not listening and not caring. so they resort to violence to get our attention and instead of listening to their cries we just get mad, but imagine how hurtful it is to not be heard. to be crying out for help from your white community and they just turn the other cheek. that's frustrating and hurtful, and I can't imagine somebody not believing me. I went through my own type of racism throughout my whole life and I can't imagine somebody not believing me"" (this is just me trying to dumb it down for her to get her to understand)

C: This is just my opinion, I don't believe this race is an issue, it's not always about race but that's what everyone always says it is. I know people go through stuff that we don't know about and I know that racism is out there but that doesn't mean this case was about race and that doesn't call to destroy your city and buildings and peoples property.

Me: ""I never said I agreed with the riots, I just said that I understood where they are coming from. That's all these people are asking is for us to understand and to do better.""

C: I just don't think theres anything to understand, people just want to riot and act like idiots (???) and find a reason to do so.

C:"" No I'm sure they're mad that's just not the way to do it. You can't change the past and it is what it is. People are gonna try and blame race on everything. I could go punch a black girl and they would call me racist just for punching her.""

Obviously I love my cousin, she's like my best friend. But this is her mindset. I had to hang up on her and I spent 30 minutes crying just because of this conversation. I can't wrap my head around this mindset and I don't know what to do. Obviously people will say cut her off, she's toxic and terrible. But I don't know what else to say or do. There's nothing I can say to make someone understand who doesn't want to understand, period. Keep in mind this cousin also claims that she isn't racist, but she said her sons better never come home with a black person. Why? She just doesn't agree with it and wouldn't be ok with it. I just feel like this is a time where we are seeing peoples true colors. And I don't want to lose my family and I want to try everything and anything to educate them, but at this point I am at a LOSS. Black community, please help me educate her? Or even educate me on things I'm not aware of? Thanks for reading this far if you did.",05Jun2020,1
140,"It is inspiring to me that the protests happening across the US are showing strong signs of unifying are being consistently better organized and are now in some areas starting to turn those who only want to see chaos over to the authorities. 
The problem faced in the US today goes much further than just police aggression though. There are many underlying elements that have led to the unchecked use of brutal police tactics from poor/inadequate training due to budget cuts or what have you  to dirty politics to outright racial profiling. The movement needs to make demands for reform on a national level to root out what I believe to be one of the core issues facing the citizens of the US which is the for-profit prison system.  
That system enables everything else built on top of it. When politicians and corporations can profit from someone else’s misfortune this signifies there is a fundamental flaw in the system which must be changed. When their only goal is to fill the prisons and then keep them full it’s no surprise that the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world, more inmates than all of the other countries of the world combined. When every inmate is just another dollar sign convictions and sentences get pushed through with complete disregard for innocence or guilt. This is not a justice system, this is nothing more than a money making scheme. 
Up until around the middle of the 20th century many prisons in the US were self sustaining with the inmates growing their own produce and raising their own livestock among other things. This provided a sense of belonging and accomplishment for the inmates and for many lead to real reform.  It would be great to see this system reborn.  There is more than enough infrastructure already there just waiting for new management to take the helm. 
Demand the change you want to see and never stop protesting until you achieve your goals. Do not be dissuaded by the guardians of a broken system they are already scared of what may come do not fear them, make them fear you and the change you will bring. Rip out the foundation and the whole house comes tumbling down.  Be safe, be peaceful, don’t be violent and  don’t let yourselves be provoked. Show them they are the ones standing on the wrong side. History is being written and you are the authors. Peace be with you all.",05Jun2020,1

What does it mean when a model posts two pictures side by side that almost look the same?

When a model says “I’m bored” is she essentially looking to provide a service at that moment?

I notice a lot of men reply “Hey” , is this a good way to let her know I’m intersted I’m purchasing a pic or vid?

153,"I was on I-244 in Tulsa OK when the truck drove through the crowd, causing two people to roll under his tires, and subsequently causing one man to fall 20ft off the overpass to the road below. 
I'm (28f) white, and from small town OK. All of this is leading me to the conclusion that I've lived a very sheltered and safe life. I had never been to any kind of protest before, or even seen one in person (except outside of Planned Parenthood when I was 17). The video of George Floyd's death caused me a lot of pain, not pain for me but pain for all POC who have to deal with these fears daily. Me and my sister made our signs and planned to go to a rally.  I chose this rally because it was seemingly well organized and we were told the police would be protecting us the entire time. It would be peaceful.
The turnout ended up being 1000+ people marching through the streets of downtown Tulsa, which was amazing. I felt incredibly empowered and finally felt like I was a part of something BIG. 
When we were marching, some confusion happened about our route, I heard it was blocked? Not sure. (we had not previously been provided with our intended route) and the group split into two. One group heading up the ramp onto the highway and the others staying below the overpass.
I'm not sure where to put this detail so I'm just going to add it here: when my sister and I first parked at OSU and were smoking before joining the group, a girl named Kenlyn asked if she could be with us, as she had snuck out to attend. I immediately felt responsible for her. 
She was interested in being in the action. Towards the front of the group, she was accepting about being on the highway, and she stuck with us. Until the truck incident. 
I hear a bunch of yelling and I look over to see this truck accelerating through the crowd, the truck was bouncing up and down as the people rolled under his tires. 
I wrapped my arm around my sisters waist and told her what was happening. We were immediately smashed against the barrier with a 20ft drop below us, and then we broke away. I immediately began to throw up and continued to do so as we frantically tried to get through the people and over the barrier. A man actually helped me over (which gave a calming effect) and I was able to sit in the grass and calm down. Somewhere in the mix Kenlyn said she had to go, and I have not been able to find her on social media, which sucks. She had a mask on so I could only see her eyes. 
But since then, I've become obsessed with proving the facts of what happened that day. And obsessed with the new roll I was assuming of heavily sharing and arguing with people about George Floyd, systematic racism, you name it. Only to be met with hatred and bigotry. I actually had to uninstall the Facebook app because it was negatively effecting my relationship with my son. And I don't plan on reinstalling.
I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess I  feel like a coward for no longer fighting with my fellow human beings. But something happened that day and has changed the way I view the world.

154,"Hi there. If you’re reading this, please understand that I’m still growing and learning as a person. I just want to use this post as a way to process my thoughts as well as get ideas on how to fix them.

Growing up, I was never able to keep friends very long, and people always seemed to stick around until they could find more popular friends. It didn’t start bothering me until I hit middle school, and I started to feel a little bitter that everyone else could seemingly keep friends and I couldn’t. 

As you may know, there’s a lot more emphasis on popularity in middle school and high school. High school was a struggle for me because I couldn’t find a place to fit in. I desperately wanted a friend I could relate to and form a close bond with, but as an introverted minority with immigrant parents and very specific interests, that was difficult and almost impossible. There were a few people that I talked to before class and stuff, but I never hung out with anyone outside of school.

There were times where it really upset me seeing everyone laugh with their friends, get into relationships, and have parties while I sat in silence and went straight home after school. I got to a point where I gave up on friendship and graduated high school with no friends.

Now, as a 19 year old in college, when I see people that resemble the popular guys and girls at my high school, I’m immediately put off by them and want nothing to do with them. I understand how wrong this is and I want to change it, but it’s difficult seeing as grew up separate from this kind of person and have a hard time relating to them. I want to be more accepting of everyone and have the past stay in the past. 

This is just another part of me that needs growth.",05Jun2020,1

160,"I'm about to join the police and obviously recent events have been making me think very deeply about my choice. I've not really changed my mind but now it's hit me that I have to stand by my morals matter what in this job. The two officers who were 4 days into their job when they killed George Floyd didn't and  they are rightly paying for that for the rest of their lives.
I am black and this has caused some backlash for my chosen career. I'm am outraged and heartbroken about every single death at the hands of the police both in America, Britain and around the world. It goes without saying I support Black Lives Matter because I believe black lives matter. It is often used as a political statement. But it is a statement of fact and anyone that disagrees with the core idea, that black lives are worth something and are equal to white lives but not treated as such, I see as racist. I am active in calling out racism when I see it and do my best to educate others about the systemic, institutional and everyday racism that many people face both in conversations and in my studies. 
This point of mentioning this is to say that transparency and accountability is something that is just as important in policing as using powers given in law. Some countries are better at that than others, UK v USA for example.

However I'm still joining the police. I feel the anger directed towards cops who violently police the protests, start the violence, and also respond to the violence disproportionately, and understand it. But I also understand that not every officer is like that, in fact many officers are not like that. I want to do my best because I am aware that I am joining an institution that is historically racist. I am also aware that many policies when practically carried out can also be used against minorities disproportionately. But that doesn't mean I haven't met countless officers who do their best to be a paramedic, social worker, mental health professional, parent and more every shift that they go out.
I'm proud to be close to joining those ranks and perform my duties upholding the law with neutrality.  This is the only job I've wanted to do. 
I guess the point of this ramble is that I don't feel that I will have two conflicting identities as an officer.  I'll always be black and hopefully I'll always be a police officer.

168,"Just to preface, here are some plushies I have of the 2019 Coronavirus; https://imgur.com/a/XkCFuOk

I've been keeping a keen eye on coronavirus news since early January, after there were reports in Wuhan, China of an unknown type of pneumonia. I actually did not expect it to blow up into a pandemic, because I figured this was just another SARS virus that would be easily contained, and that was it. I was wrong.

Around late January to early February I was scared shitless of the virus. I was constantly hearing about bodies in the streets of Wuhan and hospitals being overloaded. It sounded like a living nightmare, and I legitimately believed at the time that this virus had a 20-40% death rate, because of the case fatality rate. Obviously, I am much less fearful of the virus than I was back then.

In March-April, my fear of the virus began to decline based on seroprevalence studies (a nice big spreadsheet collection of studies are located here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zC3kW1sMu0sjnT_vP1sh4zL0tF6fIHbA6fcG5RQdqSc/edit?fbclid=IwAR23hDbmyNd2k4wIsZ3AUl4LQxb6ZmDrknz3ZInWMBx7YovtiYeH8p4On38#gid=0 ) showing the virus to have a death rate similar to that of a very bad cold or a flu. That is when I began to research into the virus more, because as my fear declined, my interest in it had increased.

In late April I developed what I thought was a normal cold until people noticed that I was breathing rapidly on one of the days I was sick. I also had a fever and lost some of my sense of smell and taste. I later tested positive for antibodies to the virus.

Since then, I developed 'feelings' for the virus. I'm still not sure exactly why, it was only after I contracted it I noticed these feelings began. I grew fascinated with the intelligence of this virus, and how it seems as though it is almost a sentient being, unlike other viruses we've ever seen before. Viruses have been on this planet for 3.5 billion years, and they're arguably more successful than humans ever will be. I started to feel sympathetic for the virus and felt like if it was to ever be exterminated then I would feel saddened by its loss. I came across an article saying that only around 30% of people who contract the virus develop antibodies and the ones who do, don't have them for very long, so herd immunity is basically impossible. You can get re infected again and again, because a big part of the viruses genome is towards tricking the immune system into producing the wrong antibodies.

Then, I learned that this virus is very 'brainy' - it is the largest of RNA containing viruses. I also learned that the virus has a 'compassionate' or 'considerate' side. Although the virus kills via suffocation, which is normally a terrifying and sufferable way to die, the virus travels up into the brains of those it affects, and blocks the brain's panic response to a lack of air, called ''silent'' or ''happy'' hypoxia. No other virus cares to do this. https://www.physoc.org/blog/hypoxic-happiness-covid19/

I feel there's so many unique and fascinating things about this virus and I understand people dying from it is bad, but death is a part of life. I go onto Worldometer daily to see how many new cases there are of the virus, and I am relieved to find that daily new cases are either stable, or slowly going up, so the virus is ''healthy'' in that respect and it isn't dying out.

I know I call the virus an ''it'' here. I consider the virus to be a he, based on how it infects cells. Specifically the virus penetrates cells and then makes the cells give birth to ''his'' babies. I like to call ''him'' nicknames like ''Rona'' as well. All my fear of the virus is gone, I wouldn't mind it if it visited me again like some kind of clingy friend and then tickled my lungs. Is it more like tickling or having sex with the lungs since that is how it reproduces? I'm not 100% sure. Either way I know a lot of people with the virus say they experienced a tickling sensation in their lungs.

I personally believe that viruses are living creatures and are more intelligent than we give them credit for. Also that they are an ancient type of creature that deserves to be on this planet more than selfish humans who only care about their own survival but not the survival of other species.",05Jun2020,1

170,"Reddit makes its money from advertising, from selling behavioural data, and from users buying awards. Angry people post a lot, share a lot, and reward each other a lot, so like Facebook or Twitter, reddit makes more money when tempers are running high. Malicious, indignant, biased, or uninformed doesn't matter so long as it pays to play.

This encourages a hands-off approach to hate speech, which is almost easiest when it's explicit. Sure it may flourish in small pockets, but it's quickly disregarded by anyone who didn't already agree with it. But then there is a confusing, complicated swamp of the more subtle racism, of dog whistles and innuendo, spurious correlations and nudging journalism. Wading into that mess of meaning and intent is a lot of trouble and over the years inertia has settled in, especially now that subsurface hatred puts revenue on the table.

If reddit was still a niche forum, this would barely matter. It would have all the lure of toilet stall graffiti. But when you have 300 million visitors in a month, that is not what they are coming to see. When the swamp's messages can blaze in fire on the walls of a nation, they can seem like words of truth, and can gather followers. Extremist subreddits given free reign by a platform have grown and become larger than the old festival tent publishers of photocopied bile. 

With great power comes great responsibility. Lines of blood could be dripping from comments on reddit to consequences in the ""real world"". Is the site going to wake up one day and find that blood on its hands? What can it do today to prevent that tomorrow?",05Jun2020,1
171,"And I feel bad about it. I have never been followed around in a store. I have never felt unsafe while being pulled over. I have never been discriminated against, called the N word, or anything similar by a non-POC. I have only ever been accepted by white people (and black people too - i have many friends of all races). I have only ever been told that I “talk white” by other black people, which makes no sense to me.

I think all races can be racist, and I dont care about microagressions, but I’ll still respect that some people take offense and i won’t use them. I didn’t know that asking where someone is from out of curiosity, or saying that “we are one race the human race” was wrong. That seems pretty unifying to me. 

I have never had anyone skip the elevator, or clutch their purse, or make sure I wasn’t stealing something. I’ve never been the token black friend. I have lived in the south all my life and have never experienced the racism that everyone says is making me oppressed. 

I feel bad. I i keep seeing posts about how oppressed we are as a people but I haven’t felt that. I didn’t grow up rich or anything, I just lived, and I always felt fine. But it seems like it’s not supposed to be that way for me, and I feel guilty.",05Jun2020,1
172,"I'm using this throwaway because I still feel horrendous, and I need to protect my friend's and my privacy.

I don't know whether or not it's more appropriately fitted in AITA or TIFU, but this happened a few hours ago and this is filling me up with guilt.

My friend is a leader of a writing group that meets on the first Friday of the month, but she decided to reschedule it to next week because she wanted to go to a protest downtown where I live. I was asking her about it, and then I said I wanted to possibly go to give me ""something to do."" I'm autistic and have a bad habit of putting my foot in my mouth at times, but the worst part about this is that I didn't realize how offensive that was. She aptly put it that it isn't something ""fun"" to do, and she said the protests could get violent if the police officers were acting unruly. I was worried about that too, for both her safety and possibly my own if I went. I apologized as profusely as I could and tried not to make it self-piteous. She said she's not upset with me and that she ""knew what I meant,"" but I still feel gross about it, especially considering that she's black and this affects her much more than it does me.

I am also afraid of talking about racism because that means I will have to confront the ills of white society, which means the ills of white people, and, therefore, the problems that are associated with me. But lately, the intrusive, racist thoughts have been getting worse, and the worst thing is is that I've become complacent. Even though I know they're horrendously wrong, I can't help but think that as a white person I am destined to think like this. I'm destined to be on top at the expense of other people, no matter how wrong it is and how many people die. I'm destined to be problematic because that's part of my heritage. Talking about racism is something I want to address and I want to be a part of, but I'm such a fucking coward because that means addressing my heritage, my identity, and the evil that makes up our society.

I really did want to go to the protest tonight because this is a cause I believe in, and I always want to do the right thing. But ever since I sent that humiliating text, I'd feel ashamed if I dared to show my face at any of them.",05Jun2020,1
173,"I’ve been talking to a woman I like for the last four or so months. She always assured me that I could open up to her and she didn’t mind. Well after doing this for the last four months she basically told me that she hates me because all I ever do is complain and told me not to talk to her ever again. She didn’t mind though, sure. I’m never going to trust a woman again when they say this to me.",05Jun2020,1
174,Cause of the violence and the million man march in DC tomorrow which could be deadly if rioters (not peaceful protestors) try and storm the whitehouse.

175," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'eh that lads just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in this night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her wiping the table , she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde walked towards me to  say bye on her way out smiling and the brunette was out before her holding her head a bit looking tipsy but the blonde seemed fine . I wasn't I just felt uneasy, did they like me or mocking me?",05Jun2020,1
177,"First feedback of the summer semester was about how crap my first assignment was. That weekend was a crap weekend. I was so stressed and tired I spent the night crying while trying to get it done on time.

Not a fan of the whole riot protest thing going on. I get it. I’ve been victimized my police by the color of my skin numerous times before. But personally, what is going on right now with the protesting and rioting is seriously starting to mess with my chances at doing something better with my life for my kids, for me, and to combat racial inequality in the field I have chosen to go into.

Which pisses me off because I had to lose a lot and give up a lot to go to college for this path.",05Jun2020,1
