BUT I have no idea what a godfather does beyond going to the christening and taking custody is something happens to the parents.

1,"I used to crave it. I was bullied so badly in school, even after puberty when I was already attractive, that nowadays at almost 38 with 20+ years evidence that I am, in fact, conventionally attractive, I still feel insecure when someone compliments me. Like they might be laughing at me.

I do belong now, and you will too. I found my place between the D&amp;D people, the gamers, the weirdos. The people who will fall down a wiki rabbit hole all night.

So will you. Don't try to belong; embrace your weirdness. You will find your people. And we will be waiting without arms open; some will do a vulkan greeting and maybe that's not your thing. Some might chant a spell and maybe that's not your thing either. Some might shove an equation in front of your face and wait for you to solve it... Yep, we have jerks everywhere.

But know that no matter what you love you are welcome, and there are others like you. You will never be alone unless you want to. You belong. You belong with me and you belong with others and we will embrace you like family because you.are.not.alone.",27Oct2020,1
3,"Hi everyone, I hope this is an appropriate place to post this. I'm looking for some kind redditors who would be willing to take a minute out of their day to vote for my dad to win a new motorcycle! 

A year or so ago he bought a bike from out of province and had it shipped to our place. It's actually the chopper he's on pictured in the link. Long story short we found out the frame had to be replaced in order to register it here in Ontario, Canada, since the bike was in an accident. A buddy of ours was willing to help so we bought a cheap donor bike and started wrenching. The deeper we got the more problems we found, and it got to a point where we could no longer continue, as my mom had to stop work for unrelated reasons and finances became tough. I've tried to help as much as possible in any way I can but at this point the bike is pretty much a lost cause.

He's been aching to ride ever since, and if there's any hardworking, loving father in the world that deserves a new bike, I'd say it's definitely him. 

Here's the link: [https://dreamchopper.com/2020/daniel-kowcun](https://dreamchopper.com/2020/daniel-kowcun)

As a bonus there is an option to make a donation to support Hudson Valley SPCA that rescues and shelters animals, this will also earn my dad some votes! Completely optional of course, but I thought it would be worth mentioning in case your feeling charitable.

If anyone could spare the time to vote I would appreciate it immensely - it would mean so much to my father and I. Thank you!",27Oct2020,1
4,"So I'm having problems with my roommate currently.  Basically she said and did shit that annoyed me to the point where I didn't wanna be around her energy and just ignored her until I was ready to be around her again. It's been 3 days and not once has she asked me if I was ok or why I was ignoring her. The way she is acting is making me feel like I have to apologize to her when she was the one that made me mad in the firs place. I'm tired of having friends that don't give a fuck about my feelings and never reach out and apologize when they do me wrong. For once I want someone to fight for our friendship and care about me. I am always the one that has to end up confronting these friends and justifying why I am having these emotions. That's messed up why should I have to apologize to you when you're the one who made me feel that way. Why I should I apologize for being the ""monster"" when no one apologized for making me this way.",27Oct2020,1
5,"I have a small, hard lump next to my scrotum, on what I suppose is called my inner-thigh. It's slightly smaller than a skittle and painless.

6,"I know it's not easy, really it's supposed to be something that demands a lot of discipline, willpower, and motivation. I'm more than willing to work for it.

Four years ago (at 18) I've had the first impulse to change myself, like an epiphany, so I decided to just run. I went out for a run every morning. And after a week or so, I ended up with something called 'jumper's knee' and a sprained ankle (both on my left), because I really was dumb enough to just go out running without any notion of posture, technique, or even appropriate shoes.

I recovered quickly from the worse part of these injuries, but even today (at 22yo) my ankle still feels stiff and my knee hurts when I put too much strain into it.

On january I've had an appointment with an orthopedist, and she cleared me up to do some running and even resistance training. I was so glad.

So after all that, I went out running again! And this time I did my homework: researched just about everything related to running, got the right shoes. I'd run every other day, and on rest days I'd do some very basic bodyweight exercises. My fist goal was to run 5k, and try out some HIIT after that (to finally start losing weight).

Well, it didn't last long. Halfway through that C25K program, my knee would hurt like hell during a run. I was trying to be very aware of how I ran, and every time after a run I'd ice my knees and ankle for a few minutes. But my knee still hurt. So I put everything to a halt.

Maybe I'm just being lazy and looking for a reason to feel sorry and all sad. I don't know. It's maybe a problem that I insist on doing everything by myself. I wish I could take on swimming, which would be easier on my knees, but there's no place nearby with a pool - and I can't swim, so I'd need lessons.

It's just so frustrating to fail at even the most basic level of something that so many people can do without thinking too much.",27Oct2020,1

This year I tried things differently. I picked a field I’m actually interested in and studied at my own pace. I didn’t pass the first two times, but promised myself I’d keep trying until I did. Now that the moment has arrived, I can actually say that I’m happy and proud of my accomplishment.

19,"A few years ago I met a woman in college and she treated me horribly basically and kept leaving me and coming back to me. We were never in a relationship or went past making out either. One day I realized I was giving her too many chances and was letting her walk all over me so when she just said she wanted to be friends I took it literally and just hid my feelings and stopped giving her any attention.

The thing is she would get very jealous of any woman even looking in my direction, again we were never in a relationship because she kept going back and forth with the idea, but she randomly denied having feelings for a mutual friend. That same guy even said we would end up working things out and thought we were great together. Well she started flirting with him after I stopped giving her attention and a few months later they started going out and they were always all over each other.

I had to see them together since we were in college together but I had since stopped talking to them even before all of that. My dating life just went downhill from there and I never really met anyone like her or got anywhere close to a relationship or a hook up. I graduated and its been a few years since then and I have felt so emasculated since then and my life feels so pathetic, I will never recover from it and will never come close to even experiencing what that relationship could be like with her or ever have the fun they had or be as happy as they were.

Im stuck just thinking about how my dating life has just sucked and now my life is just struggling to understand my job and to not get yelled at for making mistakes. I am hoping a guy can help me figure out what to do, I just dont think Ill ever be happy or even content. I dont really know what to do, I wish I could just stay under my covers for the rest of my life.

28,"I was just lying in bed, making up scenarios when I started to think of my dog who was recently put down. I thought of this memory that fills me with guilt every time I think of it and it made me sad.

Basically, when I was around 7, and he was a puppy, I found it hilarious to put him on the back of the sofa and shove him off (Please note this only ever occurred once). He would run for under the table but he was small abnd I caught him easily. I had no idea it was abuse, or that I might be hurting him, I was just a dumbass kid. But then, as I shoved him off again, he went way further than any time before and hit his head on part of the fireplace/ raised tile(?) bit by the fire.

Only then did my brain realise it was bad. I panicked, scared I'd given him brain damage or something and confessed straight away to my mother, who was obviously angry.

Anyway, even years later, every time I think of that event, I feel so shitty. He was a puppy. He didn't know why I was scaring and hurting him. Hell, I didn't know. I just found it funny, until he got hurt obviously.

It's been a month and almost a week since he was put down due to prostate cancer and as I was trying to sleep, it came into my mind and I just started crying. I just felt so bad, and for the first time, he wasn't here to cuddle, or to apologise for the millionth time to.

It just sucks.

I have his harness in my bed, so I cuddled it and talked out loud about my thoughts as if he were there, listening. 

I'm not a huge believer in heaven, or an afterlife so part of me knew he's most likely not there to listen to me but it's still comforting to act like it.

Not really looking for advice, I just wanted to rant. Anyway, have a good day/night. :-)",27Oct2020,1

32,"Looking for a second opinion!!!!

So I (23m) am currently on a roadtrip across the USA. I’ve wanted to do this trip my whole life.

To go on this trip, I saved up $16,000 working as an EMT, quit my job as an EMT, and budgeted $4000 dollars for the trip, with the idea that the other 12,000 would be used to establish myself in a new location after the trip is over. 

I have a week left in the trip - so far I’ve seen everything I wanted to see, including almost a dozen national parks and several major cities. I just finished a tour of Zion. Tomorrow I’m going to visit Big Bend and Antelope Canyon, and the day after I’ll be headed to the Grand Canyon.

To save money, I’ve spent most of the trip camping on BLM land and sleeping in my car. Tonight I’m sleeping in a Wal-Mart parking lot. And I’m laying here thinking, am I nuts? I quit my job during a pandemic/recession. I barely have a plan for how I’ll get back on my feet after this (I’m banking on the abundance of EMT jobs helping to get me a job quickly + relying my savings until I establish a positive income stream) and well shit I’m sleeping in a Wal-Mart parking lot. 

I feel like a nutcase. Do you think I’m crazy?",27Oct2020,1
33,"I was in middle school or early high school when I was going through the worst period of my life. I was dealing with some undiagnosed, untreated mental illness (panic disorder and severe major depressive disorder, if you want to know.) There were a lot of reasons behind that, but a main part was living with my family. 

There was pretty much constant fighting and door slamming. My parents weren't abusive, but they would do fucked up shit sometimes. I once got punished for an entire summer, no tv, no videogames, no hanging out with friends, all because I got a single c on my report card. This led to feeling super isolated, plus hearing my extended family talk shit about ""the homosexuals ™,"" while I knew I was gay. My stepdad was openly homophobic, and my mom didn't openly disagree with him. A lot of people I was friends with at the time kind of just stopped talking to me, due to being grounded. I felt almost completely alone for years pretty much. (Don't worry, I'm doing much better now. A cocktail of antidepressants and getting out of that stressful environment does wonders)

Then we got Bella. She was originally my sister's dog, but my sister never spent time with her or showed her attention. She was also super anxious, as was her mother, so she would run and hide in her cage whenever my parents would fight. At some point, I called her up to my room while they were yelling and she eagerly came with me. She was anxious, I was anxious. It seemed like she *understood* that I knew what she was feeling. I held her and we both seemed to calm each other. Eventually, she got to the point where if something scared her, she would run to me instead of her cage. I promised myself that I couldn't leave her there and be ok with myself. 

I moved out and got a letter from a therapist saying that having her as an emotional support animal was necessary to my well-being, and I brought her with me. My sister was kind of mad at first, then my parents pointed out that she wouldn't have to take care of her or pay for food. After that, my sister was just kind of like ""yeah, take her.""  

My landlord said that I had to move in on a certain date, but the letter from the therapist hadn't came in yet, so I had to leave Bella at my parents' place for a few weeks. My mom said that she would sit outside the door to my bedroom and sniff under the door all day. 

We're both doing a lot better these days. I've personally never felt better, and Bella seems sooo much happier. She doesn't get scared by very much now. Her only issue is that she wasn't socialized very much as a puppy, so she sometimes barks at other people and dogs that are around. Even this is getting better though. She used to bark at every single person that she saw when I would walk her outside and she would run from people on bikes. Now she's cool with most people, even the ones on bikes, and usually only barks at dogs if they bark at her first",27Oct2020,1

35,"When 2020 started I was hopeful. I didn't give two shits about the pandemic. 

The first bad news came along in February. I didn't make it to residency. I got over it and took up a job in a small hospital as a Medical Officer, only to quit five months later, to give residency another try. Whilst my preparation, my Granddad, someone I was immensely close to, was struck by COVID-19 and passed. I was still recuperating from his death, when my family learnt that my father was into some illegal business and he was using mine and my brother's names for it. My mom forgave him, even though they were on the verge of separation. I couldn't and haven't been able to forgive him. We live under the same roof as strangers. 

The only good thing to come out of it was this guy I was seeing. I'd liked him for five years. He was a good friend and finally in March this year, we started seeing each other. I had told this to my friend, who had run her mouth to everyone of our common friends. She just couldn't be happy for me. Just this morning, the guy told me that I was complicating things for him and I either had to choose between ""not being exclusive"" or ""stopping"". I chose the latter, because after waiting for him all this time, if couldn't have all of him, there really is no point. 

I called my best friend to ask her why she did this to me, and she flat out lied to my face that she didn't and if there was nothing else to talk she'd hang up. I said some pretty hurtful things to her and hung up. It didn't help with the heaviness I was feeling, but I did lose two people in a day. My life couldn't get any worse.

This is what I need to tell you. ""EXACTLY...  Trump just handpicks random people who are anti-abortion and don’t believe in immigrants/civil rights and finds an intricate loophole to get them appointed in a period of a few days. On the other hand, covid, the “hoax” he allegedly got, was not a big deal. There was need to take action quickly, not like thousands of Americans would still be alive today if he took it seriously, gave enough PPE, and took action in a constructive way that any rational, compassionate leader with a mind would do. 
He doesn’t give a shit about the American people! He doesn’t care about you. Sorry. He just gets off at the fact that the whole world “loves” him. And he maybe appreciates you if you support him only because you make him feel like he is a supreme being. Because that feeds his ego. The same ego that gets fed by grabbing women and criticizing Biden’s son who died of a brain tumor. This man has no empathy and wants to turn America into a place where immigrants are treated like shit, women have no control on what happens in their bodies, black people are treated like animals, and LGBTQ people don’t have the same rights as others. Much like Hitler did with his philosophy of propagating the Aryan Race with systematic extermination.

I know that you struggle a lot, but please if you’re reading this and you don’t feel like anything is worth it, think about a simple thing that made you happy. Maybe it was petting your dog, or sleeping after a long day. Maybe it was hearing the rain fall outside, or running your fingers through your hair. Take a deep breath in and out and sink into the memory. Think about how many things your body did to do that and how amazing it is to just be. Give yourself a moment to let your worries wash away. And just *be.* Nothing more, nothing less. I would care if you were gone. I really do mean that. You are worth it. You are a good person, and I am sending you my love to have a good day.

68,"This is gonna be a long one, so buckle up kids.


I'll start at grandparents/my parents childhood, just so you have an idea of the conditions my parents were under to make them this way.

My fathers parents are evil, disgusting people. His mother is an alcoholic, and I've never known her to not be drunk. Saying that if I had to spend every day with my dads father I'd drink like that too.

Hes a horrible, slimy man who talks to a woman's chest, hes the uncle at the pool party your mom tells you to cover up for. He almost certainly beats his wife, and one christmas she got incredibly drunk and let it slip that ""well, (grandad) doesnt really take no for an answer and, well, I cant look at (my father) without it coming back.""

He raped his wife and my father is the product of that. My father does not know. Throughout his childhood my father was overweight, and quiet. From what I can tell he was the laughing stock of his family so he never learned that people who care about you dont treat you like a jester. In every social situation I've ever seen him in he someone finds himself getting ridiculed, and he just laughs along. 

He has siblings, but they've never really been that large a part of my life, save a few incidences.

My father is very clearly somewhere on the spectrum, and he is the least empathic person I've ever met in my life. I think this and his emotionally distant parents are why he went on to be an abuser.


Now onto my mother. Her father was a photographer in the 70s and 80s, so he lived behind a closed blackroom door. Overall she had a pretty decent relationship with her parents, it was her only sibling, her brother that was a problem.

5 years older than her, he was an alcoholic by 13, and began to drink more and more. Soon he became violent, beating my mother with a cricket bat multiple times.

This went on for multiple years, her brother would skip school, start drinking at noon, come home around 7 and beat my mother, then he would steal the car and leave. At least once a week. My mothers parents were consumed with her brother, so she didn't get much attention in her teenage years.

So she turned to olded men to get the attention she needed. I don't blame her for this in the slightest. As you would expect, she was seriously taken advantage of, raped at 13. She had to have an abortion at 13, and was branded the school whore.

My mother had two more relationships before she met my father. One man fathered my oldest sister, now 27, he was financially and emotionally abusive. But mostly he was just a bit of a man child.

The next man fathered my other older sister, now 22 and was incredibly physically abusive. My mother had to get a restraining order against him, and she hasn't seen or spoken to him in 17 years.

My parents didn't have a great childhood, so I put this in here to maybe give some insight into why they are the way they are.

Now we're done with the prequel, let's actually get into my life.

Fresh out of an abusive relationship with my youngest (but still older) sister, my mom described my dad as a booty call that wouldn't leave.

He got the cold, and insisted he come live with my mom for a few weeks so she could look after him. He then just moved his stuff in. This is the first in a long line of emotional manipulations.

Nothing really happened until me and my twin brother were born. But my dad made my mom marry him because ""he didn't want his boys with another mans name""

 20 minutes after my mom had finished labour my father held us both and looked her straight in the eye and said

""If you ever leave me I'll make sure you never see these boys again""

Theres a lot to unpack there, but that set a precedent for the rest of their relationship, which lasted 17 years.


10 months before I was born my moms dad died, and my moms mother sold her house and gave half the money to each of her children. My parents sold their house aswell and used all the money to buy a 5 bedroom. (All of this is important later aswell).

My dads parents drove down from where they live a few hours away to help move in. In front of his wife, my dads father tells my NEWLY WIDOWED GRANDMOTHER that he would keep her company if she got lonely at night.

 My grandma moved in, as both my parents worked, she was my second parent honestly, and when she died everything kind of fell from their.

When I was five for mine and my brothers birthday we went to a Christmas fair type thing, in the middle of winter. In england.

It must've been around -10? Way too cold to be spending extended amounts of time in at 5 years old.

My eldest sister is a spoiled brat. Put simply.

I'm gonna go into a small tangent about her relationship with my other sister to demonstrate what kind of a person she is.

My eldest sister was 5 stone at 5, 6 stone at 6, so on. (For people that dont know how heavy that is I'm a 5'10 15 year old male and I weigh 9 stone) 

She has always been overweight, and this wasnt helped by her grandmother getting her whatever she wanted.

Every week her grandma would send her a huge brown envelope filled with sweets, so filled that it wouldn't fit through the letter box. My mom started insisting that my sister shared with her sister, so grandma stopped sending the sweets and got her a bank account.

My sisters grandma is a psychotic woman. Her son( my eldest sisters father) wouldn't take my sister on a holiday to India so she set his car on fire and smashed the windows of his house in.

She never really payed attention to my other sister, or  me and my brother. 

She made forced my mom into letting my sister stay with her every weekend, and found out she was making my sister call her mom, and telling people in shops that she was her mother.

I think my eldest sister is responsible for my other sisters anorexia, I'd hate food too if I went through that. I've gone on long enough about this but a stand out indicent was when my eldest sister told my sister to kill themselves, and do it properly this time.

My eldest sister was incredibly smart, and she coasted through up to uni putting in no effort at all because she could get away with it. Then she got to uni and she choked because she had never actually tried before.

Tangent over, back to the fair in minus temperatures.

My eldest sister needed to go and return a skirt her grandma had brought her, and she had to do it then because the next day her grandma was coming down for Christmas, so she wouldn't have been able to get a moment alone to get the money back.

She left to go return this skirt, and four hours later we are still waiting. My youngest sisters lips are blue, my mom has taken off her coat to keep me and my brother warm. My dad is just stood there.

After 5 hours she hadn't responded to any calls so we left. She had her own car that her grandma bought her so she came home a few hours later.

A huge argument ensues and my mom tells my sister that if she can't hold a basic respect for the people in this house, she can't be a part of it. My sister slaps her and leaves.

Up until this point my eldest sister had the second biggest bedroom, after my parents, but she refused to move out of it.

My mom took this opportunity to move me and my brother into a bigger room, because that just makes sense right? Two people need more space than one person. My dad agreed with this and helped out (this is also important later.)

My mom reached out to my sister and told her she was welcome back, but she would have to start respecting my mother as an authority and be a little less selfish.

Not hard terms really.

I fixed my sleep schedule by waking up early to make sure I was awake for football on Sunday (real nice priorities there haha). On Monday I woke up, and got back on my 200 ounces of water a day hydration routine, which is something that’s a lot easier on ye old bladder once you’re in the routine, so it was a lot of bathroom breaks. I got a workout in which I slacked on for a week. Then I went to bed at 10 o’clock, woke up at 5, played video games for a bit, did a quick homework assignment, then I went on a run at 7:00.

i’m a 20f in college and idk if it’s depression or school but .. i always feel so drained. i try to do usual things i love like going out for breakfast with a friend every other day, yet i noticed i haven’t been myself at all lately. typically i’m really talkative and direct but lately i’ve just been quiet &amp; snappy, sometimes downright ugly. even others around me notice. 

my friend will be in the car talking to me, laughing and i just barely make a chuckle. it’s so annoying because i know i’m acting boring and serious but i just can’t fake what i don’t feel. i’m not going to pretend to be cheerily happy and crack jokes to save face, i’m tired and i admit it. i feel so boring and lame to be around, to the point were i even uninvite or cancel plans because i already know how i’m going to feel when i’m there. (ex; irritated, annoyed, quiet, snappy, etc) 

school stresses me a lot and i never feel like i’m doing enough, especially with everything going on and school being online (i’m taking 6 classes). i typically wake up early like at 7 since i have morning classes, then i’m on my laptop doing school work/stuff for another couple hours of the day before i have my leisure time (which is me just napping or smoking lettuce sometimes) then at night i’ll either sleep early since i’m so tired or grind out a couple more hours doing school work and then sleep at around midnight. 

i honestly don’t think i do enough or even feel that busy but i don’t know why i’m so drained and tired all the time. all i think about is school and how it affects my future, which is why i put so much emphasis on it. i’m not super nerdy &amp; i have somewhat of a social life, but that doesn’t stop me from feeling this way.

78,"A couple of years ago I met a bunch of new people in a university group, we all got along well and were fast friends, which was a big deal since it was the first time I'd made new friends since leaving high school a couple of years earlier.

I got into a relationship with one of the girls pretty quickly, we got along well and she pretty quickly became the focus of the vast majority of my social interactions. We got very co-dependent and still spent time with the rest of the group but even with them we'd still be together by ourselves usually.

So fast forward to the middle of this year that really didn't work out and left me an absolute mess of a human with crippling anxiety and next to no social life. Did make an effort to reach out to my friends more though and I don't think it would be wrong to say that a couple members of the group kind of adopted me into their own little smaller group while a couple others adopted my ex. Not that there was any picking sides, everyone is still friendly.

But I just appreciate this little group of mine so much. I have never felt so accepted and that I just fit in in my life. I can get up and start dancing with these three girls at a party, in front of everyone, completely sober, and not care at all. And for a quiet guy who's just now realising he's actually more extroverted than introverted and found it embarrassing to dance alone with his girlfriend, that's a huge deal.

These people have absolutely gone out of their way to make me feel welcome and loved and worth it even when they're having big problems of their own going on at the moment and I just appreciate them so much. We're even going with matching costumes for Halloween as the Four Horsegirls of the Apocalypse. Luckily I don't mind making fun of myself and my masculinity can handle being a horsegirl.

I've spent probably the last seven years desperately searching for a relationship because I thought it was the only thing that would give me the love and acceptance and intimacy I've craved so much but instead I've finally found it with friends. And while I'm still a bit lacking on the physical intimacy part and miss that from my relationship it's the only thing I miss and for once I'm actually okay with just being single and not actively looking for anything.

Anyway, that's it for my TED talk. Hold your friends close people.",27Oct2020,1

80,"&gt;Between human beings, love is a relational word. Yes, you can love things that do not love you back—the sky or a mountain or a painting or the game of chess. But the love of other people is directional. There is a lover and a beloved—you don’t just love, but you love *at* someone. And real love is not only about the feelings of the lover; it is not egotism. It is when one person believes in another person *and shows it*.

Globus pharyngeus. Dysphonia. Lacrimation.

I get choked up and cry easily - beauty and wonder and awe and *love*. It’s so easy to get lost in the world around me (and not just because I’m directionally-challenged). Sunrises, sunsets, the moon and stars. Fallen leaves dancing in the wind. The feel of the earth beneath my feet.

Finding love outside is.. well, natural. Inside, however - I struggle.

We don’t have to get into the obstacles. No need to dwell on what is or isn’t happening at home. Or if it really even is *home*. I’m not interested in your physical appearance. Your face. Your parts (ahem).

&gt;I only care about the words that flutter from your [extraordinary] mind.

As for today ... I want to curl up on the couch, all cozy with hot cocoa and a book. I want to get a little high and gaze out at the snow a while.

Most of all, I want to fall in love. Again. More. With today, tomorrow, yesterday. Outside, inside. Myself. You. Us.

Since the moment I walked in there I could tell she didn’t like me. I’ve tried to test the waters a bit and crack a joke, or make a comment about the heat when I saw her fanning herself. Nothing. Both times this girl just stares at me like I have five heads. 

I‘d venture to guess she’s at least five years older than me and I’ve never met or seen her before so as far as I know it’s not like I fucked her boyfriend or something. I just don’t get it. She never says anything to me, she just kind of glares at me every time I come by. I can do my job with little to no interaction with her so it’s not really a big deal, I’m just confused. 

She gets along with everyone else, though of course they’ve all been working here with her for a while. Part of me wants to just ask her but I know I won’t get a meaningful response. I did say to another coworker (whom she frequently works with) that I don’t think she likes me, hoping I could get a little insight but she just laughed and we kept working.

83," 

I am probably going to delete this later but here goes.

Ever since I was 11 years old, I fell for a girl at my neighborhood. She was funny, kind, energetic and positive. I loved being around her. She would tease me and occasionally sit in my lap and simply cuddle.  
I was not living with my parents and I grew up with my grandmother, so I knew nothing about relationships or flirting.  
Soo we where young back then and I didn’t knew how to act. I just let her do whatever she wanted and whenever she needed me for something, I was always there for her.  
4 years later, I realized I was attracted to her, but I didn’t know what to do. After she went out with some douche bag who just wanted to be with her for the sex, I was depressed.  
Then when she broke up with him, I decided to tell her how I felt about her. She wanted to be nice about it so she told me that she cared about our friendship soo it’s better if we don’t pursue anything serious. Because if we did, the moment it was over, we could never look each other in the eyes again. I was afraid to lose her, so I agreed to remain as just friends. But I did so because I was hoping that in time, she would reconsider. I didn’t realize that I agreed to be something that I could no longer be. Needless to say, her behavior changed around me, as she wanted to hang with me, but she didn’t want to give me any false hopes. So occasionally she would ignore my messages and when I would ask her out, she would always be busy.  
There where times however, when she would ask me out to hang and even invite me at her place. I was very happy when she was giving me her attention. But the fact of the matter was, nothing was happening between us.

I decided to move to my parents when I graduated, and this put distance between us. I tried to keep in touch, but I realized that I was the only one putting any effort. I realized that she never had to put effort into keeping in touch with me, so I held no value in her eyes as a person.  
I was hurting for years because I grew to feel attached to this person and crave her presence in my life. But I showed too much weakness in my behavior like neediness and depression. I know I turned her off in some way which is the reason she never could feel attracted to me in a romantic way.

As I write this, I am 29 years old. Halfway trough 2019 I decided to cut all contacts. Not because I was hoping that she would start to miss me and want to contact me. After all, she is a busy woman who has plenty of things going for her in her life. I cut contact with her because I realized that I invested too much in a person who had me as a given and didn’t had to put any effort to keep me in her life. I just needed the chance to move on and potentially meet a person who can show me what real love is. (Yeah I know, sounds cliche.)

Other things I can share about myself is, that I am not working out, but I am neither fat or skinny. Tho I would start fitness cuz I want to get in a better shape. My voice is not too deep, but it’s not like I sound like a girl or anything. XD  
I keep basic hygiene like brushing my teeth and showering. I dress good and I am an average looking kind of guy.  
I am insecure about many things and I am lucky to have a friend who encourage me to try my best.  
If you ask me if I would date myself, I probably wouldn’t because I don’t have much to bring on the table, beside affection.  
Sometime I feel lonely as I see how most of the people I know, either are in a relationship or they are getting married. Even friends who used to be depressed and alone like me, finally found someone in their lives. And they are happy. And I am happy for them as well cuz they deserved to be happy.

Like I mentioned earlier, I grew up without having much understanding about how relationships work, so I had to read a lot of stuff and watch a lot of videos to understand the dynamic.  
I know that if I don’t feel happy and whole by myself, then a relationship with another person is not going to make me feel like I am complete or anything. The other person only adds to the whole life I already have. And this pretty much made me realize that I am not even ready to be in a relationship, since I don’t even have my shit together. Not to mention that I can’t find another woman in my life, that would make me fall in love. Most women out there are either taken, or uninterested, so I just gave up on the idea of having a relationship at all.  
I know that most women are attracted to a guy who is a positive person, confident, knows what he wants, and has his goals.  
I guess I lack confidence and I am not always positive. But I had gone trough a lot of crap so I don’t exactly feel like a winner in life.

Anyway, I don’t ask for advice or anything. I just felt like sharing a little story so you, the reader, can better understand how I feel. Perhaps share your story if you’ve gone trough the same experience as I have. I would read how you dealt with it. And would be very happy if right now you are in a good place in your life.",27Oct2020,1

85,"I haven’t had sex since high school in which I had 5 partners, and can’t remember how many I’ve fooled around with. I peaked in high school in my own personal sexual arena. (Not much of a peak Ik) There was a few things that happened to me physically (more mentally)  that caused me to lose a lot of charisma and social abilities. I could go into a novel about why but it’s irrelevant now. 

So why is the US so dead set on no prostitution? Is it to stomp down people who are in a tough spot socially and mentally?

86,"I've had seizures since \~2009 but 2016 was when I had my first major one.  The thing with seizures is, there is an instant snap between the start of it, and the waking up from the end of it.  When you sleep, there is a low level of consciousness where you can approximately tell how much time has passed.

When I finally regained consciousness I didn't have my glasses on as a safety measure by the EMTs, and I was still out of it, so I could barely see.  What I could see though, were the outlines of the medics in their standard dark blue/black uniforms.  They had propped me up against a wall, so I was sitting upright.

So, I was functioning suddenly normally and then suddenly I'm sitting upright while people in dark suits are standing around me.  I literally thought they were the CIA and I had been kidnapped, and I started to panic.

87,"I (23f) have had unhealthy relationships with food my entire life until these last couple years. I went from emotional binge eating disorder to bulimia. It wasn’t that hard of a change- I just began throwing up and was obsessed with feeling “empty”

Now I am healthy and people tell me I look amazing because I was always obese- morbidly so. 

I learned to control portions, eat for survival mentality and I stopped eating chicken/steak during the week just because my body did not crave it. 

A couple months ago I got employed and I noticed I am not back to my old habits as staying in quarantine affected my meal prep and cravings.

I’m back to choosing chips. I’m back to eating ice cream, cookies and great amounts at night when no one is looking. 

How can I bounce back?",27Oct2020,1
88,"I wouldn’t consider myself depressed but I haven’t been truly happy in 4 years. In September of 2016 it was my junior year in high school and I thought what the hell I’m tired of waking up early and going to school. I had lost most of my friends(was popular) when I got into an argument with someone and felt like I couldn’t go forward in that school. On my last day one of my closest friends who was almost a girlfriend but was never the right timing had moved back from a different state. She didn’t tell me but wanted to surprise me instead. If she would’ve told me I most likely would’ve stayed at that school. 

I ended up switching to a charter school where I would only go to school on Tuesdays and Thursdays. About a week into my charter school my cousin(who went to the school) convinced me to join the art club and SAC(Student Advisory Committee). In the middle of October I was having a great time and I was elected as treasurer of SAC. We were able to put together a trunk or treat and a few other things in my time as treasurer. I ended up getting a girlfriend and everything was going pretty good. Sometime in December I was talking to one of the people in SAC(she was 19 I was 16) just as a friend(let’s call her Ally) on Facebook. She told me her boyfriend said she was ugly but it seemed like she was flirting with me. It was kind of harsh but all I said was ""well you’re not *that* ugly”. 

The next morning I go to school and the counselor wants to talk to me. I go to talk to him and he asks me to leave SAC. I asked why and he said that Ally said I was sexually harassing her. I understandably got upset and started explaining what happened and even showed him the messages but he wasn’t hearing that. After word got around that I was ""sexually harassing” someone at school my reputation was tarnished. I lost my girlfriend and my cousin was the only one still on my side. I had stayed in art club but people there mostly didn’t talk to me. 

Come January my art club teacher recommended me for a leadership conference at Universal Studios and I decided to go. My now ex girlfriend went to and we stayed together the whole time after a night on the phone explaining things. I had a good time but after that she was distant. 

In May I decided to go to my old high school so I could get letters of recommendation from my old teachers. I went to a pep rally with my old friend and I think that was the last time I was truly happy. Just being with her and enjoying my time. I’ve tried so much to be happy but at the end of the day I’m just sad. I moved across the world and made new friends but I haven’t felt true happiness since that last day I spent at that pep rally. I often wish I didn’t switch schools and think what could’ve been. I just want to be happy but I can’t seem to find a way.",27Oct2020,1
89," I'm a 21-year old male, just failed my university degree out of maybe sheer neuroticism about myself and my place in the world. It's worth mentioning I was diagnosed with ADHD in late 2019 and suffered quite a bit of abuse / emotional neglect throughout my childhood. 

I'm a highly sensitive person, I feel very deeply about what I percieve to be the wrongs in the world, but I am finding that instead of being able to actually take the necessary steps to have an impact (e.g. get a job, get my degree, be a good friend and supportive of my peers), I am overanalysing every possible decision I have to make, and withdrawing from all social activities out of fear of judgement and hurting people. 

I'm at a point where I feel entirely ridiculous quite honestly. I'm at an excellent university, I've constantly been told I have great potential, but all I can think about is how I might do the wrong thing when I act. 

I think about a career in finance but then worry about being greedy, I think about a career in social work but then worry about not making enough money to build a family around, I think about being a musician but being too arrogant. It's horrible. I just want to move on in life in some clear direction, but all I can sense is that I'm going to fuck things up and somehow hurt someone, which I realise is equally ridiculous. I need to find some sort of moral middle ground, I've just got absolutely no clue whatsoever. 

TL;DR: Neurotic moralising inhibiting moving forward in life, need to find a path forward.

91,"The past couple of days I’ve been thinking about life. I was thinking about how they try to control us by the food that we eat, the music that we listen to and the internet. First about the food, they make it so we love junk food they purposely make them addicting and then we eat the junk food and we get addicted to it and then we get bad health when we do. Many of us don’t eat healthy food because it’s disgusting or it’s too expensive and many more reasons and we are already used to eating junk food that we don’t want to change. And when we do want to change and start eating healthy it is so hard to do because junk food taste so good and it keep pulling us back. The internet is bad because it is addicting and it is so hard for us to keep a active lifestyle because we keep getting pulled into social media and the internet.

92,"I've done some research on New Years resolution from a psychological perspective and kind of narrowed down reasons why they don't work. I also tried to find ways to be more effective in setting resolutions. Here are some reasons they don't work and how to combat them:

1. Failure to utilize the ""spark"". We often think of a resolution and then put off starting it for the new year. This time where you come up with your goal is the most important in starting and gaining momentum. When that motivation or spark diminishes its impossible to gain traction!
2. Failure to set attainable goals! We set massive goals from the comfort of a New Years party but don't realize that we will become overwhelmed. Its best to start off slow and then naturally allow the goals to become larger and larger.
3. Failure to set any goal structure! When we don't think about how we will achieve our goals we end up giving up before we even made any progress. In this YouTube video I go into more detail about this but basically you need to come up with a strategy that allows you to incrementally work on massive goals while also giving time for reevaluation.

96,"One of the more distinct memories about my childhood is that my mother collected anything related to cows. Mugs with cows on them (I remember a mug with a little cow figurine inside), sweaters, figurines, cow bells. 

I don’t know if cows were trendy back then or it’s just something she loved collecting. 

That’s all fine, I like collecting stuff too. What surprised me was her reaction when I brought it up.

Years and years later I suddenly remembered her love for cows. When I brought it up she shut down any further conversation about it. So of course I didn’t pry further, except for one time after that where I asked her why she refused to talk about it. She shut me down again and wouldn’t say why she wouldn’t talk about it. So I never brought it up after that.

My best guess is that she was mortified about it.
But I can’t help but wonder. She collected other things too but she will talk about those. Just not the cows.

I mentioned this before to someone and they seemed shocked. They said their mom was obsessed with collecting this another animal but they also don’t talk about it.

99,"Hello everyone,

I (24m) have been struggling with a drifting eye for many years and have seen it affect me in many aspects of my life particularly in dating.

To me, it seems much harder to be seen as attractive by the opposite sex if you have this condition. You could have abs, nice hair, and good style yet once people see the deviated eye that all goes out the window. It feels like this condition sentences you to a life of rejection or, at the very least, restricts you from reaching your full dating potential (I.e. having the confidence/attractiveness level necessary to attract a quality partner). 

I know that personality is a big deal in relationships, but I’m in my early 20s, where social media presence, good photos, and attractiveness is at a premium. 

I want to experiment like normal people do with hookups and flings, meeting new people and creating new memories. But it feels like I’ll just never get the chance. Sorry for venting, I’ve just been feeling helpless lately.

I always fail, of trying to fight my fear too... which is talking, making a conversation and making a friend... be it in real life and in this virtual world. 

I just...hesitate and then I would give up in the end because I'm just deeply afraid that I would encounter those people who'd hurt others for many reasons. Like how I encountered these four females a month ago in my workplace, the females who were my colleagues. At first, when I started that job- I was hopeful. My first wish before i started that job was to make 1 friend. But eventually I stopped being hopeful because these people were not it for me. After being targeted by these four females, I grew to feel more alone and have gained more cynicism and fear instead of strength from the abuse from these females. I have isolated myself even more. I have become more depressed and sensitive.

I joined that program, to have another go at fighting my fear of talking and start reviving my social skills that I lost years ago after almost 10 years of complete solitude and isolation in my room. From 12 years old me, to the 21 year old me today. 

In the end, I couldn't fight it. 

I'm still here, with this invisible tape on my mouth... and the invisible lock in my throat and voice box. While I'm back in my room, living in solitude again. Being completely frustrated and angry with myself for not winning this fight. For not making a single friend. For still being this loner loser.

121,"It's utterly inhuman out here. Hell, forget Saturdays, some companies even make you do some extra tasks on Sundays. Not to mention 8-10 hour days are the bare minimum. Not to mention the cyberpunk developers are apparently being more than adequately compensated for their overtime. We don't get anything for working our insane hours, we just get fired if we don't do it.

There's a million other things too. Work from home literally wasn't a thing here until the pandemic. Like, literally, only the top of the top executives could probably work from home and that's it. And even with the pandemic companies very begrudgingly put it into place. Hell, some in my city were still forcing people to come to work deep into April/May until the damn government had to step in. And now that the peak seems to have subsided for now, companies are already foaming at the mouth to shove people back into their cubicles. 

I asked someone who's a higher-up in an IT company why this was happening and he basically said 'Why should we let them work from home?! They'll just jack off and play games all day.' I said 'Well, as long as the work gets done about just as well as before then what bloody difference does it make?!'. He literally had no answer, just muttered something about not wanting to make it too easy for them.

This is the core of the problem. Companies WANT to make life difficult for employees because they think that means they're working the hardest and if they're happy it means they're not working as hard. They still haven't caught on to the radical concept that the west has realised long ago which is that HAPPIER EMPLOYEES=MORE PRODUCTIVITY. It's such an obvious win win but they're just ignoring it and sticking to ancient ideas.

I know these problems aren't just here of course. The west also does have this to a certain extent sure and hell countries like China and Japan seem to have it even worse than us. But I just wanted to make my voice heard because it really frustrates me when I see this outpouring of support and concern for the cyberpunk guys while we're out here suffering to no end. 

Sorry for the rant but it's just.......as if the heat, pollution, traffic, violence, hate, strife, poverty, and a billion other things weren't bad enough, we're forced to run one of the most inhuman, demanding rat races ever just to put food on the table. With sociopathic assholes for managers and dystopian nightmares of companies. They don't see us as humans. They see us as just another cell on their productivity spreadsheets, one which can be replaced with an identical one in a flash should the numbers even barely sag.

Nobody cares about us. The world doesn't care about us. There's no outrage for us. There's no support for us. There's nobody coming to rescue us. And please spare me the 'YOU should do something about it!!!!' I'm just a guy. What the hell can I do besides just make a post about it and let it all out so it's a little more bearable for a while. Raise awareness or whatever? Forget about it. The only thing people are concerned about in this country is which celeb is going out with someone and that's it...

There's places out there that have 1 month mandated vacation time, 4 hour work days, 4 day work weeks and shit.......and I'll probably never get to any of those places because the amount of work to even try to make it there with all the ironclad immigration policies anywhere worth going.... especially on top of all the impossible work I have right now.....well, why don't I just shoot myself and get it over with?",27Oct2020,1
