0,"It's not the same place where I was sexually assaulted, but it's the same general area.


Last October, someone I considered a friend, talked me into going to this nature park and because I thought he was a trustworthy person (everyone thinks he is) I went with him. This is a nature park that's far outside the city, people sometimes go there for picnics and whatnot. I've been there before with family myself.

What I didn't see coming was him attempting to rape me, stop because of whatever reason (we were in the middle of nowhere, I don't know why he stopped), only to proceed to confess his love and attraction for me and try to kiss me and then refuse to take me back. Well, all of that happened. I was ready to put up a fight or just walk all the way back to the nearest place I could get help from, but he was then convinced to take me back. Still, that's the place where I got sexually assaulted and even hearing the name of the place made me feel molten metal in my stomach until very recently.

I can proudly say that not only did I got out of the trauma a stronger person than I was before, but today I went back to the place with my boyfriend and close friends. I had a lot of fun and didn't think ""this was the place I was assaulted"". I couldn't even identify where it had happened. All I did all day was eat junk food, have a lot of fun with people who care about me and wouldn't let me down like others did. 

If I was a bigger person, I would also thank the person who assaulted me. I would thank him for making me question everyone around me, feel like every person ever is an enemy, and nobody is trustworthy. Because that feeling lead me to reach out and get back in touch with the only person I ever felt I could trust unconditionally. 

I am now engaged, I walked out of my abusive household, currently can't afford therapy but I live with someone who I know would never leave me all alone. I know that even if we broke up, he would be there for me when I need it, and I feel safe with him. I feel loved, cherished, cared for, and safe.

All because of that one catalyst event. One of the worst things that ever happened to me, leading to some of the best memories I now have. Life is so weird.

Tl,dr: I went back to the place where I was sexually assaulted, but only to form new and happy memories with all the great people I have around me now.",29Jun2020,2
3,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

4,"I was at a cousin's place and i (and a couple other people) joked/teased her about not knowing how to speak our native language. She said she can and i said ok speak it without any english words for next 10 mins. She speaks a sentence in the language and i correct a word and jokingly said see you can't speak it. 

Maybe i came across the wrong way, although i clearly meant to do it all in a joking manner, but she was upset by that and went to a different room. I realized it after she came back and as i was apologizing to her, she started crying and went away again. Now, i am bad at social stuff so tried to go after her but seeing that someone else went to console her, i didn't want her to get upset again seeing me. So i sent a text saying how sorry i was and never meant to hurt her.

Anyways, after all that was over and i was riding home, i just couldn't stop thinking about it. Like, my whole day was because i feel like shit. I know i am the asshole yet a part of me feels that she got unreasonably upset at a small joke. I hate this part of me thinking why the fuck would she just go ahead and ruin the whole day for us all for a relatively small matter.

I just wish i can be someone who doesn't get hurt over small things and stops caring too much about what others think of me.

Idk man i am just ranting. I am socially awkward and too blunt for my own good. I say shit as it comes to my mouth (a lot of times it's just trying to get a laugh out of people to get them to like me). Fuck, i just feel like going away somewhere far off and live on my own, away from all these complicated relationships because clearly i can't act like a fucking adult.

Anyways, thanks reddit for being a place where i can vent.",29Jun2020,1

7," I think for most my life, I haven’t loved myself.

Now, in brief moments, I’m feeling love creep in.

I looked at my face in the morning and saw one worth holding. With lips worth kissing, a jaw worth caressing. I saw hair worth ruffling and hair worth admiring. I saw eyes that were gentle, and also understanding—eyes that seeked not just to see you, but to allow you to be seen.

I looked at my body this morning and saw one worth holding. A body capable of cuddling, but also capable of strength—of climbing, hiking, running. A body capable of jumping and laughing and singing and breathing and loving and breathing.

I am loving myself today. I do not always do that.

There are a million lessons &amp; songs &amp; lives &amp; paintings I want to build out of this moment. I know it may not be back tomorrow. 

There are a million books I could write from this feeling. I’m not going to write a million books—today, I’m not going to write a single one. 

Today I will read the only book worth knowing. Today I will hold this love to my chest, without interrogation.

And maybe—just maybe—if I hold this love tight enough, I will remember it. Then, I can love a million worlds.",29Jun2020,2
8,"and it makes me question the point of dating and relationships. the thought of marriage makes me feel tied down. and the thought of long term relationships scare me because I’d have invested so much time into a relationship knowing that they’ll get bored or ill eventually get bored. it also scares me out of having kids. because i know that one day ill wake up and i won’t want them around me. i can’t see myself committing myself to another person’s wellbeing for 18-25 years. 

and maybe this is commitment issues (?). but when im in relationships i want them to stick around, i want to be with and around them, sometimes i might think about stuff in the long term (2-4 years). and i don’t cheat, ever. i don’t even think about it. still, i know that eventually ill get bored and feel under-stimulated and end up leaving.",29Jun2020,106

13,"Recently I’ve been seeing a lot of men and women come out and have the courage to speak about their abusers and uncomfortable encounters. 

This has motivated me to speak about one of mine.

I was probably 19 at the time and his name is Austin. He worked out at the same gym I did and I always found him attractive. I wanna say he was like 27 or something around the time, which wasn’t an issue for me because I was always interested in older men.

I think he pursued me through Instagram initially and then had the courage to speak to me in person at the gym. We started talking through text message and Snapchat. It was all going well and he was never pushy about anything and was asking me question to get to know me and everything. Everything was going well as he didn’t request to see each other outside of the gym for a few weeks of texting back and forth and talking a little at the gym. Eventually though he asked me to come over and watch a movie. I told him I would but that nothing would happen. I don’t remember him saying anything to that statement. 

I drove over to his house after the gym and he greeted me outside, which was nice. I went inside his place which was nice and we talked for a little bit then went into his room to watch a movie. He told me I could sit on the bed (I should’ve know by now). He starts the movie and I can’t even remember how long we watched it until he pulled me close to him, my butt up against his groin. I didn’t say anything, I wasn’t even sure what was going on. Then he turned me around and started to undress me. He didn’t even take my bra off. I didn’t do anything or say anything, I just laid there. I don’t know why I didn’t say “no” or why I didn’t get up and walk away. But I do know that he was tall, and muscular, and owned guns and I didn’t know a lot about him. But I do know that I didn’t say no, I drove there, I didn’t fight it &amp; I let him undress me. He didn’t wear a condom and he finished quickly. I cleaned myself up and I left. The worst part is though, that I noticed a picture of him and a pretty woman next to his bed. And it was a big place for just one person and there were cameras in the corners of the ceiling in the bedroom. And that he didn’t kiss me once during the whole encounter.

I wouldn’t say that I was r*ped. Or even compare myself to the AWFUL situations many women endured. But it was weird. He messaged me that night and I didn’t respond. Then he texted me a little while later and asked what happened and I told him I wanted something meaningful with someone else. Then he never spoke to me again and blocked me on all social media. It was weird. And uncomfortable. And I don’t know how to feel about it. 

This wasn’t my first sexual encounter ever, I was experienced. I was comfortable with men and that didn’t change after this experience. I pushed it out of my head and never really thought about it again until recently. I don’t think he was trying to force me or hurt me (he didn’t physically hurt me). And he wasn’t angry when I told him I wouldn’t see him again. But I do know is he was and is a scumbag. If I had a way to tell his girlfriend what he did, I totally would.",29Jun2020,1
14,"Hey,

I just need to let this out because I feel like an asshole by feeling this way. My girlfriend's mum passed away two months ago, very unexpectedly. She has since sunk into depression and hasn't been the same. Of course I understand that losing a parent sucks, that the grief process is long and that it's normal that she feels like shit. But I still miss her. I miss her smile, her laugh, her memes, her silly jokes, idk just the little things. The pandemic makes everything worse too, because I can't see her, hug her, kiss her, etc.

I know it might be a while before she starts going back to normal again and it's totally fine - I'm trying to be there for her as much as I can. But today she sent me a text, saying she feels she is losing me, and I got so sad because I feel it's the other way round, that I'm losing her, because as loving and caring and present as I am, nothing will make her feel better, and I feel as though she is irritated by me sometimes, because she can get so distant. Idk maybe I'm being selfish, but it's sad how much I miss the old her. I'm even crying as I'm writing this, it just feels so shitty.

Of course I don't trouble her with these things because I don't want to be a burden to her. I know eventually things will pass and that I have to be there for her (I want to be there for her and support her) but I feel like we're miles away.

After being single for some time in realize that I simply enjoy my time alone. At times it can suck just..having my thoughts. But after what I’ve went through with my last couple relationships, I’m good on dating. I keep getting more and more insecure every time I’m cheated on. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I feel like I have an idea. I’m taking time to try to improve certain things about me, in this time of solitude 

But being cheated on is always more embarrassing for me than heartbreaking at times. I feel like I’m being fucked with. I feel like I’m seen as some little disposable joke. It’s embarrassing and my self esteem takes a hit all the time. 

I don’t think I want to do this ever again for the rest of my life. I think at 22, this is a good decision to go ahead and seal in. Maybe I can get my fucking shit together instead of focus on something im clearly not cut out for.",29Jun2020,2

24,"I was standing in front of the mirror in my bedroom, and I was making silly faces in the mirror to help calm my anxiety.

Then I had this idea to make the reflection, in the mirror, talk to me as if it were *another* person talking to me. I figured I could be my own friend this way.

So, though it was only me making facial expressions and talking (thinking) to myself, I immediately felt as if the reflection in the mirror was someone else talking to me. 

This realisation surprised me and so my facial expressions changed to that of surprise. 

And for just a few moments... I felt strongly that the image in the mirror was mocking my emotions. 

So although I was really looking at this face -&gt; 😯
I interpreted the reflected expression as some sort of demon, mocking me, with this face -&gt; 😱

Creepy emotions immediately began to overwhelm me and my heart started racing starring at myself. (Fight or flight kicked in)

I had to step away from the mirror entirely just to calm down.

30,"At around 12:42 AM today I got up from bed needing to pee really bad, so I walked over to the bathroom and turn on the light; Lo and behold it’s a tiny fucking roach, he was about the size of a Lima bean but a little bigger. I recognized this fucker, About a week before I saw that bastard scurrying into a crack near the wall before I could rain my sweet golden lava upon him. That bitch knew I wouldn’t let him get away. This time I succeeded, albeit sloppily. I aimed my pecker at him and unleashed a hose of piss on him, he got fucking drenched. As I pissed on him he scurried around frantically, but wasn’t smart enough to hide in the crack he hid in last time. After like 2 seconds of peeing on it I decided, maybe I’ll aim for the bowl now and stop getting piss all over the tile floor and the wall. But I had more in me, and he hadn’t retreated yet. The roach, now covered in urine, was literally just standing still under my legs. I directed the remaining pee pee at him to further embarrass that stupid roach and make him regret ever rearing his ugly head in my domain. After that I decided enough was enough and picked him up with a piece of toilet paper and threw that motherfucker in the ‘bowl. He now lays silent in a watery grave. 

So yeah, today I pissed on a roach. Not much of an achievement but I’m glad that one more roach is dead in this world.",29Jun2020,1

We go and meet the guy on a subway station as the train comes this guy tries to throw away his movie ticket but i take it and give back to him then we have to switch trains so we are waiting and this guy try the same thing again and i give the it back to him at this point he tears the ticket into pieces and give it to me and goes into the train and leaves .
So i show the the girl what he has done and she burst into tears and starts crying and starts saying some thing in Japanese ( weird since the just meet the day before  )so i tell her to calm down and say that i don't know Japanese and there are no subtitles she gives  me a smile so i tell her that i wanted to learn Japanese and if she teach me i will help her with her English ( this took place in Japan) she agrees and we go home , and then everything is white (like i just got flash banged) and then i see myself in helicopter and i have left her a note which says that i want her to remember me as i would not .the end

He left before they got there, so they couldn’t arrest him , and he left me stranded in a city we were vacationing in about 100 miles from home. I just don’t get it.

Couple (Mum and Dad) have been doing an extension to their house for the last 8 weeks. Had a baby 4 weeks ago. Father (we'll call him Father) of one of the couple along with Dad have been doing the extension. The father is a builder and male isn't and works full time in a different industry (now currently at home because of COVID-19). Father has been working throughout helping the couple with their extension. Dad works full time as a senior professional in a demanding role. 

Father is double the age of Dad. Dad has been looking after the baby throughout the night feeding the baby, whilst still working, as Mum is poorly. Couple are staying with Father and Mother whilst extension is underway. 

Should the Dad lay in on the weekend mornings and follow the Father to the house a couple of hours later (8.30am Father start 10am Dad start) to catch up on sleep missed throughout the night with feeding the newborn? Or should he feel embarrassed if he does that and go up with the Father and help out?

42,"Hi. I would like to ask if anyone of you had experienced recollecting a memory that never happened? I was not bothered about it at first but it happened again twice today and thats when i am now totally confused. First, i remembered about having romance with my bf using condom when we were like 2 months within the relationship (we are now 1 yr and 7 months). I told him we did not like it that was why we never used condom again. He then became mad at me because he said we never did try using a condom. I laughed at him as to how he did not remember it because in my memory it was him who told me to get his condom inside his bag which i did. But he got upset because he said it never happened and that i am remembering the event that happened with my ex. I find it weird and confusing because i thought it was him who did not remember it. However, he was really sure that it never did happen and so i brush it all off to avoid fighting with him. Later i keep on thinking about it and i said to myself that maybe i did remember it wrong. And now, just today, he was talking about how his niece always want to go out of their house. I told him it is expected since his niece (4y.o)has a mole on her feet (base on our belief here, if you have a mole on your feet you tend to be someone who always want to go out, travel, or just someone who would not stay inside the house). My bf told me then his niece don't have a mole on her feet. I'm dumbfounded because i remember seeing it once and teasing her how she would be wanting to be outside of the house always. Im currently doubting myself. Was my memory wrong? Why do i have those kind of memories? Where did i get it? Did i jumble the events on my memory and maybe it happened but i remembered the wrong people? Is this some kind of a symptom and im sick? I don't know.

- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie.

47,"I'm 22 years old, recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering.

Ever since I was little I've always wanted to become one of those scientists that 'change the world' and win science awards. I originally planned to work in R&amp;D for a few years, and then opt for furthuring my MSc overseas. I've always liked studying and thinking of getting into academia. I love travelling too so I hope to work where I would be doing my MSc and have a life there. (Preferably Japan or Korea, I have basic Japanese fluency but am learning everyday to become fluent one day, also I have always loved Japan and been dreaming of the experience to live there.)

But on other days, I see people making money while travelling and living their lives, some are entrepreneurs and some digital nomads. I'm not skilled in any digital professional field but I am looking into learning them (and seeing if I enjoy them) and from there start to market my skills to make 6 figures while I travel and enjoy the daily life of a digital nomad.

There was even a moment where I thought of doing a teaching program to teach English in Japan like Jet programme,  (would waste my engineering degree, but I've always liked English and languages) but it would require me some money first (hence, work first) then I could see myself actually living there as an English teacher and maybe one day come back and teach at my home country when I'm ready to migrate back. 

Let's just say there's an amount of jobs I've applied to, even fields that are unrelated to engineering because I just want to move out and start earning on my own. And the companies that called me are the ones that are related to sales, marketing and real estate that I've applied to all because I saw 'No experience required' and as I said I've always liked learning things and studying, so I was prepared for anything as long as they train me, oh and plus those companies offer travelling opportunities which is also why I applied. -Which what made me start to look into online courses and certificates on sales and digital marketing.

So that's about it, I'm at crossroads. I feel slightly sad if I choose the sales path, I won't be able to return to science and there would be like a black hole if I were to apply for postgraduate studies overseas then. One path leads to another.
I'm just putting this here for some advices.
I find it hard to choose which path to take because I'm having a hard time to decide what I really want to do because I really wanted to study and live abroad, but no one from the r&amp;d/engineering companies have called me and some rejected me when I called them to follow up. So I thought should I just go wherever that I can make money then travel when I want? It's all just so confusing to me. Some insight would help.",29Jun2020,1

54,"Hello (Blank for privacy reasons). I'm sorry for leaving you hanging. That's not what I should have done and I should have explained, but I didn't have the words. My friends and my girlfriend have encouraged me to talk to you, because I thought that naturally, we would just drift off if I wouldn't answer anymore like I do with most people, thinking that we weren't that close.

I've told you before, that I can't be all that committed to friendships that are outside of my comfort zone. I know you are struggling with issues of your own, and I am deeply sorry for any mental troubles I've caused you, I felt uncomfortable, especially with our vast differences in our beliefs and our views on certain things. 

You are a great guy, and an amazing friend to other people--I know you are. You helped me in search for a job, and I thank you for that. But I think that we, as friends, are not a great match. I feel albeit uncomfortable, and we've talked about this before, so I thought things would naturally run their course this time.

I'm sorry if all this feels patronizing or condescending, or as if I am provoking you. That is absolutely not my intention. I'm sorry that you are only getting this long overdue message now. I really do not wish upon you any unnecessary ""drama"", and I wanted to make my intentions and my purpose as clear as possibly can, so there would no longer be any room for any misunderstandings. What I say here, is all that there is, and no deeper reason for them. I hope we can part ways peacefully afterwards. 

With all this said, I want to make it clear that these are all problems on my part, and never yours. I am the one that suddenly disappeared, and I am so sorry for that. I have no excuse. You did nothing wrong, you said nothing wrong, it was simply just about my choices, and the kind of company I prefer in my life.

If you have any anger or words to tell me, you can say them, to me or to anyone, it is okay. But I will not answer nor see your messages in the meantime, as I want to distance myself right now.

I wish for your continuous success and good health, overall.",29Jun2020,1

58,"Before anyone clicks away, I'd like to say that this is a positive post. This is me still trying to pay my dog back for everything he's done for me. Read it or don't, I just needed to say thank you for all he did for me.

Alright, with that out of the way, I'll start with a bit of backstory.

Oh, and this: I'm currently 17, nearly 18, living with my sister, and avoiding as much contact with my parents as possible.

My parents (mother and stepfather) were abusive emotionally, physically, and, in my mother's case, sexually. I grew up surrounded by animals, and, me, along with my 3 siblings, were expected to take care of them. We had a dog named Roxie, who did too fucking much for me to put into words in anything less than an emotionally charged text wall (she was more of a mother to me than my biological mother) so she's not going to be the focus of this post.

When I was 7 or 8, we got a dog who mh mother named Bozz, and this is where the story begins.

We were fostering Bozz, and his two brothers and one sister when they were puppies, and we all fell in love with Bozz (A black and tan Coonhound, Pitbull mix, who was mistaken for a Rottweiler)

My mom paid to adopt him, and from there, things only got better.

Bozz imprinted on me, cause I slept with the dogs on the floor when we had all of them, and basically became his only brother left after they were separated.

Needless to say, I loved this dog, and he loved me.

After the joy of a puppy wore off, however, my parents went back to their old ways, and started cussing me out, berating me, and beating me for the simplest of shit (like not doing the dishes before bed)

Bozz, I could tell, got very uncomfortable watching this, got scared, and would go hide under the table.

One day, however, Bozz decided my parents had taken it too far, when he could tell they were absolutely livid over me not doing my chores, and he stepped between my mother, her belt, and me, and stood, silently, staring her down.

She yelled at him to move, and he just stood there, while I hid my face. I heard her getting more and more pissed, and eventually she backed off, cursing the dog for getting in her way.

Later on, as I'd be sent to bed, crying (on way too may occasions to count), he'd scratch at my door a few times a minute, until I got annoyed enough to let him in.

He'd heard my stepdad come in the room when I was crying and yell at me to ""man the fuck up"", before ""[giving me] something to cry about""

Night after night, until it became a habit to let him into my room before I entered, he would keep this up, and sleep between me and the door.

One night, my mother came in, fuming about the dishes again, with a knife in her hand, shouting something about being *almost* pissed off enough to stab me.

Bozz was immediately standing up, growling at the door, before she even got there, and just got louder as she opened the door.

She once again cursed him out, and told him to ""get the fuck out, you stupid fucking mutt"", but he didn't care, she started walking toward me, fixing the knife in her grip, and he adjusted into a clear pounce stance, and barked a warning, which she ignored, waving the knife at him in a threatening gesture, and he lunged.

He bit her in the arm, near the wrist, and didn't let go for a solid 5 seconds, and she dropped the knife, grabbed his collar, ripped him off of her arm, and threw him out of the room.

She turned to me, and in a rage-seething voice that still haunts me, just said ""Get up. Do the god damn dishes, and do it now, or I..."" she stopped herself and gave me her regular psychopathic glare, before leaving my room, and slamming the door shut.

After a few seconds of the shock setting in, I hear her shout again, and Bozz is in the living room, yelping and screaming in pain, all the while I'm in my room just fucking crying, unable to muster up the strength to do for my dog what he did for me. He took a fucking beating for me, and didn't give a fuck.

In conclusion, this dog has saved my life plenty of times, and I could never pay him back for it.

He died prematurely at 4 and a half years old of severe kidney failure, when I was around 13, and yet every day he stood up for me, and refused to show that he was weakening. To this day, I carry around a picture from the beginning, and end of his life, and I never forget what that god of a dog has done for me.

I can never say just how much I loved him, and how little I deserved him, but for anyone who read this all the way through, I hope you can find your own Bozz, to stick with you through the absolute hell of your life, and sacrifice themselves for you. I just hope you can be stronger than I was, and do the same in return.",29Jun2020,1

I became choked up and had to take a minute to compose myself. Now I’m siting here analysing the shit out of it.

There seems to be no middle ground, it was either a big mistake or the best thing I could have said.",29Jun2020,1
60,"I am going to admit to something. Not begging for attention, but hoping for understanding.

I have no functional capacity or comprehension of how to initiate any type of conversation. I know how, and I give some good advice about it, but my mind is blank and fuzzy when I try myself.

When I do, I fade out into a whisper and retreat because I don't have the slightest clue if I am doing something wrong, nor have I ever. I actually mean literally ever. I have never, ever initiated a conversation. The only friends I have ever had literally walked up to me, and said hello. Not only saying hello, but inviting me to things that gave me days or weeks just to understand what I'd be prepared for.

I've been in crowds. I'm fine in them, and it's not anxiety. I simply don't comprehend how to start. I used to say I'd never speak to anyone if I were stranded on a desert island with them unless they spoke to me. I will never learn from a person telling me how. I've read books on the subject of conversations, and starting them. This has been my entire life, and it will likely be the entire remainder.

I have never once, in all my years breathing on this Earth, spoken first to anyone who wasn't behind the counter at a store I was shopping at. In fact, those end up being my hangout places. Where I'm actually capable of talking to people.

So, if you've ever thought to have me meet someone, or imagined it would work out. You're absolutely wrong, and there is nothing that can be done about that. I've accepted the fact that I live vicariously long ago. I accept, or deny friendships. That is one of the primary reasons I have had so few. My mother was the person who made many of them for me, and I fell into my sister's friends as well.
I won't say that I'll never have the capacity, I suppose because people are all different, and eventually I'll find, as I do, ways to pique interest enough to have someone else start talking to me. I will however, state the fact that I have never been capable. The one person I pride myself on speaking to first, actually saw me skate by a few times and offered to let me play kickball. We were then invited to eat, maybe because I was a new person.

I'm good at concerts, and I can be a damned tank when I'm getting someone through a crowd as they're experiencing a panic attack. (So can Corkey, that little fireball had a mouth on her and she would have beaten one of those people if they hadn't moved as I carried our friend out.) I'm also fine with friends I've actually fallen into, because silence can be accepted.

I'm capable of making decisions if someone asks me a question. That's all I've ever done, as it's all I've needed to do. Years ago, through all my life and even when I had started smoking weed, my mind trailed of into thinking about chemical processes, physical traits of the universe and stuff like that. I lost myself in realistic memories and never thought about anything other than what we may be able to learn together when I was with friends.

I don't know what caused or causes the way that I think, but I've never once pursued sexual relationships either. I've actually actively avoided them at times. I was the person who thought about cat videos and memes before YouTube and memes were the thing. When it was flash videos and animations. I occasionally worried about new pairs of roller-blades because my old ones started rubbing too much.

I've been the type of person who's thoughts while with people are guided by emotion, and solely that. I think about how to prolong happiness and quell or ease sadness and pain. I understand one mood, if vibrant enough, can become that of everyone in a group, and it's something I miss about my friends. When I needed to, I stepped away with a single individual, helping them through something because they needed it, and there was a noticeable change in everyone's attitude as a result of how they were.

I think that may have been learned from the way hospitals ended up treating me when I was younger, as they saw no real problem with me most of the time, and they just had me work with other patients they though needed me. Maybe that's the kind of conversationalist I was nurtured to be. The one who approaches out of broken necessity.

I will always make my strange, and often unscheduled stops and visits to where I've made memories, or places I enjoy being. I guess I'll also just have to put up with certain people giving me looks because I dress to be comfortable with myself when I have no others to be comfortable for.

I wanted to say this, because it worries me that I do want to be around people, and I'll continue to try. It only seems, now that I'm returning to where I was most happy, both around town and in my beliefs, more noticeable and worrisome that I only respond, instead of initiating conversations. I've had officers stop me, and I always know why they check my bag. They always leave me with suggestions for it, never anything bad. Nothing like, ""Get a new one."" Usually something like, ""Get a safety vest for your bag so you don't get hit by another car.""

On the subject of my bags, I've had compliments from cops. It's actually kinda cool. Everything I have with me at any time is useful on a daily level, but without a car, need to be directly on my back. I have no issue with that. I'm pretty strong. I keep food, drinks and snacks in my bags, which keeps me that way.",29Jun2020,1

I go to a school miles from my house and non of my friends live near me, the kids who do live near me don't come out anymore and my school friends are too far away to see in the free time we have. I mention this because recently my dad kind of said I don't have any friends and my mom said I don't really have a life. Whether they said this jokingly or not I still feel funny about it. It has been a sort of reality check for me, I guess, and I can't stop thinking about that. I may be overreacting but this has just been playing on my mind and it makes me feel as if my parents just don't like me. I know they don't see me with my friends and to them they may just see their son as an introverted teen but it still felt like a kick in the teeth when they said those things.

64,"I had a last appointment to get travel expenses for my new job with my job advisor who I'd been going to for 6 months. I'd never really got on with her in recent times as I used to just keep my head down rather than saying hello to her and I always felt she hated me tbh.

I got a new job and I told my new job that id been in a temporary work placements the last 6 months rathery than being with that advisor the last 6 months as I said (because they didn't want to see too many gaps in unemployment, I lied) and my advisor (who didn't know tbh) contacted my new job to confirm my employment, and then my new manager questioned me about where I actually was the last 6 months ( I nearly got sacked) I emailed my advisor angry about it and her responses were her mad to on the defensive she replied with things like ‘I will not contact you again now if this is what you prefer’ and ‘I’m sorry you are unhappy about this but I do wish you well for the future’ etc. but but I quickly apologised as I realised she didn't know I lied I replied ‘ok sorry to make a fuss’ and she didn’t reply. 


Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. 


Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass at her desk. so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?'

A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll stay in contact yby email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got a job.",29Jun2020,1

I am overbearing with the use of “I love you”. I’ve lately gotten in the habit of being annoyingly sappy with it too. I often just walk up to him, no matter what he’s in the middle of, and demand he love on me.

I don’t know if he hates it, loves it, is annoyed by me, or simply doesn’t care. What I do know is he doesn’t complain. He’s never said “not right now”. He’s never turned me away. He’s never appeared annoyed by it. My wonderful husband takes the moment, however long or short, and makes me the center of his world.

My heart is so full. I love my husband so much and clearly he loves me enough to show it whenever I feel I need it (which is often...). Even if we’re out running errands and I suddenly feel the need for a kiss or hug or tender touch in some way, he’s willing.

72,"Having periods sucks. Mine have always been awful in the pain department and I’ve never been able to figure out how to deal with it. Last night I was woken up by the worst cramps I’ve ever felt, the kind that make you writhe because staying still makes you think about it too much. I know people have it worse than me. Some people can’t get out of bed with their pain. I can always force myself to.

I got on birth control at 16 to help with cramps and hopefully make the process easier to track (via the pill pack) and easier to handle. Still, every month, I was sick for a week. Exhausted, in pain, unwilling to do anything. I tried other pills and had various side affects and now, at almost 19 years old, I’ve discovered that one hormone in birth control gives me painful mouth sores and the other is causing a lump to form in my breast that will have to be surgically removed if it gets any bigger.

So hormonal birth controls seem to be a no-go.

My sister told me about an IUD with no hormones, but after some research I’ve learned that it makes periods worse, not better. That’s fine if the purpose is not wanting to get pregnant, but I want some relief. 

I’m just a mess. The fact that I don’t want to have children, but still have to suffer from a bodily function solely for making children just really hit me hard as I lost half my sleep last night.

This is a very long story, read it if you want to be entertained, not all aspects are important to the question. 

To start with I’m not complaining about their friendships at all, I’m complaining about myself cause I can’t help but feel like a horrible human being. 

Right so basically, we were born in the same year and in the same block, her mom was, and still is, one of my moms best friends, her grandpa was my dads Dr and also his workout buddy, her dad also developed a very close relationship with my dad as well. We’d spend all time together, if she wasn’t playing at my house, I’m playing at her house. Because I was born in October and she in January, she joined Kindergarten earlier than me, but in my kindergarten we had a system in which the smarter students would be boosted to the upper class, I basically only spent 2 weeks in KG1. I used to be scared of the older student so I was always by her, my mom had a picture of me tugging behind her in the playground. Of course because of the war in Iraq, both our families left the country, mine moved to Jordan, hers moved to Belgium, but our parents kept in touch, we didn’t. 

So we basically grew between the ages of 3-6 together, maybe before that and I don’t remember.

The next time I saw them, was when I was 13ish, my parents had visited them before and the next time, they took my brother and I with them, her parents were like family to me, I wasn’t awkward with them at all, in facts I’m less awkward with them than I am with my actual aunts or uncles. Her little sister also, despite the fact that the last time I saw her she was still a toddler, also felt familiar. However, with her, there was a lot of awkwardness, when our parents reminisced, we both pretended like we don’t remember anything, almost like we don’t know each other. I remembered everything they spoke about, but denied that, she would wait for me to say something and if I’m denying she’s denying with me. We did hangout eventually, she tried to teach my how to ride a bike, I still don’t know how to, and we would tease each other about or personal interests, cause she was obsessed with JB and One direction and I was more into house music. We didn’t reestablish our friendship if I’m honest, even though she didn’t change much, she was still the braver one as she was when we were little. 

Not two months later, they returned the visit to us in Jordan, when I saw them I had just returned from school, they had just gotten out of the pool, so when I came I went to go say hi to her mom (her dad didn’t come with them), and I completely ignored her even though she was right next to her and she was smiling, as I left I heard my mom say, “oh he probably just felt awkward cause you were in a towel he’ll come and say hi to you when you’re dressed.” That wasn’t really the case I just didn’t wanna say hi to her. In their visit, they would mostly hangout with my sister, I was mostly in my room either doing homework or playing video games, we would still tease each other from time to time, but she got a lot closer to my sister, which again I understand, puberty is awkward and it’s easier to hangout with other girls, but she wasn’t really avoiding me I was the one doing all the avoiding, in facts she once asked me to add her on Facebook, and I was refusing and she was like come on please, and I reluctantly added her then deleted her. Idk why I did that, maybe it’s the fact that I didn’t have a single girl in my friends list.

I’ve come to the realisation that I’m a complete asshole recently, I realised that all my siblings have her on social media and I don’t, even my brother who hates people my age, and my other sister whom I have no memory of them ever speaking. I was always the friends first type of guy, and I always say my friends are top priority and I will ALWAYS stick to them and try my best never to betray my friends or leave them behind. Now that I’m in university, am no longer the little misogynist I was as a preteen, I have a lot of girl friends as well as guy friends and I treat them the same. I always brag about the fact that all the guy friends I’ve had since I was in primary school are still my friends to this date, but I can’t help to feel like a hypocrite for leaving my first ever friend behind and cutting all connections with her, just because I was too stubborn to be friends with a girl back then. 

I just want my friend back, nothing else, but I feel like it’s too late now, at this point we are adults and what I might say might be misunderstood. 

How can I get my friend back, without sounding like a creep? Alternatively, is there a way I can let go without feeling so horrible about being such a shit friend and person in general.",29Jun2020,1

What I mean is for example in some cases of cancer where our body doesn't recognize the cells as tumoral and ignores them.

78,"Sure, I've been in love in the past, but I knew the relationships would never work long term. This guy was someone I had a friendship with for years. We did everything together, he really was one person I considered to be a true friend, he was always there for you when you needed him. In the last year, it just clicked that we had so much in common and we were attracted to each other deep down. So things grew from there. Even though we were close, I started seeing a different side of him, a darker, more negative side. 

I have to preface the rest of this story with the fact that he has mental issues (dont we all)? However, he was schizoaffective disorder with bipolar. Essentially it means he has some qualities of schizophrenia, but is largely based on the highs/lows of his bipolar. I always knew he was a little different, but never pressed the issue. He finally came clean to me about all of this about a month into our new relationship. He had been on medication for years and suddenly decided to stop taking it so it was causing his illness to become more prevalent. At first, it was that I was bugging his phone, then it was that I put poison in dinner. We would be okay for a while, then we would have a fight about something that happened months prior that we already resolved. I'm not gonna lie, it's hard. But I knew for a long time i loved this man. He was one of my closest friends and I respected him so much. When he wasnt feeling these problems, we were fantastic together in every form of the word. We were on cloud 9. Its been rocky, but we are communicating more and learning to not run every time theres a small issue.

Fast forward to about a month ago, we were laying in bed in the morning, just enjoying being lazy. He had recently started checking my phone. I know this is an invasion of my privacy, but the first rule of loving someone with SZA is showing them proof that their delusions are not real. I have nothing to hide, so I'm okay with it. He saw a random number in my phone and completely lost it and started screaming that I'm not going to play him. He then had his hands around my throat for 5 to 10 seconds before he stopped. Now, I do have to say, we arent PG in the bedroom, so hes choked me before, but only at that designated time. For him to just lash out of nowhere like that was shocking to me. He acted like he didnt know what happened until I finally got him to admit it. I've been a little more cautious and ""ready"" so to speak if it happened again.

This past weekend, we decided to do a day roadtrip out to the other end of the state, about 5hours each way. We were having a really good day. No real issues, just really enjoying each other. We are on our way back home with about 3 hours to go, and I run inside a gas station to get some food. He goes through my phone while hes waiting in the car and sees messages from someone I never respond to. When I get back to the car, he started getting aggressive and arguing. I'll admit, I was arguing back, but I was trying to calm it down at the same time. We started driving again and he got incredibly angry over something small (I had a salad in my lap) he threw it out the window and the next thing I know, I'm getting backhanded across the face. He then pulls over and takes off my seatbelt and started full on punching and elbowing my face. Square in the eye, nose, mouth, head. Just everywhere. I screamed for him to stop but he wouldn't. When he finally got off of me, he said ""you finally got what you wanted"" 
We were still 3 hours away from home and he was driving like crazy in the middle of the night. He had been mentioning suicide recently and I've been working on my own issues, so I was terrified we would veer off the road. He wouldn't let me go home, I had to go back to his place. By that time, he was really upset and crying and telling me how sorry he was. How could the one man I truly loved and could see myself with forever, beat me in my face? I just know it only gets worse. I have never even been punched in any form before. I've always said I'm a lover not a fighter. 

I'm not sure where to go from here. I know its partially on me because I knew he had issues but still stayed, because that's who I am. I empathize with everyone and I know it's something he struggles with. I told him I couldnt considering being with him, or even talking to him until he got help. He has supposedly left the state as of last night. I went to the ER just to get it documented and am working on filing a report. The local police cant help since it happened in a different city. I call 2 local police and visited one, and all gave me the same answer. 

I know he needs help, but how do you get past someone you love punching you? I KNOW that's not right and not acceptable, but my heart just can't shut off those feelings of missing him. People can change,  but they also can get worse. I'm just so lost and needed somewhere to vent. Thanks for listening and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",29Jun2020,2

82,"I am a sad person, I wasn't always this way. I was at one point an outgoing, charismatic person. I have lost touch with myself, and it has lead me to find comfort in my solitude. It is not truly solitude, as I am never alone. I have turned instead of inward, as I've tried to convince myself i had, towards external means of finding meaning. I have consumed countless videos, movies, video games, and books, trying to fill a void that comes from a lack of meaningful relationships, or experiences. I have sat idle as my life revs its engine ready to go, but have lacked the courage to put it in gear. I have become so withdrawn that I am intimidated by meeting new people, or seeing new things. I will go to drive thrus to avoid prolonged interactions. I convince myself it is so i can go back to ""seeking wisdom or exploring ideas"", but I am ultimately just entertaining myself with various forms of media. I have slowly cut off contact with most of my friends. The friends I do talk to I barely know anymore, and they hardly know who I have become. I hide the reality of my situation, and always have an excuse for missing an occasion. I feel uncomfortable in my own skin, and I am scared of the judgement that I feel is inevitable if I do start to meet people. The more time I have let pass me by the more I become scared to take a step out of the safety nets I have surrounded myself with. I am unreliable to rely on for any consistent amount of time, because I am scared I will reveal who I truly am. A sad lonely person, who is judgmental of others, so I don't have to be judged myself. Writing this now makes me think of how absurd it is to pass the judgement, that I myself am so deeply afraid of. I sometimes blame this withdrawal on the circumstances of my upbringing. An alcoholic mother, a tyrannical father, an abusive step father (not to me, but witnessing my mother receive it). A betrayal of my closest friend, who was a huge influence in the way I think, and approach the world. I outsource the problems in my life to circumstance, and an unstable upbringing, taking no accountability for how I have influenced my own life. I have become a heavy smoker. I have been on all kinds of drugs. I stopped drinking, because I didn't want to be like my mother, but slowly have made my way back to it. Now I smoke marijuana, and drink thinking I am happy until my sobriety inevitably returns. I have not wanted to nurture a relationship, because I have become selfish, unwilling to put effort into another person. I get mad easily now, and hold in anger to fuel my resentments. I have even become complacent to my dog, she no longer gets the attention she so desperately craves. I rationalize everything I do, based on my interpretation, or judgement of others. I am a sad person, but I won't always be this way.",29Jun2020,1

84,"I know this sounds weird, but hear me out. I've always wondered whether STD's can be transmitted among virgins. Before I sound any dumber, let me explain.

Let's imagine a situation where we have 60 adults (30 men and 30 women). They're all virgins and free from any STD's. Now, let's say MAN number 1 has sex with WOMAN number 1, and so does the other 58 people (with their respective partners). Then, every week they all have to switch partners and they can only choose someone among the 60 people I mentioned. So for example, during the second week, MAN number 1 has sex with WOMEN number 2, and everybody else follows. (Hopefully you get my point). After 30 weeks, all the men will have had sex with all the women, and all the women will have had sex with all the men.

Now, assuming all of them did anal and vaginal intercourse (the whole nine yards) and none them used condoms or any other sort of protection, is it possible that by the end of the experiment, some of them end up with an STD like HIV or something?",29Jun2020,1
85,"I took a 20 minute nap on my 15 minute break this morning. I'm about 10 weeks pregnant and have only in the last couple days started to ""acknowledge"" my pregnancy in my dreams. I was physically, and in dream, on our living room couch, same position.

I was asleep but in my dream I was still awake, staring at the ceiling as shimmering gold (3d)  blocks kinda danced around on the ceiling. Fluctuating and multiplying and shrinking and kinda slowly dancing and glittering their way towards me while staying on the kitchen.

Then my attention was broken from the blocks because my boyfriend walked in from the bedroom and sat at my feet, moving my legs to be on his lap. I was ""drifting off"" at this point and vaguely wondered if I had overslept when he had asked me to wake him up, and he was mad. (My boyfriend is not, nor has he ever been, abusive) I just kinda settled in more sleepy but I remember noticing at this point that the entire front of his body (he was shirtless) was purple except for his face and arms. It was likely someone took purple paint and started under his chin and covered everything down to his shorts, stopping at the shoulders.

I felt 2 fingers press down on either side of my throat, they were long and started putting pressure on the sides of my neck like they were trying to choke me. It felt like he was using his pinky and either his thumb or index finger to mock squeeze my throat. I went to take a deep breath and he shoved his two middle to he's a into my mouth so that I couldn't. Suddenly I couldn't breath, but I didn't want to give up, because I'm pregnant now and have more of a reason to live.

So I started biting down on the fingers, gradually increasing the pressure to try and get them to release. Eventually they cursed, pulled their hand out off of my throat and shook it, and then they were just gone.

I woke up (for real this time) and checked my timer. It had been 17 minutes since my break had started. My jaw *was not* sore as if I had bit hard on something, but I did vaguely feel like I had just regained a breath. My bf was still asleep in out room, door was locked, and the room was exactly as it had been before and during my dream.

This is not my usual type of dream, and it's got me a little puzzled. My boyfriend wants this baby just as much as I do, and has never shown signs of abusive behavior. I have no idea where this dream came from or what was going on with the gold shimmers and purple paint.",29Jun2020,1

91,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",29Jun2020,0

Here my story begins, I found myself in front of many choices with noone to tell me what to do. Some students ignored the grades and focused on student activities , some focused to be on top of class, some participated in competitions (coding, architecture, football, ...etc) some lived the moment and ignored all of that.

 Dominicans (in general) are known for being amazing at straightening very curly hair. There’s a lot to this I won’t get into right now, but basically to many of my family members, my natural hair texture looks unkempt and un-styled.

I don’t live with them anymore, but every time I go back to visit, my grandma makes comments about my hair being ugly. My uncle told me I would look more beautiful with straight hair. My dad and stepmom are always giving me advice on products I should try for my hair as they always think it looks too dry or frizzy.

While i was waiting for the results i was fine and excited and worried what would happen if they rejected me, but as soon as i got the good news that i was accepted I started outright panicking every day with stupid thoughts coming to mind- what if i go there and fail classes, what if i don’t like it, get sick, don’t meet any friends... it went as far as thinking about some soo specific problems which i am aware are unlikely to happen.

After years of dealing with fears of intimacy and relationships, I think I finally got over it after therapy. I actually want a relationship for the first time I can remember. I met a guy I thought was good for me. He’s sweet, great cook, and smart. We bonded a little bit over therapy since we had some similar things we were working on. It was the first time I let myself be vulnerable with someone. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out. 

He got scared from his past problems (some are ones I have dealt with). He has so many trust issues and an ex he hasn’t gotten over and it caused him to play games with me. I’m not mad at him anymore. I understand and I hope he gets help. We talked everything out so I feel I have closure from that situation. 

Our time together was short, but since it was my first time being this “new me” I had a lot invested in it. It’s ok it didn’t work out. It’s ok to feel sad for a lost chance. If there is someone like me reading this, I hope you stay hopeful. I know that this one try doesn’t mean I can’t have something great with someone else. Working on myself was the first step and finding a relationship that will make me happy will take time.

The ""In Europe"" part is very important. I believe BLM in the US is a great movement and blablablablabla.

My problem is with the European asshats protesting ""BLACK LIVES MATTER!!!"" in Milan. Or Paris. Or Berlin. It saddens me, really. Mostly because it feels like they're rising up against nothing but trying to feel good by doing it.

Let me explain: most of Europe doesn't have that much Black immigration. Yes, France has its old colonies and does have systemic racism against Blacks, so one could argue the Paris protests are fair enough. Buuuuuuuuuut the problem here is that it completely ignores the hugely widespread systemic racism against Arabs. But trying to fix the fact that Arabs in Paris are either convenience store owners, kebab owners or ""zonards"" isn't as sexy as protesting BLM I guess.

For Germany there's few blacks. There's a huge Turk population though. Turks that get discriminated against daily. But hey let's protest BLM on Alexanderplatz ! Low risk, high ego reward, no impact.

Italy has Roma issues, but yeah let's BLM all day long while saying we need to deport them!  How tolerant. How unracist.

What is the likelihood she saw it? I’m more concerned at the other posts she may have seen from that user account. I’m new to Reddit so I have no idea what the chances of her seeing my nonviral post in a huge reddit community is.

105,I've never been with a woman nor do I have any interest being with a woman. Relationship or sexual. But I LOVE woman's butts and chests. I'm not sure if that would qualify as bi though. I just appreciate the look of women. I am engaged to a man and love him entirely but it's something I've been curious about lately. TYIA.,29Jun2020,0
106,"To put this into context, I am a white, 27 year old female. I have always considered myself anti-racist and pro equality. This is still true, and this is the first time I feel like I've had a tiny glimpse into the reality of the struggle and thinking of black people. I can never fully comprehend it in the real way because it's an experience I can never live, but it was the first time I have been accutely aware not only of my skin color, but some of the reality I live in versus the reality of others.

Recently I watched a video with my significant other, and although we watched the same video we both came out with different opinions of what we saw in the video. It was incredible to realize it's not just that people aren't seeing the same media or seeing the same things I am, they are just processing it completely differently. The sense of reality is so unique. 

 Maybe this is silly, maybe it's common sense and I'm just a fool learning something late in life; Perhaps you all have realized early. Maybe this is some woowoo expansion of consciousness or something. Idk. I want to learn more though, I want to expand my understanding drawn from other people's realities, not just drawing conclusions from my own reality. For example, I can read about someone's experience and understand it, but I couldn't comprehend it before, if that makes sense?

108,"It's a common practice to remove groups that say shitty things on a website.  It makes logical sense, to remove things that don't fit your vision/ideals.  So the ban of certain subs like *The Donald* and *Chapo Trap House* may have been a long time coming - but instead of celebrating, hear me out.  At casual glance it seems a sort of ""meeting grounds"" have been removed.  However, I'd argue that their **containment zones** have been eliminated and *they will seek out new homes and/or vengeance.*  

&amp;#x200B;

You see, the people that frequent these subs still exist.  They aren't going to go ""Aww, shoot, my favorite sub is gone!  I'll just stop posting forever I guess.""  No, absolutely not.  They'll want retribution.  *And their venting subs are now gone*.  Perhaps they'll go elsewhere, perhaps they'll create a new place on Reddit for operations.  Perhaps both.

&amp;#x200B;

Banning these subs, in my opinion, may be a mistake.  Reddit has popped a zit that will spread out, infecting more, instead of letting containment bubble subs do their jobs.  Why not make those subs hard to find, incapable of reaching the front page, to let their numbers inevitably dwindle out.

Yet, inside me is the urge to 'lead the way', 'say what needs to be said' and 'be the first to speak when others are afraid' . But I know so relatively little about anything. Especially politics. Politics are so nuanced. Every opinion on anything subjective is incredibly nuanced. So intricate you need to be a master of patience and have the energy needed to address something correctly and with respect.

How do you even know the difference between having the wrong opinion and someone else just telling you you're a bag of shit because they don't know what they're talking about?

When does the other person have a good point? Vs ""You're too weak willed to defend your own point"" 

Opinions are everywhere. It's hard not to have an opinion on one. But imagine if everything you thought was low level shit and you didn't even know it?

But I have an opinion. It matters and I care about myself enough to know that. I wouldn't be showing myself enough respect if I didn't share it?

As long as I perform basic hygiene and wear clean clothes, that's all that should matter. But no: society expects you to conform to ridiculous beauty standards or be shunned as a result.

Sure, people try to talk about how looks don't matter or how beauty is subjective, yet society and human nature contradicts itself by giving preferential treatment to attractive women compared to their plain/homely counterparts. At least men can compensate for their looks with social status, but a woman's sexual desirability and physical appearance seems to be her status to the world.

I'm tired of people being absolutely repelled by me just for existing, yet these same individuals bend over backwards for and rubberneck conventionally attractive women even if they're absolute cunts. Even if you -do- try to conform, people will still give you hell if you're still unattractive with such embellishments.

Being cordial isn't enough: you have to be attractive to get by. If you're attractive to others, you're more confident because people like you. Can't develop a sense of self worth if people bully and ostracize you for just existing, and I don't see the point in conforming if it's all bullshit and looks fade anyway.

138,"This is going to be a long post and probably riddled with grammatical errors and mistakes, but bear with me if you can.

I should probably start off with some background information before I delve into the issues or problems that I'm facing. School as in where I am present in a physical classroom inside of a school has been over for me since the final bell on March 13th. As per schedule, I was to receive a week long ""March Break"" and then return to school however the provincial government mandated that all students (at least in high school) were to stay at home for an additional two weeks. This made the total absence of school three weeks and as anyone would have predicted, everyone was as happy as could be. 

I had planned sometimes in February or early March that I was going to really step up my personal development and try to become a better person with any free time I might receive. As a result of this line of thinking, I scheduled that for the entire ""March Break"" I would not be using any electronics at all. This was mainly to fix my problem with using electronics for too long on a daily basis. I would sometimes be on YouTube, Reddit, or even reading fanfiction from the moment that I got home till the early hours of the morning. Another issue that I wanted to fix was my terrible sleep schedule. Removing all electronics for a week from my life would have surely somewhat fixed my problem. Those were the two main plans that I had in mind however there were many others that I also wanted to accomplish. It was fixing my sleep schedule and my addiction to electronics that were my main two because those were the ones that I thought received the most attention.

However, as many things in my life have gone, it didn't exactly go as planned. That very Friday night on March 13th I spent a massive amount of time engaging in meaningless pursuits however I was satisfied because I thought I deserved it since school was over for a week or so. The next day I woke up pretty late, sometime after noon I believe, and followed through with my plans. I didn't spend a single second on any electronics that day... until about 6:00 PM. So from about a little after noon till just before dinner, I had done a decent amount of things around the house. Because I no longer could use my electronics I cleaned my room, helped my mother make dinner and wash the dishes, spent a little bit of time outside, hell I even meditated for like 10 minutes. But it was all for nought because I couldn't resist going on my phone or my laptop and ended up using both until the early hours of the morning. My first plan was an absolute failure and I put all my disappointment in just watching more useless YouTube videos and scrolling randomly on Reddit and fanfiction. My second plan was also a failure because it was tied to my first plan. Overall, the start of my ""March Break"" was the exact opposite that I wished it was.

I don't exactly know why I didn't try and do everything again but I was probably under some misguided belief that even if I did follow through with my plans, it wouldn't matter anyways. I now realise many months later that I probably just wanted to spend more useless amounts of time on my laptop or my phone. For the remainder of my ""March Break"", I don't think I really did much. It was hideous amounts of pleasure and leisure time that eventually resulted in nothing. I don't remember any other day of my ""March Break"" other than that Saturday which really drives home the point that my days were filled with nothingness.

School technically started again on March 23rd however it was very dialled back and literally didn't challenge anyone at all. You could spend less than half an hour doing everything you needed to in a day and you would get 100% on all the quizzes or whatever. Any assignment didn't really matter either way because our marks would not be downgraded, only improved, if we did the assignments. Therefore if I had had a 80% before the ""March Break"" and I somehow fail a quiz or a test, my mark would not be affected at all. However, if I scored a 95%, my mark would improve. I did whatever my school demanded of me and hurriedly did all the assignments the last day I could possibly do them, usually at night as well. Was I procrastinating on the stupidly easy assignments/tests that I could have easily done prior without any stress or anxiety, definitely. What was my excuse? I got all the time in the world.

Life continued for a couple of months afterwards. I did whatever I needed to do for school and most of my days were filled with useless things like YouTube and Reddit. I did have certain moments throughout this break that lasted from Mid-March till June 26th (my last day of school) that I should probably stop wasting my time and do more productive things however I just kept on repeating the same excuses, I got time later for that, or I got all the time in the world. I procrastinated so much for such minor things even though I even knew that my excuses really had no merit. From March till June there was a perfect environment set up for me to do absolutely nothing meaningful in life and literally face no consequences at all. Sure my parents or my sister might tease me or try to get me to go outside or do something but still, I was my same useless self. 

I had heard about the NoFap community a couple years ago and I generally agreed with its goals. I had discovered porn and masturbating probably around the age of 12 and had realised probably around the age of 13 or 14 that masturbating or having to look at porn to masturbate wasn't the healthiest thing in the world. I started to find out a couple years ago whether or not I could really do NoFap before I even knew anything at all about NoFap whatsoever. After unsuccessfully trying again and again to do away with porn and masturbation, I discovered the NoFap community online however that hasn't necessarily helped me at all because I am at the same place that I was before. In January of this year I had my longest streak ever at about two and a half weeks however I haven't been able to beat that streak even though it has been six months and I have said time and time again that this will be the ""last one"". This is yet again one more plan of mine that has failed.

By reading the past few paragraphs, you probably think I haven't really done anything productive at all however I think it would be wrong to say that. While 99.99% of my time these past three or so months has been entirely unproductive, there have been some snippets of time which I actually have in memory. The thing is that when your days are so full of meaningless stuff, there really is no differentiator between the days. What's the point of knowing what the date is or whether it's Tuesday or Friday? Everyday is the same; wake up late, spend time on my laptop, eat unhealthy food, sleep, and repeat. I did talk with my best friend every couple of days or so and we usually talked about what we each did everyday and just ordinary stuff. Our friendship has definitely improved as a result of us talking for I would say well over 30 hours just back and forth. I took advantage of the free Kindle ebooks that were available on Amazon however yet again, I thought I would spend a lot of time reading and finish all the classicals by Shakespeare or Arthur Conan Doyle but even now when its almost July, I have yet to finish a single book. Out of the hundreds that I now own, I've probably only progressed through about a dozen or so and the reason for that is whenever I would feel bored reading through one book, I would just switch to the other one. So even when I actively wanted to be productive and learn more things, I procrastinated on that. 

What I've mentioned so far pretty much sums up the rest of March and pretty much the rest of April and May as well as about half of June. The past three months haven't been very striking in my life and I can say that if you were to ask my to list one really memorable day in either April or May, I would not be able to. March was utterly insignificant and a complete failure of my plans. There was two or three days in both April and May when I was in bed and realised that the clock read 3:00 or 4:00 AM and not really feeling sleepy at all, I would just ""wake up early"" and then fall asleep something before dinner and not really fix my sleep schedule at all because I would be exhausted from being awake for so long. I did start spending more time outside when the weather started becoming nicer however it was at most maybe an hour in an entire day so it doesn't really matter anyways. My main problems still existed. I don't think I really have much else to explain as it pertains to March, April, or May. As a recap, I'll just list out how my day would really go.

1. Wake up sometime after noon, sometimes as early as 2:00 or 3:00 PM, sometimes as late as 4:00 or 5:00 PM.
2. Go straight on my laptop and probably stay in bed until my mother told me to get out.
3. Eat dinner, probably the healthiest meal of my day.
4. Get back on my laptop and snack on unhealthy things throughout the night.
5. Either sleep sometime just before sunrise (5:00 AM), or go to sleep just as the day is coming around. I've gone to bed sometimes at 8:00 or 9:00 AM.

I've tried fixing this terrible routine however all my efforts have been in vain either as a result of me not being hardworking enough or just me not really caring because I probably will just do the same stuff once I do somehow magically wake up at 6:30 or 8:00 in the morning and have a ""perfect day"". 

Now that I've explained basically how my life has been starting from Mid-March till Early June, I think it's best to describe how my life has been for the past two or three weeks which has been a little different than the past couple months but at the end of the day, not really.

School really started to wrap up around halfway through June and I started having a lot more free time again which further reinforced my bad habits or meaninglessly wasting my time while at the same time so many other people are using the exact same time to truly improve their life and become a better person. I started looking for some jobs around two weeks ago and there was a position as a store clerk available at a local store around a 10-minute bike-ride away from my house. I knew that if I got that job, it would really help me get my life back together and really put some purpose in life day-to-day routine. But even for such a great opportunity I procrastinated and I just checked today that that very same job posting has been removed, probably because someone else took that role. Last summer I was under the notion that I was going to also become a better person and really improve and by the time September came around, I looked back at my decisions as foolish and just a plain waste of time. I had made a decision back then, around a year ago, that I would definitely have a job this time around and not waste my time like I did last year. However, it seems I am in the same place and in even worse circumstances.

I just really don't know what to do right now. I don't have any purpose in my days and have my whole life in front of me but I just feel like I'm wasting so much time right now. I thought I would look at this summer with joy because I could have more opportunities and maybe fulfill some of my goals however when school did end about a couple days ago, I only felt sadness and really no true joy or happiness. 

It's June 29th right now at around 5:00 in the afternoon. The five-step schedule I posted above rings true even now. I have reached a stage where it's better of my to just ask for help and try to get in a little better position. I'm sorry if this was a really long read and I apologize if the depressive atmosphere of my post has ruined your day. This has been my story so far and the only thing I have left is to just pose my final question.

Around March I helped him dye it blonde (his natural hair is black) because he figured quarantine would be a good time to dye it blonde because why not. However, as bleaching does, it was pretty damaged and dry from it. Last night he got a buzz cut to get rid of the damaged  hair and grow it out from a fresh start. I certainly don’t think he looks ugly, but I kind of hate the haircut.  I really do NOT like the buzzed look on him at all. I’m not going to tell him this because it’ll make him sad and that’s the last thing I wanna do. But yeah I really don’t like it at all and miss his old hair so much. I am praying his hair grows fast. Ok that’s all folks just needed to vent. :)",29Jun2020,1

141," first of all: i **don't** wanna to make these post a place to look for dirtychatting or anything like that.

so, i realized that some time ago, i never been much of horny all the time, have never been always thinking about it, have never been so into masturbating. but since quarantine begun i have been that a lot. so much than i create these side nsfw account. i have never wanted a bf or live by myself so much as i do right now.

is anyone else feeling like that too? is it a quarantine thing?",29Jun2020,1
142,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",29Jun2020,0
143,"I just was with my very kind, loving bf. He’s looking on his Instagram and scrolls through countless photos of girls with the perfect ass, huge boobs, all while having virtually no fat besides those places. He has some of their photos saved on the app to masturbate to. I’m just never going to be enough. Not even in his imagination am I good enough it seems. I don’t wish for the “perfect body,” but it would be nice to feel like I’m enough to please him. I don’t even have an Instagram myself, but I wonder how he would feel if I had a bunch of photos of half naked men on my phone that I masturbated to.",29Jun2020,2
144,"Usually get bored when arguing with people and I tend to avoid it, because I rarely witness someone swallowing his pride and admitting either that he’s wrong, or  that the contrary opinion has some logic and might be also true. On the other hand I behave the opposite way, I admit my faults on the spot or if so it happens for me to realize it later I change the way I’ll behave in the future. I’m trying to “serve” the truth, I know it sounds a bit cringe but that’s how I have it in my mind. Today I was pissed of and took the chance to stand and support my opinion to the end, it gladly paid off and the other guy even told me that I’m right, right on spot. To be honest it had paid off again multiple times in the past, but I really think of it as waste of time, since I’ve witnessed numerous cases that even when someone admits that what he did or thought was wrong he usually repeats it in the future. This post was more like a reminder to myself.",29Jun2020,1
