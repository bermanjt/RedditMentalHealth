0,"I never had any relationships in high school... well, yet, I guess, since I still have another year. But now that I actually know what I want to do with my life I feel sad all the time. Beginning of this year there was this girl... very tumultuous relationship and we were best friends, but just happened to like each other at different times. I stopped talking to her.  Now I find that I can only think of the future... what girls will I meet in college? How will my career determine my relationships? I haven’t even gotten accepted into a college yet. I fucking miss thinking in the present. I miss when all I thought about was a girl despite how much fucking anguish it caused me. I miss when that was the only thing that mattered, I feel like I’ve gotten too mature and too smart. I have absolutely no plans with any girls in the present, and honestly no big desire to do anything my final year of high school  (although I hang out/do crazy shit all the time). I miss being hopeful and only caring about relationships. Ignorance is bliss.",01Oct2020,1
1,"Im 23 moved to a new town 3 and a half months ago with my brother. In that time I have made no new friends here. It’s not a huge town but there are a few small bars and stuff to hang out at. Everyone I work with is 45+ so while we’re friends at work, we would never hang out outside of work. Tinder was a total failure. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m not dying of loneliness or anything but I’m definitely starting to miss hanging out with friends and having fun.",01Oct2020,1
2,"I lost my job recently and have quickly found myself honestly completely destitute. I have a son who lives with me and am waiting for benefits to arrive, but we are hungry... Ive sold what I have of value but have run out of options.. this will probably get removed but Im desperate enough to ask. Anything anyone could do would help thank you.",01Oct2020,1
4,"For the past few years I've been on and off Tinder and other similar dating apps. And honestly, not much luck. Been stood up a few times, went on a date that couldn't have gone worse. But mostly, waiting weeks on end for a match just for it to turn out to be a bot. Or actually match with someone just for the conversation to dry out 3 messages in.

Shit is demoralising. It really messes with your self esteem. I personally dont think I'm that bad looking but dating apps always have me questioning whether I'm wrong, if there is something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just really shit at conversations. Who knows. 

I always reach the point where I just give up and uninstall the app only to reinstall it a few months later for whatever reason. But I'm starting to realise that maybe dating apps just arent for me. Part of me thinks that if I uninstall it then I'll never find someone but it's just not worth the stress of actually having it installed. 

So who knows.",01Oct2020,1
5,"I’m from rural Appalachia. My parents are from working-class rural southern white backgrounds, as am I. I have 300 years of heritage in the same state, and I despise all of it. 

My father physically abused me and gaslit me about it for years, and my mother pulled us into a borderline cult. I am one of 6 children for this reason, they basically developed this “quiverfull” ideology where they worshipped the Duggars and believed that basically doing anything to prevent conceiving more and more children is violating God’s will. They were offended that public schools taught that the world was more than 6000 years old, so they withdrew me and homeschooled me to fill my mind with creationist pseudoscience. I became socially somewhat isolated for this reason, just like my other 5 siblings.

As the only son, I was constantly expected to be the hyper masculine type with ambition. I got depressed, and they never got me any help, instead calling me lazy throughout all my teenage years, and telling me I needed to man up. I don’t know how well I’m recovering from this. At least I wasn’t like my sisters, who were encouraged to become housewives at 19 and now are in impoverished unhappy marriages.

I’m now a software engineer, but still stuck in my podunk hometown. I am trying to save up money and leave ASAP, but I don’t feel like I’ll ever belong anywhere else. I also foolishly admitted that I’m progressive and atheist, and now my family tries to sabotage my confidence in people by trying to sneak people into my life to reconvert me into their fundamentalism. 

I have no friends and nothing to lose, but I’m underpaid and have people holding me back. I think I’ll escape soon, but will my life really get better? I have no social support in my life, and no friends elsewhere. I speak with an Appalachian accent and my self hatred flares up when people call me things like cousin fucker, which happens enough that I know that people who don’t say it are thinking it. 

I’m beginning to think things can’t get better for me, because it’s not just circumstance. I hate everything about who I was raised to be, but if I reject it, I am nothing. I’ll never belong anywhere or be happy",01Oct2020,1

I don't want to go back to my internship. I don't care about going out with my friends again, I'm tired of living and I'm too scared of dying.

""The look in your eyes while peeling those onions, its like your peeling away layers of life, it gives me some context on how you live yours.""

And then cracked a little smile and walked away like nothing happened.

16,"I just need this to get out of my system, long story short,  two years ago we ran out of the money dad left us when he died 10 years ago,  we could have handled it better sure, but it happened, my mom is a stay at home mom, my sisters were both in highschool and middle school, and I was in senior year at college, so It was up to me to bring the cash in, I started working but I was still a student and there were slot of bills and rent so we swam butts first in the debts and loans sea, now mom had a bad credit score due to ill credit card payment, 
So all the loans and debts were under my name, especially last year. Everything was getting worse because bills are still here, installments for loans and debts were added and so little money (income of a 21years old student) 
But I worked my ass off and by the end of the year I doubled my income,  but my income covered the bills and installments only,  we lived poorly for couple of months and I was shredded, trying to get more money in by working full time, part time, and freelancer jobs every waking hour, and I was anxious all the time,  thinking about bills,  food,  medicine for my mother,  I had a really horrible year (I had an abusive ex who was truly the cherry on the top)
This year,  I trippled my income,  worked even more, took courses to enter some new fields, started pursuing a dream I have,  and have a great boyfriend, but the demons keep following me, everytime I'm happy with a new job,  the bills and expenses increase,  it's not enough, gotta get more freelancer gigs, gotta find a new job,  but I can't think and work,  when 3 different loaners call me and threaten to sue me because Im late,  I work 3 full time remote jobs and couple of freelancer gigs now,  I barely make time for my courses, and can't even touch my dreams or work on,  
So today when the manager at the bank threaten to sue to pay the 2 late installments by tomorrow or the build a case against me I cried and broke down in front of everyone, 
But hey atleast he gave me chocolate",01Oct2020,1
17,"Articulation isn’t my strong suit, but here goes. 

Not particularly criminal nor abusive, my father’s vice involves unemployment, lounging, gives no fucks about cleaning, and binging on TV shows all day. We were never a priority, and with his inkling to play the generous, nice guy, he drained his bank account (savings, emergency, kids’ college funds) to lend to his sibling despite unemployment and educational needs of his 2 high schoolers. 

It was never paid back. He never got another job.

Further, unwed younger sister living with us has gone crazy - talking to herself, chanting, singing. At times, she’d go crazy and hit me, my sister, mother, or father. Messing up the house, she’s managed to make our home look like Smokey Mountain (large landfill in the PH). Even so, we are the ones tiptoeing in this house. Father refuses to act on it even though he has ownership. 

Ofc this is just a wrapped up, simplified narrative. I know this sounds all simple and mundane. But it has consumed all of us exponentially. 

Father does nothing. 

Graduating, I wound up feeding a family of 4 behind the starting line. With an entry level jobs, a bunch of side hustles, and my sister joining the bandwagon after graduating (2 years later), we’ve managed, barely making ends meet. Yet, my father reprimands us for not helping pay off his debts used to support us during his unemployment despite holding an MBA.

I barely have enough to support the family, let alone myself. Every breathing second of the day and night, I’m thinking of ways to earn and rid of my crazy aunt and this ratchet place to give my family a better, more peaceful life. Yet, I’m branded an ungrateful and unfilial by my father. 

Isn’t it a father’s obligation to support their family? Debt wasn’t a sacrifice. He chose to be unemployed when he could have been employed anywhere.",01Oct2020,1
18,"This is a throw away just because i want to keep this private to those i know. Im 17f and i think i might be bisexual. The thing is im also autistic idk if that has to do with anything but idk if its also one of my little puffs of interest i go through but this is just hard to really understand for me. The thing is im scared to even say anything about being bisexual because i have a boyfriend and ive known him for 5 years and im scared he'd leave me or he would think im not attracted to him anymore but thats not true hes literally the most amazing guy ive ever met and i plan/hope to be the person i mary one day, but i worry by saying that i think im bisexual may imply our relationship wont work out. 

Im also confused and unsure if it counts but like sometimes i find some girls in games cute or sweet like in harvest moon/story of seasons and you can marry them and i wanna do that but also i feel the same when i see some girls on tiktok like they are so pretty and seem so funny and goofy.

22,Okay I know this is super dumb and insignificant in the grand scheme of things but it really does hurt. About a week ago I met this girl on reddit. We both had the same fetishes and kinks and we sexted for a few days. Since quarantine started I’ve been so bored during the day while my fiancé was working (yes he’s fine with the sexting). It was so refreshing to find another girl of my ethnicity into the same super fringe kinks that I feel uncomfortable sharing. Talking to her was so amazing and I feel like it filled a void in my life that was missing. I even sent her a photo of me which is a big deal for me because I have trust issues with people online. So after Friday night she just ghosted me. I was worried from the beginning but today I texted her from an alt account pretending to be someone else and she accepted the chat confirming that she’s been on Reddit since and she hasn’t just taken a break or lost her phone or something. You might be wondering “why do you care so much about some girl online?” I have BPD and I’m absolutely terrified of abandonment. I feel so hurt and I don’t know what to do. We literally connected so well. Why is she doing this?,01Oct2020,1
23,"I have had thoughts and questions hounding me for a few years about reality. I won't explain what brought me to them, but it's like this: I have seen the very fabric of space and time ripple before my eyes. Headaches often plague my sleep and obstruct my focus, bringing what I call ""dream drops"" of other places, normal and amazing, fully invigorating my senses. They are not mere illusions or hallucinations, failed treatments and simple experience has proved me of that. I have noticed that I occasionally warp a quick moment into the past, interrupting my train of process. I have asked people I know and trust, but have gotten nothing to help. Is there anyone at all out there who shares these strange occurrences? I need to know if I'm not alone. Please.",01Oct2020,1
24,"My shoulders are heavy. I try to save everyone from the pain I have, but in order to save them I have to hurt them, push them away. And I hate it. I can’t ever make people happy because I’m not happy, I have issues that I hide behind a smile and pray nobody notices, but I want someone to notice. I want someone to look me in my eyes and love me, even with my flaws. And because I never think I will get that kind of deep, intense love, I just give it to everyone. So that maybe they will feel better, because if I can’t be happy, the least I can do is make everyone else’s lives better. But all i can think about is the kids being sold into slavery, the innocent people killed everyday by people who think that they are okay, people who think what they are doing is justified, and sometimes I just want to snap and let out the darkness. The storm in the deepest part of my heart that no one could handle, the one that would make everyone afraid. The monster that I have hiding, that feels nothing and knows nothing but rage and sorrow. I want to let it out of its cage to reek havoc on those who would hurt the innocent, those would rape and murder children, those who would kill without a second thought. I want to bloody my hands with the skin of the evil, but I can’t. Because to kill the darkness, you have to be even darker. And my heart would never recover. If I ever fold into the darkness, I will never make it back. I’m so afraid to open the door, because I’m scared that once the beast comes out, I’ll never be able to cage him. And after the good has been done, all that will be left is an empty shell of who I once was, and an unforgiving nightmare of a person who only feels anger and hate, sadness and hopelessness. If I ever succumb to the darkness in me, I won’t return, there will be only pain, only savage justice. I’m so scared of my thoughts that I drink and get high so I don’t have to think, so I don’t have to feel. And even though all I want is to make the world a better place, I know I can’t do it without giving in to the deep abyss of numbness that is my soul, the unfeeling, senseless violence that seeks nothing except a target. What if I never wake back up? What if I become the thing I swore to beat, the only thing I wanted to eradicate from the earth? What am I? It scares me. I’m just sitting in my car. All I can hear is the voices that I keep at bay everyday. It starts as a ringing, then it gradually turns into whispers, calling out my insecurities, my deepest darkest fears. And because I’m drunk, I just laugh and talk with them as if they were a pissed off customer. But what if I’m really sick? Or what if when I drink I can suddenly hear the truth around me? My thoughts are running wild, there will be no sleep tonight. My mind is turning over and over, reminding me of every bad thing that I’ve ever seen or done, telling me things that I had long forgotten, bringing me to a place I had hoped to never see again. My heart tries to fight it but my mind always wins, I’m so tired. I’m so exhausted from caring so much and getting hurt, by people I trusted with my life. I’m worn down, broken, torn to pieces. But I shove it all in a jar and keep going, because I feel like I have to. But I don’t want to. Sometimes I just want to smoke a telephone pole as fast as I can to see if I can survive, to see if I’m strong enough to live. I have a fucked up mind, and a constant battle between what I feel is right and what the world tells me is right. My thoughts close in around me, the voices get loud, and I cry because I can’t hear anything but my past, and the future my demons show me. I can’t see anything but the ones I’ve hurt, the ones I wish were still here. Sometimes I can’t take it anymore, sometimes I have to let it out, but I don’t know how to without sounding like a mad man, or a bad person. I’m in pain, I just want to feel happy. I’m so strong all the time, it’s killing me slowly. I feel like I’m just breathing to death, fading into the bottom of my heart, where the only comfort is the nothingness of eternal sleep. I have to be better, than everyone, because no one can carry what I carry. No one could live through their own mind constantly telling them that they are shit, worthless, and can’t ever be happy. I’m so close to giving up, to simply letting my inner thoughts become my reality, I see the edge and instead of fighting for balance I just want to jump.....please help me. Sometimes I hurt myself, not to escape or anything, but to prove to me that I can take it. That no matter what pain I endure, I can beat it. I have nothing to offer anyone, and yet they let me into their lives as if i have some great thing, some spark of hope, but it’s all a lie. One that I created to fool myself. And the saddest part is, I believe it. I believe that I am happy, that I genuinely affect people’s lives for the better. When really I just hold them back, keep them from being the most that they could be. I’m so tired....so tired of breathing, of feeling, of thinking....I just want to stop, I want to be normal, I want to function like a regular person and not have the thoughts that I have. I want to be invisible. I want someone to understand, to know what I know, to truly feel how I feel. But if I asked anybody to understand, it would be selfish. No one should know this grief, and yet all I want is for someone who gets it to wrap me up and tell me I’m not the only one, that what I feel is not just me....that I’m not alone. I don’t want to be alone forever....I have to find someone. Someone like me, who knows. Who understands. Someone I can look at, and see the same pain I feel in their eyes. Someone who can relate to me more than I can, someone who can take the pain like I can, that can feel what I feel and still be happy like me....I need someone, I can’t do this on my own anymore....I’m not strong enough. I want to be successful. I want to change the world In a way that everyone remembers, that will never die. But I can’t do it, I can’t be the hero that I need. And if I can’t do it, then there is no hope, because no one can ever come closer than me, no one can ever know what I know and be sane, no one can take what I feel and make it good. I have to be the one, no one else will step up. I have to change it, I have to make it better. I’m so scared of the day that I can’t do it, that I just erupt and let out everything I feel on the wrong people, that I deeply hurt those I love most...I don’t want to hurt you, I don’t want to let you feel my pain, I don’t want you to suffer like me....but I so badly want to share my burden, I want someone to see that I’m fucking broken, that I need help, that I can’t go on. I want someone to see that I can only carry so much, that I’m so close to falling down the hole I crawled my way out of, that I’m on the edge of total and utter silence, the kind that can’t be fixed.....I’m so lost, I can’t find my way out, I’m bleeding out of emotions and if I let the last drop fall, there will be nothing left... I’m alone. And though the feelings I share are real, the love that I give is real, i know I will never be who I wish I was, that I can’t achieve my goals, that the one thing I live for will never be accomplished, and I’m sorry.",01Oct2020,1
25,"I don't mean that I'm going insane in the trite, half joking way people throw around the phrase, I mean I'm actually losing my sanity. The isolation, being locked in this cell of an apartment bedroom for 24 hours on an average day staring at a computer screen, with no respite nor solace from the endless swirling thoughts eating through my brain, I just can't take it. I can't. I CAN'T. It's like a coil of barbed wire is wrapped around my skull and getting tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter with every bitter moment I'm alive.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. I can't read any of my favorite books. I can't play video games, I can't force myself through movies or TV shows. I've seen 2 of my friends in the last two months and even talking to them felt wrong somehow. Like I'm a hollow shell imitating who I was before this god damned pandemic started, like I have no right to even talk to anyone. I can't communicate. I can't connect with people. All I do is stare at my wall, mentally disassembling every philosophy, paradigm, and belief I've ever held or lived by.

Yesterday, while listening to The Wall by Pink Floyd for the third time and just laying in the corner of my room, I think something broke in me. I KNEW, not as some vague idea but as CONCRETE KNOWLEDGE, that in 5 seconds I would stand up, run into my closet, grab the hunting knife I keep on the top shelf in the back and plunge it as hard as I could into my chest. I could see it happening in my mind as clear as day. I could feel the pain, I could see the blood.

Instead I stood up, put on my running shoes and tried to run a few miles to get the hell out of there. It was cold and rainy and miserable, but I didn't care. I got back home, my roommate said something to me when I walked in the door but I barely even heard him. I walked into my bedroom, took off my shirt, walked into my bathroom and looked in the mirror. And I just couldn't fucking take it. My beautiful fucking body that I've been eating 88 grams of protein a day and working out 5 times a week for the last 4 years to maintain, my beautiful fucking room which I vacuum, sweep, dust, spray and wipe down twice a weak, like a fucking lysol scented mausoleum for my rotting remains, and I couldn't take it.

I trashed my room. I punched a hole in the wall, I threw my dresser on the floor, I ripped the towel rack off the wall. I screamed my voice out. I fell on my floor and laughed to high heaven and banged my head on the linoleum until I couldn't stop crying. My roommates came came in through the door, and eventually I stopped crying. They brought gauze to stop the bleeding on my head. We used to be really close before I started slipping. Maybe we still are. It doesn't feel that way.

I tried to tell them how I feel, muting the harsher points. They didn't understand, of course, but they recognized my pain. I mean how the hell could they understand? Anyway, we talked for about an hour and I felt better for the rest of the day, I fixed what I ruined, I plastered over the hole, and I knocked out some homework. Great.

But now it's tomorrow, and tomorrow will be the next day, with another thousand to follow it, and nothing has changed. I'm slipping. I can't think straight. I can't write poems, I can't play my guitar. I don't know what to do.

The lights dimmed out and plane took off. Obviously uk what comes next: the small side glances at each other, bumping into each other’s seat for the entire two hr plane ride.

27,"I am a person who suffers from mental health yes, Bipolar Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, PTSD, Schizoid, BPD, Avoidant, you name it!  But this desire currently isn’t one born out of depression.

Perhaps it is?  Im not sure.  I’m not mentally well, my ideas aren’t considered ones that would categorize me as such.  However I am a thinker, a meditator, I am a philosopher, a poet, a spiritualist, and I really see no logical reason to live.

We are born without consent.  We are given the task to work for our own lives even though we didn’t ask to be born.  We seek joy in others and in things that don’t last and usually end in pain.  Marriage for example ends in divorce or death, neither is a happy outcome, for the partners first intent, and for the one left behind grieving a spouse.

I just don’t see a point in life.  Life is meaningless.  I understand the existential cliche of create your own meaning, but fleshing that far out does no good for society, one could find meaning as a serial killer, which brings meaning to the morgues, law enforcement, hospitals, psychologists, prisons, but absolute suffering for the victims and their families.

So creating your own meaning isn’t an excuse society should run to.  My personal “meaning” in life is that life is pointless, worthless, however I would never begrudge someone else their life or decide for them whether or not they should live it.

I believe in the way we discussed that He meant it as a Cause and Effect way to view/say Manipulation. Example: You say Something and in turn you get a response from Someone. I think that is what he means to say when he used the word ""Manipulation"".  

I tried to explain that, To Me, when you say Manipulation I view it as trying to control someone in a mischievous / unscrupulous way . Also that it sounds very assholey / Niceguy to say unless go into like a hour long convo elaborating, like we did.  I also said if im looking at the word in the best way, then I can /see/ what he means, but even after the convo I am still unsure if I knew what he specifically meant.

Still, I still find myself wandering what’s the purpose of all of this? What’s the point of life really? I don’t think I’ve truly been happy in a long time. Sure there are moments, but sustained happiness for more than a few days at a time is almost a foreign idea at this point. At the end of the day, I think I just want to feel loved. I feel so alone in this world sometimes. At the same time tho I’m really not that depressed or upset right now. I think I’m just numb.

The important part, is an upcoming celebration of the love two people have for one another.

There’s just one spot that they keep getting stuck on, and they’ve been trying and trying and trying to overcome it, with no success. Finally, after so many failures, they finally got it right.

Recently me and a friend of mine started working out; we live in different cities but talk about it often. But the thing is I've recently been feeling really depressed with myself because of how fast she was progressing at first and now she is getting stronger than I am. This never really affected me at all if it was a guy. But for some reason this thing is just making me feel really low.

It can be because the things she's saying she can do right now- I used to do more. I was a national level shot put player and I focused mostly on strength training and my friend; she's able to pull through 2 sets of 50 reps of dumbell curls with 7.5 kg dumbells on both her arms. She has gone from lifting basically nothing to this much in 2 months time. And while I used to do the same amount before, after the pandemic and lockdown I just let everything go and ended up gaining almost 20 kilos. And honestly it makes me feel horrible. But the thing is such an inferiority complex never happen to me when a male friend of mine talks about his workouts because I do have friends who lift more than her- (we're all 17 yr olds). When she first told me she was able to life an amount more than I could- it really shattered me for some reason and I went on crying for so long because- I don't even know why I felt so bad. This is the first time that I've had such a feeling and I'm not really able to articulate it very well.

The summary of this convoluted post is that- while I know I can and eventually might start lifting more than her and get stronger than her, I just feel like shit whenever I think about how much she can lift right now and how much she improved. And I don't think it's only because she is a girl. I know huge female bodybuilders exist but- I guess it's because I personally know this girl that it makes me feel so bad. Am I the only one who feels like this?",01Oct2020,1

Or you should've just ran when you had the good oPPROTUNITY when no one was around because the newborn &amp; first zombies ever were too busy chasing and eating people around the town.

Knew this hiding place was not a good place to be in because you couldn't move that much and in some time the zombies would be all over you, idling around while you are dehydrated and starving and die. So, i got out, ran quickly to this trailer house and hid under the stairs- mind you, the ground had rocks. A lot of rocks. A lot of noises when walking on them. So, i hid, under the stairs. I saw a woman running and running  past me and a zombie chasing her. She got caught right behind the trailer, she didn't scream, and thats where i made the biggest mistake ever. 

The rocks, my walking, the noise- the zombie picked it up so quick. I heard it walking hurriedly, so I ran. It began to chase me, i was on the road and thats where it caught me and killed me. 

Somehow in this dream while I was about to get caught- I turned on this Minecraft menu thing and selected Save &amp; Quit. 

And thats where i fucking woke up. Bevause I didn't want to go through immense pain.

Why I couldn't think of a bETTER plan while I was still under the soil, hiding- was because I was dazed and scared. So, i couldnt think right. Because, i just kept hearing a lot of bloody murder screams, car crashes, explosions all over the town. Of course, a little soy girl like me- got scared.

Oh yeah, before the zombies got out- I was the first ever person in this whole world to know about it. And I just let it happen by getting out of that school to let the zombie spread the infection because...I dont fucking knkw why.

I still ended up like him. I still beat my girlfriend like he beat my mom. I still blame everyone else for what I fail to do. It doesn't matter how much I hate how I'm acting, I still do these things.

One night he comes up to my bedroom door at midnight and he asks me if I loved him. I didn't know what to tell him. How could I love this addict who'd stolen from me, my mother, my grandmother. How could I love him when he spended his days screaming at them for God knows what reasons. I dont even think he knew why he spent so much time screaming.

Yesterday was a fucking shitshow. 

So, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I’d consider myself a decently attractive, decently socially skilled guy— I can talk to girls pretty well. However, I live in a pretty small town where I don’t really fit in all too well— my politics are different, my religious views are different, my interests are different— meaning I’m not exactly popular with girls in my area. So instead I talk to girls online from other parts of the country. 

Anyways, being in the talking stage, I talk to multiple girls. I happened to be talking to two girls as of yesterday, both in different states. And I struck out with both of them to whatever extent. 

Girl Numero Uno: this girl in her own words really likes me, but doesn’t want to catch feelings because she thinks it’ll end in pain for her— she thinks I’m out of her league and will break her heart. Which is ironic, because she yesterday decided to go back to her ex who cheated on her and treats her like a second choice. Basically we’ve been talking for a week, and if I do say so myself, we’re really compatible on a personality level— we have the same interests, have the same sense of humor, etc. And as I said, she finds me really really hot, as do I her— I know all this because she’s brutally honest and has zero filter, so I trust what she says. But she’s weirdly insecure and believes that nobody will love her like her ex— her ex that, in all his magnificent *love*, cheated on her and dumped her when another girl showed the most interest in her, and only came back to her when she dumped him. Literally nothing she says makes any fucking sense— she says she doesn’t want to catch feelings for me because she thinks I’ll break her heart, but then she also is going back to a guy that’s already done it once. She says she’d date me if I didn’t live across the country, but I do, so she’ll go back to her ex instead but still wants to be friends because we ‘have so much in common’. And that hurts so much, on a base level— like she admitted she thinks I’m hot, that we get along really well, that she would date me, but then she goes back to an ex who mistreated her for bs reasons.

Girl Numero Dos: met her online as well, and at first everything was going great— we were having fun texting back and forth, and she admitted she found me cute. Over time, school started and conversations got dry, which was both of our faults— I couldn’t put that much effort into conversations, neither did she. Yesterday she unadded me on Snapchat. 

I’m pissed off, really. I don’t understand how in both cases it went from ‘yeah you’re cute, I like you, our conversations are fun’ to ‘yeah I just want to be friends while I go back to my cheating ex’ or ‘i’m ghosting you’. I’m pissed off.

81,"I was doing so well— finally socializing outside of my small bubble, becoming confident in myself and my abilities, working my ass off to make my life better. I was looking forward to graduating from college and having the best summer celebration.

All I can do right now is, selfishly, think about every little moment I lost over the past several months. What could have been. I don’t socialize now, I rarely leave my apartment, I “work” 9-5 every day (but can’t concentrate), and I don’t have any purpose or anything to look forward to. It’s like all my hard work has gone to waste.

I’ve lost a family member this summer. I’ve lost friendships I thought were doing so well. I’ve lost a potential relationship with someone I really liked.

I don’t know what to do to make life worth living again. Who knows when we will be able to go out and live properly in this world again. Especially with the US’s potential political demise....

This is a huge help, thank you to everyone who takes a second to complete this. I'm hoping to pinpoint the problem in the home as there is not a lot of specific research pointing to what factors are contributing to in-home falls, when, and why.

85,"Only read if you want to read about a very tired man.

Something is wrong with my wife psychologically or neurologically. After months of asking her (and then begging her) to see what’s wrong, she finally began. She’s very medically avoidant. She’s never had a primary care physician despite having good insurance. It’s made more difficult now due to the pandemic.

Well, my patience has been ground down to nothing. I’m quicker to get frustrated at things that I would have been able to tolerate before. Little things like complaining that a movie is boring in the first five minutes, leaving food out over night so it has to be thrown away. I.e. real but minor irritations that normally wouldn’t really get to me, but I’m riding around so beat up that each bump feels like I’m going off the road.

But I can’t even voice legitimate problems without ending having to a) console her or b) dismiss her feelings of abandonment that come to a head whenever I’m upset with her. I’ve never walked out on her or given her any reason to think I would. We’ve been together *fifteen years*.

My close friends are also close friends of hers. Closer to me, and I could talk to them about it all, but I don’t want to affect her friendships.

I figured I’d take up skiing again since it’s outside and generally COVID safe. Well she pouted that I’d be gone most weekends. (She can’t ski for medical reasons.) We see each other every day, and we don’t go out because there’s a pandemic. I plainly explained that she can’t expect me to just sit in the house with her all the time.

To pile on, my job has reassigned me and I loathe my new position. It’s temporary so I’ll just deal with it. By itself, I could tolerate the irritation, but I feel like I’m being worn down both at home and at work.

My family isn’t behaving as they should during the pandemic, and hers is even worse. Mine are in multiple overlapping circles. Hers is a step below full blown denialists.

Finally, my father is in the hospital. It’s probably cancer. He’s not in great health generally, so if it is cancer he probably won’t last long.

To conclude, I am beleaguered. I am ill-equipped to deal with everything going wrong at the same time.",01Oct2020,1

Sometimes I may just eat a half of tuna sandwich, maybe a croissant and a chicken wing or two as well.

2 years ago, I made a rushed promise to God about not rechecking compulsively my boiler heater etc. I made the promise in order to force myself to stop doing that tiring compulsion.

I ate another red grape because I could not confirm that the first one was red, even though I knew it was. Does that somehow, counts as compulsive rechecking just, because I knew that the first one was red?

I worry because when I made the promise about not rechecking compulsively, I cant remember if I was speaking only about the boiler heater etc or for everything generally, that have to do with compulsive recheck. Did I break the promise? I am angry with myself again.

Someone makes a promise about not rechecking things compulsively

someone eats a red grape without memorizing the image that it is a red grape but knows that it was a red grape. He just, eats anotehr one just to be sure. He was probably, 99.9% that he ate a red grape. He just, could not bring the image-memory in his mind. Does it count as rechecking compulsively? I know there is no ""recheck"" in this case but the reason he ate another grape is because he could not persuade himself that the first one was red. so, he ate another.

97,"He has been working from home since the middle of March because of Covid, and it has been a gift and a curse. It's a gift because he's relatively anti-social and doesn't enjoy the rigamarole of going to work M-F, so being at home on his own computer is more comfortable and conducive to his needs. It's a curse because as time goes on, this anti-social mentality has only deepened and has instilled a bit of fear of going out into public at all (and of course the whole layer of not wanting to contract Covid...).

Today, his work team is taking a half-day to play mini-golf and eat lunch together (more importantly, ""the best chicken tenders ever!""). He was not going to go because he has had a cough for two weeks due to terrible seasonal allergies (the air quality was shitty even here in the mid-west from the fires out west, and we made the mistake of having a bonfire because the weather was perfect for it), and although he has no other symptoms he has been afraid of going anywhere (even the grocery store) because he doesn't want anyone to think he has Covid. He initially told his boss he wasn't going to go because of the cough, but as time got closer to today, he became more and more bummed that he couldn't go. He messaged his boss that he wants to go, but is afraid of the cough, and boss just said ""it's up to you!"" So I just said ""babe.. go. You want to. You don't have Covid. It's literally allergies. You're not contagious and you don't have a fever. I understand the caution, but you're fine."" He checked his temperature, which was around 87, and he decided he was going to go!

I have not seen this level of excitement in him in a LONG time. He was almost giddy. ""I gotta shave! Took a shower yesterday... what should I wear? Does this look ok??"" He was running around the house getting ready, and he just left not too long ago.

I'm proud of him. I'm also happy that he gets to see his work friends and play some mindless mini-golf and eat yummy chicky tendies (we're in our mid-30s, and tenders are still his favorite thing lol). I'm mostly happy that he went somewhere without me, because with that anti-social mentality he wants me to be with him always. I'm a very independent person and try to get him to be more of the same, so this is really good for him (and me!).

Sorry if this was long, I'm just really happy to see him get excited about something. This Covid life has been challenging in many ways, so any semblance of normalcy is welcomed.

103,"Marked NSFW just in case but it’s only cause a tit is mentioned several times.

So I’m an elite ski racer, right. I go to train in Europe with the national team and finally we get a day where we train with some higher speeds.

However this day is full of massive lines to get on the ski lift. I’m talking to the point where people are taking naps where they stand, propped up by the fact that the line is packed tighter than sardines in a can. The guy managing it all has already fucked off to oblivion and is nowhere in sight, except he occasionally appears to banish the line cutters, then promptly fucks off again.

And then even when we finally get to the top, it’s not over yet, because for some reason the only way to get to our course is to skate uphill on some god’s forsaken backwards catwalk. Catwalks are supposed to go downhill (or be flat, at the very least)... but this one had a special kind of audacity.

I withstood this all, just for one full run. The catwalk, however, was not the only thing that had the audacity this morning.

I get in the start and take about ten turns before disaster strikes. After all my effort I smash my face directly into a gate and somehow get flung through the air onto the ice. As I’m sliding down the hill, I have a few fleeting thoughts.

1. I may not have all of my teeth anymore

2. Oh god am I concussed

And 3, when I got up: My left tit has been absolutely obliterated.

Indeed, the gate had it out for one particular body part. It got whacked harder than Serena Williams’ tennis ball and nearly flew as far too.

105,"My partner and I have been stuck in the house (we’re in the U.S. where quarantine has lasted longer than other countries around the globe) since March. I’m immunocompromised so we’ve been TRULY quarantined. Like “No Exit” style  quarantine. Like so many other couples, being suddenly thrust into a reality wherein we’re constantly around each other every single moment of every single day was challenging, especially living in a tiny apartment. 

At first, we found ourselves butting heads. The butting heads would devolve into fights. The stress and the fear compounded things. It got to us. So, after a couple of months, we had a long talk about why this was happening, about how we felt about ourselves, about this new reality we suddenly found ourselves in, and about our relationship. We dug in deep. We determined to get to the very heart of our head-butting, no matter how uncomfortable that conversation may become. 

We realized that we both have our own wounds and hurts that we were bringing into our relationship, and the pandemic was illuminating these hurts and we were projecting them onto one another. We saw that this extended (sometimes seemingly endless) time in quarantine could either be spent squabbling, or we could use it to learn how to best be together, support one another, and improve ourselves as individuals. We could either continually wish for this time to speed by until normalcy returns, or we could savor our unfettered time together because life is indeed short, and wishing any of it away is a mistake. 

We started listening more to one another—truly, actively listening. Hearing what the other needs, even and especially if all the other needs is to be heard. We had quarantine date nights, dressing up just to make dinner in the kitchen together, light a candle and drink a little wine. We started playing games—we’d do improv games together and made it a real goal to laugh together, to play, to have fun inside our lil shoebox apartment in new and unexpected ways. We made gratitude a habit, telling each other specifics about our appreciation and love. Instead of jumping into animosity when something goes wrong or is aggravating, we chose to take a pause and have conversations not just about what was bothersome, but WHY whatever bothersome thing made us feel however we felt. We treated our relationship like a craft that we have to hone. 

I often wonder about how I’ll think of this period of time when years or even decades have passed since. I know I’ll look back with heartache because so much has been lost and our trials as a people have been so massive, but I also think I’ll look back at nights spent doubled over laughing with my partner, trapped inside and making the absolute best of it with fondness. I’ll think of nights pretending we’re at a swanky restaurant, dressed in all our finery at the kitchen island and feel grateful and nostalgic for those little moments. 

The world is hard. Home doesn’t have to be. I hope this helps reframe someone’s understanding of what this time can be for a relationship. Utilizing it as an experiment to see just how good we can be to and for one another certainly helped me.

These challenging times don’t have to be terrible in every way. We can spend this time well. We can spend it lovingly.",01Oct2020,1

108,"I consider myself a fairly generous person. I put others' needs above my own; often to a fault. I do so in many different ways, such as donating my time, energy, resources, lending an ear, a shoulder to cry on, often taking food off my own plate to give to others. As I've aged, I've gradually learned when to say 'no' and how to recognize people who are taking advantage of my kindness and generosity.

Outside of my family and friends, there are two material things that bring me great joy, one of which is craft beer.

Craft beer is something that I love to share experiences with anybody willing, open their minds, senses, and pallets to flavors and nuances they are usually unaware of. I really like good beer, but I love even more to share it with others.

It wasn't until recently that I realized my generosity does not extend to the other material thing that brings me great joy: chocolate chip cookies.

One of my sons' friends came over the other day and saw a brand new package of chocolate chip cookies on the counter. Nothing special about these cookies; just grocery store bakery purchased, and very easy to get more of. But when my sons' friend noticed them and asked for one my first thought was ""No. Those are my cookies."" This was such a foreign feeling and thought process to me that it struck me. For the next two days, I felt guilty for being selfish and not wanting to share with a 6-year-old who was asking to have just one of the twenty-four chocolate chip cookies in the container.

After much internal deliberation, I've decided that it is okay for me to be a little bit selfish with chocolate chip cookies. I will share them from time to time, but not at the level or frequency I do with other things. And I am now at peace with that.",01Oct2020,1
110,"OK I am going to preface this as saying im not trying to be edgy or cool. I have never told this sort of stuff to any one. I just want genuine advice on how I can deal with this shit, and if anyone has experienced anything similar. I dont want to be like this.

So I  am a 22 year old female. I am quite liked, normal looking, and am soon graduating from a prestigious professional school. I have Bipolar type 1 that is well manages, and see a psychiatrist regularly. Ever since being a kid, I felt like I wasn't quite right so I just want to explain some of my issues and see if anyone relates to them (using a throw away for obvious reasons). 

Flashback being in the Mcdonalds play centre- I see some kids walk in and I fantasize about torturing them and I feel turned on (I was maybe 7 years old, and I didnt know i was turned on but I had a tingly feeling down there). Things like this wasnt abnormal to me, however I knew it was bad so I never acted on it or mentioned it to any one.

I started masterbating at the age of 9, started watching porn at 11, started watching ""non consent porn"" at 12.

I had a love for horror movies as a young teen (normal), however some of these movies looking back are movies that I should have definitely not be watching at that age (Last house on the Left, I spit on your grave,120 days of sodom, Martyrs, human centipede, hostel- movies that had heavy rape and torture seasons). I fantasized to these movies, masterbated to these movies, and became almost obsessed with certain scenes. I have the feeling of being turned on by true rape victims (which is disgusting I know), and things like the tape from the ""Toy Box killer).

Intrusive thoughts of hurting myself and others has always been a norm for me. Hitting, slapping, breaking bones. Ever since I was young kid. I see visions of me snapping my fingers off, jumping out of moving cars, moving the steering wheel while in the passenger seat while a friend is driving on the high way.  I fantasize about killing myself all the time as well. I fantasize about being raped,  and hurting others as well.

I feel extremely self aware, and aware of peoples actions. I feel like I can manipulate people but I dont as I feel I have morals. However, sometimes I catch myself ""tricking people"", randomly lying, or attempting to control people I care for. I rarely do this though. But I feel as though I have this ability to harm people emotionally if I wanted to. I feel like I can seduce people for my own gain, and more or less fuck with  people. I have done this in relationships, and can act in a way to cause them to ""fall in love with me"" but my feelings rarely mutual (I do really care for people though) and I have always ended my relationships. I currently have a boyfriend who is a VERY VERY nice guy and i am trying hard not to do this shit, but patterns sometimes happen before I realize soon enough to catch them.

I love BDSM (however this is more normal), I love non consent, blood play, knife play, and I want to do more but many of my partners are hesitant.

My friends see me as liking cliche spooky things, but I keep the fucked up stuff to myself. I have never told this sort of stuff to anyone, as it would obviously limit and harm my relationships. However, I have this feeling of not being satisfied in life. I want the feeling of intensity of the things I have mentioned. BUT I dont want to be like this, I feel guilty, I feel gross, and I want to suppress it. I feel like I am a fraud. I feel like people see me as this pretty young lady who is nice, but I more or less feel pretty much like a terrible person.",01Oct2020,1

I was walking down the chip isle to pick stuff out for our kids that live with me full time. I look up and even though we had our masks on I will never forget her eyes. I immediately turn around and walk away. 

While walking away my heart sunk and I wanted to leave my cart full of food right there and leave the store. I didnt because I need to get this stuff because my kids are remote learning during covid. I quickly get in line and stare straight forward so I dont see her. Half way during unloading my cart I look up (stupid me) and there she is and I look her in the eyes again. I paid and left, loaded my stuff in the trunk and took off. Half way home I start to have a anxiety attack. I cant help but feel all those terrible feelings she made me feel for so long. Luckily I have amazing kids to come home to and an amazing dog. 

Thanks for reading guys, I just dont really have anyone to share this with and it helps writing this out. I love you all stay safe.",01Oct2020,1
123,"I think I am smarter, more hard working, funnier, more charismatic, more likable, and better looking than anyone I know. I’m the most attractive person I know personally, and If I wasn’t myself I would date me. I’ve been told a bunch of times that I “live in my own world” but isn’t it normal to view yourself on a pedestal compared to others or am I just a narcissist?",01Oct2020,1
124,"Not sure how but wanted to unburden the awfulness of being me. I did not take care of my father when he was alone. I am an Indian living in the US and he lived in India. I visited him and even had him live with me. But I am single and it felt really burdensome as I was busy with work and caring for him. I am the only caregiver and he went back and I visited him as much, but he passed away. He wanted me to take care of him permanently. He was not immobile but I just felt I could have done better by him. But I am the only caregiver and if he lived in the US with me, if something were to happen to me, there was no one to care. Not sure but I feel awful and many a time I get depressed for my own actions. I was his family and I let him down.",01Oct2020,1
125,"So, for context, the family dog was put down last Wednesday.

My mother was getting into her car when she noticed something fluttering around in the footwell. It turned out to be a white feather.

Apparently, white feathers are often thought to be the dead trying to communicate. She googled it and found it was also special if in somewhere like an automobile.

I'm not a huge believer of the afterlife or signs or whatever but what's even weirder was she found this precisely a week after his death.

Still, there are still flaws in it; The feather could have blown in, it could be a coincidence it was a week later but I think it's pretty Wholesome.",01Oct2020,2
126,"We all like Reddit to a certain extend. At least the minimum necessary to continue using the site. The platform, though, has changed throughout the years and depending on how long you use it, you might have seem a shift in its values compared to when it started to where we are right now.

Now everything is consolidated, we have lots of annoying ads, we have stupid coins that doesn't add much value to the discussion. But that is OK, they do it because they are a company and have to pay for the cost of having the website running, and have the cost of paying their employees and their executives and investors. It is a business, not a charity, right?

Except when they outsource the work. Then it is OK to ask for labor without compensation and wash their hands because ""fuck you, we do business, but only when you are the one giving the money. Other than that you are a helpful Redditor who should do it for free because you believe it! In other words: we care only about your credit card, not your bank account.""

A month ago the Reddit Admin  [u/Baroness\_Bear](https://www.reddit.com/user/Baroness_Bear/) posted asking for French translation to the French community. [This is the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/i18n/comments/ihpgvc/are_you_interested_in_helping_translate_reddit/).

You can see in the comments some users concerned about compensations. In which the admin readily replied:

&gt;This is a volunteer program so if you are interested you can suggest as many or as little translations as you'd like as well as participate in voting.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no tangible benefit to volunteering at this stage.

I can understand that there are people who would like to accept the volunteer position because they believe on the value they are generating. If your friends don't use reddit and you think it is because it doesn't support your language, I get that you might want to help this issue. But I find horrible Reddit seeking for it. It is exploitation of work. Unpaid hours of service. With the mask that it is for the community. If it is for the community, why is it never an option to reduce ads or price of coins to the point where the site just pays itself? Why not do it for the community, Reddit? It would make everyone have a stronger feeling of belonging, since no one would be profiting, right? But this is never the option because this site is a business, and not a small project trying to consolidate itself and needing help from its users without proper compensation.

The same admin, now 8 days ago, is trying to expand this unpaid work project. Now seeking the Brazilian community. [On this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/i18n/comments/iydth3/are_you_interested_in_helping_translate_reddit/) they are saying the exact same thing. The tactics is to make a post pretending it is a good thing to work for free (without saying it is for free on the post of course), and avoiding all the concerns on possible payments. For me this is ridiculous.  Not only they are seeking for translators, but also managers (or *moderators*, so they don't have to use a real professional word in case we aren't paying attention). Technical and executive positions without payment. How is this acceptable?

On top of that, if you know Portuguese and read the post you will see that there are 14 year old users agreeing with it. **Unpaid child labor** is really the way to go, Reddit? Are you really pushing for this?

I don't know how well Reddit does in other countries, but from a marketing perspective Brazil is a great prospect for the site. The country has a population of hundreds of millions, with a high amount of people using websites all the time, but that also resist to use websites that don't have support for their language. Facebook only got real in Brazil when they added Portuguese. Now it is the top 4 country on there. Before that, the preferred social network was one called Orkut. It was a side project from Google and I think you might not even heard of it before. But it was popular because it was the first to have support for Portuguese. The site died and Brazil didn't migrate to Facebook until they added support for Portuguese. Brazil didn't even use myspace. 

Now Reddit thinks it is acceptable to ask for free labor just because it will increase your feeling of belonging in the community? My big fat ass!! I believe this is wrong. If this was 10 years ago I would understand. But today? One of the most visited websites? Give me a break.",01Oct2020,4
128,"I am a really happy person. M17, living a normal life, graduating this school year, got plans for jobs etc. While my plan is going to Germany and joining the air traffic control, I discovered another job which I believe is extremely great.

Some days ago I watched some 'behind the scenes' videos from my favourite movies, The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner. What actually is behind the scenes is more amazing than the movies itself.

I saw the tributes becomming close friends over such a short timespan, how much fun they had. Those are friends you have for an entire lifetime. And most of them were still so young, in their teen years. I just can't imagine how amazing it could be to have friends you got close to in a few days.

This kind of daydreaming started two days ago. The reason why I'm writing this post is, that I just now realized, that I only imagined the fun about the job, not the popularity. And thinking more about the job 'actor', it's mostly associated with popularity, not making friends and family. 

I am kind of shocked, that I still don't care about the popularity aspect of being an actor and rather wish to be one for the fun part.

It's kind of putting me in a sad mood thinking about all of this, but also makes me extremely happy to imagine what could be only in a dream.

Thanks for reading &lt;3",01Oct2020,1
