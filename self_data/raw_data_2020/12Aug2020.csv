(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I’m very shy and quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

◾️the next interview she chose me for I had the next week she never said anything like this at all again and she even filled out the whole application form for me for it and I didn’t ask",12Aug2020,1
2,I'm literally fucking numb right now. Sure it was only 6 months but she said she loved me. I asked if they were separated or something and nope. Apparently they are supposedly happily married. I'm just fucking blown away. Obviously I broke it off but she won't stop trying to contact me. I literally think she's insane now because she is showing zero regret or emotion about it. Oh and I did ask if he knew and she said no. I only found out because I signed up for Facebook (because I was told it was strange I didn't have one) and was adding people and searched her name and she's listed as married. Fuuuuuuck!

its not people having a go at me that is truly getting to me it is that i am influencing people and demotivating them and that is what really gets to me i only became famous through hard work and i want other people to work hard and feel what i felt but when people are in my presence they basicly say no im not doing anything cus hes here.

i have felt nothing but torture in my stomach for at least 2 weeks as i slowly started to notice what my presence was doing to other people. 

i had a panic attack last night just randomly i used to get them every month a long time ago now i had not had them for years, i keep crying randomly.

most people in this situation would just vanish but i am far too passionate about what i do to just vanish being famous doesnt matter to me what matters is the art and that i create new artists and that they become great artists but people are seeing me and saying i dont want to be an artist.

12,"Hello,

I'm in my first year of college in England. I have felt like I'm behind / less knowledgeable than the other students in my class right from the start. This has only been increased by the online-learning.

After fighting the college, I have been given the option to retake my first college year, and start college again. However I'm just not certain of what I want to do.

I feel I'm really behind, so it *may* help to restart. But it means I've lost a year of my life, I'll lost the friends that I've made, and I'll have to resit literally the exact same lessons for another year.

I was offered this a couple of months ago, the deadline to decide is the 26th of August. I've been ignoring it up until now, as my mental health has been fragile enough as it is, and this is just pushing me over the edge.

Any advice would be appreciated.",12Aug2020,1
13,"So, at my last job, I was essentially hired to reinforce stereotypes about foreign people (apparently they didn’t count on me being fluent in the local language). 

There were a bunch of bizarre bullshit rumors circulating about me. One of the weirdest was an INSISTENCE that I lived at a sharehouse with a boyfriend. I have never, ever lived at a sharehouse and hadn’t dated anyone in years at that point. Several staff members would ask me about the sharehouse and every time I told them no, there is no sharehouse, I rent a normal apartment and live with just a friend, but apparently that wasn’t good enough because when corporate came to evaluate me they mentioned it (as if it were fact) and (after initially thinking they had someone else’s file) I had to explain the weird story someone came up with and how people kept asking about that nonsense. One of the corporate guys looked at me skeptically and then asked AGAIN if there was a sharehouse. 

+bonus points to the assholes who thought that because I brought my own food due to dietary restrictions that it meant I didn’t like the local cuisine and couldn’t wait to go back to “my” country and date men from there (I would NEVER).

14,"
So basically this girl was (and I suppose kind of still is?) my best friend. We started our first job together about 4 years ago and just instantly clicked, we went from being work friends to talking outside of work, to hanging out a little, then a lot, then everyday, you get the idea. It was the first time I’d been that close with anyone I think, I mean I have quite a few friends but I’ve never connected with someone on a deep, emotional level like I did with her. We were inseparable. Eventually that friendship turned into more for me, I couldn’t get enough of being around her, I’d had crushes before but this was a step beyond that.

But she had (and still has) a boyfriend, and as time went on it got harder and harder for me to be around her as ‘just friends’. I couldn’t eat properly, all I done was think about her when I wasn’t with her, and when I was with her most days I just wished it was more. My grades suffered, I was just completely wrapped up in her. Eventually I realised I couldn’t go on working with her and hanging out with her all the time like this, so I quit my job (she quit straight after I did) and shortly after laid out how I felt. She told me her boyfriend was her priority and all that stuff, and we basically both agreed it would be best if we didn’t talk. To this day I’m convinced there was something more between us, it was so intense between us, but she made her choice and I knew I just had to accept it and move on with my life.

Fast forward a few (brutally hard) months of not talking to her at all, and she reached out to me and told me she was sorry for how things were between us, but she needs me in her life. I was happy, I’d felt awful for messing things up that bad between us and was just glad to be able to talk to her again, but I still wasn’t completely over her, and I knew I couldn’t be as close to her as I was before for my own sake. It would drive me insane. Since her boyfriend knew what happened I knew she’d want space too, so while we messaged each other most days, we didn’t hang out really and kept each other at arms length.

It’s been a couple of years since then, and I’ve moved on. I’ve had major crushes on other girls that aren’t her, and over time and with distance between us my feelings for her kind of died down. I wouldn’t say they’re completely gone; I genuinely think she was the first person I ever really fell in love with, I’ve still never felt the way for anyone I did for her at the peak of our friendship. I think I’ll always have a little thing for her at least. We still message everyday, but we’ve literally only seen each other in real life a handful of times since all that happened. The thing is, even though I don’t really ever think about my feelings for her other than as a kind of fond memory, the times I have seen her in real life it’s like it’s all kind of flooded back. Being around her, no matter how long it’s been and how much the feelings have died down, kind of makes me start falling for her a little all over again.

So basically, while we’re still good friends and we’re in each other’s lives, I’ve done everything I can to keep myself at arms length from her and kind of avoid hanging out with her. The thing is, I feel like as time’s gone on things are getting a little weird. Like every time we get closer again (which just kind of happens) and she suggests we hang out I’m always looking for an excuse. Tonight she’s pretty drunk, and messaged me saying she really fucking misses hanging out with me and that she feels like things might kind of ‘be over’ between us if we don’t see each other soon.

So like, basically, I don’t know what to do. I’ve moved on man. We can’t be together, and it’s been the hardest thing I’ve had to do, but I accepted it and moved on. But I just know that if we hung out like we did before and were that close again I’d fall for her again. I just know it. And I can’t do that again man. But I get her point that it’s weird we don’t hang out anymore, and that our friendship doesn’t feel the same, but like, what’s the answer here? I can’t go back to how it was before, I thought there was a kind of silent agreement between us that we shouldn’t be that close again. We’ve never talked about how I felt about her since, but I mean it’s out there and it’s always like the elephant in the room with us. Clearly though she wants us to be close again, but I just don’t know if it would work. What should I do?

**TL;DR:** Was best friends with a girl, hung out every single day. Had feelings for her, she had a boyfriend, I told her and we distanced ourselves from each other. Fast forward a couple years, we’re friends again now, but she wants us to be as close as we were before and while I’ve moved on, I feel like if we were that close again I’d fall for her again. What should I do?",12Aug2020,1
15,"I've realized people all have unique things they like to collect and I love learning about what they do for example: my mom loves collecting Tweety, she has plushies from early 90s to about now. One of my friends likes collecting hot wheels, an older coworker loves collecting wrestling memorabilia. I've also realized there still a stigma on people expressing what they like to collect or what they do on spare time.  There's always someone trying to say it's trash or do something else.

16,"I kind of just want to discuss this with people just to talk about it and get it out my brain and absorb courage to cut them out my life. Forgive me, this might be long but This is the most manipulative friend/person I have EVER dealt with. 

I(F) don’t follow my friends(28M) page nor have a twitter account I actively use. My friend is aware I don’t actively use twitter and a few weeks ago I found out he had been making tweets about me specifically, using my first and last name and saying rude things about me. He uses his twitter primarily, Facebook or Snapchat to vent/trash/rant about any and everyone he has problems with. He will make these posts in real time as the arguments are happening or he makes his tweets first and then at some point will address the issue with the person he has the problem with...sometimes he will just keep tweeting for a week+ about the issue as a way to avoid confronting it or get the other person to bring it up so that it seems as HE doesn’t have a problem, because he didn’t bring it up. Some/most of these tweets and posts about me and others are beyond disrespectful. He also calls out my family and friends(that he’s never met) by first and last name in the posts and will repeatedly demonize them. 

I have never specifically referenced his tweets that bother me and honestly I’m not sure it’s something I want to address at this point as, the posts directed at me just keep coming and I’m kind of glad I know how he really feels now so I’m not sure there’s much to talk about. He also is the type of person to try and hurt me by hurting someone(s) I care about, hence calling out my friends and family. So my biggest fear is him trying to turn every one I have a healthy relationship with, against me.

I try to get him to talk to me directly about problems and he rarely does but when he does, 98% of the time he’s the victim, even if the problem was caused by him somehow I every time I make him feel just AWFUL AND TERRIBLE, because I’m such a bad disrespectful person. He’s usually very quick to say we should just end our friendship instead of just talking about the problem after he’s gotten his words out. But a few hours-days later he will come give me this sob story about how much he cares about me and appreciates me and how good of a person I am and how much he needs me in his life and I’m tired of it. 

Bottom line, he’s becoming a shitty person and i dont think I want to help build him up again....I don’t think I have it in me anymore. We’ve been friends for so long and I’m baffled this is how he repeatedly treats something he values as much as he claims. He repeatedly does things I don’t like after I’ve asked him not to and pushes me to the point that I raise my voice or lose my temper, never mind that he can raise his voice towards me and still decide I AM the problem, I AM the reason this all happens. He has explicitly told me nothing is more important than his hobbies/passions, including me specifically, in an angry way and then flipped and decided to shower me with compliments and positive things. 
I do feel he has some underlying mental health issues that ignite this behavior but I believe he’s convinced he’s just superior and prides himself on lack of emotion.


TL:DR; I need courage to end a toxic relationship where I’m being disrespected and belittled behind my back via social media posts because of boundaries I have set for an overbearing friend.",12Aug2020,1

19,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

But deep down, I’m really hurt. For the last 15 years I don’t think I’ve ever missed her birthday. She makes hers a priority and all her other friends as well. I see her almost every other weekend and go to all her events  and make it a priority - I feel so undervalued as a friend and feel like such an afterthought. She forgot my birthday last year too. I already have really low self esteem so it hurts even more. 

Basically just needed a place to vent. It hurts when people don’t reciprocate and I just don’t understand it. She’s not the first friend I go out of my way for that just doesn’t reciprocate.

31,"Hello

26M Canadian. I have been a regular with a sex worker at a massage parlour over the the month of July and a few times so far in August. I had before not partaken in this before except a couple times in January. Last session a few days ago, she told me I was her best client, that I was generous, and that I put her needs before mine. Indeed, I always made sure to treat her with the the highest respect, ask before doing anything and make sure to ask if she's comfortable as all the acts ensued. I habitually tipped $40 for $300 full service and last times tipped $100, $90, and $75 respectively. Treating her well was extremely important to me. And, it was great to hear that from her. However, during the last session, After all was done, she was adjusting her hair. So, I commented: ""you look much better with your hair this way"". I honestly only meant to compliment her and my intention was really well meaning. However, a few days later, at home, it occurred to me that this statement may not be construed as a compliment since it includes a qualifier. I honestly feel bad I worded it this way. I should have said: ""this hairdo is good"" or something. I fear this statement, unperceived to me, may have been somewhat disrespectful as I uttered it when I only ever meant to compliment. I really really meant to praise her but the way I worded it may have removed from that effect. I cannot stop thinking about it and I feel bad I should not have worded it this way :( especially after she told me how she appreciated me as her best client. Do you think this may have been displeasing in any way? I have no way to tell if she was displeased by it. However, the meeting ended on very good terms as I remember. I also remember I followed up this statement with ""you're so beautiful"" so I don't know. I don't have her contact information so I cannot contact her and apologize. So, I would have to see her again to do so. However, I do not feel the need for another session. It was my 7th session for the period of July-august and a number of times, I felt compelled to go because I did not want to disappoint her if I didn't show up again especially since she'd said she'd want to see me again. I wasn't planning on going again after the last session or perhaps I was planning on maybe going for another session some months from now when actual need arises (sexual urge etc). But, now my anxiety found another reason (this statement I told her) to go again and apologize but that also means paying for another session I don't need. Tbh, I don't even know if she would remember it or even that she minded it. If I wait until a potential next session, if it is to happen, say months from now, then I may stress over this in the meantime. Should I really go for another session to apologize?

Thank you very much in advance. I overthink everything and thus I really apologize for this question",12Aug2020,1

I lost my son eleven days ago.  He committed suicide,  as he had severe emotional issues ftom horrible and I mean horrible things that happened to him when he was young. He had just be diagnosed,  two months ago with severe Ulcerative Crones disease... He went to Europe. There was no Stelara ( crones Med) there. He knew he’d suffer ...He thought he’d be happier far away. He always thought he be ok far away. Never stayed in one place too long.   He was so sick from a flare up of his crones he went from 175lbd to 110lbs.  He was a Skelton.  His bones sticking out. His pictures made me cry and cry and cry.  He then felt very vulnerable and he couldn’t live with  “not having power”.  as someone evil took his power away when he was young. Someone offered him to stay at there house- there were sick gross people but he thought everyone was nice like him.    He also had brain damage from a previous suicide attempt gone wrong. So then my son had brain damage so he believed everything anyone said. He was 30 so I could not force him to stay home. He kept leaving home.  Running away from himself. always going to places far away and many times dangerous countries. But when he travelled before,   he was sharp, smart, aware picked out lies, bs and could smell bad situations. No one could fool him. A man and his wife did quite the number on him. His health was failing.  He knew with crones he couldn’t travel anymore.  He wanted to come home to us but he was a 14 hour flight away. He was took weak saw no hope and was doing a podcast while overdosing. I am loosing it. I love him so much. He was my sage as he was so book smart and school smart. If something scared me even though I’m his mom he helped me,  he would stay on the phone for hours with me- talking making sense of things. He wouldn’t say good buy until he saw in my face I was ok. We spoke or texted everyday. It’s 11 days. I want him back. I cant walk. I dont want to see light. I dont want to eat no appetite not only that’ but I want to go join him. He was my everything.

36,"Yesterday at about 6 in the afternoon, I went out to clean my pool, I used a pool vacuum to get up leaves and dirt. I noticed the pool skimmer in the opening for the filter, when I pulled it away I saw something tiny and black hanging from the side, half in the water. At first I thought it was a dead mouse so I got out the pool and wet around the outside to the filter. I popped the lid off from the basket area to see and it was a baby bat that was alive. I let my grandma know and she took it out with a net, note I didn't touch the thing at all and it flew away once out the pool, I'm worried because since it was a bat during the day idk if it was rabid, and last thing I need is to die from rabies. I didn't get bit or anything. But I'm worried about water transmission if that's possible, idk how close it was when it was swimming around and got stuck.",12Aug2020,1

39,"Hey I (21F) am from guatemala I’m an international student living with my aunt, and honestly it’s been the worst depression I’ve ever had and I need some help. This comes from long ago. I’ve been looking for love through sex since I started having sex. I needed approval and I wanted so bad to feel loved that I started saying “yes” when I truly wanted to say “no”. When I was 15yrs people started to slut shame me for things that didn’t even happen, but I’ve been believing that’s true since. I was raped at 16 by one of the “popular guys” a friend of a friend (I really didn’t know him) I opened a case for him to be investigated... but i was too scared to follow it and be called names, so i cancelled it. Couple months later I got pregnant with my best friend. We arranged to pay half and half of the abortion (which my mom had to pay) but my ✌🏽”best friend”✌🏽spent it all in drugs and alcohol. 

Then when I was 18 I got pregnant with my boyfriend that I had since we were 15 (we were always on and off) he was physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive. He threatened me to move to move to his mom’s house. One day we had a huge fight and he pushed and punched me. I moved to my parents house again. Two weeks pass and I start bleeding. I call my doctor that Sunday and he said to drink some medicine but that night I started with labor pain and just bleeding like crazy. My mom takes me to the doctor and he said “your baby it’s been dead for quite a bit” and he said it was two weeks. So I had surgery to remove the rest of the baby that was still inside. After this started the partying and the drugs. 

At 19 was the first time I tried cocaine. It started once every while, then the once a month, and then it ended with once or twice a week. It never affected my life so drastically, but I would have depressions that made me want to kill my self. 

Last year, at 20, my aunt offered me to come to the US so I could change my life and study. It’s been a year since I first got here and a lot has happened. I dated a Brazilian boy who ghosted me after we had sex and after came the best boy I’ve ever dated. This guy had goals, smart, handsome, he was weird and a complete gentleman but he was never living in affirmation words or touching ( my love languages) so we always had issues and it was mostly me, because I needed affection. At the end of the relationship he tried to control me and change me. On February this year we broke up and ever since I’ve been scared of not finding someone like him and it’s terrifying. I sometimes think how a person like him could be with someone like me. It’s painful.  It’s now August and still think about him every single day. 

I met a boy at work and I kinda liked him but he was an asshole. One day we went out and I got super drunk and had sex with him. We had sex for a couple more times, but every time he was just thinking about his pleasure so I was like WTF. Fast forward today, I had sex with him on Saturday and made me realize that I’m having sex with him because it’s the first one that got interested in me after a while, and his body is just exactly as my exes. 

I need help knowing how actually have boundaries, how to love, value and respect myself please. PLEASEEEE.",12Aug2020,1

42,"Well technically in September I will have lost my job

I work in a daycare as an assistant teacher (although because of covid I have been acting head teacher since May), been working there for about 4 years altogether now and today my boss let me know that since I'm going back to school in September they can no longer accommodate my schedule. 

I literally asked for one day off.

One of my coworkers came into my classroom today to find out what my availability will be like for the fall and I told her I'm available anytime for whatever amount of hours they needed me except for Wednesdays as I have a class all day that day. An hour later I get an email from the director (her office is 2 doors down from my classroom she could have come talked to me face to face but she has been avoiding me for weeks) telling me that they are not accepting anyone not working for the full 5 days and I needed to commit to 5 days (her words). 

Well, I cant. I have classes. I am a student and my education comes first. 

She writes back, ""I understand. Unfortunately I need you the 5 days. If you are unable to work the 5 days I wont be able to accomodate you this year.""

Now I'm sitting here confused and angry and wanting to cry. I basically just lost my job. I don't understand why all of a sudden working 4 days instead of 5 is a problem? This has been my work schedule for the past year since I started school again, they knew when they hired me that I would be going back to school for my degree (which is in the same field btw) I made sure they knew that unfortunately my schedule would have to change every semester but for the most part I have been able to keep it in good balance. Why is it now all of a sudden a problem??

48,"This is my first post here so it might be really long, but I'm looking forward to the input I receive. Also I may jump around with information, so I apologize ahead of time. 

 I am a 22 yo male. I have ADHD, anxiety, and what I can only imagine is mild depression. I live with my brother in an apartment. I have a good job that I work M-F. With COVID still being a fairly big issue in my state, I socially distance and isolate most days due to my brother being immunocompromised. We spend most of our days (if not working or making a run to the store) at home.

 At work, I do my best to put in hard work, but like to goof around with my co-workers when possible. I like to make them laugh and don't take any smack talk too seriously. I know they mean no harm and I can dish it out as well as I can take it. 

When I'm working, I do my best to do things right as quickly, yet thoroughly as possible. I make mistakes as any human does, but I have always been extremely hard on myself mentally. I tend to really berate myself subconsciously for little mistakes I make, even if it hardly effects the work flow. I also dislike the way I look. I dress as well as I can to try to counteract my negativity towards myself.  I don't know when I started to do this to myself this brutally, but it certainly started before COVID. Its just gotten worse recently. I will tell myself things that part of me knows or at least partially believes isn't true, while my other half has no faith in my mental or physical abilities. It is something I feel has affected my social skills and confidence and has ruined my ability to be able to trust myself to be a good friend or brother, etc. I have not made very many friends outside of my job, (other than a couple online friends explained in next paragraph) and I don't really know what I should do to try to make new friends whom I could hang out with regularly. To be completely honest, the thought of it scares me and I hate it. I haven't really let on to my co-workers that this is a problem I have because I don't want them to treat me any differently. I love the people I work with and my job. The only person at my job who knows about my mental health is my manager. He told me he was surprised, and that he didn't know a lot about what it was like, but he would do his best to keep it in mind when giving me feedback on my work performance. I have told him that his criticism is much appreciated because I do want to better myself and make myself available to be promoted. He has checked on me every day to make sure that I'm doing alright and some days he can tell I'm not entirely myself. Its hard to not break down on those days but it just takes some time to breathe and get back in my mindset for work. Due to the other current events that are taking place, the company I work for has brought forth a discussion topic for us to go over during meetings each week. Its to let everyone who wishes to voice their opinions or experiences about whatever topic (whether its racism or mental health, etc.) to do so at a designated time. With that, I have learned many things about my co-workers I might not have otherwise known and I'm quite thankful for them sharing, but I don't know if I'm ready or comfortable with sharing my current situation about my mental health with them for fear of them not understanding or not treating me the same way they currently do. I don't want people to walk on eggshells around me. 

I don't have many hobbies, but I do play video games and have made a couple of friends while playing. Lately, they have been busier with their own lives and so I don't talk with them as much. I try to ask how they are or just say hello every couple of days. They also live across the country so meeting up with them is out the picture as well. My social skills have greatly decreased since high school and I haven't dated anyone since a year after graduating. Its partly to do with me feeling as if I'm not equipped with the skills to be a great friend or significant other. I have tried to make new friends, but a lot of times I end up feeling outcasted, whether it was all mental or I really didn't gel with the people. It has reinforced the things I tell myself because I have not really had much success. I don't feel like I'm equipped for dating either. I don't want to bring someone else down or disappoint someone else because I can't even really lift myself up or love myself. I have tried to make attempts, but most of the time they aren't successful. I have had girl after girl ghost me and I can't really get a reason why, so it loops back to the same old breaking myself down or blaming myself for them not wanting to talk to me anymore. I dabbled with Tinder but just was not having any luck even getting past the initial conversations. I deleted it because I came to realize how toxic it was, but I still had no experience or know how into introducing myself or being confident with in-person interactions. I guess I can ask about this type of stuff on another sub. I'm not entirely sure.  Just figured it would help to add for some more information.

If you could give me something to work with or just give me cold hard facts, I guess some reassurance might help me. I greatly appreciate any and all who take the time to read and pass along knowledge or advice. 

Also, if you're experiencing something like this and don't feel like commenting, PM is totally welcome. I don't mind being a vent/rant recipient. 

TL;DR I am extremely hard on myself and don't trust myself to be a good friend or trust my decision making. I'm not sure what I need to do to fix this problem. It seems hardwired at the moment. Any input is greatly appreciated.",12Aug2020,1

50,"My dog is 9 years old, German Shepard mix, and lately she’s been slowing down a looooot. She doesn’t get up to greet my dad when he gets home from work, is tired all the time, and doesn’t want to go for long walks with me anymore. I read that that is a sign of cancer and I’m just so fucking scared 

I can’t bear to lose her like she is my angel and my main reason for living. I got her when I was 10, so she’s been with me for half my life, really. I even met one of my best friends through her because he came up to pet her in 6th grade. To know her is to love her. I’ve had so many people tell me they were afraid of dogs, and my dog helped them get over it. She is the sweetest, gentlest girl, and would never hurt anyone. She only barks when she can’t tell who is at the door, and she never jumps. She even doesn’t eat our food— I left some peanut butter apples out on the porch, and she only sniffed them! Didn’t even take one! Everyone I know adores her, except for two barky annoying dogs down the street. She gets along with everyone.

This year has taken so fuckinng much from me. I really can’t take another loss. In January my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and although he’s doing okay right now, it’s doubtful that the cancer will ever go away. Because of this, I had a complete breakdown in January as well, because we really thought he was going to die. and then, because of the pandemic, I couldn’t go to school. I had to come back and live at home, so I’ve lost my autonomy, I can’t work anymore, I have lost all my friends, we still talk but it’s not the same as seeing them every day. I’m so depressed and I really just can’t take much more. Walking My dog is one of the few joys I have. I am going to call the vet in the morning, but right now, I just can’t sleep. please pray for us, if you’re the praying sort.",12Aug2020,1
53,"My life would be 100x better if I had a different dad

He always takes out his anger on me, beats me, insults me, intimidates me and wonders why I’m depressed.

He says something and tells me to do something his way, I add on to his comment and tell him I know an more efficient and smarter way to do it. I’m “talking back” so that’s me pinned across the wall with my head slammed first, him piercing into my soul like he does same as usual, I used to cry and shit but he doesn’t get much of a reaction anymore, I’m apathetic, I’ve been hurt too much to give a shit anymore and I gaze back into the abyss which is his cold, cold eyes

He tells me to “think” a certain way, I KNOW he’s wrong and I correct him, and cite internet sources for example, we both know the sky is blue, I’m not gonna believe someone tells me the sky is red unless they show me facts, evidence, etc. he told me all that shits fake and statistics don’t matter I told him if statistics don’t matter at all, why is he always trying to tell me about the rate of black people being shot compared to other people and why is he and I wearing a mask in a pandemic if the numbers don’t matter? I could’ve sworn that he almost chipped the bottom of my left lower jaw and he told me his punch was a “reaction”

I’ve been dealing with suicidal and negative thoughts since middle school due to my mistreatment, as always he comes in my room and he literally tells me to just “snap out of it”, I literally had no response to that.

My mother also uses him against me too, for example she tells me to do a chore. I tell her okay and I will do it at the soonest. She gets made and expects do “X” chore and if I’m not started immediately she calls him, he also gets mad at her and yells at her and shit, I’m not sure if he beats her or not, she probably got with him because of his great personality.

He tells me that looks don’t matter in life because he knows a guy that is generally “unattractive” and is successful in life, I respond that race does not matter in life, because Obama was president and he told me that I was cherry picking. I told him he was doing the same and your race is just another part of your looks and he punched the shit out of me, nearly giving me a black eye.

He’s a hypocrite, one time I went out with a relative because she knows I’m going through some shit and she paid for me to get some ear piercings. I got both ears pierced and he found out and called me a “faggot” over the phone, I told him having two piercings does not make you gay and asked him what’s wrong with being gay? I wanted to say this to him so bad over the phone but I knew I couldn’t “You know dad, it wasn’t too long ago when one group of people discriminated against another group of people but it wasn’t their sexual preference”, regardless, i took out my right earring before going to bed, woke up to find it missing.

He keeps telling me that one day I’m gonna be the boss of some major organization and one day all of my bullies will be working under me, I told him that’s not true and I even showed him the study of how bullies are more successful in life then he thinks. His response, “just be a bully then”

He keeps telling me there’s millions of girls , looks don’t matter and one is out there to date me. I told him the first part is true, and even if we did ignore the second part, of the human population was completely balanced 50% male 50% female, some of them will still not get together because some may be homosexual, and a few men may get dozens of women while some men get nothing at all. He told me he didn’t want to hear all of that “numbers bullshit”

He told me that he doesn’t want to hear about the rising suicide and mental illness rate In men but he will be the first to tell me to “lookout” if a Blackman gets shot on the news or something about crime statistics, but “numbers don’t matter”.

Maybe that’s the reason I’m continuously drawn to strange communities full of strange men that were cast out from their societies, I just want some people that give a fuck about me. I want some people to PROVE that I’m wrong with data, and statistics instead of getting pissed and trying to literally beat their ideals into me, I just want an actually family that loves me and the closest thing I could find that was those types of places

Ironically he tells me to not let my school bullies “take my happiness away from me”, that’s impossible, i doubt I ever had any to begin with in the first place and what’s the use when your biggest bully resides in your own home?",12Aug2020,1

83,"+trigger warning, suicide* 

For much of my life I have dealt with suicidal ideation. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder around the age of 14 but have likely had it since about the age of 10.. I know those ages are young, but you grow up a little faster when you’re severely bullied at school and just an intelligent little munchkin as is. 

Flash forward 13 years, and I’m still this self loathing insecure sack, holding on by just a thread. 

My therapist asked me the next time that I fall into a depression, especially one in which suicidal ideation occurs, that I write down every thought that I am feeling. She wants to understand just how deep this goes. Just how truly mean and awful I am to myself, and well... she got just that. 

The letter is extremely difficult to read, especially now that I am outside of that depressive episode. 

Mental illness is nothing to fuck with, friends. I’ve been fighting the good fight for every bit of 10 years or more. I genuinely don’t know if I see myself making it to 30 years old, but yesterday was my birthday and I made it to 23, so I guess that counts for something right?",12Aug2020,1

I’ve got two things going on so I’ll talk about them

The first thing is I was going to transfer schools but then it didn’t except me, the school I wanted to go to had my friends their, it had decent education and it was in my hometown but it didn’t want to me join half way through the year thought I was going to join term 3 where everything is changed so I don’t think I would have a problem with catching up but turns out they think I will

So I’ve been doing online school I started it term 1 and it’s term 3 now so that’s about 23 weeks I could be WAY off but I can’t remember off the top of my head it’s not that being at home is the problem it’s that I can’t learn things with just reading or listening I need someone to walk me through it and I’m the only person at my current school doing online so none of my teachers are doing zoom and I’m really falling behind because I can’t get help

And I won’t dare ask my parents for help they get annoyed or angry when I don’t get things right essentially my dad or they explain things in a way I don’t understand so I can’t ask them.

I kinda want to ask my friends too see if they can talk to the school about my situation but I don’t want to put this on them and I don’t want to poke the hornets nest.

Second problems I’m going through a whole lot of emotions I’m getting more angry and annoyed at thing more easily and I will randomly feel Terrible and I just have to sit through it because I can’t help it with anything, I have next to no motivation now and everything feels like a struggle

And to top all that off I just feel lonely I can really only see my friends on weekends and sometimes they are busy so I’m just alone all weekend sometimes and I don’t know if it’s just me but do you randomly get the feeling to snuggle up with someone, it just seems so nice and relaxing and I feel really lonely.

- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bits to me about how much she smells.

Edit: she’s Normally nice and she seems pleasant etc with me never had a problem with her before",12Aug2020,1
88,"Throwaway!

Today, I reached out to an ex I ended things VERY poorly with in March last year.  I was terrified to contact him, but it’s always felt unresolved, and I’ve always wanted to apologise and carried huge guilt about my behaviour (which was appalling, speaking frankly).

In the message I said I would like to apologise for some things, and despite the time that’s passed, if he wanted to hear what I had to say I would love to have the opportunity to say it.  I said the ball was in his court on responding.  I didn’t expect him to respond, but to my surprise he did.  He said I had nothing to apologise for and he was just grateful to have had the time together that we had.

I was absolutely floored at his graciousness and kindness.  I’ve been carrying this weight of guilt for so long.  And while it’s not true that I have nothing to apologise for (I absolutely do), I was overwhelmed by his forgiveness.

This has really shaken me in a profound way.  His ability to meet me with kindness despite my past behaviour... that’ll have me reflecting for a long time to come.

As simple as it may sound, I hate the job I got myself stuck in. My age and my gender may not play a role with how I hate my job, but I feel like I’m too young and too old at the same time. 

I’m a combat medic for the army, I’m coming up on my last year of service and I’m completely drained of energy, I’m becoming more lethargic as the days creep up closer to deployment and my end of service.

This job and my years dedicated to it has took its toll on my mental health and physical health.

I loved the army, I loved being physical and doing medical things (even if most of my time was spent in the motorpool on my broken vehicle handed down to me from leaders before), I loved being in another country on my first duty station…

Now I’m shouldering responsibility someone with a rank above me should be taking care of, I have soldiers to take care of( I love my soldiers to death and I don’t blame them for any of my shortcomings as a leader), I’m being disrespected left and right by new leadership in my platoon. Most of this is due to our deployment/rotation coming up fast and me being so useful (practically the last one of the senior medics who is staying and has been to the area that we are deploying to) on top of me refusing to re-enlist.

I just want my leave date to get closer man, I loved this job and now it’s leeching off of me.

All this includes job searching and making sure I have one once out. I’ve been good at finding jobs and securing myself in one with no problems with my co workers and management, so it’s only a little pressuring currently since I have certification in an applicable job skill opposed to being a high school student before.

I used to be part of the CPTSD subreddit. I’ve been through a lot of severe abuse in my brief existence on earth, and that sub was the only place I actually began to feel properly safe. The thing is, I did something really bad that not only affected my personal safety, but the safety of everyone else in the subreddit. I’m in a lot of pain right now, more so than usual. I was actually properly welcome there, I was part of a community. I was loved. And I’ve let everybody down. I’ve never felt more depressed and isolated than I am now. Idk if this is even the right subreddit to go to, but I just feel so alone. I completely ruined all of the progress I made in taking care of my mental health and I didn’t even mean to do any of it. I doubt anyone will actually care, but I could use some advice on how to move forward from this. I feel like I’d only just found my place in the world and it was suddenly snatched away again. What am I going to do?

EDIT: I’m too scared to say what I actually did. I’m so ashamed of it. I never had any bad intentions, which makes it even worse. I thought I was being brave and had no idea how dangerous the situation was. I just want anyone who reads this to know that I’m sorry and forgive me. I want to feel safe here again. I want to be able to process the hell I’ve been through in life, to have a supportive network of people who can truly understand me. That’s all I wanted. I’m heartbroken.

keywords bombastism rights violations Capitalism

=

There are two things we all know about our president.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 He is bombastic.

&amp;#x200B;

And, he has a very clear policy that his people are to ignore the social media, news, and press conferences.  He doesn’t manage extemporaneously.  The bombastism overwhelms us if we’re tuning in frequently, but he clearly has communicated to his people that they under no circumstances should do anything based on anything that he tweets, utters, writes, or jokes about or anything else, including as reported by the largest news media corporations.

&amp;#x200B;

You might think that this management style is political, but it’s principled.  He believes that these giant corporations, and not only the giant new media corporations, but all giant corporations, are some of the world’s most flagrant universal rights violators, and in the news media’s giant corporations they will show you their character in a unique way, that no other giant corporations are able to do, these giant corporations will show you their soul, because they are organizations that infringe our universal rights.  The last thing these giant news media companies want is for our president to win a second term, because they’re uncomfortable in his spotlight, because he’s calling them out, not only in public, but he’s using them to do it.  He is using them.  And on some level, they know it, and so they are doing what makes sense to do, they are electioneering for the Democrats.  ""Because the Democrats aren’t going to point out our flaws like the president is doing, the Democrats leave us alone,"" and nobody likes government scrutiny and interference in going about their business, but the president has the principled belief that giant corporations have no heart or soul, and more specifically and unambiguously, they are universal rights violators, and ultimately, what nobody sees, is that this is an embarrassment for people who consider themselves Capitalists, because this state of affairs can only exist in Capitalism, the “Wild West” of the economic theories.  Capitalism believes that people who own property are authorized to infringe the universal rights of the people who engage with your property, they just think that, generally speaking, people will not do that, but all the evidence says that they are wrong almost without exception.  If any bureaucrat in a giant corporation doesn’t like your haircut, e.g., they can tell you to change your hair---or they don’t like tattoos, or piercings, or those things in rare places.  Perhaps they're Catholics and you’re forbidden from cursing using the name of Joshua of Nazareth.  All these seemingly “death by a thousand cuts” rights violations are brought into sharper view when we know as our president knows, that our universal rights are what is called “indivisible”.  It means every one of our rights are equal in weight and in importance---i o w they are all of the same value---i o o w they are all the same.  You cannot violate one of them, in many ways, without violating them all together as a collection of our universal rights.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, the president clearly has informed, instructed, and communicated to his people, that they are only to act upon his clear directions, from him directly, and not “round about” through Twitter or a press conference (ignore the bombastism) or whatever some other giant corporation publishes or advertises (""fake news"").  The bombastism i o w does not cause chaos in the executive branch of our federal government.  You may not prefer the policies, but this organization of giant organizations is not acting disorganized, i o w it’s not acting bombastic, even though the president is bombastic.

&amp;#x200B;

And the other thing that is beyond dispute is that #2 the president has removed more people from positions of power (""You're fired!"") in the federal government, than any other president, because they did not share his values, that our universal rights are indivisible, and so the entities who are violating more of them in number are the world’s worst rights violators, and that means giant corporations, because they have a Capitalism loophole, where, because they are privately owned instead of government owned, they are able to violate rights with impunity, so long as the nature and character of these rights are such that violating them won’t “leave a mark”.  Like beating someone with a phonebook.  As long as Capitalism believes that our rights are not all equal, Capitalism as an economic theory is actually a political theory and a legal one, and those along with moral theory are the pinnacle of philosophy, as these ideas objectively detectably physically manifest in the world, they make things happen.  Our president is a liberal and not a Capitalist.

&amp;#x200B;

Why am I writing this?  Because our president has rightly said even in his bombastism that this novel virus is going to cost him reelection, and that’s not fair.  The novel virus is politically convenient to all his political opponents, because now they can win the election, where there would have been zero chance to win if there were no novel virus.  In his bombastism our president has floated all sorts of ideas concerning the novel virus because he’s obviously grappling with the biggest of big pictures in private, and this grappling produces some of his bombastic remarks.

&amp;#x200B;

To put this novel virus and its pandemic into perspective, one of the liberal left’s progressive wing’s great heroes, Ronald Dworkin, introduced the idea we know of as “luck egalitarianism”.  Dworkin was a champion of democracy, such that democracy is required in order for mankind to be dignified in his view.  And so what we have here, in this novel virus and its pandemic, is luck that has affected this president only, simply due to luck (appearing in 2019, and not 2011 e.g., not 1995, and not 2027 either), and if this had affected any other president, all the ones we’ve had who were not bombastic, this wouldn’t have hurt them as much politically, but because our president didn’t want to change who he is, he chose to just continue being bombastic since this was who he has always been.  But because he is bombastic, a novel virus inducing a pandemic is going to hurt him politically, it’s an Achilles’ heel for bombasts.  If not for the novel virus President Trump would cruise to reelection.

&amp;#x200B;

But if he were fair, and I do feel that he would be fair, Ronald Dworkin would agree that President Trump suffers from terrible luck at the moment, and that if this democracy could proceed undisturbed that he would easily win reelection.  And RD too knew the danger of Capitalism as a political and legal theory---it actually protects rights violators instead of their victims, which is the worst kind of oppression.  Our president is going to continue to press for justice in a way that Biden, Harris and every other Democrat will not do.

&amp;#x200B;

Our president presides over the largest organization in the world.  And he has been, through his management, directing his organization to ignore the bombastism, and through removing people from his organization who don’t share his values, running a taut ship, and a ship even more sensitive to our universal rights than President Obama’s was.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s just this darn novel virus.  Bombastism might be a sin---maybe---but even if it is, it’s definitely a light one, and in Catholicism light sins are called “venial” which means through Latin I think, “forgiven”.  So we wouldn’t even treat it like a sin, basically, except during academic discussion.  Nobody breaks communion by committing a light, venial sin, and bombastism, even if it is a sin, is definitely a light one.

&amp;#x200B;

If Cousin Louie is bombastic, he's just dramatic and always exaggerates.  It doesn't give us a reason to think that he's a bad man, and if we were concerned about him managing an organization with his bombastism, we would watch carefully for any red flags, or signs of disorganization or internal existential conflicts, and with the president's organization right now, the executive branch of the federal government and its organizations, there is zero cause for concern.  The Commander in Chief has everything well in hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Our president believes more seriously in our universal rights and in their equality than any president since Lincoln, and probably even more than him.  I think that given a second term, without having to think about electioneering anymore, he would release the hounds, who sniff out and hunt down rights violators, everywhere in government, and as a man who understands how to avoid building a house of cards, and instead skyscrapers, I think he’ll pave the way for it to preserve his values as an organization, long after he’s gone.",12Aug2020,1

98,"So a few years ago, my (now) husband was pulling some shady shit with an ex of his and I found out. No cheating that I know of, but their interactions (specifically how his ex interacted with him) made me very uncomfortable, and even though I talked with him about it, nothing changed. My boundaries kept getting violated and it was starting to be too much for me to bear.

After months of talking about it, he cut off communication with her. After the fact, I found out more about their relationship. She was very manipulative towards him, flying him out for a weekend because she was bored, seeking comfort from him while lying to him about situations, and continuing to communicate as if nothing had changed about their relationship. It really warped his view of relationships and we've both worked really hard to unlearn unhealthy behaviours and relearn new ones. He's opened up to me about how she treated him towards the end of their dating relationship and after and it breaks my heart for him, she broke him down in ways that have been hard to come back from. I'm happy to report that we were married last year and our relationship is now stronger than ever.

What I'm having trouble with now is letting go of the hurt that she caused. My husband and I have worked hard to reconcile what was wrong in our relationship, but that was only one half of it for me. It takes two, and she is also responsible for what happened. Truthfully, what hurts most is that she seemingly had no interest in being my friend, too. From my point of view, if my friend starts dating someone (especially someone I would call my best friend), I would want to befriend that new person and be part of their life as well. We have a lot of common interests, and it's really a shame that things didn't work out. Maybe I should have been the one to reach out, but I felt like the other woman in my own relationship at the time... my feelings about it are still complicated.

I honestly just wish she would reach out to me and try to talk it through. I don't know if that would solve anything or even make me feel better, but I just want to understand what happened from her perspective too. I've tossed around reaching out to her myself, but I don't want to cross boundaries or bring up old hurt for her. I just don't know what to do anymore. I carry this pain and hurt of betrayal and seemingly being thought of as 'not enough,' and I don't want to anymore.

Though the eyes do flicker back and forth, from the realm of my mind to that of my body, they create a pressure comparable to that of the oceans deepest valleys. The eyes always watch from the corners of the room, and only the corners.

Elusive in the physical realm, I find the summoner of these exists in my mind. He begs the questions of my childhood and of things which happened far beyond my own past. He is the gatekeeper to all things solitary, and only lets me pass mostly when I need not to.

He summons. Why he does, I don’t know. Why he must torment me this way is beyond me, but I cannot stand to fight this.

It bothers me. A lot. The guy I lost my virginity was manipulative and not at all a good person to be with. I can’t believe I didn’t see it at the time being 24. Old enough. He got me very drunk one night. Or stupidly I drank too much I guess... and yeah. I don’t wanna even think about it it makes me feel sick. I was 24 at the time and I was very strict on my virginity. Even walking down and aisle where there’s alcohol makes me nauseous. It was my biggest goal to wait for marriage as I grew up in a very red pilled ideology of a  household. I’m trying to break free from those ideologies as they’ve obviously harmed me. But I’d be lying if I said I don’t believe in them still. 

After that first ex and I broke up I felt so low and disgusting. A year later I started sleeping with a colleague ( I’d say a handful of times if that) The sex was obviously miles better than that dreadful first time. 

Fast forward to 26 and I meet my fiancé. I love him so much and everyday it pains me that he’s not my one and only. My first, my only and my last. Like I had always thought my life would pan out. Except i’ve slept with two others who didn’t have any actual love or respect for me. 
I have a great relationship now but there’s this black cloud over me. I feel sickened and embarassed that my fiancé knows ive been with other men I don’t know why. I guess because I’m sure he doesn’t like it.. who would? I can’t help but feel really bad as my goal in life was to be with only one man. Will I be loved differently, seen as less special? Just be honest. 
He’s never made me feel bad about it of course and has a past of his own but idk. It hurts. I worship the ground he walks on but I never feel good enough. I never feel like I’m special enough. I also recently read online that men feel closer and more attached to a virgin spouse and it hurt. I know I logically have more to give but there’s nothing special there to give. Anyone can give him kindness or love, or make him food etc. 

I feel like I’m drowning in pain each day and life is feeling less and less worth it.

Thing is our wedding is coming up in October and I still cry myself to sleep pretty often about this whole thing. We don’t live together  but we will once we move in. I’m worried about him seeing me so broken over it. He knows I wishes he was my first but he doesn’t know how much it tears me up on a day to day basis. Idk how he’d react. I’ve sort of said stuff in the past and he says it’s my burden to hold and doesn’t enjoy talking of my past. But I don’t know.. I’m worried that he will feel I’m not ready for marriage and call it off or something which would make the past win. 
Just today we were watching a show on Mormons and this guy was having sex with a few women. I said ‘ oh, that’s strange he may not have been that religious as Mormons usually wait for marriage ‘ and he said ‘ but that’s like saying you’re not really catholic because you didn’t wait ‘. And it hurt. A lot. Not his fault of course but I just thought. Ahh if you knew how bad I wanted to wait.

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",12Aug2020,1
118,"To start off, I'm a 25M. I didn't have the greatest childhood. My parents were always cheating on each other and they were rough with my sibling and I. They instilled in us that emotions(sadness mainly) is weakness and any human who complains about something are weak. One time my sister and I got into a physical fight and our mother made us hug each other while kneeling for an hour without being able to cry. I know it's messed up and I joke to people that my sister and I were raised like Spartans. My mother was raised worse than this. Discipline and obedience above all else is what they would say.

My parents aren't together anymore (long story) and now that they are old, they are completely different. A complete 180 of what they were, but I feel my childhood was robbed and I was forced to grow up. My sister is older than me and I was also forced to be the big brother and protect her a lot.

I joined the military and the work I did and the amount of stress reinforced this emotionless self. I don't care what people think of me. I don't care if I lose people in my life. Yes I get sad for a bit and I'm not totally emotionless but I move on quick. The only thing I feel is love for my two dogs. 


I want to change but I don't know how. Heck I don't even dream. It's very rare when I do. Only those close to me know this version. In public, I can be a public speaker, or the goof ball, or the friendly guy but as soon as I'm alone, I'm like a rock. 

Sorry about this being long.",12Aug2020,1
120,".....it is something I have long suspected and the year's events have only exasperated the belief. Days, sometimes weeks pass before I recognize an emotion. I recently accomplished something significant for my age and don't remember feeling even a smile. Reflecting on it now I can only think ""huh, that occurred.""

Though I live in a liberal city the politics of the last four years have not caused me any sadness, outrage or glee. It is a talking point. And on speaking -- conversations even among close friends and loved ones seem choreographed but I cannot determine if that is intentional or not. I am not confident if I have an opinion on anything or if I say what I believe to be the most advantageous at the time. I am not sure if it has occurred to me to question whether I have beliefs or not until now. I have always known I can adapt to new information.

I know people enjoy my company - I have evidence from the continuing messages and invitations to events even during quarantine. And I know I am decent in a conversation - I can make anyone laugh and read body language like an Illustrated Classic. But, to be honest, I do not enjoy the company of others. With the lockdown I have not felt lonely but boredom, all encompassing boredom. This indifference is not new - in college I would routinely pretend not to see friends on the quad or in the cafeteria because I did not want to talk. I have never had a best friend with whom I could share all my dirty secrets and, were someone to ask for a dirty secret, I know I would make it up because nothing - outside of this - would actually come to mind.

Sex.... is difficult. I have had partners of various ages, sexes and races but none have been able to get me there. It is not that big of an issue, I can get myself off no problem. Were it not for my frequent trolling and consumption of pornography I would consider myself asexual. I am most certainly aromantic as any attempt at a relationship I have found suffocating and a chore.

I do not know what I want. Gun to my head I would not be able to tell you an \*honest\* long-term goal of mine. True wants in the past were nothing but biological needs and decisions with actual consequences were made spur-of-the-moment. Hobbies are a mystery: do people truly have passions or, as I suspect, did they just pick up something one day and decide, ""well, there isn't this type of person in my life. i will be this type of person for the sake of being different""?

Like I said, I do not know what I want. I have no real interest in power or anything that intentionally harms others. With this post I only hope to find out how many other people are like me. Who knows, maybe most people are like me and the notion otherwise only happened because those on a higher emotional spectrum (?) create humanity's media? I do not know. I cannot even tell you if writing this made me feel good.

First of all, I wasn't planned, thats a fact.

Second, every ""chapter"" in my life, in which i meet new flocks of people in different communities, it has all ended in misery and loneliness. Time and time again.

So, when I say I haven't felt true happiness since I was a child, or in other words, since I stopped playing with sticks and became aware of my own mental health, *I'm not exaggerating*

All this, convinces me I deserve to die by suicide.

139,"It's my birthday. I don't know if I should feel excited or sad. Excited because its my birthday but sad that I'm growing older. I have never had a sociable school or college life. I never had too many friends. All the people I know have had birthday parties, cake smashing on face, clubbing on their birthdays. I have never had that experience but I always wonder what would it feel like to be in the limelight, to be a person who has many friends. Would I have been more excited about my day if I did? I'm not complaining. I never have, in fact maturity prevented me early on to focus on myself and my career. I kind of see it as a sacrifice for a greater cause. Anyway, I don't want to go off topic. My birthday has come and it will go as if its just another ordinary day like it has been for the past many years. I am lonely now. I don't have social media and my focus on career has socially isolated me from all the people I knew. I doubt if anybody remembers. My family does at least. I'm thankful for that. I'm not sad about people not wishing me, I'm not sad about being lonely. I am very content with life and I am happy to be that way. I really do hate growing up. I feel older than I was yesterday, and we aren't getting younger. And there will be a day where my family will be no more and I will be all alone in this world.

140,"I’m kinda now used to the way students of my age break my trust but one thing that always leaves me broken is the trust broken by teachers. I’m done. Here’s my story. I was the average kid taking a lot of sick leave so missed most classes. In middle school, I became a topper and I was kinda healthy but no one ever expected anything from me. I would be the last choice for any occasion. 


It changed in 8th grade when my class teacher made me feel valued and I felt respected. It was a hard year for me tbh but I kinda felt like it would get better in the beginning. I was wrong when the same teacher scoffed at me saying ‘ you got very overconfident, didn’t you?’ when I went from getting a hundred to a ninety. It was a total mistake and I happened to get 98 but still she looked down on me when my grades went down a little. She took the side of the kids who don’t respect her cuz they were pretending to be nice in front of her. First time being pushed from a top spot to something very low and deep. Dusted it off nevertheless. I wanted to believe that it was just the once. I force myself to do so even now. Idk the truth.


The second time in 11th grade. This teacher made me overcome my stage fear. Made me believe in myself. It was more of a personality based learning with this teacher but the same thing happened twice that year. The first one was in July when she made a decision regarding the character I had to choose for face painting when she wasn’t even on my team. They stole my idea and threw chits to select the character when neither my house mistress nor the one doing it (me) was present. I let it go. But then called my friends and I pretentious in a class tour with the group that causes a lot of chaos in the class. 

Apparently teachers like students who leave an impact. They don’t mind if it is a bad impact. I still remember how every single person annoyed that teacher in class and made them storm out of the class. Yet this teacher chose them. 

Ik my worth and what I deserve. I just don’t understand how teachers act very differently in such a short time. Did someone else put a bad word? God only knows. But they knew me for who I was right? I did so much in those two years only to have my trust broken.",12Aug2020,1

Ive never told anyone this. I just needed a place to vent.

I get bad migraines. Throwing up. Ive had it for awhile. He doesn't believe theyre real. It just... Kind of hurts? I just don't know, really.",12Aug2020,1

156,"I know this might be trivial, but either way it's making my (21m) life difficult at the moment.

For a couple years now I've been struggling with my selfesteem. Mainly its related to the way I look... It has become more apparent in recent days when spening time with my friends who are all reasonably attractive and happy with themselves. I hate the way I look when smiling, which keeps me from expressing joy. Especially my lips since I had an accident that left my upper lip slightly deformed.

I realize that not smiling and not accepting my looks is destructive and counterproductive. But I fear that noone will ever think of me as a partner because of the way I look. The past few days this feeling has been haunting me. Everytime someone looks at me I can't help but feeling selfconscious. 

I assume that noone is attracted to me. I assume that if a girl talks to me it's never with any romantic intention.

Any tips overcome this and develop a healthy relasionship with my looks? I just want to feel comfortable with the way I look.

Thanks.",12Aug2020,1
157,"You know how some men “Can’t hit women” because they think it is wrong no matter what the woman does? I have something similar, but I don’t believe in the thought process other men have, instead I have a strange pain whenever I see women get hurt, especially for whatever reason anime characters who are female. It feels like someone is gripping my heart and squeezing every time it happens, it is to the point I can’t watch anime without getting stressed out. I just want to know if anyone else has this problem? I feel alone with it, and I feel like everyone judges me for “being sexist” because of it (hence this being a throwaway account.) when I completely agree with equal rights. I just don’t know what to do, I typically just try to ignore it and pretend I have no problems which is obviously unhealthy, but I don’t have anyone I can talk to about it.",12Aug2020,1

It's a odd coincidence that it happened after I rejected my landlords advances towards me and his car was seen on video passing my neighbors house around the time the second break in happened. I have the police the footage and my landlord got angry and ballistic and told me to get out. My lease has 6 months left and I can't afford a new place. I feel very uneasy whenever I'm home and now my back door is broke after I JUST had it replaced. I left a very abusive relationship 7 months ago and made so much progress but now I'm back to being scared and on edge. My twin girls were potty trained before this but has regressed back to pull ups. I have no options, my gut is telling me to leave but my wallet and logic is telling me I have no way out.

166,"It started some time in elementary school. I barely remember anything from elementary because of how long ago it was. (I'm in my 20s now) One distinct thing I recall though (but forgot in which grade it was) was when the teacher seated us in groups and the girl who sat next to me said, if I remember right, ""don't look at me, don't talk to me, don't touch me"". I was also often punished for things that I didn't do or that someone else did because I was too shy to stand up for myself, and the kids knew that and used it against me. I still remember when a kid's toy or whatever was missing they accused me of hiding it or taking it, when I never even touched it. A teacher also once made me apologize to a crying kid in class when I didn't even do anything to him.

In middle school, things only got worse. 6th grade was horrible. I don't remember much about 7th and 8th grade, but they weren't any better. My first day of 6th grade was fine, but as time went on, things changed drastically. The kids thought I was some gross person and they didn't want to touch me or touch things I touched. I was also at times treated cruelly. A couple of things I remember was this group of girls (I still remember their names because they were in all of my classes) shoved my backpack under a table behind some chairs and it took me a while to get it out. And once I found lotion squirted on my backpack after class that I had to wipe off, and when I got home I found an apple core in my backpack. yuck. I was depressed everyday. I hid my depression from my parents because I didn't want it to show. I felt suicidal, but they never knew. Whenever we had to work in groups or do group projects no one really wanted me in their group. There were only people in my group because there had to be.

In high school things got better, I assume many of the kids from my middle school went to a different high school than me. In 10th grade I started online school because my math teacher was an asshole and I couldn't change classes, but that's not important haha. Anyways, my big regret is not telling my parents how miserable I was. Both in middle school, and also during the times I was miserable in elementary school. I know that if I would have told my parents, they would have put me in new schools. But I never said anything. I would have loved to change schools, but I stayed silent. I'm almost 26 and I know it was a long time ago and I should try to let go of the past, but I still think about these things, ya know?",12Aug2020,1
168,"I really hate spiders. And when I say spiders I don't mean like tarantulas or black widows. I mean those  small dot-shaped bodies with huge legs, apparently they are called daddy long legs or cellar spiders. When i was younger my instinct was to run away as fast as possible and go into another room to escape from them. Then when I went off to live on my own for college I realized running wasn't an option because the landlord couldn't care less about general maintenance so every room had one of those. So I was forced to switch instinct and went from a flight response to a fight response where I would just kick it or hit it immediately. The fear was still there, and it still is, I just switched responses.

I also have a general fear of bugs, not just spiders. Even smaller bugs can keep me out of a room. I'm not even able to play the first 15 minutes of games such as Fallout because I instantly quit as soon as I see a giant flying bug. I was once locked in my room for 6 hours because as I left it during the night I heard a loud ZZZZZZZZZ. It turns out it was a bee-shaped insect (though bigger) hugging the light. I locked myself in my room until 8am, wide awake, then asked my roommate for help. He went to get a broom, hit the light, and the insect instantly fell down and he killed it. I still don't know what I would have done if I was living alone. I'd probably still be in that room.

There was also another night when I came home to see a spider in my ceiling. Killed it. Then I saw two other spiders coming down into my bed and didn't manage to kill any of those. I promply left the room and went out again, pulled an allnighter outside the house even though I wasn't planning to, and then only fell asleep in my room again the following night because I was too tired to be anxious.

Really, if we are ever flatmates and you want me out of your house, just go ""Hey mate, I saw a bee running int your room. Since I know you hate bees I went and got a tarantula to see if it would eat the bee, but now I don't know where the tarantula is either"".

So in the last 3 days I've had 3 fun encounters with those daddy long legs or whatever. All of them with a small body, say the lenght of two well-sharpened pencil leads, but with big enough legs that it would cover my palm or slightly. One of them was waiting for me hugging my towel as I left the shower. I waited for it to climb out and then killed it on the wall. Another one was riding along the drawer under my laptop. I tried to strike it, failed, it ran behind my desk and I haven't heard from it since. I still haven't recovered from that one, once every 30 minutes or so I will look under and around my desk to make sure it isn't getting out.

Then about 1 hour ago I saw another one climbing my bedroom wall. I was waiting for it to climb into a wider place to kill it... and then it just fell down. I don't know why. It just stood still and fell without any provocking movement whatsoever. It feell behind a set of weights. I immediately started kicking them against the wall to crush it. Eventually my kicks made a painting hanging over the set fell down, taking down the set as well. No spider or body to be found. So now I'm still looking around for it in a bit of a panick, after spending the last hour moving my phone's flashlight around the crime scene with no sucess. 

And I mean, I know they can't hurt me, I know that even if the worse my imagination can come up with happens (which is the spider climbing into my mouth while I'm sleeping) I'd still be okay, I'd either wake up or eat it and it wouldn't be strong enough to cause any harm besides a bad taste and maybe a toll-free trip to the bathroom. But just thinking of its legs and it climbing on me or even around me freaks me out.",12Aug2020,1
170,"I am curious of how some people think about the work hours that I can fill in. 

For context, my job basically consists of researching data and writing reports. Sometimes, I do have to go into the office to receive guidance &amp; direction from my boss, as well as access software, information for the reports, etc. Other times, I can simply do the data research and report writing from home. As such, there are times when I am given a certain project, but am able to find the information that I am researching pretty quickly. While I am not doing any ""work,"" I suppose I can be called by my boss to do any work that is needed (theoretically at any time, but official ""work hours"" are 7:30 A.M.-5:00 P.M., which are the hours that I work when I go into the office). 

For this, I fill in my own hours of work. I am paid on an hourly basis. What are some people's thoughts on how I should clock my hours when I am ""working"" from home, but not necessarily performing any productive work that relates to my job? Is there perhaps another subreddit I can ask this discussion question?",12Aug2020,1
172,"So recently I’ve started noticing that people, including some close to me, have been using the inverted filter from Tik Tok and have been genuinely getting upset. This has mind boggled the ever loving crap basket out of me since it’s something so trivial. All it does is just make you appear how you would to others, so why are people getting mad or sad about it? Those around you that care about you and deep down will be there for you know how you look. The inverted filter doesn’t come as a shock as to how you look, as everyone has been seeing you like that all your life. It just seems so pointless to be freaking out over a filter that I can’t even notice the difference to. It’s just a different perspective, nothing more nothing less. The entirety of the person is still the same, and is just as attractive as they were with a regular mirror or an inverted one. Sorry for the rant but there’s so much more to be worried about than how a filter makes a person look. They’re called filters meaning they change how you appear, so don’t be upset by the change or bothered, it’s just a filter, especially this one since all it does is become a true mirror since it isn’t a reflection per say.",12Aug2020,1
