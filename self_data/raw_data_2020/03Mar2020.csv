1,"I'm not a confrontational person, I get overwhelmed and it's not good for my health (epilepsy where stress is a major trigger). 

This situation needs a bit of back story to really understand the enormity of it all. So, just over a year ago I along with my sisters moved my dad to one of my sisters house. He had just had surgery on Friday and moved up to my sisters on Saturday. I was really upset because I used to go see him everyday and now he was an hour away.

By the time Monday night rolls around I was chill and really saw that my fiance and I were getting held back. Then Tuesday morning comes, I had just woken up and my sister asks if she can come over. I, of course, said yes and she replies back that she's right outside. So, I just woke up, hadn't had my morning cigarette, yes very gross I know, and she comes in and ambushes my fiance and me. She's sitting there saying that my dad can't live with her anymore (after 3 days), she wanted him out of the house the next day, or that day if possible. She wouldn't tell us why and kept saying she couldn't. So we ended up moving him down that weekend.

My dad is on dialysis and was on a couple benzos for RLS, one that was too high of a dose. He lost one of them during the move and was looking for it but wouldn't tell us. After having surgery, losing one of the benzos, and continuing using the high dose one, he started to have a psychotic break. At first, we all thought that he was getting dementia due to the dialysis so we didn't take him in right away.

During the final major incident that got him in the hospital I found him beating the shit out of a heater fan. When I yelled at him to stop, he started to come after me but thankfully stumbled and sat down. He proceeded to tell me that he was going to beat the shit out of three invisible people then come after me. The look in his eyes said that he was gonna do more than beat the shit out of me. Later he attacked a couple nurse's (the EMT's hopefully got in trouble for not telling the nurses that he was violent).

In the end, we had to let him come back, way too soon. But ever since then I can't look him in the eyes for more than a couple seconds. We've had a bunch of bullshit forced on us since then because I'm not confrontational, scared, and a bunch of other stuff.

About a week ago he ambushed me (not physically) while I was cleaning and said that he needed me to write rent receipts for 400 dollars. I only get 300. Last night I wrote up the receipts for 300 dollars. This morning he says that that's not gonna work, it has to be 400 (he trying to lie to get more food stamps). I've been somewhat freaking out about this moment for the past week. When he brought it up I finally said no!! I'm already technically lying by saying I'm not getting any rent money so I'm definitely not gonna lie saying that I'm getting 100 more than I actually am. He was starting to get mad till I brought up that its gonna mess with my taxes and that I have to look out for myself. I wasn't as scared because the situation was different... and he has no legs now. He got all deflated, trying to get me to feel bad and change my mind. He made a comment about how that's not gonna work, that he needs to lie to the state. I will not more than I already have been because a felony would destroy me. For him? He can just quit dialysis at any moment.

I finally said no!! I was shaking the whole time, before and after, but I said no. After everything, I don't care about him. Just like he doesn't care about me or really anybody. I did it, I'm still shaken up, but I did it.

With how my life has been going my motto is ""one step at a time."" This was a major step and I'm pretty proud of myself.

Thank you for reading! This really helped me calm down a bit more. Please don't judge me for not caring about my dad, at this point he kinda deserves it no matter how harsh that sounds. Also, to anyone who will probably say that I need therapy, I don't. I've been given the tools to work through this from a therapist I had in the past and I feel like I'm doing pretty good. I've talked to people and at this point am good, well for the most part, but I'm working on it.


TL;DR.  My dad asked me to say that I'm getting $400 in rent when I'm only getting $300 so he can get more food stamps. I was really scared because a year ago he had a psychotic break and pretty much said he was going to kill me. I'm not confrontational and I already have a hard time looking him in the eyes. He tried to make me feel bad even after I said it would affect my taxes and that I have to look out for myself. He doesn't care about anybody but himself. I don't care about him anymore, well only a tiny bit. Trying to make me feel bad didn't work. I stuck to my guns and said no. I'm proud of myself.",03Mar2020,1

3,"I’m leaving school this year and all my friends are starting uni after summer. I’ve postponed uni and instead I’m doing a gap year (or two, that depends on how I feel when the time comes). Luckily my friend’s dad has a position at his workplace available for my friend and I to work at over the summer, it’s a highly laborious job but it will keep me busy. 

Even though I don’t have much direction in my life at the moment this is a great start for me. I hope I enjoy the position and if I’m lucky, offered a full time placement there.",03Mar2020,1
4,"I'm bipolar 1 and in my 30s.  I had been under treatment before but unsuccessfully.  It really screwed up my life.  Was evicted multiple times because of my behavior and couldn't hold a job.  Haven't worked in 5 years and been on disability during this time.  I've been on a different medication for the last 6 months and things seem to be going better.  I've signed up for a job placement program where you have to show up somewhere for 24 hours a week for several months doing teambuilding exercises to see if you're actually ready to return to work, if you graduate you end up getting a job shortly after.  I could just stay on disability my whole life and frankly it's tempting, but I want to be able to afford a vehicle.  I'm sick of needing to take the bus for groceries.",03Mar2020,1
5,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",03Mar2020,1

8,"In high school I was admitted to an early college program where I started college classes my junior year and got my associates and diploma free of cost a year after I would’ve originally graduated. I also worked full time and lived with my parents the first two years of this scenario. The last year was hell- I had moved out and was completely unmotivated and burnt out. While I had originally thought that this program would be great, I hadn’t done it for myself. I did it to impress my parents and give them something to be proud of (I had just recently come out as trans (he/him) when I was 15 and they were STRUGGLING with that). And they were. But that entire last year of college was so horrible and effected me terribly. I had promised myself I would never go back to college or any type of school. 

Fast forward a year to being out on my own with my fiancé, and I’ve made the decision MYSELF to go back to a college of my choice and get myself a teaching degree. I’m so much more motivated this time and I’m super excited to start in the fall. I’m finally doing something good for myself, and it is one of the most amazing feelings ever.",03Mar2020,1
9,"During my freshman and sophomore year of high school I was in a Pre-College program, and we stayed in a College Campus for summer, for five weeks, except weekends. It was a cool experience because we all got along. It was diverse there was students of all races, ethnicities, and sexualities. A little over half were boys(including me). It was probably the end of the third or the early fourth, one evening we were showering and I heard someone yell ""Oh shit"" or ""Fuck"" and I heard others yell oooo and others surprised. When I got out of the shower and went to my room and I saw my roommate spray a lot of Lysol in a garbage bag, and he said I stepped on Poop. I thought that was the end of that. But later that night they called all of us to a meeting room we had and told us about what happened and wanted us to come clean, there were like 21 or 22 of us. They told us that it was expensive for someone to clean poop of the floor. They went lightly on us during the first night but then the teachers started to get more disapointed, the female teachers were basically crying and one of the male teachers was really sad too.

They let some of us state our opinions and one of the older students who played football at his school started ranting saying that we are better than this, that we are good people, and saying that we were cowards and scared, and this other guy who I knew from my school just started to laugh hard. The teachers then said that there will be no threateneing each other. They basically told us the following nights they repeated themselves and mad us write an essay. They were telling us to come clean by email or alone in person, then they were basically telling us to snitch. Some nights I wanted to laugh, but I honestly felt sorry for the teachers. To this day I don't think we ever found out who it was, and others think so too. Thanks for reading.",03Mar2020,1

11," I frankly don't know what's happening in my life and I feel like I'm not in control of my body and life anymore. I don't know how I feel, well I know how I feel I just don't know how to express it in words. 

 I've started to see a therapist, but I feel like I don't belong there in a strange way. It's not that I don't trust them, it's more of a ""I just do it for the attention"" kind of thing. Nobody ever told me that, I just- maybe the things of depression and all, like, I'm not officially diagnosed and I just say it to myself to find excuses to why i'm so fucking useless and don't do shit I'm supposed to.

  And my anxiety, that I think I have, I just use it for attention and to get excuses for myself and my ""anxiety attacks"" I'm sure they aren't that I just panic a bit more than usual and start tearing up.

 And let's talk about my crying and my shyness,like, god, isn't it wonderful to be a weak little pathetic thing that everyone need to protect and I don't even know what I want! Like, bitch pick a side, do you want others to care and protect you or do you don't want it! 

 And the others, my ""friends"", don't know shit about me ask them any questions on it and they won't be able to tell you and I don't even know who I'm mad at, me for never saying shit in conversation and when I finally decide to say something it's weird and annoying for them, or if I'm mad at them for never listening to me and be interested in me!

 I don't know my sexuality or identity anymore and if I start to think I'm something other than straight and cis, my brain, and he's right, says that I do that fo attention and what not. 

 I just want to be like everybody else and see the world like they do or like I did when I was younger and now my therapist says that it's likely I have something that makes me think and see the world differently than others, I'm like in the 2% o some shit, and even then I talk about it like I have it, but I'm not even sure!

 I don't know what I expect by doing this, but I think that deep down I hope someone will be like I care about you, when I know nobody does and the only reason i'm still alive and will be is because I'm suh fucking coward.

I want to die and that's the only thing my whole being is sure about.

And that shit was my vent to the void.

14,"In the deepest darkest depths of college right now. I'm 20 and working on an ecology degree. I should be thinking about school and all that but I just can't get this thought out of my mind.

What if nobody ever likes me no matter how hard I try? 

I would give anything in the world to be in a relationship, but I never have been. It would just be so awesome to be able to talk and connect with a girl, I would be so happy.

It's just so uncommon to still have no experience with girls at my age. It makes me feel like less than everyone else. But worse, it makes me think I will always be like this.

I'm already past the mark by a good amount, why should I expect it to change?

Yeah jobs and hobbies are great and everything, but if I have nobody to share them with, what does it all mean? 

Am I just supposed to keep going like this and hope and pray that maybe some day someone will like me? Meanwhile everyone else is going through relationships non-stop.

Sure maybe they haven't found the perfect person, but they get to experience something.

It's just not fair. I want to know what it's like to have someone like me as much as I like them.

I know I sound really whiny but I just needed to let this out. I'm sorry for that, I don't usually talk like that but it's hard not to feel sorry for yourself sometimes you know what I mean?

So my plan is to put myself on the clock. I'll give myself like 5 years. If I've still been alone all that time I will evacuate this wicked cruel world forever. My consciousness will dissipate into the void, blasting off into infinity and I will never be sad again.",03Mar2020,1

18,"So, seventeen, senior, male, yada yada. I’ve noticed recently that while I’m not always depressed, there are certain days or maybe a full week (depending on how bad) where I get quite depressed. Feelings of worthlessness, like nothing I’m doing has meaning, and there’s nothing that really makes me feel good during those times. So maybe I’ve got some variance of depression, I dunno, but it ain’t fun, that’s for sure. 

Now that you’ve been kind enough to sit through my backstory, I think another depressive episode (?) might be coming up. There’s no food that sounds good, I’ve been bouncing from video game to video game, and have had just general feelings of my life being... grey, I guess. Life just feels grey. I’ve gone through these signs before, it’s what’s happened the last time I had a particularly bad episode. 

But... I’m going to fight this. I’m going to set myself small goals, easy to accomplish, trivial or meaningful. Small, simple, and I’m already starting. I’m gonna buy myself a late dinner and maybe a shake on the way home, I’m gonna try to just tidy up my room a small bit, and pick one game and commit to at least one mission. 

I’ve gone through a couple separate days where I just sat in my room all day, YouTube in the background, lost to my thoughts of grey, and I will put in the effort to keep it from happening again. Here we go, let’s get some food! (Sorry about any grammar or format mistakes)",03Mar2020,1

20,"Just wanted to get this out there, off my chest and share my opinion. Let me preface this by saying I am a straight, 20 year old male and am speaking from experience. I never ask for nudes and you shouldn't either. If you are ever texting or even **sexting** a girl, do **not,** under any circumstances, ask for nudes. Here's why.

I do not care if you are in the heat of the moment talking about just how much you're ready to meet up and fuck already, there is nothing attractive about asking for nudes and is a great way to turn off whoever you are talking to from associating with you in the future.

Simply asking for nudes says **a lot** about your personality. It makes you come off like you just want her for her body, that you're just in it for sex or to get your dick wet and that you do not really care about her at all.

And to all *females,* stand your ground when a guy *does* ask you for nudes. You are better than that; recognize your self-worth and **if asked for nudes,** **do not** send them. That guy who asked you for them does not deserve you...not to be with you, not to fuck you, not to even communicate with you.

Now, if you are a girl and want to send a guy nudes **without him asking,** *that's* a completely different ball game. That's your choice and if you want him to see your body for whatever reason, be it to turn him on, tease him, then go for it. But again, if you are **asked** for nudes, recognize how pathetic that really is on his part and what that really says about his personality.

That's all I have to say.",03Mar2020,1

I think I got too comfortable around them and let some unchecked feelings get past the gate, then I tried to cover it up with angst and stupid words online ( nothing hurtful ). That friend  has ultimately not been in contact with me and I sort of made it that way. But here’s my real thought process, do I give meaning to friendships? Or does the other person hold the value of the friend ship ? Does knowing someone for a certain amount of years mean anything ? All I really know is that I’m not very quick to reach out to old friends like that, in fact I don’t really reach out to people at all. Maybe some things are really left to be untouched because trying the same routine of intimacy ( not the partner kind ) is something that doesn’t like it does.",03Mar2020,1
23,"My parents are both immigrants from Asia and my dad was the one who came to the states first to work so he could bring us over. But ever since my mom and I got here when I was 3 years old, he’s been doing less and less. 

My mom is a hard worker, she always has been because she grew up dirt poor in a third world country and worked from a very young age to try and provide for her family, shes the oldest. My dad on the other hand, grew up wealthy with a doctor as a father and a nurse as a mother. He’s lived in big houses and grew up with maids and everyone doing everything for him. He’s also the youngest in his family. My mom has worked her ass off ever since she moved here. She even worked her entire pregnancy when she carried my little sister. 

Im 20 years old and still living with them (I know, how embarrassing) and my sister is 15 now. My mom would give 110% and never complain about a thing and never ask us to do too much unless she was really tired and needed us to get her something and it hurt her feet to get up. We would get stuff for her without her even asking us because we know how hard she works and we like to make things easier for her. But my dad doesn’t work as hard as she does and he complains if he has to work almost as hard as her. 

My mom gets up at 5 every morning and stays at work until 5pm. They both own their own sushi shop; but my dad wakes up at 8 or 9 and asks her to leave early all the time. Then when he’s home he never washes his dishes, help us clean the house, or do his own laundry. My mom cooks and cleans for us every other day despite her working long hours daily.

Today was the last straw. They got home at the same time and my mom starts making dinner for us. My sister and I are helping her out and the entire time my dad is just on the couch on his phone. We’re used to that so we don’t say anything. He says he’s not too hungry so he asked my sister if she could microwave a pastry for him and so she did. He then asks me if I can make him some coffee. I don’t say anything but I start doing that for him. He’s sitting down this entire time just commanding us to do stuff from across the room. 

I go back in my room waiting for the water to boil and I lose track of time until my dads at my door asking me to make him his coffee. I ask him if he can just do it himself since he’s up and walking already. He pouts like a little kid so I go back into the kitchen and finish making it for him. I bring him the coffee and he asks me if I can pour some condensed milk on his pastry I start getting mad and asks why he couldn’t do it by himself he just needed to walk literally 10 ft to the kitchen. He gets done eating and decides he’s hungry again and wants dinner. He eats what my mom made and leaves his plate on the dinner table for us to clean. I clean it anyway bc I hate conflict. Then I eat my dinner and about to go into my room to sleep then my dad asks if I can wash his coffee mug. My sister and I just look at each other with faces of disbelief like is he actually serious right now. I couldn’t handle it I start getting really mad and had to go into my room to calm down.

He’s always like this all the time and I would like to do stuff for him if he wasn’t always asking us to and if he worked as hard as my mom. He does the bare minimum and feels entitled to having everyone do everything for him. I cannot wait to move out because all I feel like is a slave here. And my mom doesn’t say anything to him because he can get really fucking angry and she just doesn’t want to deal with that. I really can’t stand it. If he worked as hard as my mom then he would be giving her a break. But he doesn’t even think to help her out more or work harder to make things easier for her. It’s just been hard and it’s getting worse. Sorry this is so long I just have a lot of feelings.",03Mar2020,1

I needed to come to realization that I am not at a good weight... and I’m not saying if I was 55 pounds lighter I’d be perfect, far from it. I’m just saying that where I currently am is a helleva lot farther that I expected to lead myself off the path. 

I’ve been needing a big change in my life and I think tonight the train finally hit me. The one everyone hopes to get when needing to change their life. I’m not saying that this is some grand big thing that is immediately changing me but after looking at the 55 pound lighter photo for a good 5 minutes.. I really do want to change my life for the better now. Time and time again I’ve given up. In previous tries I’d hit a wall and I wouldn’t even ATTEMPT to keep pushing, climbing over or under.. nothing. I simply gave up and sat my ass down and ate a big huge meal full of sugar, way too many carbs and not a veggie in sight. 

I truly see who I am now, with no rose colored glasses on.. I’m on the obese scale. If I don’t change now I know for a fact I won’t when I’m 30.. 40 or 50.. 

I’m far off from where I thought I was however now... at least I know where I’m headed.

28,"Somebody in my city's subreddit posted something about needing someone with long hair to help them out with their hairstyling program. They needed someone to do a certain cut on in order to do an assignment.

I saw this ad, and seeing as I haven't had a trim in about a year, figured, why not. I don't really care too much about my hair, so if they mess it up, it's no stress, I get a trim out of it and I get to help someone out.

It was seriously the worst experience I ever had in my life. She started prepping my hair, and starting going on and on about her personal life, about how she can't find a 'good man' and how (my city) is filled with ""fuck boys"" and ""dutty n\*ggas."" I don't mind conversation, but she started also talking about how she knows men want instagram models and how she wants to get liposuction so she can rope in a rich dude.

Then she started going through my hair, and she asked me what I did for a living/school. Told her I was still in school for X, and she started talking about her previous jobs. She told me she used to be a stripper in X city, and then came to (my city) and tried to get into stripping again but some dude who owned one of the local strip clubs here called her too fat, and then she warned me that if I knew any girls who wanted to work at that same strip club, I should tell them not to since ""(owner) is the type to ask you for 'favors' if you want work"" . Will do... thanks...

Again, like I mentioned, I don't really take care of my hair. That's when she noticed I had dandruff. I get it, I have dandruff. Every salon I've been to in the past noticed it, it's just the respectful thing to do that you don't mention it. I know I have it, you see that I have it, if you're uncomfortable with small flakes, put on gloves or refuse me service, by all means, but this woman started talking very loud about how I had dandruff. She mentioned it at least 15 times and even once to a nearby student. She kept repeating that I should be more hygienic and should shower more. Thanks for that. For anyone wondering, the instructor actually came by because she tried telling the instructor, and I don't know if the instructor was trying to save my face or was being serious, but she said that it was because my scalp was dry, and that I should try to use a certain oil instead of more product. I try not to wash every day because it's not good for my type of hair.

At worst, I expected to get one side shorter than the other, or get an accidental buzz, but I seriously had to spend two hours with this person and it was the most miserable 2 hours of my life.",03Mar2020,1

30,"Has anyone ever felt an overwhelming sadness every single day for no reason at all?
I have an amazing family, a good partner, good friends, and a job I love. I’ve always dealt with anxiety, being antisocial at times but have always blamed it on being an introvert. However I feel like the older I get, the worse it gets. It has been getting worse at least for the past year.
I have this facade of being happy on the outside and nobody really knows what I’m struggling with. They know I get anxiety and overthink things but nobody really knows how unhappy I am because I’m just truly unhappy. Nothing makes me happy.
I don’t have any reason to be this unhappy or depressed whatsoever. There are bad things in this world. I don’t have anything bad in my life to feel this way. It almost makes me feel guilty.
I’ve made an appointment with a therapist to see if I get help. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",03Mar2020,1
31,"Im a college student... i got put in a group with a quiet girl, ive seen her around and never spoke to her before. We get into the assignment she's flying through it i am holding my own, i know the material, whatever. Note i am that kid who scores 105s on every exam i am usually better than most. But this girl was incredibly calculated i am just amazed by how smart she was. I ended up following her on instagram after the class, turns out she was a stripper for a little bit. This is the kind of person who actually dates a rich guy to go to college. Which made sense because she explained to me her goal was to go to medschool and find a sugar daddy. but not in the dumb way, like in a calculated she's actually going to do it kind of way. What scared me more was how photographic her memory was, she knew where she saw me and when, she knew everything about me that ive ever said passively in conversation. She knew what values i used in the calculator ten steps ago. this is the kind of person that i picture when i think of red sparrow. she could actually break society one day.",03Mar2020,1

I used to have a therapist but my anxiety is so strong that even having to meet up with her made me feel anxious.

37,"A prison with thousands of inmates is separated by units where they house about 150 people each. On average there might be 3 AB's on a unit. Its more of an elite force than anything. They only take the best. You have to be a smooth talker and a top notch fighter. Even then, they dont just let you in, you have to earn it for almost a year. Prison is extremely racially divided and there aren't really any white street gangs that carry over to prison like other races. That leaves a lot of individual white people that become victims of gangs. The brotherhood helps prevent that. If a bunch of Crips go jump a 65 year old white man for his lil Debbie snack cakes it's up to the brotherhood to go handle up and set an example. That really happened btw. I was ready to die for what they did to that old man. Eventually you watch things like that happen so often you want to do something about it. That's why I prospected and earned my patch. Its not socially acceptable out here in the real world because nobody knows what it's like in there, but I'm proud of it because I know what it means.",03Mar2020,1

I try to think of it as just a long distance relationship where I only get to see him on the weekends but the negativity just really takes a toll on me some days.

The next day I wake up he tells me a female friend of his wants to talk to me. I start talking with her through Instagram and she is really nice and we have a lot of things In common she compliments me and calls me handsome. After a whole day talking with her I started feeling more confident with my self. But when I looked more into it the account looked really fake only having 1 photo and the photo also being the profile.

The other company allows me to get to the interview, which I thought I was doing fine about it but later on I got rejected.

43,"When I graduated high school I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I went to work.

I did a temporary summer job helping a carpenter, then did two months of construction and hated it, then did another temp job as a pig farm labourer and capped of my 18 y/o year as a concrete labourer.

I then bit the bullet and went to a 9 month broadcasting program and have now been in the radio industry since last August.

Nowhere in that timeline have I been happy, beyond happy, or super happy. 

I haven't been happy in years, probably elementary, but certainly before I was 12(nearly 9 years ago now).

Now in this new industry I am unhappy and have 27k in student and car debt and am lost at what to do. 

I think I'm going to try to get into the oilfield and get money as fast as possible and pay off my debt and then travel as I have never really travelled and I long for it.

The problem is that even if I went and explored the world I don't think I would be happy, I dont think it's in the cards for me to be content in life.

I just wish I knew what I wanted out of life, and what my purpose is, because at the moment I know neither.

I'm probably going to push myself to an early grave with how much I stress. 

I have an amazing family that loves me, a longterm partner of over three years who loves me though she's now eight hours away in school, and I am alive and have evaded sickness my whole life. 

The only bad things I've dealt with were being bullied and feeling unwanted as a middle schooler(woopty doo, so were millions of others), and then my birth father leaving me when I was three, but I was raised by a great man who I call my Dad since I was 10 months old.

45,"I'm finding I ""take on"" the mood/emotional tone of the people I'm around. I'm sure everyone does this to varying degrees, but I'm just reflecting on the pros and cons of it. It's kind of like a super-power.

On the one hand, I think it can make connecting with other people easier, since I ""mirror"" their energy level, posture, mannerisms, cadence, etc. On the other hand, it brings up questions of identity (who am I really?) and responsibility (of course I have a responsibility to overcome this tendency if my actions would conflict with what I deem to be right, but do I for example have a responsibility to choose who I surround myself with, so that my actions are facilitated to be more positive or more reflective of who I am?), and it can create the problem that a perfectly good day would be brought down by me ""matching"" with someone who has had a bad day.

I had a great day, coming off of a great weekend, and I was about to go have a group discussion about a reading we had all done (an activity which I love). However, the person I think of as the leader of the group was stoic, seemingly irritable, and aloof. As a result, the tone of my actions shifted to match that. Had I held more firm in my resolution that the day was indeed good, I may have been able to shift the mood of the group to become more appreciative and optimistic and joyful (let's call it charisma...or just talking over other people, idk).

Anyway, be it a blessing, a superpower, or a curse, I wouldn't trade it for the other way around. As I've developed this skill/personality trait, I've felt myself become more... magnetic. It's a good skill for leadership, making good first impressions, and building community for others.",03Mar2020,1

You have been the best person in my life so far. I realize it now at the age of 27. I'm sorry to make you my enemy in my head and I'm sorry to have said all the things I have said in the past to you. I truly deeply regret it and I'm cursing myself for being such an idiot. 

It's only after the ups and downs I realize who I should count in my blessings and who I shouldn't. I'm really grateful for having you in my life. It's only today I realize that you gave me everything but comfort.

I seeked comfort in other things when I didn't get it from you. Since I was a child you have always made me feel uncomfortable. And that's the best way to raise me. It was as if you knew it all about me. Right now I feel extremely uncomfortable but satisfied - weird na! It's because I was raised like that and I know I can get through anything!

I was stupid to not see the intent behind this nature of yours - and now I just had a thought that you trying to always ""fix"" or ""nag"" was a part of improving me gradually and always making me feel UNCOMFORTABLE. I always went against this. I was wrong.

I promise you this is the best kind of treatment I could ask for. You never comforted me and thank you for not doing that. THANK YOU! 
My weakness is COMFORT. When I'm comfortable I am lazy. And when I am lazy I am not productive. When I'm not productive my mind is always doing the unnecessary things and I land up wasting my energy in stupid things...

So yes, I'm sorry to always fight you. I'm sorry to have said all those things to you out my anger. And I really regret saying them to you. Please forgive me if you can. 

Love you so much ❤️",03Mar2020,1

I wish that humans were built in such a way that sleeping was an *optional* thing, but that everyone recommends. Just like going to the gym for example. You don't need it to survive, but *everybody* recommends it. I wish it were the exact same case with sleeping. Alas, it is not, and it is something we all need to do.

53,"My boyfriend and I are both in college at different schools so we aren’t able to go out together on the weekends. The last weekend, he went to a club, got really drunk and posted a picture of him with his friend on his Snapchat Story with the caption saying something along the lines like “my n****.” For context, none of us are black, so he should not have used that word, especially on his story for all his friends to see. After seeing him post that, I just got so disappointed and angry. I was reevaluating my relationship with him because that story really rubbed me the wrong way. Of course he deleted it when he woke up the next morning sober but a lot of his friends already saw it... people also screenshotted the story. 


I was really upset about it the next morning but things went back to normal. That mistake was brought back up today when we were talking again and I just got so angry again. I almost felt mad at myself for dating someone who says that kind of thing, but I know it was a mistake that he truly regrets. I don’t know how to explain my inner anger, and I don’t even know if I’m justified to be this angry. My boyfriend is really remorseful and wishes he could take it back. I can see he is sincere... I just can’t get over it for whatever reason. I think this anger is definitely a combination of things but I don’t know what and I hate that this feeling is all going towards my boyfriend.

65,"I’m 15 and male, around 2 years ago I moved to the beach and I now go to a school with 800 kids. Some of them are great, some of them suck, just the usual from what you expect from a highschool. The issue is none of them really have the same passions or interests that I do, I like making music and I’m a really dedicated person when it comes to friendships, and from what I’ve seen the kids here just kinda use each other to not be bored if that makes sense. I think i’ve seen people here that do have an interest in music but they are just fuckboy assholes that make fun of me for my pale skin lmao. I’ve really only taken average classes, I’m in a honors English class but the people there are the kind of kids who yell out stuff from the back of the class in hopes of getting attention. Because of my lack of “smarter” classes, I have to deal with the less sophisticated (?) kids which are mostly just douchebags who have a shit ton of money and don’t really care where they end up later in life. Another issue is I have some anxiety and self-confidence issues so it makes it really hard to just up and meet new people. Does anybody have any advice? Is there a possibility that I just won’t find my clique in highschool, because that sounds pretty awful. I appreciate any and all advice! Thanks. :)",03Mar2020,1

After Christmas though he just stopped talking to me and hanging out with me, i thought i did something wrong especially since in the past i have had a crush ghost me but i figured it out as me trying too hard, i thought it could probably be the same here or the strangest idea could be he thought i was trying to groom him or something by merely getting a Christmas present, i was merely trying to be nice, but anyway i have recently realised he has been spending a lot of time with a girl from the class, and normally I’d feel happy for a friend who got a gf, i actually helped a friend in my last course ditch a bad girlfriend and get a new one but this time i feel betrayed, it feels like i just eat a meal and I’m just full enough and someone reached down my throat and pulled most of it out, in some ways i even feel used but idk why, it’s not like he used me to get to her. And with the existence I’ve had I’m not as wholesome as others so i can’t just be all “oh im happy for him” but i just don’t know what to do anymore.

68,"So I had a generally happy childhood, minimal stress and anxiety. Unfortunately, Adulthood has been quite the reverse.

Ever since I started uni in 2013 things have taken a turn for the worst. Serious anxiety and chronic stress have resulted in what feels like burn out. I'm regularly on the brink of panic attack whilst at uni, on placement and in social settings. I feel physically exhausted regularly, have become deeply cynical, and quite frankly I have no zest for life. 

Internally, I just feel like a husk. But I somehow maintain a facade of relative normalcy.

I've been prescribed valium, which I take on occasion to manage symptoms when they get severe. Usually prior to public speaking or performance. I have concerns that I'm developing a dependence on them just to get through life (generally take 1-2 per week for the last month) and they are not something I want to become addicted to.

I'm at a loss for what to do. I just feel like I'm not equipped with the tools to survive this life...",03Mar2020,1
69,"That says it all. The main purpose of life on earth is reproduction. Of course, if you look at the spread of your genetic material from a position of universal significance, then this is pointless. However, in order to live on the planet, all living creatures give birth. And gays and lesbians do not breed. Also childfree and all sorts of transgender people. I think that this is a glitch in the natural program of the individual, in which the transfer of genetic material is not carried out. It doesn't mean it's bad. Sometimes such a program failures become really significant people and impact our society in a positive way.

I want to add that I have nothing against gay people, moreover, I do not care about them, I am absolutely indifferent to who has sex with whom, if everything happens by consent.",03Mar2020,1
70,"The game theory of a political system with primaries and electoral colleges naturally reaches a stable equilibrium where there are two dominant parties which trade power, but collude to prevent any new entrants.

In the US, this means having democrats and republicans which stage-fight about drugs, guns, abortion, welfare, and immigration, but which line up solidly together to protect the ruling elites (billionaires and the 1%).

In this way, US politics is like professional wrestling: it appears to be a contest, but is extremely carefully orchestrated. ""kayfabe"" was code for the open secret of professional wrestling being theater, in a political context, kayfabe means the two parties are not really different. (this is the reason you are always disappointed by the candidate you thought was in favor of Change).

Given how effective the system is, the chance to change it doesn't come up very often, but TODAY, and this election, is one of those times.

Bernie Sanders is the equivalent of taking the political red pill, and seeing what unscripted politics looks like.

Some people may have a legitimate reason for choosing the blue pill, and should do so without suffering the judgment of others. But if you feel like the government doesn't serve your interests, this is your chance to change everything.

Super Tuesday (and this whole election cycle) is a red pill vs blue pill moment for all US voters.

72,"Well, I was watching YouTube when I stumble upon videos of people talking about their personal life in VRChat (breakup, depression, etc). I feel like I want to do the same thing. So I'm here to share about a snippet of my life that I regretted until now. Although I did tell this to some people, I never told the full story.

A little warning, this may or may not be a long thread. If it is a long thread, you can just skip it. Kind of NSFW some time at the end.

It was second year in Junior High School where I enrolled in a chess extracurricular activity. I don't really like chess or anything, I just don't have anything better to do so that's the only reason I joined. I also can't play chess so you can probably guess my performance in every session of that activity. Some months after that, I started to hear about a girl that took interest in me. Because of that, I became curious. I started to look at the girls and try to spot someone that ""kind of"" looking at me. I'm not an observant person so I obviously cannot spot one. After some time, I put it at the back of my head and did not really care anymore.

Another month went by, I was invited to a Whatsapp group chat which contains some students and a female teacher. I have something that I can tell about between me and that female teacher. But the short sentence is, I confessed and got rejected in a way that did not make me embarrassed. Let's continue the story.

Third grade started not long after I joined the group chat. It was fun talking to students which I normally don't talk to on school. But the best part was, I get to chat with women. It was a school where boys and girls were separated... a religious school. Well anyway, a day later, I was playing GTA IV and I found the secret car (forgot the name of the car but GTA IV players should know what I'm talking about). Of course, being a teenager, I brag about it in the group chat. Some did not know what I meant but there was this one girl where she kind of ""understand"" what I'm talking about. So one way or another, we started to have a private chat because one of the students told us to chat somewhere else (we chat for quite a lot and it was holiday).

The chat went from this car to a regular chat about something that I don't remember. A week went by, we still chatted everyday. But this day, there was something different. The way she send her message was... different? There were more emotes using hearts than usual. That's where I started to ask something and I ask her to be my girlfriend in Whatsapp. For god sake, thinking about it now, I cringed so hard. But I digress.

Long story short, we got marr- I mean we got to be a couple. Because my Junior High School is a religious school, we decided to not tell anyone so we won't get find out by the teachers. It was really a smooth sailing relationship. We went out at least once a month, chat in a regular basis, and phone calls which took me 3 months before I can gather up my courage to answer her calls (I'm quite a pussy in the past). As months went by, I got my first kiss. I still remember how nervous I was when I asked for her lips and how good and satisfying it was to finally reach it. But then, my hormone started to slip into my relationship. I started to ask to touch her bare thighs, boobs from her outer clothes.

The one that broke the dam, meaning the moment where my lust began to high up was when I took shelter in her house because of rain. The house was empty, like it was just us... and her white cat I guess. She gave me a small umbrella so I can go home. Then, before I go home, I asked for a kiss. Well, it got to more than a kiss. I ""pushed"" her to the nearest wall and put my hands all over her body. I raised her leg like those ""hot kissing moments in movies"". Then I whispered if she dared enough to touch my lil bro. And she did. I became more daring and ask for a blowjob, and a blowjob I receive.

This is the point where I started to regret. I started to ask for a date in my house and nowhere else. Even if we got to somewhere else, I still asked for a blowjob. Yup, in public place. Although it was empty, it was still a public place. In my house, we make out, she gave me a blowjob, a handjob, you name it. Then, I started to ask for sex. Remember that I was still in Junior High.

At first, she said no. But I insisted. It did not took me a long time for her to finally pull down her jeans. We then did it.

I think it was nature telling us, or rather, me, to stop. But some hours after we had done it, she felt sick like a woman that was pregnant. But I still insist that we keep having sex. In total, we did it for 3 times. Because after the last one, she started to become distant. I was still a horny bitch so I got mad because she did not want to have sex. She eventually stop giving me a kiss. I then went on an ""angry spree"". We fight a lot because she did not want to have sex or kiss me. Eventually, some days after our first year anniversary, we broke up.

At the time, I did not think heavily as I do now so I thought she was going to go back to me. She did, for 3 times. So we got back together and breakup spree for 3 times. After that, we kind of being distant towards each other.

We still kind of chat sometimes in High School, but then stopped after she and I got our own boy/girlfriend. I still remember her boyfriend after me was very similar to me. Well, there is a story for high school but long story short, I lost both my second girlfriend and my only best friend I have from Junior High because they liked each other and become a couple 2 weeks after our broke up (second ex and I). Because of this, I got kind of depressed and feel alone all the way to the present time.

First ex and I never talk to each other since second year of high school starts. She got a new boyfriend now and I regretted being a horny slut in the past. I wish I can turn back time, or at least can tell my past self to stop being a horny little bitch. I forgot to tell you this, but our parents (first ex and I) were looking forward to meet each other. I think if I can control my hormone and emotion a bit better, we will still be together.

Well, that's my regret story. Or at least the one that I regretted the most.

Sorry for taking your time and I hope you have a nice day.",03Mar2020,1
74,"I ""played the game of life"" all wrong. I spent it focusing on my own personal happiness, but when spoke with others, I was so concerned with their personal happiness, I lost sight and was no longer in touch with who I was.

I don't know when this started, but it was definitely at a young age. I started creating lies to please people, or myself, which led me to even more pain and fear.

Others warned me what was going to happen if I continue down this road, but I had created a general distrust and lack of self-esteem that was so overwhelming that I felt like there was no escape.

I'm 30 years old and have a Master's degree. I could be doing something really productive to help the world. Instead, I'm laying in bed at 8:41am on a Tuesday having to re-evaluate my life.

I have to be willing to give up a lot. The toughest one is my wife. She can't stand being with a depressed person anymore. Especially a person that turned to drinking and started lying about it. I should have never married her. All I did was bring misery into her life. I never meant to, but I used her as a crutch for my problems. They were far greater than i ever told her.

Anyways, for the first time in a long time, I realized there can be good things in life. Not every part of me is bad. I can find good things. I'm a good person in my heart, I just need to find a way to let that good person out.

It won't be easy to change. I like things that are easy. I can't have easy things if I'm going to find myself. I have to work my ass off and that's scary. I also need to have some pride and sense of accomplishment after I complete a goal. I just need to do it. I need to eat the elephant. One bite at a time.",03Mar2020,1

I learned most of my values, the majority of my lessons, and took most of my shape form how I handled the pain I was given in my earlier years. The only thing thats curious now is that, it seems some subconscious part of me somewhere is hungry.

If I get into a relationship that voice out of nowhere would just be like “damn, what if you cheated? Wouldn’t that be an interesting scenario.” Or literally any other situation, that probably wasn’t the best example but it feels like some fucked up part of me always wants something to go wrong, and I just, I don’t know if it’s normal, or if I’m alone with it?

Then the next day I emailed her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses). A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job",03Mar2020,1
79,"Looking back now, I realize that I never felt safe growing up. Mom did a piss poor job of taking care of us. Sure, we had everything we needed, food shelter, that sort of thing. But we weren't protected by her. Until recently, I never even thought it affected me, seeing my father drunkenly beat the hell out of my mom and older brother. I now see that it did, how could it not? We weren't safe. He never hit me, but I was so little at the time, it would have started eventually. But she kept us there, maybe she felt like if she took most of the beatings, it would be easier for the kids. It wasn't. I had no idea what was going on with my sister. And what did mom do when she found out? Had a stern talk with my father where she told him not to do it again. We moved out to the country, maybe mom thought the country air would stifle his abusive behavior. It didn't. It all happened again. After the second time (or the second time she found out, only my sister knows how many times it actually happened) , she finally got us out of there and away from him. But the damage was already done.

Fast forward to present me. If I were to describe myself in one word, Anxiety. I have social anxiety, trust issues, self esteem problems. I'm scared. All the time. And most of the time, I couldn't even tell you exactly why. Have been for as long as I can remember. I'm short, 5'3"" when wearing my big boy shoes lol. I graduated from high school weighing around 90 pounds. I've always been so anxious, my stomach literally hurts nonstop. Food has never been something I enjoy because I can never get enough to make myself feel not hungry. The pain was usually too much for me. I would eat just enough to make it another day. 


In spite of everything wrong with me, I found someone who was, I thought, perfect. She was broken in her own way, aren't we all? We fixed each others broken parts, and for the first time ever, I felt whole. Like everything would be ok. My anxiety symptoms, while they never truly went away, I felt were mostly under control. I felt like a person for probably the first time ever. She was amazing. Kind and caring, comforting when I needed a shoulder. And OMG such an amazing cook. Hell, last summer I hit my highest weight ever! I got up to 145! I looked good. I felt good. Married for a while now, kids, good job, house, dog. I was living the American dream. I thought everything was great. 

It all came crashing down last summer, though. She said she wasn't happy, hadn't been for a long time. She said that she had found someone else, and spent the night with him. World as I knew it destroyed, felt betrayed and unwanted. You know the drill. Turns out that she's been in a relationship with this other guy for a while, and it's not going away. Shows no signs of remorse. Unwilling to take steps to fix our marriage. I don't sleep much, and I haven't weighed myself in months, but I can clearly see that I'm losing a dangerous amount of weight. My anxiety symptoms have gotten worse. Obviously, it's time for me to move on. 


Why tell you all this? Because now, I find myself repeating a cycle that started with my mother. There is no physical or sexual abuse. But emotionally, the situation is not safe. My children are not learning how to make and sustain healthy relationships, and I can't stay in a situation where I don't feel important or cared for. feel like I know this, but I'm so scared to take the steps necessary to get out of a bad situation. Financially, I'm not ready. Emotionally, I will likely never be ready. But I know that I need to go. If I don't, I'm going to end up... Well, I try not to think too much about where that would be.

It's awkward to admit I never had anything resembling a social circle or a relationship and that I missed out on some of the best parts on life.

86,"I didn't have the best childhood. I was bullied and back-stabbed by people claiming to be my best friends. My parents split when I was 13, and I grew up fast. Caring for my younger siblings and trying to comfort my narc mother when she was upset.  

I'm not sure if it was the bullying or the uncertainty in the household, but I grew up hating my body and without a shred of self-confidence. This despite dancing competitively for 15 years. You'd think that would help my body image and confidence, but all I constantly compared myself to the other dancers.

I met my ex-husband at a young age. He, like my mother, was a narcissist. Very emotionally abusive, though I didn't realize it at the time. He saw me for exactly what I was - a young girl without any self-esteem. And he used that against me. He would tell me the most romantic, beautiful things, and I'd believe him. But then he'd turn around and tell me all the things I was doing wrong. This did nothing for my sense of self-worth and in fact was very confusing. He was my first real boyfriend, and I didn't know what to expect. I thought I loved him, I thought he loved me, and I thought that was enough. No matter how poorly he treated me, I was always there when he called. Our relationship was a roller coaster, and every time we peaked over the edge of the drop ended in angry, hurtful words and lots of tears.

We were together for 6-ish years, married for 3. By the time our marriage unraveled among the fragments of his multiple affairs, I was anorexic and bulimic.

That's when I met my husband. It's odd because I felt such relief to leave my ex. I hadn't realized how much pressure the chaos of my life with him had pressed onto my heart until I was relieved of it. Yet, I couldn't bring myself to eat normally. I either wouldn't eat or I'd throw up what I did. Every pound I dropped was some sort of victory. Some sort of triumph. It was addicting.

I foolishly tried to keep my eating habits from my husband (then boyfriend). But that was impossible. Our relationship moved from the first date to living together very quickly, and I am a terrible liar. Not to mention, by the time we married a year after our first date, I was a 5'2 woman, 29 years old, weighing in around 90 pounds. I would drop another 10 before the right combination of therapy and drugs helped me to begin eating again.

But that was a whole 'nother thing. The bloating from eating again was nearly unbearable. There were days I just wanted to hide under the blankets. I wanted so badly to disappear. Every time I had to buy a new pair of pants, I wanted to die. It was awful.

I'm not sure when my body started to even out. Between my healthy eating and regular workouts, it took a few years for sure. During that time, however, my confidence was growing. I had some opportunities at work and took them. My marriage just kept getting better - I'm married to my best friend who worships my body and puts me first always. I think seeing me through his eyes really helped me to heal. Helped me to appreciate who I am instead of constantly doubting myself.

My husband and I will be married 10 years this year. As I was reflecting over those years, I realized that I no longer look at myself in the mirror and wrinkle my nose or burst into tears when I've made a mistake, internally shouting calling myself names. I can't pinpoint the moment it happened, but it happened. I have finally arrived at a place of peace within myself.",03Mar2020,1
87,"I found out a few days ago that my mom is HIV+. She’s had it for a long time, since not long after I was born. She’s lied to me and my siblings about how our father passed and hid so much of the truth for a decade. I don’t think she even knows I know the truth. I doubt one of my other siblings knows. I know there’s nothing I can do and it fucking sucks. She’s the only reason I’m still alive.

I have various things about myself I need to fix and clean up but it feels like I’m dragging my legs through concrete to accomplish what should be things I do regularly. My teeth are falling apart and it’s keeping a girl that I wanna be close with at a distance. I got them cleaned and had maintenance scheduled, only to realize I couldn’t afford it on the scheduled day. The following appointment was too early and I slept through it and have yet to reschedule. Why? No motivation and I can’t keep myself from spending more money than I know I should. Not only that but I can’t seem to get it through my head that there’s no chance I’m going to land where I wanna be with her for many other reasons. I can acknowledge this, but I just can’t let go of the thought of her. 

I’m working full time and overtime. The overtime got old months ago and when I finally got a position where I can earn $1100 paychecks with no overtime, I fucked it up for myself. 

I refuse to make an attempt to face my nicotine addiction because it changes how I think so drastically that it’s too uncomfortable being awake without it. 

I have so much that I want to accomplish but I’ve let myself sink into a slump of bad habits and laziness for the last couple of years and it’s a shitshow trying to climb out as I slide right back to where I was.

92,"I dont even know where to start. I just really need your responses. i have written this post so many times, and got few of them.

First of all, i just want to mention that this post is going to include questions about mental health, and if your response is going to be to see a therapist just dont even bother replying. Its not about money, there are some other reasons and also i dont think that this problem is to an extend where i need one. I would really appreciate each and every respond of yours, since it can help a lot.

Basically. I developed a thought that theres something wrong with me. I think that its on an unconscious level, like even if im not thinking about it, my actions still can be affected by this mindset. It doesnt make me depressed or anything like that, it could be just me being paranoid, or just a teen. But around couple of months ago, the thought came back. It used to come and go but didnt use to bother me that much, maybe for a day max.

 But couple of months ago i started considering that i might be on the spectrum. The thing is that if being logical, it doesnt make sense at all, since  i got no symptoms of it at all. But for example, hours ago i literally believed that it was true, regardless the logic. 

Okay as i said it started months ago, i even remember the day. The next day i had uni, basically it bothered me for that day and after that it went away. Being around people definitely helps, because i dont feel any different, i even tend to think that im above others and even seperate myself from them. 

Basically, yea it hasnt bothered me for probabily months, and then the one month break came. I, for particular reasons, ended up with no close friends (it happened probably 2 years ago, when i fell out with my school friends). Even tho at uni i literally got to know to everyone, became the most popular, cuz i definitely dont struggle socially, cuz of different factors i did not manage to make close friends. I mean we still talk to each other, but not outside uni, we only went out couple of times, thats it. But yea, the point is that i ended up alone. 

Have Been alone the whole month, and obviously it doesn't help my paranoia. I havent felt completely peacful ever since. This thought kills me. Its not that im depressed, but i question myself a lot, and as i said i even sometimes believe that i have the condition. 

I dont even know what to do anymore. My only hope now, is the break to end, tho it happens in 2 weeks. But what should i do till then? My mind keeps clinging on my negative memories, and tries to somehow connect it to the condition, and no matter how ridiculous it is i have moments as i said where i totally start believeing it.
Well, its not that im at home all the time. I go to gym everyday, but obviously it doesnt help much. 

I don't know what it is. Am i psychotic cuz of loneliness? I haven't felt like a part of group in a while as i said? Or is it just my age? I just turned 18. No matter how many times i tell myself that this thought doesnt make any sense, i just cant help but believe it sometimes. 

Being around peope, hopefully will solve this problem, because it is making me insane. As i said the first time i considered it was months ago, and after being around people, feeling that im no different, the thought dissapeared. 

Obviously, the fact that i even developed this thought is not healthy. I even used to think that there was something wrong with me and my parents and everyone were hiding it from me, tho obviously it doesnt make sense too, because of how im treated. Is it a part of being 18? Like i have not felt normal, in so long. Its like ""theres got to be something wrong with me."" 
What do i do? 
Im tired of going thru this cycle, i obviously dont have it. But i know that maybe even tomorrow i might feel otherwise.

She wore this lotion once on a date and I told her I loved it and it made her skin baby bottom soft. The scent was sweet like a ripe peach, but not too sweet. It didn’t smell like chemicals like some lotions or perfumes can. It was perfect. Ever since I told her I loved it, she would always wear it when we hung out together. Every time I smell it, it brings back all of my happy memories I have with her. The happiness quickly turns to sadness thinking about her. She ended it, but she talked it over with me before it all. It wasn’t a bad breakup. It has been a while and I feel like I’ve been over her for a while now, but every time I smell it, it brings me sadness. :(",03Mar2020,1
95,"My mom always tells me (51F) and my siblings that she likes to brag how her sons and sons-in-law all work for prestigious companies (in the league of Facebook, Google, Morgan Stanley, etc.) I do meaningful work too. Unlike any of her other children, I have a PhD and I work full time for a non-profit that does important work. My husband, sibs, and in-laws all respect the work I do, but my mother doesn't even think it worth mentioning because my employer, if her friends have even heard of it, isn't prestigious. 

When I told her and my father that I was encouraging my husband to consider changing employers to one he enjoyed better, my mom immediately said yet again how she loves to brag about her sons and sons-in-law. I told her that I care more about my husband's happiness. She said of course she does too, that it's just a joke that all of us (?) make.

I'd never really got on with her in recent times as I used to just keep my head down rather than saying hello to her and I always felt she hated me because im ugly and quiet (the  type no advisor wants to bother with) I got a new job and I told my new job that id been in a temporary work placements the last 6 months rathery than being with that advisor the last 6 months as I said (because they didn't want to see too many gaps in unemployment, I lied) and my advisor (who didn't know tbh) contacted my new job to confirm my employment, and then my new manager questioned me about where I actually was the last 6 months ( I nearly got sacked) I emailed my advisor angry about it and her responses were her mad to on the defensive she replied with things like ‘I will not contact you again now if this is what you prefer’ and ‘I’m sorry you are unhappy about this but I do wish you well for the future’ etc. but but I quickly apologised as I realised she didn't know I lied I replied ‘ok sorry to make a fuss’ and she didn’t reply. Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office ‪before 5pm today‬ I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (sounding annoyed) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ (Idk if she was passing conversation or asking about travel expenses).  A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned back around again) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job",03Mar2020,1

A member of my well-known favorite band had their attorney contact me to stop selling fan merch of her. I wasn't making much money, and I was giving a portion of proceeds to her own music page donation fund. I have loved the entire band for over ten years, and love this particular member so much, hense showing my fandom to her. 

I havent listened to any of their music since. I feel so beyond shitty about the whole thing. On one hand, I feel it's super petty of her, since people LOVED what I was selling and I spent so much time into making and distributing merch and made very little money off of it. It was showing my fandom and support of her and her music. I always support the band by buying merch and tickets to their shows. But on the other hand like I get why it is an issue. The attorney wasn't rude to me or anything, it just made me feel super shitty like I did something wrong.  I feel like the band and she hates me for selling art, someone I respect so much.

111,"I hate the advice that gets given out around the internet when it comes to guys who struggle to get dates. As soon as a guy makes a post about not being able to get a girlfriend, the (kind of insulting) assumption is that if he’s above a certain age and hasn’t had a relationship or slept with someone? He must be a socially incompetent, fedora wearing neckbeard who hates women, washes once a month and exclusively wears clothes 3 sizes too large for him. The advice is usually ‘dress better, take care of your hygiene, get a better haircut, hit the gym, fix your views about women, go out more, etc.

In my personal experience, this doesn’t solve a lot of issues. Maybe I’m alone, but I’m willing to bet I’m not. Maybe at one point in high school I was an ugly duckling who dressed bad and had a bad haircut, but I’ve always had good hygiene, got along well with women, etc. In like the 5 years since I finished school I’ve really pulled myself together, hit the gym, dressed way better to the point I get compliments on it, maintained a good social life and really tried to work on myself and all the other shit that gets suggested to guys.

And guess what? I’m almost 22 and I’ve never been on a date. As far as I’m aware, no girl has been interested in me romantically. I’ve never had sex. I’ve made out with a couple of girls, but the few very rare times that’s happened I’ve been blackout drunk to the point I can’t remember it. I’ve having to come to accept that no matter what I do, I’m just not as attractive as other guys. I’m 5’6”, still have a baby face, metabolism makes me skinny, a little shy until you get to know me a little, etc. I have plenty of female friends who adore me, I get along great with women, but they’re not falling over to sleep with a guy who could pass for their younger brother. At the end of the day, sometimes you just don’t win out on the genetic lottery.

And I see little reminders of it all the time. If I’m out at the weekend with my friends, who are all taller and naturally better looking than me and we get talking to a group of girls, they’re gonna talk to them way before glancing at me, and if I do get talking they’ll be friendly enough, but you just know it’s politeness. Some of my friends are way more shy and awkward than me, hell I’m usually seen as the funny one of the group, but they get away with it and it’s endearing cause they’re naturally more attractive. They haven’t had to do all this work on themselves and try so hard to be the bare minimum standard of attractiveness; it just kind of comes naturally to them. Sure, they’re not all sex gods or whatever, but you can guarantee every once in a while a girl is gonna show some level of interest in each of them. It just literally never happens for me, and if I think it has I’m always bitterly mistaken and have misread the situation and stupidly got my hopes up, mistaking someone’s friendliness for interest.

Online dating I get a few matches here and there, but it never goes anywhere and I’ve always just hated meeting people that way anyway. I’m much better in person. It honestly all just feels kind of hopeless. I’m not outwardly bitter about it, but it does really destroy my self-confidence when I’m reminded constantly in little ways that I’m just not attractive, no matter how much work I put in, and constantly being told that if I just put enough work in to be ‘good enough’ for someone then I’d be happy makes me feel even worse, like I’m doing something inherently wrong. Despite this, I’m proud of myself for dressing well, having a fulfilling social life, not succumbing to the bitter women hating incel mindset and all the other shit that people suggest to ‘fix’ yourself, but we need to stop suggesting that guys need to do these things and only dudes who are horrifically unattractive and horrible company don’t find anyone, because in suggesting that it makes the guys who are out there trying, but just happen to be unlucky, feel like THEY have always been horrifically attractive and horrible company, and I can guarantee most of you guys aren’t. I know deep down that I’m not, as much as I get down about myself sometimes. I still have hope I’ll find the right girl one day and it just takes time for some of us guys, and I think there’s probably a ton of normal dudes like me out there who need to hear that too.",03Mar2020,1

115,"So as of about an hour and a half ago from typing this, I'm unemployed. They wouldn't even let me finish out the day. Sat down at my desk to eat lunch and all of a sudden I saw a meeting request with the head of HR and my boss come up on my screen. Last time this happened it was about a simple misunderstanding over verbiage in an email I sent shortly after being hired, so I thought I might have done it again by accident. I wish it was that. But no, I got the boot.

Every other job I've had, I've left on my terms and in very good standing with the owners. So this whole ""we're terminating you from your position"" is a new feeling that I'm not a fan of. 

So now I'm home alone unsure of how to feel or what really to do. All I can think of is spend the rest of the week Starbucks hopping while looking for job listings. Maybe wait until friday to tell my family I've been fired so it seems like I at least finished off the week before getting fired.

So far, the supervisor (not the same guy as my boss) I worked with on a daily basis is the only coworker I've told. And that's only because we were both supposed to be in a meeting together at noon and he texted me asking if I was coming.

120,"i had a beautiful girlfriend. by beautiful i mean both externally and internally.

at first it was like a dream so beautiful that i wouldnt want to wake up. in the beginning she was looking for ways to be in touch with me. texting, calling, wanting to meet. the way she talked to me and the words she chose to use were all so touching. but lately she hasnt been that way. we argued often. i always told her she was right although it was clear that she was mistaken.

lately i wanted to know if she still cared. if she still loved me. it looked like i was the only one texting her every morning. so i decided to not do that and see if she texts me or calls me to say at least ""good morning"". she didn't. so after two days of not conversating at all, i texted her, asking what's up. she wanted to be right once again. as i made it look too easy for her. she said ""so you finally remembered me?"". i said no. not this time. ""we dont have to be together just because i love you"". and broke up with her. she got aggressive and looked down on me. i didnt say anything offensive. i didnt say much, either. my last words were ""i hope you'll find what makes you happy"".

later on she left all of the stuff i gave her at our favorite coffee shop. i picked it up. i was expecting to see my books in the bag she left. it hit me so hard when i saw the letters i wrote to her. i wrote her poems. i drew her portrait. she left it all behind. and just yesterday, when i was deleting all of my unnecessary photos i saw a photo of a poem. a poem that she wrote for me. she writes a lot. but she once told me that she has never shared anything she has written with anyone. not even with her closest friends and family. that also hit different. 

i left. but im sad. i wish she loved me and deserved to be loved the way i loved her.

I smoke like a chimney (I know, bad) so I got there all red like a tomato, all out of breath and 5 minutes late. I'm in a divorce and the summary of the conversation was basically that I'm screwed financially. Awesome, thanks man, great talk. 


When I got back home I decided to call that road service thing. They said they werent coming cause I only had their 'away from home' deal, where they only help you if you are somewhere on the road and outside of your home town. They could come but It would cost me 90 euro's and I had to upgrade to their premium deal, which meant that I would start paying 120 a year instead of 60 a year. I decided to call my dad first and ask if he thought it was the battery of my car, that way I could get those cables and ask the neighbor to start the car and drive to a garage. My dad asked me to mimic the sound my car was making, So I did and he said he didn't think it was the battery. So I called road services again and said fine, I'll pay the 90 euros and take the premium deal (which I can't cancel for a whole year) which costs twice as much. They got there after 90 minutes. Put the cables on and my car started (great, thanks dad). They said my battery died and I had to drive to the garage cause if I would turn my car off I wouldn't be able to turn it on again. ( I didn't leave my lights on or anything, the thing was just ready to retire) 

Okay fine. So I went to the garage, they didn't have said battery and they had to order it, it would be there in an hour. Fine go ahead and order the damn thing. They could lend me a bike so I could get home. Great, riding a bike again. So I got home on the bike after 15 minutes only to find out I lost my keys (of the house, I left my car key at the garage). So off I went on my bike again, riding all the way back to search for my keys, which I didn't find, they are gone forever.

I decided to just call it a day. I drove back home. Crying because I was fed up with it all. 'Luckily' I forgot to lock the back door so I could get into my house. I crashed down on the couch and ate a whole bag of chips. 
They called me later to pick up my car. 250 euro's for the new battery.

When I was 16, this older guy took me to a party he was 18. I got wasted I had never been that drunk before. He took me to another house and had me have sex with him and his friend. They called me gross after and said it was my fault. They ignored me after it happened. Told ill ruin his reputation because I'm unpopular.




I hooked up with the guy a few times after because of what happened I felt like no other guy would want me. When I was 17, one time, when we were hooking up, he took photos of me. Afterward, he ignored me, and I found out he was in a relationship (I don’t hook up with people in a relationship). 





He never made it clear from the start. He only wanted sex when I wanted more at 18. He was 20. He called me annoying that he wants sex and nothing more.
I moved away. I haven't seen him in person for five years. Now years later, he continually tries to contact me. I am 23 now he is 25. He tells me I'm beautiful and he's never felt so comfortable with someone. He begs me to visit him(I moved states). 





He also keeps the photos of me from when I was younger saying ”don't you miss this”
I tell him how he ignored me and used me to hurt me that I don't want to see him again. He told me,” what did you expect? You slept with a guy, and he didn't call you back grow up.” he was saying that I most guys suck that I need to grow up cause most guys would ignore me.
Am I the crazy for being upset about the past?

130,"I just voted for Bernie! The Bern feels pretty good after I was robbed of it four years ago (didn't receive my absentee ballot for whatever reason).

Regardless of who you support, *go vote!* If anyone is undecided, here are my reasons for voting Bernie:

* He supports personal freedom and tearing down outdated legislation on morality. These laws are useless, wasteful, and in many cases outright malicious in original intent. Ending the Drug War alone is estimated to save us $50 - $100 billion annually.

* He's the only candidate from either party who explicitly supports our constitutionally protected right to use secure end-to-end encrypted communication tools like Cyph. Both Trump and most Democrats are actively seeking legislation to take this away.

* Medicare for All and expanding public education to include college and trade school just make sense, insofar as you support existing socialized programs like public K-12 education, the military, and emergency services. A rising tide lifts all boats; it benefits all of us, and ultimately the economy, to live in a country where everyone has the same opportunity to be healthy and productive. As a bonus, many studies have shown that M4A will actually be more cost-efficient than our current system.

* I support laissez-faire free markets, but it's the government's job to balance paper economic growth against negative externalities, not the private sector's. And the fact that as-is we're all gonna die soon is a pretty big negative externality. (Or at least see widespread suffering and a collapse of society as we know it by the end of the century.) Bernie's Green New Deal is a plan to finally get serious about addressing this issue.

* From an electoral perspective, Bernie is the Democrats' only real shot. Biden is fine, but he's effectively just Hillary with a penis, which I can't see ending any differently.
