0,"I have severe depression and anxiety — to the point where I have suicidal thoughts and panic attacks pretty often. My friend said that he would always be there for me, and has helped me through a lot of rough moments. We mutually opened up to each other about what we were each going through, so I thought it was okay that I was telling him stuff because he was telling me stuff too. But when he fell into a relapse of depression himself, I realized that it was my fault.

That realization broke me. I already felt hopeless and alone, and the fact that I probably made his depression worse shattered me. I realized that as long as I am mentally unhealthy I will only ever be a burden to the people around me. I was also terrified that he was going to kill himself. I would have blamed myself.

I reached out to him but he didn’t want to talk, so I gave him space. After about a week he messaged me, wanting to chat. And we did for a while, but it felt different. After begging him to be honest I asked him if I had hurt him, and he basically said “yes” in the nicest way possible. 

A few days later, we talked again, and I decided to try and give him an out. I tried to get him to leave by saying that “sometimes even if we think that someone is good for us, they may not be.” — subtly saying that I knew I wasn’t good for him. I think he knew what I was saying. But he still talks to me. I’ve made a point not to open up to him anymore. Not because I’m angry — it’s the opposite. I care too much to hurt him. 

But at the same time I feel awful. I feel alone. I wish I could exist without hurting people.",17Jul2020,1

2,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it. 

I drank a lot of water yesterday and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal? 

I’m down to 11.2 now  and my face looks wayyyy larger than ever at all I was thinner when I was last that weight :/",17Jul2020,1

5,"I live in Arizona. You know, the state that is #1 in the corona outbreak at the moment. I remember when the virus was first starting out and we were supposed to be under lockdown. We didn’t close. Practically everything’s was open. People were coming here from California and Texas to party. I had family telling me how good I am for staying inside with my infant daughter and that they just couldn’t do it because they we’re getting too bored. Boredom is not an excuse.

Some days are harder than others and I desperately want to ask family for help but I don’t want to bring germs into my house because they refuse to stay home. My husband works many days in a row at the hospital so we have that constant worry every night when he comes home.

We order our groceries. We don’t leave the house. We did everything right. And yet just two months ago we both tested positive. We quarantined ourselves, taking turns resting while wearing masks around our own home in order to protect our daughter.

Do you know what it feels like to have a conversation with your mother about how you want her to take your baby if something happens to you? How sick you feel thinking about a future for your baby without you in it. To even have to think about not being able to watch her grow up.

There were nights I thought I was going to suffocate because of how hard it was to breathe.

Do you know what it’s like to listen to your husband wheezing, gasping, and coughing beside you?

We both pulled through and our daughter was safe because of the masks we wore. But now I worry about the future and what might happen to my husband and I because of Covid. 

What happens if we get it again?

My husband is a nurse and has Covid positive patience practically every day. We can be as cautious as we want but it’s still being brought into our home because of the people outside refusing to wear masks and getting everyone sick. Because of the people who think Covid is a hoax.

What’s sad is that the ignorant people aren’t the ones who are dying and going through things like this. They are hurting the people trying their best and leaving us to deal with the repercussions.

6," I’m a young guy and  went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows  , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying)  ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

9,"I'll start off by saying I had a rough childhood. Alot of domestic violence growing up, parents fought alot, I got teased alot in school for being the only brown kid in a white town. I was a very sensitive kid and cried alot, so I guess to protect myself I built up these defenses and walls to shield myself from the world. Over the years I became more and more callous toward the world and everyone. I struggled with severe depression growing up due to all the supressed baggage and trauma I collected over the years, I never told anyone about my problems cause I'm extremely introverted, so my emotions came out in the form of aggression and rage. I went from being the abused to the abuser. Not really in a physical sense, I'm never violent, but more in terms of personality. In my early 20's I realized that what I was doing was wrong, but didn't know what to do to change. I'm 27 now and am still working on being a nicer person. Deep down I'm still that sensitive kid that wants to be loved, but this exterior I've built up to survive in this world is hard to shed. I'm tired of people avoiding me cause due to my cold personality, I'm tired of my resting bitch face. I want to change but I fear that this is my permanent personality now.

13,"I’ve had an irrational fear of growing old from age 17. It gets worse every birthday. To mentally prepare for birthdays I usually imagine myself that age a few months in advance. For example I’ll start considering myself 24 in September to make the transition easier when December comes.

Sometimes I feel like I didn’t do some of the things people should do when they are younger and now I feel too old. People always say “it’s never too late” but I feel like this is often a delusional excuse. With that said, I admit I’m hoping someone can ease my mind.

14,"Ever since I was in elementary school I've had episodes of severe muscle pain right above my knees and when it's really bad in my arms and ankles. I was always told by doctors that it was growing pains but I've long since stopped growing (21 yrs old) and the pain only gets worse. I have restless leg syndrome, but this is definitely something else, without a doubt. The pain is pretty much always there, and for about a week every month or two, it gets *really* bad, and it makes me feel confused and nauseous and really weak. It seriously interferes with my daily life and studies.

I'm starting to lose hope now. I went to my doctor and he ran a full blood panel, everything was normal or near-normal. He didn't know what to do anymore, so he referred me to a rheumatologist. Also I had gone to a neurologist a while ago for (unrelated) severe migraines, had a full-brain MRI which was normal. The rheumatologist was completely stumped. He said it was ""highly unusual"" and referred me to the only neuromuscular clinic within three hours of me in Boston and said ""I hope you have good insurance"". I don't. 

I feel like I'm never going to find an answer. I take 8 ibuprofen (1600 mg) and 1000 mg Tylenol per day and that still isn't enough to make a dent in the pain. The only thing that helps is cannabis but it's illegal in my state. I'm literally taking maximum amount of legal painkillers I can without destroying my liver and even that isn't enough. I've gone undiagnosed for over 13 years. I don't know if I can afford to go to this clinic, and even then I will likely just get another ""we have no idea"". Every day of my life is pain and I have no fucking idea what to do anymore. I can't even find a single person online who has described anything like my symptoms.

22,"I (24 f) didn’t have much of a life growing up. Until the day I moved out of my home at age 19, my entire life focused on being a parent to my 3 younger siblings. And I know a lot of people say that- but I truly had to be their mom. The only time my mom was ever home she was either sleeping or locked herself in her room doing god knows what. So my job every day was to get them up and ready for school, walk them to school, then once I was done at school I would pick them up, make them dinner, help them with homework and put them to bed. I did this from age 10 to age 19. I didn’t have any hobbies growing up because I didn’t have time for them or if I tried to start one my mom would tell me we didn’t have enough money for me to continue. I didn’t watch much tv either because my mom would always have something recording on the dvr and “if we watched tv then it would stop recording her shows” and we would be in trouble. So at age 19 I moved across the country and started a new life for myself. But that also meant that I was completely responsible for myself now. So all I really know is taking care of my brothers and working. It’s embarrassing when people ask me what I like to do for fun- I truly don’t know. I try to enjoy the things my friends do, but I really don’t have anything that’s mine.

I didn’t get any replies or offers in over two months, but I have to get out of my current job for my sanity and I guess I acted too hastily. 

I accepted a position that was procured for me by my mil and I’m supposed to start that job in two weeks. I’m not really excited about the coming position and it’s really not my thing.

36,"All my past relationships were based on sex. I kept seeking validation, comfort and reassurance, I was always depressed and sad. Whenever I was in a relationship I felt safety.

I never thought I was attractive and but whenever I had sex it made me feel like I was. Who would ever repeatedly sleep with someone they weren't attracted to? It wasn't for money, I was just some broke college girl.

I knew that after years of dealing with my depression my personality was extremely flat and I was a broken person with many depressive episodes. That in itself was extremely unattractive but it didn't matter if I could distract it with sex. I was 'exciting' because I was open to most things sexually. I didn't need to be a social person around all of my ex's friends if he never took me out to hang with them, I was always in the bedroom.

Sex was also an outlet for me. During my depressive episodes I always felt inside me my chest hurting and in my mind I was pressing the self-destruct button but couldn't detonate. I couldn't ever do anything to harm myself but I was fine if my partner did. Physical pain was a good distraction and addition to sex and I think somewhat my thinking was warped. If I felt guilty towards my partner I saw the pain as some sort of punishment for not being good enough and that I needed to endure it. Other times it would be the result of being too passionate but bruises always meant that I was still wanted and 'loved'. I can't have really vanilla sex anymore.

I overlooked many red flags while in a relationship, I was afraid to be alone. I get attached so easily and each time I thought my heart couldn't break or sink any further it continued to.

Taking the long route in creating and finding a relationship seems to make me less attracted to a man because know I mainly want sexual compatibility and to have some of the happier small comforting moments together before going onto the bonus of common interests. Why waste time if I can get straight to the point and move on if it's not meant to be? I am plain and boring and I want a dominant man that will stay and give me what I want.

37,"I (18f) used to be so concerned with external harmony that I was a mess: a walking, blubbering emotional nightmare. I was easily manipulated and refused to realize I had to prioritize myself in order to not ruin relationships and events I cared about. I would clamor for harmony and abhor conflict to such a degree that it was rediculous, I was covering myself in a cocoon of concrete just because I didn't want to step on any toes. Fast forward three weeks, something snapped after a rejection.

Most worthwhile rejection I could ever experience.

I went to the beach, and started letting go. My obsession with not hurting others only hurt me; my reluctance to acknowledge that it WASN'T my job to make everyone happy ruined my interactions. I sat back and started to say what I thought. Started to debate. Started to think THROUGH and not feel out conversations.

I got asked on a date. Excited as I was to try out this newfound confidence, I was extremely wary of the old concrete cocoon I own that's only concerned with appeasing the other party. I stood up for myself that date. Didn't get rolled over, got so fed up with how the other person compared himself to Hannibal Lector and bragged on his skills of manipulation, that I covered the check and told him to go home. After I paid, I got in my car and chuckled; I couldn't BELIEVE who I was anymore and I was so proud. Tonight, I stood up to one of my friends who constantly pushes boundaries and uses their own manipulation to blackmail others. I kindly declined to tell them anything, not mean, not biting. Nice, but unyielding in my boundaries.

39,"hello reddit! this is my first post; I've been reading and relying on reddit threads for years and years but have finally decided to give it a try at making a post of my own. I don't really know where this thread is going or if people even see this but I just have some thoughts I want to share to see if anyone has felt this same way or is in this same sort of mental situation.

I'm 20 years old, entering my last year of college, and honestly despite the circumstances of the world's current state, the way I feel is the way I've felt for a bit now. I often feel that whenever I think about the future- where I want to end up and my place in the world- I am swimming in cloudy, thick, muddy water. I am entering my final year of nursing school and, even after returning from being abroad the past few months I can honestly say that I do not feel like I am in the right profession. I always wanted a reliable job, and was sure I would find something in this field that interests me. But now 6 semesters in, each time I think of my pending graduation and job-search I get a sinking, pitiful feeling in my chest. But then the more I think about it, there really is no realistic career path that interests me. Finding way in the creative world has intrigued me since I could process the world around me, but I grew up in a very conservative small town with a debilitating shyness and paranoia surrounding artistic expression and order that I have only recently broken out of the previous few years (what I think is now just self-managed OCD). I never had the resources or environment or confidence to create a platform for myself, but now I feel like I am so deeply down a wormhole that it is too late to try to make something of myself creatively. Creatively as in, I love to write as much as I love to breathe- stories, poetry, anything with artistic freedom (no thank you journaling). Yet I hate being told what to write or how to write, and so I am stuck, as pursuing a path where I have to do anything other than write my own fictional stories or daily thinkpieces again gives me that pitiful, sinking feeling.

I think a lot of my resentment for a career has to do with the fact I feel like I am compensating for lost experiences throughout childhood and high school. I never had good friends until my last year of high school, only recently came to terms with my sexual identity, and my parents do not have an emotionally healthy relationship which has taken it's toll on me. And so, I have spent the past 3 years of my newfound independence (now living in a city) to find friendship, an overwhelming sense of confidence (thank you accutane and puberty round 2), and really discover my concept of self. It sounds corny but I do believe self is discovered through others, and to feel deprived of this basic foundation until the age of 18 really has not let me begin to discover what it is I want to follow until only recently. I have found incredible friendships, finally feel in love with myself and my identity, and know the things that make me happy. But when I think about throwing myself into a career for the rest of my life, my mind is thrown back on track to an inescapable depression that stole a lot of my teens.

I don't know what to do. I am terrified of hating any job that has to do with my major and I genuinely cannot see myself enjoying any job that requires routine committment. I have thought about travel nursing but I still feel intuitively that I will feel as if I have chosen the wrong career path. My goal was to get involved with the creative writing community on campus this year, but everything is remote. I know that I need to just get over myself and that the way the world works revolves around getting a job. But there is absolutely nothing that interests me, and it feels embarrassing to say given the fact I am a first-generation Ivy League student. The only things that make me feel genuinely happy existing in this world revolve around my close friendships and spending time outdoors. I just don't want to waste my life away growing old as a slave to a job when I feel like the world has so much more to offer. Anyone else feel this way?",17Jul2020,1

I stressed on the face that there were no feelings to be attached and he was okay with that. I did it, and emotionally, I felt nothing. It was not like it was a bad kiss but I couldn't feel a single emotion. On the other hand he said that he felt amazing. We decided to tell no one about it. I thought it was done with but now he cannot stop talking about it. He also automatically assumed that we will keep doing it. Although, I did fuel that thought initially, I later clearly told him that we'll do it only if I feel like it and I don't think I will feel that way soon. He keeps asking a bad talking about it and I am really uncomfortable. I have told him several times that it meant nothing and never will. I even tried to be rude with him when he just wouldn't shut up. But, he is still going on about it. 
I feel very weird and I feel like it was very bad idea. Although it was totally consensual and everything, I deeply regret it. I don't feel any romantic emotion attached to the kissing. I couldn't care less. But what I care about is how he is making it so awkward. I low-key want to stop talking with him...",17Jul2020,1

loving an addict is wondering why you’re taking so long in the bathroom, and putting my ear against the door just to be sure you’re showering. loving an addict is peering towards your phone, hoping that you’re texting a family member rather than your dealer. loving an addict is searching your room in hopes that you’re not hiding any drugs. loving an addict is trying to help you in a way where i’m also enabling you, when in reality i should leave you alone and act like i don’t give a fuck about you. 

i’ve had to watch dad kick you out of the house and shatter your phone to pieces. i’ve had to watch mom cry for years as she wishes you’d be less selfish. i can’t pass by the hospital without panicking, remembering all the times i’ve had the responsibility to watch you and take you there when i was in high school. i feel so stupid for being in denial, accepting that you’re asking for money to buy food, rather than drugs.

People always say ""if you hate America then leave!"" but that's exactly what I want to do, it's just extremely difficult.


My literal #1 dream in life would be to move to another country permanently but it seems damn near impossible.

After that hopefully I'd be able to move to find a career but I don't know if that'd be possible.

Seems like one of the easier (relatively) places to move to might be Spain and I do speak Spanish so that may help.

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it. 

I drank a lot of water yesterday and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal?

I have to confess. Its been eating at whatever conscience I have left... If I even had one in the first place.

Growing  up I was exposed to regular pornography really early in my life, around  8 years old. I don’t what it was but it ensnared me. For the next few  years I eventually got to the point of addiction.  Then puberty  happened. Around that time I started feeling some intense depression.  Lost all my friends, dropped out, and got hospitalized. Most of that  time in my life is a complete haze, I was so drugged up on different  prescriptions and sleep deprived so nothing really stuck. Around that  same time (14-15) the porn addiction got rapidly worse, I got to the  point where I was watching more sadistic and depraved material.

One  day I came across a picture of CP on Google.  All I will say about it  is that it was from a European nude beach or something, so it showed up.  I’m not going to go into anymore detail. I don’t want to put it in  someone else’s mind and frankly I don’t wanna even remember it happened.  The guilt and the shame was palpable, you don’t come back from  something like that. It leaves a mark or something  Even worse, it might  have happened a second time during that same age? I can’t say with  certainty. I don’t know what is memories or drugs or self hate. I know  however for a certainty that it never happened again.

Over  the years the porn has gotten less rotten. Occasionally it can get bad  but never like it did. That was the worst it ever got.  I don’t know why  I did any of it. That isn’t me. I never grew up doing that textbook  definition psychopath shit. I love animals. I’ve been relationships and  have never been sexually abusive - I’ve been stupid, but nowhere near  any that that would be abusive in any way. I’ve never been a bully. I  mean it.  I can be antisocial, blunt... but I swear I’ve never acted on  anything. I feel for people, I’ve cried for people.   I don’t know who I  am.  I’m trying to look for some redemption but nothing’s here. I did  that. I was young but I had to know what I was doing... I hate that part  of me. I hope those kids weren’t harmed. I don’t know anything about  those beaches at all - I don’t wanna know.  I know I played a part. I  know I committed a bad thing. I’m just making excuses. I don’t know what  else to do. I’m not watching porn anymore... I don’t want to go to that  place.

In the end all of this is  excuse, none of this is fucking about me.  If anyone’s been a victim of  this shit, I’m so sorry. I hope you find some semblance of peace. If you  have to reserve your hatred for me and people like me I understand.  We’re the worst, we do these bad things for no reason other than carnal  reasons.. I’m sorry. It never should have happened",17Jul2020,1

I realised I was hopelessly addicted when I was around 16 but I didn't really want to change anything because whenever I stopped drinking coffe I was really tired all day and had headaches and stomache pains and couples that with school it was too much for me to handle so I just carried on for another 3 years.

79,"Look at my page for more of a background on my situation. I’ve posted here before so some of you may remember my situation. To give everyone a quick background, I found my wife sexting a coworker. She ended up telling me that she wanted to meet with him and have sex. I agreed and even tried to accept it. They met up a few weekends ago and then met up again this last weekend. I tried to like it, I tried to be happy for her, and I tried to make her happy. She just kept showing that she really didn’t care for me. First of all, she would not let me set boundaries for them. I told them that I wasn’t comfortable with things and that they needed to stop or at least put a few boundaries in. She refused saying that it wasn’t for me to say what they can or can’t do. 

This past weekend is what really did it in for me. She left Saturday morning without showing a care for me in the world. She made me take pictures of her to send to the guy before she left. She left without even giving me a kiss. At first she explained that she would be back that night. Nighttime cane and she was nowhere to be seen. The next morning she tells me that she decided to stay the night with him, without even asking or telling me first. That’s not even the worst part. That night he invited over one of his friends and she messed around with both of them. She didn’t even care to ask me about that first. When she arrived back at the house she told me all of this stuff. I started to get visibly upset. She laughed and said get over it and that it’s not manly. 

I couldn’t put up with it any more. She obviously no longer cared for me. No spouse would say anything like this to their partner if they actually cared for them. I was just shocked. At no point in our marriage until the other week did I notice any signs that she would be this way. She had always been the most loving, caring girl that I had ever met. It’s like a flip switched when she met that guy and she changed into a different person. I didn’t know one person could change someone that much and that quickly. I’m 99% sure that she is going to end up dating this guy. She has spent the past few weekends together with him and even talks about him around me. 

The other night I told her that if she doesn’t at least put in boundaries that I will leave. She said “ok” and laughed a lot. Without saying another word I packed up some bags and booked a room at the nearest hotel. I’ve told my brother about this situation and he has offered for me to come stay with him for a little while. I ended up going to his place for the night. She sent me some texts that night and the next day. She was acting upset and confused as to why I left and she was saying that she missed me.

The next day I knew we needed to go back to my house, so that there wouldn’t be as much of a chance that I would lose it. My brother went with me to help. When we got there my wife was trying to talk to me. I had nothing to say to her at the moment so I just ignored her and tried to get past her. She was grabbing me and trying to hold me. My brother helped get her off of me and told her that he would call the cops if she didn’t stop messing with me. She ended up leaving. I haven’t heard from her since. 

This situation has destroyed me. I tried to let her do this to make her happy. I didn’t want it in the first place, but I tried to make myself like it to please her. I never saw any signs or anything that she would be this manipulative and this bad of a person before we got married. I don’t know where any of this came from. She was the most amazing, thoughtful person ever.

Now that this has happened, my whole outlook on life and relationships is different. So what advice would you guys give me? Whether it’s next steps in dealing with my current wife or in the future when I’m back in the dating game.

80,"United Kingdom Political Roleplay, a discord server with over 300 members that exercised both my love of politics, discord and roleplay into one, with very realistic tendencies and a wonderful community I got to know and love, you may ask how this is sad, we must dive straight into the story.

It got leaked, banned from a few servers I didn’t rlly care about, etc, then I joined UKPR/ United Kingdom Political roleplay. Info above ofc.

I managed to enjoy a new era in the roleplay with a lot of, even more fun than the first.

However, an active and prominent member in the community tracked dm’s we’ve exchanged and knew it was me, he shared with a few members and promised not to let the admins know, I was banned 2 days later in my sleep.

A few days afterwards, I was ready! NEW ACCOUNT, NEW IDEOLOGY, NEW LOCATION, NEW EVERYTHING, TRY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER TWO ACCOUNTS, so I could enjoy discussion and roleplay. I was banned the same day for sharing an image of an aborted foetus in an abortion debate. Pro choice people got very angry.

And then, I was determined, new alt, new views again, new everything. My mistake was i joined the server 4 minutes after creating the alt, but I got around 2 days of roleplay, discussion, before I was noticed for common habits I usually do in discord I cannot help.
Spamming maps and data
Saying “Based” a lot
Begging for a statbot
Others.
They used ?whois on me, realised I was an alt, and banned me.

I knew this was another roleplay character down, and I liked this character more than the others, I even pre written a shit ton of campaigning ready for election season, but hey ok, create another alt, join server. Oopsies, IM IP BANNED.

This server seriously meant the world to me, I played it for like 10 hours a day, and now its gone. Im really sad and just want some advice on how to come this. Questions are also allowed.",17Jul2020,1

85,"Hi guys, right now I’m in a situation where I don’t know whether to be grateful or cautious about. I got tile flooring installed around a month ago, and the cost was around $4000. I paid half of it before they installed it and was told I’d pay the other half after the job was done. During the installation, I had to get in touch with the sales rep at the flooring company I talked to and paid the first half to, multiple times because they had made a lot of mistakes when putting it in, like tearing up my transition boards and missed grout spots etc. I think I called him around 5 different times because of new mistakes I would find that they made every time they tried to fix it. Even now after the last time they came to fix stuff I have found more mistakes but at this point I’m tired of calling them. 

My problem is this, now that it’s been a month since the installation has been finished, I haven’t got a call from the rep at the flooring company to pay the rest of the tile cost. Should I take this as a blessing that he isn’t going to make me pay because of all the installation mistakes, or can I get in any legal problems over this? Can my credit score be hurt if I don’t call him to pay for it? I haven’t missed a call from them either, so I know they haven’t tried to get me to pay. What should I do, call them or not? 

TL;DR: Paid half my tile installation costs before installation, had lots of problems during installation including having them come back many times to fix mistakes, and now haven’t got a call to pay the rest of the cost a whole month later. Should I call to pay or not?",17Jul2020,1

93,"    Disclaimer: I'm not very experienced in relationships sorry in advanced for the english mistakes that could find in my long text. Please read the whole story my doubts are at the end of it.

I met my friend on 2018 (she is foreign 7 hours by bus)  we hanged out like 2 times we had dinner, fun (not sex, not kiss) but I perceived her interest in me. After that we kept talking from time to time by mail cuz I didnt have whatsapp, till mid 2019 that I told her that I had a GF and I met her when she stoped talking to me like for 3 months. She showed a reaction like she really wanted to travel to see me, she asked me to tell her about my GF; I told her basic stuff name, profession. I decided to start calling her ""friend"" after few months.

She kept looking for me sending messages I was answering them from time to time. Till now 2020 where she started to message me telling me that she missed me, that I was not paying her attention (again like I was forgetting about her) I ignored answering that and keep talking about something else. Now she is not reaching me out as often or with the same frequency as she was.

I contacted her last friday saying that I missed her , she said that she missed me back. She proposed me that we could talk on saturday on skype. She told me on skype that saturday that she used to get in bed early like 8pm and stayed up to 10pm just for us to talk. I used my webcam (I promised last time that the next one I'll have one) she didnt used hers, she told me that she was not using make up and was not proper for the ocassion and she promised to use it next time, we never arrange a date for the next one.

Now the July the 20th is ""the friends day"" and I was thinking something like *""thanks for your unconditional friendship, happy friends day""* (cuz me and her are not interested in having ""distance relationships""). I actually want her to perceive that I would like to have something more with her, more than a just a friendship. I feel like keep ""being friends"" its good for distance but the message is wrong if I'm thinking about having something else with her. She was never explicit about her feelings with me and I was not neither, cuz I had a GF. I find weird to tell her directly by a skype call that I like her if she and I dont have the possibility to be together at that right time... *Do I wait for her message, do I reply it back if she writes it to me (with the one I had in mind?)?*

***Her birthday is on  July the 21th, one day after, this is the message that I was looking to send her. ""I was really proud of her growth as a person and I would like to see the most complete version of her"" is this something good that will be showing that I have some interest on her? Is it a message that shows that I'm looking forward something more than our friendship?***

***Those are ""important messages"" cuz they were close in date I wanted to send something in the right direction. But most importantly is what should I change in the way that I talk with her to send the right message?. How should I react if she still calls me friend? ignore it? call her back ""friend""? I'll be travelling to see her early 2021, should I told her as soon as I get the ticket to ""tell her to wait for me"" or just wait few days before the fight's day?***

94,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it. 

I drank a lot of water yesterday and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal? 

I’m down to 11.2 now  and my face looks wayyyy larger than ever at all I was thinner when I was last that weight :/",17Jul2020,1

96,"July is Parks and Recreation Month. How do men with BPH enjoy their recreation time? Some men may enjoy golf. Others may enjoy a jog in the park. Others may prefer relaxing at home. If you have BPH, you may have trouble enjoying the things you used to. BPH is the medical term for prostate enlargement and is the acronym for benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is a common condition in older men where the prostate grows larger and can potentially interfere with urinary health. This means men may feel urges to go to the bathroom, experience frequent urination, and not to mention, slow urinary flow, where it is difficult to start or stop pushing out urine. 

This may have hindered men from going out with the buddies before the pandemic, travel on a long flight, or have a long night's rest with their partner. BPH can be a disruptive force. However, managing mild BPH could be as simple as living a healthy lifestyle. In a current pandemic world, we have to practice social distancing and other safety precautions if we decide to go to public areas like parks and other recreational spots. Men with BPH, provided that they follow these public safety guidelines, can still enjoy their time at the park or other form of a safe, healthy recreational activity.   


Managing fluid intake and practicing pelvic floor exercises, double voiding techniques, and safe heat therapy to promote blood circulation may also support men who experience BPH. 

This weekend, you want to relax, and parks are here to offer some relaxation in body and mind. It is nice to get some fresh air and enjoy the greenery of parks provided we do our part to keep the community safe during the pandemic.

What are your plans for this weekend? Are you taking care of your BPH? If you are looking for support in your nutrition, you may consider a clinically tested therapy like UMOOZE to serve as a complement to your current healthy lifestyle plan. 

Have a wonderful weekend!",17Jul2020,1
97,"I thought I was never going to get a job, I cried sometimes at night like a bitch because I didn't want to be a bum. Smoking pot, drinking liquor every day y'know the story. One thing about me was I always loved working hard labor and just doing stuff. I can't sit around and do nothing, I would get high or drunk and go clean outside around my house or train kickboxing. I grew tired of this lifestyle, always wanting to get intoxicated by anything. I even cried only to my mom several times about how I want to change but would go fuck up again. 
Well one morning at 11am on Wednesday my dad came knocking on my door so I got up and answered it. I hadn't smoked or drank the previous night so I woke up early and sort of pissed off. But that's when my dad asked me If I wanted to go to work with him. My mind went blank, like I saw a chance and took it. 
Fast forward to today I think I've been doing a good job, my dad enjoys working with me and I enjoy working with him. We drank a few beers together yesterday then woke up for work. I think I can keep this schedule going(waking up early). Anyway, I got my first check by my boss, no over the counter cash, no rip off. A check with MY name on it! :D I never thought I'd see that in my life. Obviously I'm still trying to get my GED by doing online classes. But this is just a start, I never worked at a REAL job. Just handyman stuff, but omg I can't wait to get my own shirt with my name on it by the company name. My boss likes me from what my dad said (the boss has been my dad's employer &amp; family friend for over 20 years). I used to walk the streets 4 years ago sweaty looking for k2, stealing , breaking into house and schools, my dad had even disowned me before I quit. And when I did he said ""I finally got my son back"". I won't ever take this for granted. It's just crazy how I used to be ,  me and my dad would fight physically and not talk for days. I feel like that part of my life is finally over and I'm glad. I just wanted to say this. I can't wait until I save up for a vehicle. This is so awesome. Of course, I will still party but only on the weekends and only drink besides maybe smoking. But damn, it feels good to work all day come home to my little house by myself and watch TV smoking my pot. It's so relaxing at the end of the day.",17Jul2020,1

102,"I've met a woman. You wouldn't know her. She's blonde with black hair. The brownish-black, you see the saleswoman in the store down the street freshly colored her hair this weekend. We spent just a few moments together but I feel like I've known her forever.

The blonde is getting mad at me. I can't hide everything forever and I feel like I was just pretending the whole time. You know, when you meet someone new, who are you going to be? Are you going to be the brave and mysterious James Bond, or menacing and proud Smaug? Or are you going to be just yourself? Really? Do you really think anyone would accept you the way you are? I don't think anyone would accept me. Maybe a part of me, but everything? That's just too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever traveled somewhere really far, far away and wondered, what does it smell like? I do it all the time. I expect something truly special when I get off the plane, thousands of kilometres from home. I expect the air to be different. But it's not, it's always the same air with the same smell. Doesn't matter wether it's hotter or colder, or you're higher or lower. It's the same air for everyone, under the same sun for everyone. And still, even when we bathe in the same sunshine and we breathe the same air and drink the same water from the same rains, we are so vastly different that not a single person is the same as the other. How much do you have in common with your wife or husband? Or your best friend? And you're supposed to be together forever. Do you tell them everything? I don't. I don't think anyone would like to see everything inside me.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, there's this woman, with perfect lips, gentle touch, charming kiss that makes you breath more shallow and your heart pound. Which one is she? What hair does she have? Where does she live? WHO is she? I would love to know the answers. I'd like to pretend that I can be the iconic husband. The one, everyone talks about, who has a job and takes care of his wife and kids. Who is funny, but not too much. Who you remember just barely after they left the party. Because he's so ordinary, no one knows he's there or not. And he's happy because he has everything he ever wanted at his own house. I'd love to be that man - the simple man. We all want something we don't have. The married men want to have some free time. The single men want to have someone waiting for them at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I want. I don't know if you ever truly felt this sensation of standing on the crossroads at midnight, waiting for the devil to show up with a small piece of paper.

""Here, boy, sign this down here. You don't have to read it, trust me, it's for your own good. Just a tiny bit of your own blood and everything's going to be alright. Just the way you want it...and just the way I want it"".

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't just randomly appear on the crossroads. I've been walking there for years, without knowing it...maybe I sensed it a little bit? But I didn't expect it to be this way. Imagine being lost alone in the forest. Imagine losing your mom in the shopping centre. Imagine having to choose the way your life will go on. Right now, in this moment. How do you want to live? Do you want to be forever alone? Constantly enjoying the temporary pleasures whenever you want?

&amp;#x200B;

What do you want and what's expected of you? I realized people don't know me, so they have very simple expectations. Just be...an average human being and you'll do fine. That's it, that's the whole expectation. And I managed to walk that line for decades. What do I want? I don't think I ever told anyone. I don't think anyone even asked...I mean, really, really asked. What do you want? Do you want this? If you answer, are you being selfish, or are you being honest? Because people expect you to be honest but not selfish. I don't think that's something I can do. We all want to be happy and I do to. I think I will never be fully happy, so I have to pretend. Live a lie, do not be honest so I don't look selfish.

&amp;#x200B;

That's exactly what people expect of me, even her. But what I really want? I want...I want...everything. The entire world by my feet, limitless, in reach, any time I want. And even more than that, I want to be immortal, everpresent. Everything becomes so dull and grey so soon. I want to relive the best moments over and over again. Not just the moments but how I felt. Then what? I think I'll have to reach further.

Since she told me the depression stuff and so, I have accepted the fact that, in any moment, she can suicide and there's nothing I can do about that. She had some anxiety episodes really hard and she has almost been hospitaliced and so, so I have really clear that, somewhen she could die or idk.

I forgot to tell that she is from a small village that is really far (5 hours by car). I used to go every summer but this one because of covid, I couldn't, as I stayed in my grandpa's house and it's really risky to go there this summer.

Ok, since the voice note yesterday, she answered a couple of messages more and she hasn't answered nothing more. We usually talk a lot everyday but today it seems like she hasn't opened whatsapp even though I've kept talking to her. So I'm a bit worried.

I've been thinking and I don't know... I want to see her soon in case that she die or smth, I really want to see her, but everything is so difficult rn... If I go, all the village would know that I'm there (as everyone there know me), so I can't go without telling my parents...

I'd like some ideas, because I want to see her but idk. I've thought about staying home one week without going out and then, go to the village, but that doesn't mean that I can't catch covid while going (because I have to go by bus), or even there, or idk.

113,"While watching random videos, I noticed a table of data on Democrat candidate spending for elections in 2020. Sanders spent over $200M, Biden over $200M, Warren over $120M, and Buttigieg over $90M. Backing out Steyer and Bloomberg, these Democratic candidates have tallied some $600M in spend on the 2020 election.^1 Compare that to Trump's $280M.^1 2016 was a stark proportional difference between Clinton and Trump, who became the leading candidates. But this cumulative sum is overall a significant proportional increase over 2016 and prior election cycles, which had much smaller gaps in spending between parties.

For 2020, backing out Steyer and Bloomberg, Democrats stand at around $1.2B in expenditures. Democrats have spent and retained in cash-on-hand nearly the sum total of all campaign expenditures across all candidates for the 2016 election.

That would make sense if Democratic candidates were amassing large corporate donations. But that's not what the FEC shows. In fact, it shows that *80%* of that sum is from contributions under $200. That's $900M worth of individuals contributing year-to-date &lt;$200 contributions. So, given a few estimates on average contribution amounts around $50-60, somehow some 22 million people have donated to Democratic campaigns this election cycle? When around only 7-9 million donated in the 2016 campaign?

This doesn't feel right. And with the recent debate over ActBlue, not a single source (including FactCheck.org) has confirmed that funds donated to ActBlue, which are then given to the ""Black Lives Matter Global Network,"" are *not* then disbursed by BLM Global and other groups to smaller entities which then make massive amounts of small &lt;$200 political contributions to evade the public record mandate, I'm suspicious that the DNC is effectively trying to push big money around by investing in non-profit conglomerates that then establish dozens of small non-profits, which then disburse big money through a bunch of small transactions, so it looks like the Democratic party isn't taking corporate money, is grassroots, and actually has 22 million people betting on them to win.

I don't know what I'm looking at here. But some 2016 Pew research looked at individual donors to campaigns. Only 1 in 5 donors are ages 18-49, but that's nearly all of the Democratic party's voting base. More than half of all contributions come from the top 60% of wealth.^2,3 But we know that demographic is more likely to vote Republican, and paired with Trump's paltry individual contribution total ($127M^1 ), it doesn't make *any* sense that Trump would have 1/8th the contributions people have given to Democrats. These demographic disparities are what have largely kept the two parties on close footing.

This just doesn't read right. And if anyone else wants to jump off with this and dig around, I would be grateful for the help. I know AOC had a fluke 2018 election, with her highest individual contributor being $10k, but her campaign capped at $5M. It's still a bit odd given 30,000 people living in and around north central Queens had up to $200 to throw at a House Rep's campaign, but no one could argue she was ""in"" the club like she is now. But this Presidential campaign is just not adding up for me. If people are so sick of Trump, so many want him out of office that they're throwing a sum total of nearly one billion dollars at an alternative candidate, why is Biden only polling *slightly* ahead? Why is Trump not way, way down, given his rallies are half empty and he's getting $1 for every $8 a Democrat has gotten this election cycle?

I remarried way to quick to a man I knew as a kid, but not as an adult , looking for familiarity and someone I thought really knew me (big mistake - probably the biggest mistake of my life) 

While I have been a licensed nurse since 2007 I never felt the satisfaction or that I was really making a difference. It’s never been completely fulfilling (for many reasons)  2010 I took a holistic health course and fell in love with hypnotherapy, and was amazed at how powerful it was!   
However, my life with a addict/alcoholic abuser, did not allow me to do much more than survive! (An all too common story)  After I finally divorced, is when I got in a bus and moved moved far away. Broken and with severe PTSD,  I took house sitting and pet sitting jobs while in therapy - even though I really didn’t want to return to nursing I did for the income ... It's been 4 years since that move. 
After a 6 months I started dating my now 3rd husband. He didn’t feel sorry for me, he didn’t try to fix me, we were dating very casually for a while, no pressure, and became great friends, as he had been through a lot himself. He’s so smart, very understanding and respectful. Not a drinker, great dad to his kids ... we fell in love. 
We lived together for almost 3 years before even considered marriage. Kind of a “bonding formality” really  (lol my son used that term and I love it)  Married on my 54th birthday at a county gov. office in our masks.    
😷💕😷 
After so many signs from the universe and synchronicities leading me back to hypnotherapy, in January I started the course for certification in Hypnotherapy (CHt) Completed the course and passed my exam last month
I know I’m better at what I do because of all I’ve been through!  I would not have been who (or where) I am today had I not been through all I had.  

I truly have never been in a better place in my life as I am now at 54! I could not be in such a loving, respectful, supportive, equal relationship and married again if it wasn’t for the therapy!  I just really want to say - don’t give up!!! Trust that everything happens in its own right timing!!! 🙌🏻💗🤩 dreams do come true!  I am so excited for the rest of my life.

118,"Why don’t guys like me? I’ve wondered that throughout my childhood. I wasn’t a pretty girl growing up, nor was I popular. I was shy and awkward. Well I grew up to become prettier &amp; more outgoing. But they still don’t like me. They’ll have sex with me, act nice to me for a while, then stop wanting to associate with me or talk to me. I don’t know why. Why doesn’t anyone ever actually like me? Or want more from me than sex? How come guys never care about my feelings? &amp; why do I always end up feeling more? 

I thought I’d know by now, or it would be different by now. But I’m still the unliked girl that I’ve been all my life. I’ve tried keeping an open mind. Hoping that it’ll be different this time.. maybe he will be nicer, maybe he actually likes me. But no. They never really do. &amp; each time I’m reminded &amp; left wondering why I’m the girl that guys never like. 

I have other things going for me in life.. I was just hoping I’d have found someone by now. But every damn time without fail, boys stop liking me. I’m never the one to stop liking them. They cheat on me, reject me, ghost me, stop engaging with me. Idk if it’ll ever be any different. I’m tired of feeling like a humiliated loser each time. Sometimes I tell myself to harden my heart, but then I always meet someone &amp; want to give him a chance.. &amp; I do. &amp; I feel stupid afterwards. I’m just so sick of it. It feels like this is my fate.",17Jul2020,1
119,"Hello, I am an autistic teenager from England. I've been mostly ignoring a lot of people during lockdown, and frequently feel sad and lonely. I only still speak to a few people, and lots of people seem hostile. I began speaking to an old friend of mine around a week ago, and finally feel like someone cares about me. She has been very kind to me, and we talk about lots of our interests. I think that she's the only person other than my family that actually cares for me. I've finally been able to receive compliments and feel cared about by a friend, something I haven't experienced for years.",17Jul2020,1
120,"I don't want to come here to brag about myself, but I'd say that I did spend a lot of effort to always be a very good sensible person in all my relationships, I forgave and I checked up and I was interested and I tolerated and I helped despite always feeling like I'm not treated really equally. When I moved into university and none of my close friends were interested in contacting me/were actively as invested in the relationship, I beat myself a lot about it. I hated them and I hated myself mostly for not being able to swallow the truth and moving forward. I have surface level friends now and I stopped expecting any sort of care or connection other than the favors that serve them. I spent 6 years trying to be friends with someone who was a bit troubled, I lived his misery with him and I watched him finally get over it and grow, I was called special and great because I was so patient and forgiving, but once again I am not promised a true friend just because I was loyal all these years. I'm actually never going to be promised a friend who shows me genuine care or a shoulder to lean on when I feel tired. But I finally feel like this isn't a surprise, and I am maybe okay with what's happening.",17Jul2020,1
121,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I’m naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It’s difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I’d say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it. 

I drank a lot of water yesterday and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal? 

◾️I’m down to 11.2 now  and my face looks wayyyy larger than ever at all I was thinner when I was last that weight :/",17Jul2020,1
