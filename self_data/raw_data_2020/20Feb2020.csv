1,I first had a crush on her when I was 13 and it died down a bit until a recent movie that came out and it feels like my crush is stronger than it was before. I’m 19 now so it’s just seems weird that I still like her. How do I deal with this?,20Feb2020,1

4,"We used to work together, and we were somewhat close.  I asked her out months ago, but she said she “wasn’t looking to date” aka rejection.  We stayed cool and I even went to church with her and went to her birthday get together.  We haven’t really talked so far this year, only replying to each other’s stories.  

She lives about an hour and a half from me, so we’re never near each other.  Today I had to get my sister’s car painted near where she lives/works.  I texted her yesterday and asked if she worked so I could visit her.  She said that she was off, but asked when I’d be near.  After I said when I’d be there, she suggested getting Starbucks.  We agreed to a time, but this morning she said that she “forgot” she was getting lunch with her sister an hour before we were gonna meet.  I figured she was flaking, so I said “alright, let me know if you get free”.  Luckily the car took a while, cause two hours later (an hour after the time we were supposed to meet) she asked if I was still around cause she’d “like to see me”.  I had left her area but I had to come back to pick the car up, so we ended up meeting.

We went to Starbucks and it was really fun! We talked about our lives and caught up.  We were there for over an hour. We even talked about our plans for the future and trips we wanted to take.  She told me to come back to where she lives and she invited me and my sister to her church again.  I’ve never hung out with a friend 1 on 1 before, so today was awesome.

I’m planning on moving to another city this summer, which is about 30 from where she is.  If I do move, I’ll probably end up going to her church.  And then I may have my first real friend!",20Feb2020,1

6,"We all live this cold embrace,

A dark world, a broken mind,

To try and run with quickened haste,

&amp;#x200B;

Attempt to beg, borrow and steal,

a feeling far, a feeling lost,

Chasing a life that makes us real,

&amp;#x200B;

Relapse a habit, yet start a fresh,

A new day, week and year,

Yet understanding it makes our flesh,

&amp;#x200B;

Our DNA, what such a waste,

Beg and hell within oneself,

Yet we continue to sprint with quickened haste.",20Feb2020,1

8,"The work itself is, eh ok? Very dull, but it’s whatever. I just need the cash. 

However, the office is toxic af. I can’t stand the unnecessary ‘etiquette’ that goes along with it. 

Example 1 : I walk into the office early. I need to go to the toilet, so I walk past the secretary in a huff. I’m new, I don’t have a rapport with anyone, nor do I think about building one, to be honest. I’m a shy guy, and I like keeping myself to myself and getting on with things. 

Ok, so I walk past the secretary towards the toilets. I hear a voice, blatantly directing a message at me, so I walk back to ask what the matter is. It’s the secretary, who says to me in the most passive aggressive tone, this: “Oh, we do say hello to one another when we walk into the office first thing in the morning”. Twat. I just respond that I didn’t hear her, and she just does a breathy laugh. Ok? So she obviously didn’t care that I didn’t say hello, she just wanted to break my balls, evidently. Nice. 

Example 2: Lunch is at 1.30. I stay until 1.35 at my desk to finish a report. I leave. I come back at 2.32. My manager says to me, “Do you mind not being late back from lunch. Don’t do it again”. Fuck you. Not only do I arrive on time this morning with some sanctimonious cunt giving me shit, you also have to do some power play just because you can. 

She also treats me like a child because I’m shy, and I sometimes don’t like asking questions as they’re mostly trivial ones, and she’ll change her tone and get funny with me. Even though she said “there’s not such thing as a stupid question”. Nice. 

I’ve noticed people there don’t like me. Why? Because I’m the new fish? I’m a bit miserable? I wear too much black? I don’t know. I just can’t take it. I’m 19 and I fucking hate how crap this is. I have to commute 3 hours a bloody day too. Fuck me... 

I can’t quit, because my Mum will surely murder me/disown me, and I will be unemployed again. So I’m stuck. Unless I get fired of course, which is looking very likely....",20Feb2020,1

10," Hello,

Its been nearly 5 months since I opened my fathers shed door and shockingly found him hanging in his shed. It hurts my heart typing this out, gives me flash backs and anxiety just thinking clearly on it....

...life is so relentless at times. Merciless. Just keeping coming and going. 

Im doing good for the most part especially for a single 30 yr bachelor with not to much to live for! Ive got a handsome pupper named cooper and I own a small construction business. Theres not a day that goes by that I dont think about what I saw at some point. I can be driving and boom, I think about it... getting my hair cut, eating dinner... fuck. Its terrible.

I haven't let this ruin me... yet...at least lol. &lt;thats humor. 

Realistically, Im not suicidal myself... Im just sad as fuck about it all. Grief counseling didnt do much the last 2 visits. Im over the shock, immediate anger and now Im just really grieving.

Im orphaned. No parents....well my biological mom is terrible addict and person. But, shes not suitable to be a parent, or friend for that matter. And my step mom who helped raised me... well shes a cunt and had an affair on my dad... whom was happily married to her for 25 years. They built a life together for her to take on some new dick....what a terrible person. 

I had quite a bit of support when it happened...but one of my worst fears came true... as soon as the funeral ended...not 1 person has given a fuck about my dads death. Out of my 2 older half brothers (we dont share the same dad, but ironically their dad killed himself too. So they should know how I feel) and all my friends, work colleagues and old acquaintances, not 1 has fucking text me or called me to specifically ask me how im doing in regards to my fathers death.... it sucks and makes me feel not cared about or lonely at times. Luckily I havent tried to use these people as crutches and im not Invested into them emotionally over this.

In conclusion,...Its just hard to accept that no one really cares, its hard to accept that we could easily be living such meaningless lives. Its scary to think about... which is why I try to take it day by day and live to the fullest as cliche as it sounds... 

Anyway... I could use some love, good vibes and support! Thank yall",20Feb2020,1

13,"I made that email through my local internet provider when I was eleven years old and have used it for everything. Every mailing list, account, contact info sheet, online form... Literally everything. I got a notification that someone accessed my Uber account in Peru earlier this month, changed the email to my school email, and thought nothing of it... Until yesterday morning. My inbox was filled with notifications about suspicious logins in places I’ve never been: Spotify in the Netherlands and Australia, Instagram in Russia and Poland, etc. I’ve tried changing the password on all these and am still saw login attempts- perhaps my account was vulnerable being protected by a local company rather than a corporate giant like Google. I’ve come to the heart-breaking realization that there’s no way I am ever regaining full control of my email again, and have spent the majority of today trying to wipe the old email from every account I have. I’m exhausted and anxious and frustrated and sad.

20,"I was raised Christian but never felt anything from God, so that was proof enough to 10-year-old me that he didn’t exist. Daddy wasn’t too happy about it, neither was the church. I didn’t have to go anymore though, I had maliciously complied with my father to go once and then kinda humiliated him in front of some church ladies by being honest and saying I didn’t believe in God. Religion was never a positive thing in my life as it is in many other’s. I wish it had been, but it was not.

Anyway, I remember a LOT of the stuff I learned in church, mainly because we were very active in participating at the events. My dad made and sang gospel music, we went to church on Sundays, Sunday nights, Wednesday night revivals, and sometimes Thursday nights as well.

**Here’s what happened yesterday.**

I was in line at CVS for the second time, and the line was very long. I get into a conversation with an older gentleman about how ridiculous the wait time was and how they seem to be very understaffed, very frequently. It was a good conversation until a woman (maybe mid-50s, bearing a cross on her neck) walked over and interjected when she heard us talking about the line. She starts talking about how long she’s been there and how she can’t belieeeeeeeve she has to stand in line and can’t skip to the front even though her prescriptions are fiiiiiiiinally ready. She starts talking about how she’s a nurse and working on getting a phd, which would’ve been cool had she not been blatantly bragging and waiting for us to shower her with praise. She was very Karen-like. Both the older gentleman and I lose interest and tune out, but she keeps going.

Me:
Well, what if someone can’t work to afford their healthcare? Or if someone is working really hard but still can’t quite stay afloat?

W:
Then they should have someone else help them!

Me, trying to ignore how this dumbass woman just contradicted herself:
**My God says “blessed are the meek.” I’ll gladly help them.**

She said nothing after that, not even to the gentleman. I was next in line. I picked up my prescriptions and thanked the lady behind the counter, and when I turned around I locked eyes with the woman and gave her my best melancholy gaze.

If you remain undeclared you can't work in either. Most of us have no desire or need to. Once you have a desire/need you declare and then you file your dream, be it a captain of industry or a leader of men. But never both.

The earth is full of grandeur that never ceases to be pretty to the eye. 

At times, we are thrown fallacies of the rich having deficiencies in other areas of their lives, but such fallacies are applicable to the poor as well. I also question whether or not such claims have any ground because we never see anything that the rich say about their lives. For most of us, we are not the top 1%.

32,"Ok lmfao listen, I’ve always had trouble creating my OWN UNIQUE usernames. Usually I’ll just steal one from a family member/friend or a random person on the internet that I thought had a cool username and change it up a little but this one I created and thought of by myself. I’m so proud of myself lmao 

“ImHybernatingYo”

Ok you might be thinking, “what..?” BUT hear me out it makes sense. 

This is the criteria I used. (In no particular order)

1. I had to relate to it, I hate social interaction so I thought, “what’s an animal that rarely gets social interaction/spends its life alone?” Then a bear popped up in my head but a bear isn’t alone.. BUT they hibernate in which they’re alone, sleep 24/7 no breaks, and they get fat before it. Bears DEPEND on hibernating to survive, kinda how I depend on sleeping to make it through life. (I’m depressed as duck lmao)

2. “Yo” perfectly describes the kinda attitude I’ve been developing recently. When you think of someone saying “yo” (at least in my XP) it’s someone who doesn’t give a fuck, bad grades, just stopped giving a fuck about people and kinda like “YO leave me alone” which compliments the hibernation vibe. 

3. You might’ve noticed I spelled the word wrong in my username but not throughout this post, I’m referring to “hybernating”. Why? Think about it.. HYbernating... HIGHbernating. As in getting high, again, compliments the “yo” vibe as in no fucks given. Why HYbernating instead of highbernating? Well, HY is spelled wrong but it’s not obviously that I wanted it wrong. You could take it 2 ways. 1. This guys doesn’t give a fuck/doesn’t even know how to spell (again reference back to not giving a fuck) and 2. The HY aspect of it, getting high. 

4. Together they make 2 statements/ 1. “I’m high yo, duck off” and “I’m hibernating yo, leave me alone” 

Either way, people could never think this much planning went into a username just by looking at it. Odds are no ones going to give it a second look, some might not even notice it’s spelled wrong which is exactly what I’m going for, “I don’t care”

This is gonna be the BEST account ever I’m ecstatic lmao

35,"I know i'm not the best person when it comes to dealing with emotions. I  struggle with emotions and i know that's because all my life I've learnt how to suppress it very well, and i needed to.. i was brought up by a physically and mentally abusive unstable mother, among terrorists and jihadists  in foreign countries and was religiously indoctrinated all my childhood.. have had bombs dropped near me, involved in gun fights.. all before the age of 15. My life has come very far since then.. I've left my family and religious beliefs behind, I have made a few good friends in the past year and i have a well paying job,  i have a very stable life from the outside at least.

I know I've achieved things in life many struggle to achieve even with a perfect upbringing, but the pain and feeling of loneliness and sadness is so deep sometimes that i don't want to do it anymore.

Sometimes i think it's because I've finally allowed myself to feel my emotions. Over the last 3 years I've gone on a personal spiritual journey to learn how to love and be loved, to find peace within myself.  i'm grateful for the experiences I've had, I've learned so much, met amazing people, and experienced what it feels to be alive, because up until 3 years ago i lived life like an emotionless robot, very good at surviving and problem solving, but no feelings to anything i did except moments of rage and anger when things became too overwhelming. 

But to be honest sometimes i really do want to go back, i want to go back to not feeling the deep loneliness and pain that's inside of me.. at times it feels like a bottomless pit of sadness where i'm completely alone. i have no family who can relate to me and the few friends can never understand where i come from. A part of me is aware that statement alone tells i still need a lot of self growth to do.. but i can't help but feel tried of it all. i'm not brave enough to end it though.. a part of me thinks maybe sharing my story well help me heal..because at times it does feel like a huge part of me is trapped inside of me..and this life i live now isn't really who i truly am.",20Feb2020,1
36,"So, my friend viewer PM her on IG, they talked normally at first, but he kept saying, ""We could get married, date, or just be my sugar baby.""

My friend said no to sugar baby, but don't mind dating. But before they even met, he showed her his bank account, trading transactions/wallet, etc. to flaunt his wealth. He even took tour videos of his house and sent her. Needless to say, she is mesmerized as she like the idea of not working (that's why her full-time job is a streamer). 

But when she told me this, I was like, SIS, THIS IS A BIG RED FLAG. I mean, why would anyone flaunt his/her wealth to someone who he/she has NEVER met? Plus, all his sugar talk like ""Let's get married,"" ""I'll go find you, and I'll book a Marina Bay Sands Hotel, come over,"" things like that, which confirms my suspicion that the guy wanna get into her pants and dumb her.

Who asks a person who he has never met to get married? When my friend politely declines not to go over his hotel, he said, ""At most, I will take responsibility after we did it, to get married. I'll take care of you, and you never have to work again. We can always travel to all the different countries you would like to visit.""

37,"I’m writing this for myself, as an affirmation to me that the work I’ve done over the past four years has been worth it. If you read it, thanks! Hope your week is going okay. 


Four years ago I made this account with depression (but undiagnosed), cried myself to sleep once a week, thought every night  about how much better my family would be if I died, and would stare at walls, my entire body numb, because I hated myself so much. I was an eighth-grade kid with all of the middle school issues... not that this was the bottemest rock bottom of anyone ever, but it wasn’t fun. 

I *wanted* bulimia, lost my best (and only) group of friends as they all began to gossip behind my back, didn’t talk to my parents for days at a time other than asking for food, and sat alone at lunch. Looking back, I was pushing myself to be this model Asian kid that I wasn’t. I felt like I didn’t fit in because my standards were all wrong.

That next year, I wrote an essay about my issues. I dived into the sports I’d been playing, found my academic ground, found people to talk to, and took a leap of faith, one where I pretended that I was just like revert one else... until it worked.

My volleyball team said hi to me in the hallways and ate lunch with me. I made great relationships with my teachers, killed myself academically and reaped the rewards, I started weightlifting. Sophomore year, I got my license. I figured out how to dress to make myself confident (now I *finally* understand the whole wanting to change an outfit three times during the day to show off thing). I had a great group of friends that had since fallen apart, but I’ve learned coping skills. I’m damn proud of them. I know sooo many good food spots and viewpoints around where I live, love driving around, and am HAPPY with my set of skills. I’ve dived in professionally into internships and volunteering, and am balancing stuff.

In the eighth grade, I wrote down that it was like I was in a tunnel and I knew the “light” (truly enjoying life, well, at least enjoying the highs without fearing for the lows to hit) existed but couldn’t find it. I am proud to say I have.

My dad in the fall of 2019 unexpectedly, I lost friends once again over not knowing how to properly bother them (I just stayed silent and it ate me up inside).  My grandfather just died a month ago. A friend of my committed suicide last summer. 

And I still feel okay.

I applied to colleges and have already been accepted into four with great financial aid.
But I’ve also been drunk and high, and found my limits. I’ve said yes to stuff and lived unafraid to fuck up. I finally (after a lifetime of struggling with it) came out to myself. I’m ready to face my (very homophobic) family now (wait no, maybe, but we’re getting there). I’m looking forward to the future, unlike the me of four years ago who was certain I’d be dead today. 

I’m now the person people come to with their problems. I’m the fucked-up-shit problem solver among those I know and I know myself and how to handle my emotions and quirks. I know my elevator speech, am okay with putting myself out there.

I’m so sorry this was so long but I’m just amazed at how much has happened the past four years. High school really did me well.

He is also a highly functioning addict. When we were still married, I was the only involved parent but I kept the charade of him being a decent dad up for the sake of my daughter. I realize now that she clearly felt the truth of who he was and I blindly thought I was doing the right thing by staying as long as I could.

When I did divorce him my daughter's life completely changed of course. He somewhat attempted to remain in her life but it was short lived and even when he would make plans he would cancel or just not show up. On her 10th birthday he was to take her to an amusement park. He never showed up and every single time I recall this memory it brings tears to my eyes to remember how she felt that day, and frankly every other day he blew her off. He never paid support but I selflessly did not make it an issue as I should have in order to have some peace in the relationship between me, him and my daughter for her sake.

He eventually drown in his addiction and dropped out of her life completely 4 years ago yet he made plenty of money, remarried and moved out of state, boasting his new wife's fake boobs paid for by him, cruises they would take, tattoos they would get, etc on social media. She and I continued our lives together and I remained strong for her. She is now 15 and although very successful at school and sports, she hopes to play in college....she is extremely depressed. I finally convinced her to go to therapy and during one of the first sessions she was taken in on a 5150 hold. It was devastating. She is a great student, athlete and very sweet girl. She still sleeps with her stuffed bear and of course does all the normal teen stuff but she's different.....she's really, really sweet and highly empathetic.

I attempted to contact her father when she was in the hospital. I pleaded for him to come together with me for her sake and to show her that he cared and that he and I could be there together for her. He absolutely refused and told me to go to hell.

I feel so badly for her, she didn't ask to be born to a dad like that and she is hurting so badly and I hurt for her so badly it affects my work but I have become a warrior princess for her and I will continue to fight for her happiness every single day. I make plenty of money to keep her happy and secure but we all know money can't buy happiness.

He is such an angry, angry person. I realize now that she is too old for me to remarry and have someone become a father figure to her but my question is how can I help her have a father figure at this age? How can I help her not feel abandoned because she really has been?",20Feb2020,1
44,"I've been through a lot in the past year with breaking off an old and terrible relationship to starting a new one which I love very much. Before I blamed my ex for a lot of things but sometimes I get down and start really blaming myself for everything that went wrong. My ex cheated on me and manipulated me to stop hanging out with people and only focusing on her. Now in this relationship I am in I get anxious and worried a lot about the smallest things I know I shouldn't be. She told me today that she felt like I was becoming controlling and her friend told her I was sending red flags and that absolutely destroyed me because that's the last thing I want to do. I just want to forgive myself and get past all the stupid things I worry about and be the man I want to be for both me and her. I am worried I'll continue to ruin the things I care about all because I cant let go.

49,"This is obviously what most people hope for, but why? I saw a post in r/unpopularopinion to which I do agree that the internet has made life feel like a competition or that you need to show off the amazing things you’re doing with every waking moment. Since I saw this I thought a lot about why I am so eager to be living my life to the fullest and always feel full of wanting and motivation to do great things all the time.  

Of course, it makes me happy and I enjoy it. But, the more I thought about why I am so impatient and eager to be living my best life even more so in the last few years is the decline of my health. My mom has MS and I think I have always been in fear of losing my life and not being able to do the things I want while I am fully able.  I am only 21, but I feel my health issues taking a toll on me even though they are mostly unidentified no matter how hard I try to get answers.
The identified ones aren’t going away and are not easily managed. 

I have no idea if I will end up in a situation like my moms and I believe she is so lucky with her life because she is more able than projected with her condition. But watching her go through everything she has and sharing the feelings of her situation has made me feel so sad for her losses and scared for myself. 

Best case scenario, I do a lot of amazing things while I’m young and still have a whole life to fill with more amazing things. 

Why not live now, it’s all that’s guaranteed.",20Feb2020,1
51,"I had a bad day today. Last night, I was kept awake by the realization that I was inappropriately touched on numerous occasions by a family member when I was younger and that what they were doing to me wasn’t normal. 
I fell asleep on the couch last night because I was exhausted from being out with school and music performances all day. The kitchen was a mess - I hadn’t cleaned it yet after making dinner. My mom came home and it was clear she was so tired and done. I felt really bad. I ended up cleaning after jolting up awake, but it reminded me to the things she said before, about how if she knew how useless I’d turn out to be she wouldn’t have given birth to me at all. She doesn’t mean it though, but it still hurt and I still think about it. 
I woke up in a bad mood because of that. It worsened because I kept beating myself over how much I was struggling in a subject. I cried a lot during school hours, and I felt pathetic. 
I went to the class for that subject that I feel so bad about and it dawned on me that I probably had the lowest mark out of everyone in the class. 50% on the quiz, while everyone else averaged about 75%. 
I was so down. I went to get bubble tea to cheer myself... and then I dropped it before I could even drink. 
But, it’s fine. I had a crappy day. It happened and it’s over. I went home and played a little bit of video games, took a nap, ate, and did homework. Today was bad but let’s see what tomorrow’s like.

I'm priveleged to be born in a developed country and already live in relative luxury compared to most people. Why would I deserve to pursue even more luxuries when the money I would spend on like a nice new mattress could really help someone else who is struggling just to meet basic needs?

This is a good thing yet it makes me feel like undeserving garbage. I just think about how other people see me as some spoiled, priveleged, ungrateful stupid kid who doesn't know real hardship and hasn't truly earned anything in life.

But what got me really worried is my girlfriend talking about how much she enjoyed the first months of our relationship and how much she enjoyed it. We're in our 4th year now but I honestly barely remember how it was in the first months.
I couldn't even recall what we did or how our relationship and our everyday life was. I have some bits and parts in my memory but a lot of them are from pictures I saw and I assume I just think I remember. 
The same goes with my youth and high school time. An old friend told me that due to construction we had parta of our classes at a completely different school and always were taken there by bus. When he told me I remembered, but it's really really blurry. I couldn't even say for how long it was going on or how old I was.

67,"I don’t remember the exact age I was when she said this to me but the memory had singed itself to my very being that I’m rather grateful for her words.

First, why and how it happened. Well, it began when an acquaintance of my mom saw us and commented how pretty I’ve grown. As a child such compliments had fanned my vanity and I was grinning from ear to ear. Then, when the acquaintance left after her small talk with my mom, my mom told me without any hesitation the brutal words:

“They only say you’re pretty to save my face but the truth is, you are ugly.”

Suffice to say, my pretty vain self had suffered a blow and I never trusted anyone’s compliments of my physical looks ever since except when they complimented my fantastic clothes or my confidence.

Now, let me be honest, it had hurt and I struggled to not criticize my looks as I grew because I never took seriously what others had observed. I assumed the compliments to be lip service and even when I smile and nod upon receiving them I’d still be wary inside.

However, to my surprise I learned to discern the nuances of conversations because, you see, being complimented gives a person a high and this emotional high can blind them to small hints and red flags here and there e.g. carried away by sales talk that you don’t want anyway.

I learned that words uttered were not necessarily sincere or honest and I shouldn’t take what others’ said at face value because sometimes they would fool you into thinking you were allies when in fact, they’re just stringing you along.

I developed a shield of sorts, to not trust the beauty seen by the beholder but to only listen to my own counsel.

So, I’m proud to say that I have a fairly good and stable self-esteem today because everyday, it was my eyes that sometimes observed the glow of my cheeks, the alertness of my almond eyes, and found me beautiful; and also my eyes that sometimes lamented on the pimple scars, the dark eye bags and cried how people can be so pretty while I’m not.

But that’s okay because I learned that you can’t be pretty or ugly every second of every day. That being pretty passes and that being ugly also passes.

I learned that people are multi-faceted, driven by inner desires that might not be spoken but bled from their minute actions.

I learned that being honest with myself, that owning my prettiness and my ugliness made me love myself.

I learned that because of this love, I don’t regret the me that I am today.


P.S. I love my mom and I understand she had her  moments of un-motherliness. She might not mean them, in fact, she doesn’t remember but she’s only human, she can lose her cool and be a bitch to her daughter, she’s still an amazing mother after all that.

83,"**TLDR at the bottom**

I \[M25\] just turned 25. After graduating from high-school 6 years ago I decided to save my parents some money, and instead of going to study abroad, I was a home student at my home town, at a pretty shitty university too. I always wanted to move out, but I also couldn't justify it to my parents, as I wasn't able to support myself, and they weren't gonna spend any money when I could've just stayed at home. 

Apart from a couple of summers working in the US, I was sleeping in the same room, having to deal with my parents' bullshit all day. I got depressed, I was playing video games most of the time, which was pissing off my mom, and I was getting pissed at her, saying I'm 20 and I can make my own decisions, etc, etc. Basically high-school quarrels 5 years too late. 

I wasn't asocial. I still had plenty of friends, but I just didn't feel the freedom of being on my own. I kept telling my parents I have to be on my own, and they (my mother especially) didn't understand how they were the problem. I just felt smothered by them for some reason.

I didn't meet many people in college, and once I started working I didn't have much time to socialize either. So I totally missed out on that, especially when it came to romantic relationships - I didn't go on a single date for 5 years. This made me more and more depressed, which was pissing off my parents even more, and it was becoming a vicious circle of blame and resentment.

However, recently I moved to London to pursue a master's degree. And I've never felt better! Living by myself turned out better than expected. I don't miss anything about my old life - not the people, not the environment, not the food, not my pets (well, maybe a little bit). I didn't even want to go home for Christmas.

Unfortunately, I still lack social skills (especially when it comes to dating) because of the 5 years I wasted. And I can't stop regretting I didn't go study abroad. I think I would've gained so much instead of spending that time depressed playing video games. I finally have what I wanted, and I'm very happy with it, but I can't stop thinking about the past... My master's program will be over in a few months, and I'm not looking forward to going back into the routine of a working man, so that's also laying on my mind.

I know I can't change the past, and I know regret is a waste of my energy, and I know I need to live in the moment and focus on improving myself here and now, but I still have these thoughts every so often. How do I overcome that? I sometimes like to think that moving out at 20 could've made my life 10 times worse and that things happen for a reason, and that it's all part of my story, but I **still think about the past all the time! Help!**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**  
I spent the last 5 years after high-school living with my parents, which made me miserable and restricted me from experiencing my young adult life to the fullest. Even though now I'm living on my own in the greatest city on earth, I'm still filled with regret, and I realize my reasoning is flawed, but it's still hard to not think about the past and how it *could've been* had I moved out when I was 20.",20Feb2020,1

But to tell the truth, I kinda avoid all people. I talk back and help out if anyone asks me anything but I NEVER initiate conversation. It’s not even mainly a race or language thing because I don’t join activities with people from my own country that are here, either.

I've been sober for almost 2 years now from weed and cocaine abuse mainly. In my opinion, I'm past that and I know my physical and mental health improved a lot since. My life changed for the better in a lot of ways.

But sometimes, even though I know I'd never do that again, I have some thoughts and nostalgia (because of course I had some good moments while using drugs) when I have nothing to do such as smoking joints or going out with friends and being wasted. To me it's meaningless but I'm also wondering if it's normal or if I'm not completely healed?

91,"This post is for myself. It’s not necessary for me to justify my emotions, thoughts, or actions to strangers on the internet. But having an account where I’ve laid out everything regarding my emotions/thoughts/actions re: my ex is helpful to me in a journaling sense, and I like having it someplace anonymous on the internet where I don’t need to worry that it’s going to be found by someone I know. 

After reading the comments on the letter of forgiveness I wrote to XXXXX, I’ve decided to examine some of the points that were repeatedly brought up and sort through my feelings about them. Presented below in no particular order.

**Am I Still In Love With My Ex?**  
No. I realized that I was really never in love with him in the first place, which was a big step in letting go of the relationship. I had built it up in my head that I was head over heels in love with him and that he broke my heart, and used that as a reason to cling to the idea that this was a huge betrayal on his part. But I can see now that I was just infatuated with him, because I was so invested in having found someone else that appeared to be perfect after the worst relationship I’d ever been in. For simplicity’s sake, though, I’ll still call this being in love with him. In which case, I stopped being in love with him a couple of months after I found out about Girl #2 (which caused things to end between us) and no longer had any interest in being with him romantically. Instead, I felt anger at him for how I perceived that he had wronged me and just wanted him to receive comeuppance or feel forced to apologize. 

**Am I ""Over"" My Ex?**  
Yes. I’ve been on my way to getting over it for a few years. The stalking became less intense, less vindictive, and less focused on an actual result and more just something I had formed a terrible habit of doing. I could tell the whole time that I was starting to move past what had happened, but I hadn’t figured out the final hurdle that I needed to clear. I eventually realized that the final hurdle was self-honesty, which was what I needed in order to truly forgive and move on. After finally forgiving XXXXX, I no longer feel angry with him or wish for anything bad to happen to him. I really don’t care what happens to him, it’s never going to affect my life again. I think that indifference marks truly being over him. 

**That Wasn’t A Good Enough Letter/Think How He’d Feel If He Read It**  
It doesn’t matter how he’d feel or what he’d think if he read my letter. It’s a letter for me to write, not for him to read. All that matters is that I’ve said what I needed to say to move forward in my own personal journey of healing.

**Your Letter Was Making Excuses And Playing The Victim**  
I wasn’t making any excuses for my behavior. I don’t feel that it is excusable or that I have any possible justification for what I did. I addressed a few things that my ex did wrong, OBVIOUSLY, because how can you forgive someone without acknowledging the thing that you felt you needed to forgive them for? I wasn’t playing the victim in doing so. I don’t think I was victimized by my ex (although I may have felt so in the past, I now see that’s unfair). I understand that I victimized him through the stalking and harassment. Whatever people are reading into my letter to say that it wasn’t true forgiveness, that my apologies/emotions were shallow, and every other criticism- it’s just that, what *they're* reading into it. I know what my letter was meant to express and I know what it means to me; no one else’s opinion matters here.

**Why Don’t You Come Clean To Your Ex About The Stalking?/He’s Scared, Traumatized, Etc.**  
I have. He once accused me of it, and I denied it, and he believed me. He accused me of it again later, and I didn’t deny it. Later still I sent him a message admitting to him that I was behind the stalking and apologizing for it. He didn’t acknowledge having received it, so I cannot be sure he did, but I’d stake money on it. I’m sure he’s been very annoyed that I was still coming after him, but I don’t believe he’s been truly scared since realizing that it was just me playing the “crazy ex-girlfriend” and not a group of anonymous strangers as he initially feared. This doesn’t change the fact that being stalked was a horrible experience for him and that he was very scared for a time, and I hope he’s able to heal from that.

**Tell Your Fiancé The Truth**  
I’ve thought about this the most, and tested the waters a little bit the last 3ish days by talking to him about being obsessed with my ex, my sociopathic tendencies, and whether at this stage in our relationship he would want to know about any Big Dealbreakers I’ve successfully kept hidden. Based on his responses, knowing him in general, and my gut instinct, I’ve decided not to tell him. It’s not something I’m going to continue to do, so it won’t affect our lives in the future. My secret bad habit didn’t have any effect on our relationship, other than forcing me to keep a secret from them. He and I both agree that keeping a secret from your partner is okay as long as it’s not actively negatively affecting them, and as long as you really do keep the secret and they don’t find out. I’m certain that he’s not going to find out about this, despite the insistence of the peanut gallery that the truth will always out. I think that at this point, telling him serves no purpose than burdening him with information that he can’t really/won’t want to do anything about. I know he wouldn’t for a minute consider not marrying me no matter what I told him about myself; best just to let this lie and move forward.

**Seek Professional Help**  
If I ever find that I’m slipping back into my old habits (or even feeling the compulsion to do so), I will. But at this point I don’t think that seeing a counselor/therapist/etc. would be helpful to me. It may have been when I was still selling myself the fiction that this was a compulsion that I was unable to stop. But I understand now that it was nothing more than vindictive anger, and I could’ve stopped any time I decided I was ready to let go of the anger. Having decided that now, I’m not feeling the compulsion anymore. I don’t really have anything to say to a professional about it. I’m aware of the underlying issues that contributed to me acting out like this in the first place, as those ARE things I’ve spoken to therapists about: unhealthy anxiety coping methods, general relationship anxiety, issues with anxious attachment. I’ve made huge strides getting past all of those things, and apart from using the stalking as an outlet for those bad behaviors, they’re no longer significantly affecting my life. If I begin to feel like I’m losing my grip on this now that I don’t have the stalking as an outlet, I’ll make an appointment immediately. Until that point, I think I’m going to be okay navigating life with the strategies I already have in place. No reason to waste money on further appointments.

I think that’s all for now. More later, maybe.",20Feb2020,2
92,"I've been working for my company for about 4 years. I've been in different departments and i think i've been doing well. A couple weeks ago there was an opening for a higher rol in my department and a lot of people told me that i should apply, so i did it. There haven't been any updates about the process but they were supposed to be interviewing people already.

The thing is, i'm not a very competitive person and i'm always doubting myself, but this time, for the first time in  my life, i think i deserve the job.

94,"Apologize for the rant like format, on mobile and I just need to put this somewhere so I don't spiral. 

My grandmother has been battling cancer for 5 years and opted to go out on her own terms through the MAiD (Medical assistance in dying) program here in Canada. She announced last week that today will be her last day and even though I'd know for months this was coming it still was a punch to gut. All week I'd been keeping my head (I wear my emotions like a bad suit so it's been hard) and just trying to busy myself instead of thinking about it. Last night I went to say my goodbyes with my sister since she only wants my Mother, Grandfather, and her sister in attendance for her actual passing. It was nice to get that chance, to tell her how much I loved her and say a real goodbye. I barely cried last night during the goodbyes and thought I was processing it all well enough that I'd be fine to finish my week at work. 

This morning I figured I'd go into to work, put on a brave face and just power through. I was in tears less then 20mins into the shift when a coworker asked how my night was. I explained my situation to my colleagues/boss and was told to just go home and to let them know if I'd be in tomorrow. The moment I left I felt guilty, deep shameful guilt like I hadn't before. I feel like I'm using her death as an excuse to get off work and just sit around my house. Keep wondering if maybe I'm overreacting, if I should have just stayed and kept working, if other people will judge me for taking time to grieve, am I grieving enough to justify missing work... Its constant. I don't know how to tell myself I'm being dumb, that I'm allowed to take time to morn her loss even though I'm just at home. The funeral is Sunday... I don't know if my guilt will force me to try to go to work tomorrow, I don't know what use I'll be if I'm still crying at the drop of a hat, I just know I'm sad.",20Feb2020,2
95,"For the last 8 months I have worked for a company. It has been nothing but problems the whole time. I've gotten to the point where I keep a list in my locker of people i see come and go.

There's a position between myself and the ASM that does things like price changes, plan-o-grams, closing the store, ect.

98,"I was 18 when I met him, he was my first everything. We fell in love fast and stayed together for 4 years. 
But that was ~2 years longer than it ever should have lasted. 
He was wonderful, kind, and loved me immensely. In the beginning I loved him too but after awhile I realized I wasn’t in love but I still cared for him deeply. The way you would your best friend. 
I felt terrible about this. I knew it would hurt him if he found out, so I stayed. I mean after all I did care for him. 
In those 2 years I stayed, I became distant. I’d spend a lot of time in our room thinking about how much happier I’d be if I was by myself and this filled me with a tremendous amount of guilt. To alleviate myself of this guilt I made him my only priority. I threw my own wants, desires and self care to the side and prioritize him in every way. Don’t get me wrong I was still very distant, we had no intimacy in our relationship for ~a year. But we still got along great and he chalked up the lack of intimacy to me being stressed. I thought this was how it was going to be for the rest of my life and honestly I was okay with it as long as he remained happy. 
Then one day I don’t know why but I decided to book a trip for myself for a few days. I went to San Antonio, TX. Those few days in San Antonio were magical. They allowed me to escape my reality and be in this illusion as if I were single. In three days, I fell in love with myself again. I relaxed in the hotel, I walk along the river, I took in the sights, I went shopping, I took myself out to dinner, I got the chance to talk with some really wonderful people, I remembered how much fun I was and I released myself of any guilt. 
I was truly happy for the first time in years. 
Then it was time to go back to my reality, I cried the whole way to the airport. My poor Lyft driver was trying so hard to cheer me up (sometimes people are wonderful aren’t they? Don’t worry I tipped). Eventually I pulled myself together, got on the plane and started the journey home. 
When I landed, he was there excited to see me, ready to give me a big hug and kiss (which I was dreading) and I lost it again. 
And I finally told him everything. 
I told him how much I cared about him, how I wished I loved him and how much I needed to be alone. We cried together. He was more upset that I’d been hurting for so long then he was with me not loving him anymore. 
It’s been 1.5 years since we broke up, and for 1.5 years I’ve been staying true to myself and couldn’t be happier. He is also doing really well, and we continue to stay in touch. Neither one of us harbor any bad feelings for one another. 

It’s funny people always say you can’t help who you fall in love with but they never talk about falling out of love. So for anyone who can relate to this story or this feeling, I’d like to tell you that it’s okay to break up with someone that you care about. If you fall out love with someone who’s great and you don’t understand why, it’s okay. You’re not a bad person. It’s okay to choose yourself.",20Feb2020,2
99,"I tried avoiding going on disability because I wanted to be working instead.  This translated into me rarely working due to pain, and living with my parents until I was 29 (when I finally applied for disability and qualified).

It isn't a lot of money but constantly has me worried about things.  I can't afford a vehicle so get help from my parents when I need to get groceries, but lately I've been really worried about what I'm going to do about groceries when they die (beyond how sad that will be).  I can't afford to hire someone to bring me groceries (I've used apps before when living in the hospital and it just isn't feasible long-term at this income bracket), and to make matters worse once I reach retirement age I lose disability and go on my country's pension plan, which is ~15% less than I get right now.  Again I don't have a vehicle so I have no idea how I'm going to do weekly grocery runs.

I've tried everything but nothing helps.  I might qualify for a tax benefit soon, if I do I'm going to try more physio and cross my fingers because I would at least like to be working part time.  Full time would be better, it sucks how shallow life becomes but it's really just about money.  I have to start worrying about these things when younger due to disability and I really wish I could've been a person that keeps their nose to the grindstone and yeah working to live sucks but I'd have a lot less worries about aging if I were that person.",20Feb2020,1

They either shit talk me for no reason or make up a drama on the spot and act all loud and mad. Today I had an encounter with this lovely elderly degenerate who got mad because I asked them to show me their purchase bill (because I have to check if they really paid for what they’re taking). He got loud. He called me a fucking Indian (what kind of an insult is that? I don’t even look like one). I tried to not get mad back, but I felt a wave of adrenaline rush over me. Imagined all the ways I could hurt this idiot from a torn liver to a bashed in skull. And every time it gets harder. I barely held myself from beating the shit out of him right there and then. I realize that it’s so minor and unimportant, but I just can’t stand people being rude to me. I asked them to do what EVERYONE ELSE does. Are you really above them all to be a dick for no reason? And there’s this guy, my colleague. He’s a 24 year old man-child who only applied for the job because he has a crush on a girl we now both work with. Every time she’s around he tries to impress her by shittalking me and trying to make me mad. Wonderful tactic, right? I told him that if he says another word to me I’m kicking his teeth in. He’s cocky, but only when around her. We all know that he’s a coward and obviously he’s never even been in a fight. But would I really be an asshole if I beat him up for being rude to me for no reason? I honestly think I should never pick a fight at work because I value it more than these fools, but some people just don’t stop unless physically confronted. And I’m afraid because once I get in a fight my blood starts to boil and I begin imagining all the ways to hurt them as much as I can. Broken teeth, cut out eyes, severed arteries and such. I’m not saying I necessarily will do that but I’m very scared that I might. I don’t want that to happen but I think there’s something wrong with me, once I’m angry it’s like I’m a different person. I remember when I was young I beat up a kid for accidentally hitting me in the balls with a football. I was repeatedly kicking him in the ribs with my foot. Over and over until he started screaming. I don’t think I broke any of his bones though because we were kids and kids are not exactly strong, but I still feel bad for that. I just couldn’t control myself. And now that I’m a grown man, I feel like I can just accidentally hit too hard and well go to jail. But I don’t know how to control myself. I don’t know what to do.",20Feb2020,0

103,"Nparents, toxic family and toxic, abusive ex have ruined some parts of my self esteem. I’d like to think that I’ve still survived well despite all this and learned a lot on the way, but I know I could have done much better if I had some support. There have been a few things that are holding me back. I’m trying to focus on them and “just do” them but it’s not working. So I need help:

1. I come from a proud culture with a non-Latin script/language. Everyone’s IDs are all in the mother language until they get a passport and usually it’s the passport officer who transliterates the names into English. When I was younger I was so focused on spelling my name in English so that people could pronounce it correctly so I went with a non-common spelling of my name and got my passport with that spelling. I like my name and used to be quite confident about how I spelt it, have most website usernames under my first name only on the earlier days of the Internet and even got a domain with my name and so on. 
Moving to Europe later on showed me a different side of things: racism, false judgements, etc. etc. I started to notice that people judge me just based on my name, even before seeing me in person (say a job application). They also usually confuse me with another nationality that I dislike being related to. (Because of the way my name is spelt). Also it’s apparently not very clear for my own fellow country mates to pick up where I’m from. I’ve been thinking about this and discussing it with friends and therapists and I know whatever I do, there would be idiots to misjudge or misspell things but I simply cannot get over it. Changing legal docs isn’t easy and also on the Internet I’m somehow conflicted to have more than one name spelling.

2. I’m fairly shy/introverted but I like photography and used to be very active in photoshooting and posting online (before Instagram) however possibly due to the abusive Nex that I had, I started losing my self-confidence more and more and become more and more critical of myself which held me from posting my photos that I’d love to share with the world. When I eventually gave up resisting Instagram (because I thought it’s not for pros!), and finally joined, my mindset was that I’ll just take it easy and post photos of daily stuff I shoot with my phone and it doesn’t have to be perfect. This hasn’t worked out well. I have 220 posts in 6 years! And here’s the pattern:
I see things that I photograph or I go on trips and take pictures, I keep imagining myself sharing photos on Instagram and writing about my thoughts, etc. but this just keeps going on in my head for days without me even daring to go and check my gallery to look at the photos I’ve taken and then it gets too late to post and things just get buried down. I know that it’s social media and it shouldn’t matter, etc. etc. but this shows an underlying issue that I have and need to resolve. 

3. I’m also conflicted on how to display myself online (first name only, full name, nickname, ...?) (by the way I always wanted to have a cool nickname but wasn’t creative enough to come up with one ir again maybe it was that lack of emotional support that I’ve never had) so I’m observing that people may not recognize me as its only my non-commonly-spelt first name and maybe not a very clear profile picture but again there’s this resistance in showing myself because I’m not confident to look at myself in photos? 

A side reason to this is also how I cannot find a pattern/order to post as neither of these platforms are about order or pattern but just instant posts and my brain is struggling with this. 


TL;DR: I’m apparently not comfortable with a few ‘labels’ about myself and that’s holding me from expressing myself. How can I fix this? I’ve tried therapy and “just do it” and hasn’t helped.

117,"So this is going to be a long post but I (24F) just need to tell someone my story. Thank you in advance for reading. 

I was born with a meth addict mother and alcoholic father. My mother overdosed when I was four years old and my Grandmother on mom’s side took custody of me and my four siblings. My grandparents on my fathers side never wanted to form a relationship with us and I have only met them once in my life from what I was told, I also have an uncle on my fathers side but I have never met him. Anyway, after my mom died and my grandma took custody we only visited my father a handful of times because he was an alcoholic, abusive, toxic, etc. A real piece of scum on this earth honestly. One time he left me on the side of a four lane interstate because I spilled crumbs in his car. My sisters made him turn around a couple of miles down the road, but that still sucked to feel abandoned again. I am the youngest of five children and we all share the same mother and father which surprises me considering they were raging druggies, but I digress. 

I am grateful that I was adopted by my grandma instead of being put through the foster system but I would be lying if I didn’t wish my moms side of the family would have let me go early on in life. Part of me wonders all the time if I would have been able to find a family that would have helped me at a younger age. I don’t let myself get stuck on that too often because it fills me with rage that I had no control for so many years of my life. My mom’s sisters all pitched in with my grandma to raise us kids, but really it was a battle of who had the most control and who could get us kids to listen to them at that moment. They wanted nothing to do with us kids unless we were being bad and they needed to get onto us and there was never boundaries for us. Since we didn’t have parents, everyone felt like they could try and parent me. They all tried telling me different things and never let me have an opinion or even try to find out who I was. 

Childhood wasn’t too terrible other then the psychological abuse my grandmother put me through. I would get gifted work out equipment because “I needed to loose weight I was getting to big.” If I didn’t dress to my grandmas standards I was told I looked ugly and if I didn’t;t wear makeup I was told to put some on. To this day, at 24 years old, I am still getting in trouble for not wearing my hair fixed or having my makeup done. It is so exhausting. 

The hardest part of my life was when my oldest sister (she was 17 I was 14) passed away in a car wreck on her way to pick me up. It happened two weeks before I started my freshman year of high school and it was the most raw pain I have ever felt. I can remember the moment I heard “She’s dead” like it was two seconds ago. My sister and I fought, sure, but she was the most affectionate member of the family and she was the one I counted on most growing up. She was my comfort and my home, almost like she was my mom. She was such a beautiful soul and she lived every moment to the fullest and that inspires me to this day. I wish so badly I could have known her better and treasured her more while she was on earth. When I was passing my sisters last living age I was very suicidal, but then something changed. 

My sisters death is what motivated me to break the cycle of my toxic family. I could not allow myself to continue being broken and I wasn’t able to heal without being distanced from my family, so I moved away for College which was the perfect excuse. It was only 3,5 hrs away from my family but it felt like Heaven. I never realized how much I craved independence to make my own choices without my family’s pressure down my back. I wasn’t a bad kid by any means, I didn’t drink or do drugs throughout high school and the most I did before moving away was smoke pot, which is now legal where I live medicinally. I am such an empathetic person  that I couldn’t let myself be happy when I saw every single person broken around me not trying to fix themselves and not willing to put the work in to heal from our past traumas. They guilt me constantly for moving away and not being there. When I visit home, they ask me to do errands or chores for them, they don’t ask to talk or spend quality time or anything I care to do at all. They haven’t taken the time to visit me in almost 5 years. I will say they made the trip to come to my college Graduation but that is the only time they have came. They hurt me so much and I don’t feel like I can ever tell them the pain they have caused because I know they are broken and they tried the best they could with what they had. It still hurts. 

Since moving I started therapy and I have started medication, I have found a full time career and lastly I have learned my sexuality. I am a proud bisexual woman and I have my first girlfriend, we have been dating for almost a month and she is such a blessing in my life. I never realized how much I was missing out on in life. I am still unlearning toxic thought patterns everyday but I have made such progress in the past two years alone and I am so proud of the person I am today. I wish I could tell baby me that it would be okay. I wish I could have told myself I had PTSD, I wasn’t a “bitch” or “psycho”, I was a deeply hurt human grieving and yearning for comfort. This post is me forgiving myself for every thing I did to survive and heal. 

Thank you if you made it this far, I am rooting for every one of you to find yourselves and your happiness as well.",20Feb2020,1

119,"So I was shopping in Walmart, and there was the last pack of dark chocolate m&amp;m's...and an small child came by saying, ""Hey! I was gonna buy that!""

And I said, ""Sorry buddy. It's the last one and I already have it in my hands.""

""I'll beat your ass for it!"", the child said.

""Really?"", I said. ""I'm 21. How old are you? Like 6?""

""I'm 8 years old you dick biscuit!"", the child said.

Then before I know it, the kid headbutts my crotch area with all his might, and I cringe in sheer pain, barely being able to move. I somehow was still able to hold onto the m&amp;m's. Then the kid started kicking me in the back of my leg, forcing me to take a knee. Then he runs in front of me, yanks my classes off, and starts slapping me in the face. I still haven't let go of the bag of m&amp;m's. Then the kid runs away. I think he's done.

Like 5 minutes later, he comes back with a plastic baseball bat I think he got from the toys section, and I'm still immobilized from the pain from when he headbutt my balls earlier, and he starts hitting me with it in the back of the head, and then starts hitting me with it in the stomach, till I drop the bag of m&amp;m's, and he takes it and runs of.

And I just laid there immobilized on the floor for like the next 45 minutes.

I was trying not to hit him being much older than him, but I was legit impressed by the amount of damage he did to me despite being so much smaller. And he won the fight, though technically if this was a world without rules and he didn't headbutt my balls, I could knock him out in one punch.",20Feb2020,1

It's either help the planet or self expression ig.

I would have been fine with this before getting into makeup. It's a new hobby of mine I'm starting to really enjoy and I'd hate to let that go.

They're so many things I'd have to let go of (ok not too much lol) like witch hazel for example or hand sanitizer.",20Feb2020,1
122,"This woman has been in my life for two years. The first year we were dating, then we broke up but stayed close friends while she dated other guys. I did not continue to date other women due to a medical condition that started just before our breakup. The medical condition is largely what I  blame the failure of our relationship on.

Side note to explain my condition: I tore a ligament in my right hip. The pain slowly progressed to the point now that I can only move around (slowly) for about 45 minutes at a time before I have to lay completely flat for an hour before I can move again. The good news is that my insurance FINALLY approved a surgery that I'll be getting in May.

Anyway, this girl has been my ONLY friend, and she has been a good one for the most part. We obviously still had feelings for eachother, however, other men were able to wrap up her spare feels for me. But we were still friends. I even let her stay in my house for free all of December when she was between jobs.

She would spend the most time with me when she was between boyfriends, which was about 10 of them over the year. (I found out later she would also visit me while seeing other men, without telling me about them). She would come over and unload on me about how all men are the exact same and no one understands her and no one is good enough for her. And how from now on she is going to be single like me. Yeah right.

So I would give her a generous back massage, get some wine that she liked, cook her dinner, and watch Netflix with her. She didn't mind if we cuddled a bit on the couch but I generally recieved no affection from her.

She would even call me at midnight somtimes to see ""if I'm up."" I was not up. I would get up for her. She would come over and lay on my bed and complain about whatever guy she was just with and I could smell dick on her breath.

Lastnight I had a dream about her making out with several men right in front of me. I wasn't going to tell her about it, but it just so happened that she called me this morning to say hi. So I told her about it. She said it was interesting but that I should move on because she doesn't have any interest in me like that.

We got off the phone any my feelings were hurt, bad. I retaliated. I wrote her a very long text explaining exactly everything that I've been holding inside. In including the reason why she doesn't want me is because I've become didabled. I told her that out of all the men shes been with that I was the only one who loved her, while listening to her complain about men.

But I also took it farther. I called her a slut and said, ""you want me to be the guy who let's you come lay on my bed after the guy who you let cum on your face loses interest in you.""

I messed up, guys. Her response was simply, ""Have a good one."" And I haven't heard from her all day. I said some mean things and I feel sick to my stomach. At the same time I AM done being whatever I was to her. I could have said it nicer. A lot nicer. I was so rude that I can't even apologize, if you know what I mean.

I'm in a really dark place. I've been depressed and even suicidal about my hip and now I pushed away my only friend. She didn't deserve how rude I was to her. And I will say that this debilitating pain in my hip is slowly turning me into an angry, bitter person, and I hate it. It's even changed my face. I don't know what to do, I'm not feeling good.",20Feb2020,1
123,"The book was The Good Daughter by Karin Slaughter. If you've read it I'm sure you can guess why. If you haven't read it read no further and go find it in your preferred media because its excellent, and going in blind like I did is the way to do it. 

The events described on their own are horrific, but it's the character development that twists the knife and rocks it back and forth. I got emotionally attached quicker and harder than I've ever been before. The book has mostly numbered chapters but 4 of the 5 named chapters are flashbacks to the night the two main characters mother died. Without re-writing a good portion of the book she was shot with a shotgun (in excruciating detail). the older daughter has her eyelids nearly ripped off, is shot in the head, and buried alive (again in excruciating detail). While the younger daughter runs away to safety, but not before witnessing everything. Or at least that's what you're led to belive. About 3/4 of the way through the book at the funeral for the girls father 28 years later the younger sister is breaking down and decides to tell the truth. You see for 28 years shes been lieing. When she ran she didn't run fast enough. She was caught and violently raped (again in excruciating detail) before finally getting free and running to the neighbors farm. Her father shows up before the police get there. The conversation they have is what had me an almost 30 year old man weeping like I haven't since middle school. She apologizes to her father that she didn't run fast enough, that he put his thing in her, over and over I'm sorry daddy. The book is pure emotional terrorism in the best way.",20Feb2020,1

130,"Back in 2016 winter, I was very fat. But I went out with my family for some mountaineering during the peak of winter. There was a photo of me in the mountains with snow everywhere and half-frozen face. I uploaded it to tinder - women started to massively match me, and even send the first message.

In 2018, I've lost a lot of weight and got some new pictures - but none was nearly as successful as the 2016 winter one.

In 2019, I grew 6 months of unattended beard. No trimming at all, and little to no brushing. Most women I met would try to pick me up. I shaved the beard, and women's reaction returned to standard.
