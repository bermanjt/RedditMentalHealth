2,"Backstory: My parents divorced when I was 7 because of internal problems and my dad's creepiness. They got back together when I was 13ish because... I couldn't tell you, chief.

My dad has had some troubles. I'll put his ages beside each incident to prove a consistent pattern. Specifically being:

Had the FBI involved with his computers after a vaguely incestual incident that resulted in him getting kicked out of his own home (this was when he was a teenager)
Has three police cases filed against him in other states and cities that I didn't know about? Regarding possible pedophilia and abuse? Also had a secret woman roommate who my heart hurts for. (20-30's)

In the last 5 years that he's been with us, though:
He cheated on my mom multiple times, even while they're in the same room together or on dates together, the most recent one being a 19 yo. (I'm 18 now.) I remember one time my mom was getting fitted for a tux or just trying one on and he was swiping on tinder while we were waiting for her to get out.
He looked up the age of consent in a certain state (16, I was curious after I found out what he looked up. This was very recent.) 
He used whisper and Kik behind my mom's back (recent) 
Bought multiple secret phones (this is consistent over the past 5 years)
Looked up some porn that has mega father/daughter overtones.
All of this on his work computer not using incognito.

Yada yada yada, he's creepy and might have evaded the cops for creepy charges. I'm never letting him visit my future children. But he is paying for my tuition to a very nice college.

My parents argue a lot. Us being cooped up inside isn't the best, and I don't feel the most comfortable anyways being an 18 yo girl. This morning my parents were arguing and I just put my earbuds in. As a senior in high school I'm taking three classes with UT along with my other regular courses. My workload doesn't just stop for this pandemic. So I began working on my 6 page essay. I took a break and then the real trouble started. My dad said something pretty offensive about the situation, my mom started screaming at him to get out. 

They scream at eachother in the living room and my younger brother leaves his room to break it up. I'm ready to call the cops if something goes wrong at this point, but I just cover my ears, lay with my boyfriend, and hum a song. I have past trauma, though, so I can't help but uncover in intervals and listen for any sort of tone changes in conversation. My mom's pissed, my brothers pissed. My mom storms off because my brother told both of them to STFU. My brother starts sobbing and arguing with my dad.

I've always been the one my mom texts when she has troubles with my dad. She has texted me about how she's running away before, she texted me when she had an intense panic attack. I'm only 18, but I try and help whenever possible. But I also have my own shit to deal with. Learning to live with my boyfriend at such a young age, schoolwork, trying to keep my friends when all I want to do is isolate myself. So I stayed in my room during this fight and covered my ears.

 And I feel like shit about it. I feel like I could have done something. I'm two years older than my brother. Just because mediation shouldn't be put on me doesn't mean it should be put on my brother. I'm an adult now and I feel like I could have done something. My mom has been sleeping all day since, and my brothers seem to have made up with my dad (or are at least playing nice). I haven't talked to my dad since I told him how uncomfortable his actions made me. 

I chose a college out of state for these reasons. I can't leave until covid eases up, though. I'm just trying to ride it out until then, and I guess if that's my goal not getting involved is for the better. Still feel bad, though. My mom views me as her rock, and I might have shattered her illusion of that with how I am dealing with this situation. Usually I am able to reassure her, but this situation just affects me too deeply. I'm finding out family secrets I never wanted to find out.

Also just wanted to vent. If this isn't the sub, delete this.",22Apr2020,1

5,"It’s actually amazing how much condescension and presumption is packed into a single word.

The big assumption here is obvious: a bigger house is a better house, and the only valid reason for considering such a house is limited resources.

Do you value location over square footage? Want to devote time and energy to things other than home maintenance? Plan on having no kids, a small family?

How cute. Good for you. 

Are you conscientious about your ecological footprint? Want to spend less on housing so you can spend more on what matters to you? 

You’ll change your mind.

7,"(Reposting here bc got removed from another sub)

I don't even know where to start. I'm 37 years old and I've never felt more unattractive and meaningless. I'm constantly comparing myself to other women, other people. It's not just my physical appearance either, it's personality traits also. I have a lot of female friends on Instagram and you know that I'm the only one without an actual picture of myself as my profile picture? Because I don't like myself. The thing that bothers me the most is I wasn't always like this, when I was younger I wouldn't say I was really confident but I wasn't insecure, I mostly didn't even think about it. I was who I was and that was it and I was good with myself. Now I question everything about myself. Constant media feeding me pictures of friends and other women or even men that are so confident in themselves. I used to think it was healthy to maybe take a nice selfie every once in a while, if I took a good pic, it made me feel good. I haven't ""shared"" a selfie in over 2 years and any time I think I'm going to try, I hate every picture. Smiling in a picture never happens either, I can't stand any of them. I used to like looking at sexy pics of women because I'm bisexual and women and beautiful to look at, but now when I look, I just end up feeling like crap. I've gained some weight and that doesn't help, but it's not just that, it's my personality. Maybe I'm not funny enough, happy enough, talkative enough, maybe people don't really like because of x,y,z reasons I come up with in my head. Then comes the self annoyance. Completely sickened with myself for even feeling any of this. What do I have to prove to anybody?? I only have to prove to myself that I am enough and yet, even as I know this, it doesn't happen. I'm just so unhappy and indifferent with myself. Being insecure is not attractive. I used to find solace and strength in inspirational and positive messages and thoughts and now they just bother me, I no longer find any comfort in them. I have some other things going on in my personal life that are relationship related and maybe once the inevitable change is made, I will feel better? But I know as well as anyone else that you should never put weight on an occurence making you feel happy (""once this happens, I'll feel better"") - it doesn't work that way. I know that what's going on is internal and I need to work on it but I honestly have no idea where to start or how to start. Thanks for listening and any wise words welcome, because I feel defeated.",22Apr2020,3
8,"I’ll start by saying my parents are great and I’m lucky to have them in my life. 

But I really want to move out. I cannot stand being 21 and still having people control almost every aspect of my life because I am financially dependent on them. I want to be able to make my own choices politically, religiously, and whether I can go out or not!! My parents have a lot of rules and control almost everything in my life even down to what I can and cannot eat. They are constantly calling my fat and telling me they do not want to raise and overweight kid and it’s their responsibility to make sure I’m healthy. I don’t think it’s wrong to want your child to be healthy, but shaming them for eating at 21 is a little ridiculous to me!! I also cannot drink, going to my boyfriends house is taboo (btw, I never even told them I had a boyfriend they just kind of assumed it and I let it rock), or go out with any one who they don’t know (like hello am I 5??? Do you need to call their parents to arrange a play date???)

That being said, in some aspects my parents are amazing. They paid my college tuition and that’s saying a lot seeing as we’re not all that wealthy. They give me a lot, like a car and food. They genuinely want what’s best for me. Leaving them is going to be hard because I will miss them and I’m genuinely terrified because I’ve never had to fend for myself. I’ve never been given to chance to make my own goddamn decisions so when the time finally comes I’m gonna feel so unprepared. 

Anyways- conflict. I could leave now as I am about to graduate and I could probably easily get a job in my field in some degree (teaching). But my parents are offering to put me through grad school and to not take that up feels like a horrible financial decision. So I might as well stick with this for another two years, right?",22Apr2020,1

15,"There is never a lack of material to write about in times like these; however, the feelings, thoughts, actions, and concerns of the “everyday” individual can easily fall through the cracks. What people experience is important to me, as I base my life on doing what is most needed for the world, as a whole. I want to write about what people have experienced during this period of pain, uncertainty, and prolonged isolation separation. I believe everybody’s story has intrinsic value and deserves to be documented, understood without bias, and safeguarded for future generations. Anything I write from this information will be done with complete confidentiality unless instructed otherwise. I will not use any identifying information without your instruction. I would, simply, like to know the human experience and write about it. These difficult times bring about a variety of complex changes; I feel that understanding everybody’s perspective of these changes leads to a more accurate picture of humanity. I am grateful for any and all input. 

I do not own the information on the page, so anybody else who feels inspired to create may use it. All I ask is to please respect the confidentiality of all parties. 

Thank you to all who participate. May you and your families be safe and healthy.  

Here are some questions I feel are great starting points for anyone who wishes to contribute:

What is lacking? — What hobbies have you picked up? — What novel ideas have you thought about? — What have you done to offset/replace/cope with lack of socialization? — What are your fears and worries? — What has happened to your profession/job, how does that make you feel, how will you adjust? — What changes have you noticed in people? — Changes in personalities? — People rising to the challenge? — People succumbing you hostility? — Who/what do you trust in times like these? — What do you think will be the outcome of all this? — What do you worry will never be the same? — Have you found happiness in simple things? — More creative? — More depressed? — Any existential questions arise? — What has your family endured? — Do you know someone who has contracted Covid-19, if so how does that make you/them feel and how has that changed life in any way? — What have kids been doing more often? — How have they understood what has been happening? — Any songs or nursery rhymes about the pandemic/ isolation? — How have you, as a parent, guided them through this?",22Apr2020,1
16,"Without being too specific, I have a lot of work that is still ongoing that I was already doing from home. My deadlines haven't changed. I have a six month old baby and have been managing to balance my work with a great amount of help from my partner. His work has also shifted to wfh, but for a variety of reasons, his workload has increased lately. So now I'm balancing my own work with the household/baby related duties that my partner has less time to do as a result. It is stressful at times, but manageable.

Problem is, there are all these other people in my life who can't seem to accept that not everyone is dwelling in boredom with a heap of extra time. I've had people put pressure on me to pick up old collaborative projects that had been put on the back burner, and even friends who just keep insisting that I should be on steam gaming with them every night. I keep getting hit with this attitude of ""well what better things do you have to do?"" and it just doesn't land when I try to explain that I have less free time than ever.",22Apr2020,1
19,"sorry if this isn’t the place to post but i need to vent somewhere.

i’m working at a retail pharmacy right now in the front end of the store. i’m grateful to have a job at all but i’m just so tired of being essential in a society that doesn’t care.

my company doesn’t offer hazard pay, doesn’t give us enough masks for everyone, and still hasn’t send us any plexiglass barriers. we still push sales and run non-essential services like our photo center. i’m also not able to run and wash my hands when i’m stuck on register so i’m just wearing a pair of gloves my entire shift and trying to sanitize the gloves between customers.

most people coming in don’t have masks (in all fairness though, it’s mostly bc people can’t find them). they don’t maintain 6 feet and come up close to me/touch me, and i have to be the rude one who asks them to back away. a lot of them lean on the counter by the register and i’m stuck in that small space so i’m not able to back away. i spend most of my shift within 2 feet of my customers.

and i’m just tired. i’m tired of people yelling at me because we’re out of sanitizer or TP. i’m tired of people trying to explain that this whole thing is a hoax while i ring them up. i’m tired of hearing people’s stories of family deaths and lack of supplies in attempts to guilt trip me to magically produce masks out of nowhere. mostly i’m tired of people coming for nonessential services, coughing all over our store, and thanking me for being there because they’re “bored of sitting at home.”

i don’t feel safe and i don’t feel essential. my workplace put up signs calling us heroes and then doesn’t even include us in a hero day discount this week. it’s hard not to feel useless, especially since i was supposed to be doing disaster relief work right now but that job was suspended. instead i’m risking my health and my family’s health to print people’s selfies and ring them up for sodas.

i just wish my customers would take this seriously and treat me with respect. i pride myself on my patience and kindness but it’s hard not to be discouraged when people refuse to accommodate the virus.

i just wish people would stop thanking me and stay home unless it’s essential instead.",22Apr2020,1

21,"Today I turn 40. And if I'm honest I originally wished that I could either sleep through it and wake on the 23rd, or just get so drunk that I don't remember it at all. Due to me being a low life and having an affair that ended my marriage 6 months ago, I am now living with my dad, and have no job, don't get to see my 2 boys nearly enough, and have just worked my way out of drinking way too much. 
But I have come to realise that it isn't all bad. I'm surprised with how many people have wished me a good day. And that is even though I am in New Zealand and cannot see anyone that is outside my bubble. Friends and some family have shown me that I am not as alone as I feel I am. While he has to work, my father left me the most heartfelt and sweet note that I have ever seen. It made me tear up a little, and let me know that I am loved. 
From today, I will pick myself up by the bootstraps, sort my life and get back out there. And I will enjoy the rest of the day, no matter how it goes.

The past month has involved obstacle after obstacle, testing me every step of the way. My physical and mental health have been in shambles for longer than I can remember, and the pain had numbed me towards any aspect of life anymore. I have been really sick for the past month, in a womanly debacle - that I cannot explain in words for fear I will make myself anxious about what happened again - that landed me in the midst of a horrible chemotherapy injection 2 weeks ago, and a surgery last week. With coronavirus, the world already seemed to be at a standstill - but the chaos in my life makes those struggles look like a breeze. Multiple ER visits and hospital stays at a time where coronavirus has reared its ugly head have left me broken and anxious in more ways than one: what if I were to catch it on top of all of this? The pain from my incisions and tube removal surgery slowly healing themselves is indescribable, and the sense of impending doom from being immunosuppressive in the era of coronavirus has left me unable to sleep for weeks. To top it off - my family and other supports are abroad and unable to come be with me during a time where I am struggling to get out of bed to use the washroom without pain. I’m handling every side of this in a tiny dorm room on my own. 

— redemption: 

To my boyfriend - While life seems to have dealt me the wrong cards for a bit, I want to take this reflective entry to look at the positives. I have my love, a man who has constantly shown me that he is strong and brave no matter how he feels in times of crisis. He has supported me, even from thousands of miles away, through what feels like the worst time in my life. His reassuring, warm voice over the phone washes over every worry I could possibly have. I am eternally grateful for his support, and don’t know what I would do without him. I know he will never understand the conflicting emotions that are coursing through me as I take it one day at a time, but his words ring through my thoughts and my dreams. His soothing presence and gentle love from miles away is a feeling I cannot describe. May God bless him with everything he ever desires. 

To my mother - I love you. I have no words for how much you’ve done for me, putting my life above even your own. You have been nothing but an angel on earth. I love you and promise you that once I am healed I will do everything for you and buy you the world. I live because of you, and will work towards fulfilling the dreams that you held at my age but couldn’t pursue because you chose to sacrifice your dreams to raise me. 

To my father - I know you’re getting older and weaker. You’ve been working tirelessly for 35 years to give me and my sister a life that leaves nothing more to be desired. I want you to have nothing but love and joy in your life, and every stress of yours to melt away. I know we don’t talk as much and I promise to be better about that but just know that I love you and mommy to the moon and back. 

To my sister - You have been my baby since the day you were born. I love you like a mother and will always be here for you no matter what happens to me. You are my world and I will protect you and do everything I can to support you as you grow into the beautiful girl that you are, and go on to face the world in college and beyond.

To God - I haven’t been the best at keeping up with praying once I left for college. But bhagwaan, I know you are always listening and are always here to support me. I might be in a tough time but I have taken every lesson that you intended for me to learn by going through this. I know now that I am stronger than I think, and while the people that matter are here to support me, I can handle things on my own too. I don’t need to depend on anyone or anything for my own happiness. I am independent, and promise to build a life enriched with good things and positive thoughts. I will do good, and be good. 

I came to university to work hard and build my future, but lost my path somewhere along the way. I’ve made a lot of mistakes, but I won’t be making the same mistakes again. 

I am sorry if I have ever wronged anyone. I am a good person who has always done good, but maybe this happened for a reason. I was beginning to get lazy about my life goals when my parents had worked so hard to put me through college. I won’t settle for less now, either. Things are clear now. Sometimes, people come into your life to teach you a lesson for years to come, and that is the only role they have in your life. You cannot hang on to things by a thread just because it is comfortable and there is a fake sense of security behind a blanket of fears - you have to let go.

Atleast, corona will you. But living life while ugly is just like death. 

No beautiful girls will look at you( in fact they will spit on you), no social skills and no friends if you have no talent or High IQ.",22Apr2020,1

51,"I made a post on here recently, about how I'm not suicidal anymore. I'm on mobile, so I can't really link it, sorry about that. 

The monumentuous changes in how I feel as a person has vastly changed. Oddly enough, I don't think I'm depressed anymore. For as long as I can remember, I was nearly devoid of the ability to feel anything, for myself or others. This has come with both upsides and downsides.

In the days following the revelation that I wasn't suicidal (and now I realize not depressed), I was hit with a massive wave of emotions, something which I had no experience with. Primarily sadness and bitterness. It was such a big change that I almost wished that I would go back to my old self.

Despite this, being able to feel something also comes with actual motivation. I have studied for the first time in my life, I have pursued long-lost interests. I have virtually eliminated my dependence on others. I feel independent and free.

Most of all, I feel like a child again. I am fourteen currently. I was nine when I had my first suicide attempt. And though it might be late to feel this way, though I might be expected to become more mature, I have begun to realize my childhood again.

As I've said in my previous posts, I was abused physically, mentally, and emotionally for as long as I can remember. I was bullied in the same way up until seventh grade. Even now, I have trouble forming meaningful friendships with people. From a young age I believed I was inherently a failure, unwanted because I had only been born as 'entertainment' for my older brother.

I was bitter at the past for so long. Wondering why I couldn't be normal. How I couldn't love myself in my own skin, especially considering I'm transgender. And so I pushed myself to be more mature than I could handle. I was the shoulder in my friend group. I was only ever seeked out if they needed someone to talk to. I pushed aside the toys that I had in order to take up this role, and they've been collecting dust ever since.

But yesterday, I took them out. Stuffies, board games, racing car tracks, you get the idea. For the first time in my life, I realized what it meant to have childlike joy. I played with these for hours. Not only with these toys, in general, I was fascinated at the world. I can't believe how excited I got when I found out my jacket had a hidden pocket. I was awestruck beyond belief. I was even fascinated at the coagulation of milk in a pan.

I said in my last post here that my parents became great. These few days, that hasn't really been true, but I'm completely unstoppable. I've been a (excuse my language) an absolute fucking powerhouse and there's no way they can take that away from me. I've even been able to maintain a great sleeping schedule. I work out everyday, and I eat well. No way in hell their words are going to make me go back to my doomed lifestyle. 

I love that I'm able to enjoy hobbies now. I recently started a bullet journal/collecting account on Instagram. I binge watched four episodes of a great show. For goodness's sale, I've been reading my textbook for fun!

I've said this before and I will say it again: I love everything about living now. (Damn that feels good to say). No matter what happens in the future, I will never go back to my old self. I'll continue to work hard and become the person I want to become. To the people who messed me up as a kid, fuck you to the moon and back.",22Apr2020,1

Their one and only purpose is for the apologizee to feel better about themselves. ""Good to get that off my chest"". For the one on the other side, it does _nothing_ but raise past traumas. 
* Oh you feel sorry for bullying me back in school? Sure it's all okay now! My ruined self confidence over the past 20 years is totally meaningless. Of course you are forgiven! 
* You're sorry about running over my dog? _Of course_ you are forgiven, I'll just get a new one! \*

Want to really apologize? Dont say it - show it! The past is past and nothing can change that, but what you can do is do your best to ensure it doesnt happen again. Seeing this, saying empty words wont be necessary anymore.

56,"He had chest pains last week and went to the hospital where they put in 3 stents. He came home on Thursday and was super weak and just shuffling everywhere with his new walker. We visited on Saturday and he fell twice while we were there, once into a pile of scrap metal he had in his shed. We were really worried leaving him with my grandma who is very frail and can’t really do much physically. 

Well, he ended up falling this afternoon and hit his head. Later on he said he was getting a very bad headache so they called the hospital and flew him to a larger town to get surgery for a brain hemorrhage. He may not make it. He was always the most insightful, genuine, funny, knowledgeable and caring person. I know they’re both going to die within the next few years but for him to go this way would be fucking awful. He’s survived so much and worked so hard to ensure his kids and grandkids could have good lives. If his time is up then I accept it, but I feel like him dying this way is a cruel end for an amazing person. I haven’t lost a close family member before and this is tough for me. I don’t want to bury this feeling. I want to grieve and mourn but I feel like I’ll eventually just push it deep down and not talk about it because it’ll be too painful. I regret not spending as much time with them as I could have. I regret not asking more about his life and asking for life advice from someone who’s lived through so much. But I can’t live with regret forever. I just need to mourn and sort out my feelings so it doesn’t continue to affect me.

57,"Because their comment just made me crazy.

My response:

“This honestly feels insulting.

It’s not helpful to tell someone in pain they **have a lot of growing up to do**.

It’s demeaning.

It’s taking their feelings and experiences and telling them it’s just their *childish* ignorance without considering that this is the reality for some people.

Not everyone gets a happen ending.

**And I haven’t cried for almost two years.**

I understand the desire to want to comfort a stranger, but unfortunately this missed the mark for me. 

It just makes me feel judged and belittled.

Edit: I would consider it a person favor if you just took your comment down. That would deeply appreciated.


Like seriously, it sounds just so honestly naive. Dear god, I’m almost 30 years old. I’m not a child. 

My experiences are real, my feelings are warranted. I’m allowed to be depressed and wallow sometimes. 

I know you’re trying to be kind and supportive but this just really hit a nerve for me. It’s all garbage I believed when I was like 19.

I’m not 19 anymore. I’ve learned what the world is actually like for people like me. 

It is not how you describe.

I’m genuinely sorry to kind of go off on you like this but what you wrote just really upset me. Can you maybe get why? Like I don’t want to make you feel bad I just want someone to get it.

This isn’t who I normally am. But this is an extremely stressful time for me right now. I get this virus and I will definitely die. That is my reality.

This post is almost a month old and does not reflect my typical state of mind or feelings. I just had a weak moment a month ago and needed to vent. 

My lying pussy ass ex really did a number on me. But I don’t define my worth by something as fickle as a man.

I’m frustrated that the world would discard people with conditions like mine because we don’t fit their cookie cutter version of what they think a life well lived should look like. My ex is just one example. He’s kind of become a metaphor to me for how the general populace treats those who are differently abled.

We should be appreciated. We deserve a chance at happiness, and having a romantic partner is not the defining piece that makes someone happy. I don’t need it to be happy. I never have.

I have a right to live. I have a right to exist. I’m not entitled to a man’s love. I am entitled to the freedom to live my life the best I can. 

My life is wretched because I face constant adversity from the ignorant that prevents me from achieving my own health and well-being. I constantly held back and limited by those who don’t understand and aren’t willing too, like my asshole ex who lied to me and pretended to care about my unique set of problems until it got *too hard* for him to deal with. 

Well unlike him I just can’t walk away, move on, and never think about my problems again because *this is my life*.

Have I wanted to die? Hell yes. It is unlikely you can imagine the kind of physical pain i have experienced in my life just from existing. You’d want to die too. You’d want it to be over.

But I’m still here and I survived. I made it through. It is not my intention to die anytime soon, and definitely not over a *man*.

That punk ass bitch is a waste of space as far as I’m concerned. He threw out a human being who was nothing but loving and loyal to him as if she was garbage. However good his intentions may have been, his actions were despicable. I know I deserve better and I’m not going to tolerate less than that.

I’ll stay single for the rest of my days if I have too. That’s completely fine by me.

And now I’ve written a god damn novel. **SORRY** genuinely sorry to rant at you like this, but I hope you can understand why(?)

You seem like a kindhearted person and I don’t desire to take that from you (as if I could lol). But I’m just so frustrated of people talking to me like they *know* when they really really really don’t. Like it’s just so upsetting, I just can’t.

And Reddit is great because usually I can just post a rant and it’ll be universally ignored because like I said: *people don’t care*. 

But it’s more than that. They don’t want to think about people like me because it’s too depressing or they don’t get anything out of it. Thinking about other people makes a lot of people *uncomfortable*.

I get that! I do! It’s part of why I really doubt I’ll ever get married or have a family (at least not a traditional one). 

And I’m okay with that, honestly. It makes me depressed sometimes but I get over it and move on. I don’t believe there’s any point in dwelling on that which you cannot change. I’m human and imperfect and fall of that wagon sometimes but I always get back up there in a day or two. 

But it’s so satisfying when I do write it down on those bad days and get it out of me, it helps me work through my emotions, then I move on. 

Honestly though I should just stop posting these rants because every now and then someone comments and says something that just doesn’t help, that hits my stupid pride or just straight up pisses me off and then I end up writing them a novel to tell them what they’re wrong or I just straight up tell them they’re an idiot because who cares when it’s strangers on the internet. People aren’t to *try* to understand. They just like to pat themselves on the back and feel like they did a “good thing” regardless of whether or not it was actually helpful. 

So then writing it down and “letting it go” clearly backfires.

Lmao I may be nuts but at least I’m self aware.

So again it’s not so much about you, “Friends” person. So please don’t be offended by my rambling nonsense because that’s what it is.

Clearly I have a “lot of growing up to do.”

Muhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!

**LMAO**

Honestly I shouldn’t care what you think anyway but here I am.

59,"My father is a drunk, a liar, and always mean. I have maybe 2-5 good memories with him in my 18 years of life (and only 1 of those is within a 5 year basis). The worst blow to this, is that my father is sleeping maybe 10 feet away from me right now.

He and my mom haven’t slept in the same room in over 10 years, but they won’t get a divorce. So for my entire life they have been screaming, fighting, arguing, and (very rarely) hurting each other (physically).  They hate each other, there’s no question in my mind about that. There will be some time where a month may go by without them having a fight while I’m home but other times they may have several fights a week. These fights leave me shaking, crying, and sometimes recording them out of fear that it’ll be needed. 

My mom is angry, mean, yells at me a lot, and has gotten physical with me on occasion but the difference between the two of them is that my mom actually puts forth the effort to keep me alive. She feeds me, clothes me, keeps me supplied with hygiene products, gets me stuff for christmas and my birthday that I’ll actually like, drives me places, talks to me. My mom might be slightly toxic too but at least I have someone to keep me alive. 

My father doesn’t cook for me, aside from the garlic bread he might leave on the stove periodically. He used to sometimes, but it was always food I couldn’t eat, or food that he made solely to spite my mom (mom would be coming home with food and he would hurry up and make something). With food, he would scream at me to eat it and often threaten me if I kept refusing. Once I threw up after I ate his food cause I couldn’t eat it. My father doesn’t buy me clothes, he bought me a hoodie once for Christmas but it was pink and I cried when my mom forced me to wear it. My father has never bought me any hygiene products. My father has driven me to school maybe 10 times in my entire life. Once he refused to move his car, making me late for school. My father has never talked to me like a human being. My father doesn’t really talk to me at all. There has been times where we’ve gone over a year without talking to eachother while living in the same house. 

My father has scared me so bad to the point where I didn’t feel safe in my house, due to him pounding up the stairs and throwing stuff in my room while I hid in my closet.  My father took the dog that was meant for me, changed its name, and pretty much allowed me no time with it, and no help in raising it (he raised it to be shit btw). My father once made me walk 2+ miles in 100+ degree heat to a dog show I didn’t want to go to, without water and wouldn’t buy me water, only to have me vomit on the way back home, he wouldn’t call my mom either after that made me walk home (I was maybe 10 years old and was not used to walking that far)


Now my father is dying from cancer. 


Because of this my aunt and grandma are constantly hounding me to talk with him, help him, do stuff for him, do stuff around the house, connect with him, and I have refused to do so. They won’t listen when I have tried to speak about how my father is, and now they just except me to be the ‘perfect kid’ to the ‘perfect dad’. 

Why should I put myself out there when he doesn’t deserve it? I have tried in the past to and it’s always just blown up in my face and I end up getting more hurt. 
Why should I be the one who has to reach out? It’s his fault that he’s a shit parent.
What am I really missing? I’ve never really had a father, so how am I going to miss him? I am upset that I’ve never had a father, I’m upset that I got a strange man who makes my mom cry. 

Is this my fault? Am I in the wrong? Do I tell my relatives that I know he’s not worth it? How do I do any of this? How do I tell anyone else in my life about this?

I don’t know how to deal with this. Help me please.",22Apr2020,1
60,"Seriously, why do we do testing for this? The more ive been thinking about it the less it makes sense. 

You show symptoms so you get tested, well, *maybe* get tested. you need to already have symptoms AND fit a number of other criteria which make you likely to be infected, instead of getting the test you could just assume you’re ill and isolate. 

say you do manage to get tested, cool, now you’re out $2,000 and you have to wait a week for the results. The very next day you’d wake up and clearly be infected, the symptoms have shown to appear like the flu and then worsen a LOT the very next day. even if it didn’t appear that way, over the course of the whole week you’d have clear symptoms. If you had it, you’d pretty much be able to say with certainty that you’ve got it when you wake up the day after feeling like shit, unable to breathe, and coughing up a storm. 

the only reason i could see people being tested that makes sense would be people working in hospitals, but taking the test after you have symptoms does nothing if you turn out to be ill youve already spread it unknowingly for the past week or so. so the test does literally nothing except go “yeah those symptoms youve been experiencing for an entire week that are incredibly obviously COVID, are in fact COVID, congrats!”

What is the point of the testing when it takes forever and will just confirm what you already know, and even id you didn’t know youd be isolated while waiting for the results so it wouldn’t even matter. you would still have been interacting with others while contagious without knowing because you can only get tested AFTER you show symptoms.",22Apr2020,1
61,"Perhaps I do love him, but I don’t love him enough. Not enough to accept his flaws. Not enough to make it work. Not enough to “forgive” him for his past, before he met me.

Not enough to give him the acceptance he deserves. Not enough to give him the stability and security he deserves. Not enough to give him the love he gives me.

Or perhaps I don’t know what love even is. 

But when I asked him how he knew he loved me, he said, “I just know, and that’s all that matters.”

69,"So in the last 5 months, I got to know this girl. I am about an hour away from her. She's actually in another state technically  but our cities are super close. We met on facebook dating and became super close friends. We talk about everything. We were going to date before the virus but then that happened, I started to get work with Door Dash and she has medical issues with her back. She lives with roomies and I live with my mom and stepdad.   


In the last month, she's been there for me in ever instant. She says to me, ""If you ever meet me, you may not like me.""  
""Why?""  
""Cause I'm fat.""  
""I've seen photos, you're alright.""  
She explains to me that the reason she gained weight is due to the lack of exercise because of her surgeries. She showed me pictures of her before she gained a lot of weight and said, she couldn't help it. Her doc said she's not allowed to put basically any strain on her back. Which means 0 heavy lifting. Nothing more than maybe 15 pounds. But, she's super sweet. Loves video games, cartoons, has a fucked up sense of humor like me and is just all around awesome. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were talkin the other day and she said, ""you really wanna date me?""  
""Why not? We both like the same stuff and even you said that after all this is over with your surgeries you are gonna get back in shape, and if you're serious about that, I'll be right behind you to help you get to your goal."" And to be clear, she's doing this for HER not ME. I know some ladies think that if a man is pushing a girl to be skinny that's for him. No, she's told me several times how she hates be a big girl I mean BIG. She's a sweet loving woman. So, I'll do what I can to push her to her best. 

&amp;#x200B;

She already knows my personal preference towards women and she's not remotely offended that I want  nice cute skinny girl. She even asked me why her? I said that it's not that I know you're going to get skinny, it's that I know you care about your body and don't like putting trash into it. I have more respect for a person who takes care of their body than a person who is skinny and eats like a dog that just saw chocolate all over the place. Regardless, people will call me an asshole cause of it. I know it.   


I think what makes a good man or woman is to push your bestie, your SO to be the best that they can be. Also, I call her my Cheshire Cat cause she loves him from Alice's Adventures in wonderland and I'm her white rabbit. We are very much into Alice's adventures. When I goto Starbucks, sometimes I get them to put Alice on my cup just to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This post is more to explain that I'm proud of her and thankful for her company during this time which we can't see each other. We text daily, we send each other funny shit all the time. We talk about shit in our lives. She helps me through anxiety attacks. I help her get over some her personal obstetrical too.

I think we were pretty good friends. Things went south towards the end of them being a client, and I wasn’t allowed to talk to them for six months because bureaucracy. I think they think it’s a year of no contact. Whatever, it’s been seven and a half months now. Does time mean anything anymore?

My behaviour is frustrating. I'll get all tied up in a project, and be super interested in it at the start, learning everything about it, trying to be the best at it. Then, give it a few days, maybe a week at max and im over it. Completely lose interest. Its like my mind goes, yep, done. Its so frustrating, i cant stick to anything!!

Here's an example of the past 3 weeks of my behaviour:

Week 1 - I got super infatuated with dance, and wanted to learn. I put all my energy into learning it, I was super obsessed, I learnt a full dance and I really enjoyed it. I told myself ill continue it, however haven't danced in over 2 weeks and don't have the energy/enthusiasm to do so.

Week 2 - I thought id start a YouTube channel, because, why not. Got all the gear, was SUPER into it. Started having all these ideas, brain went into overdrive, got excited about it. Ahhh this is my calling, i thought to myself. Lasted a couple of days before i lost interest. Onto the next interest:

Week 3 (present): I wanted to start a blog because ""its soo fun, why not, maybe ill learn a new skill, i can do all this stuff."" Again, brain went into overdrive and got all these ideas for my blog. Went and bought a domain, and started to set up my website. I'm now battling the phase where I start to lose interest. Like, how do I go from SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THINGS to ive-lost-all-enthusiasm-known-to-man.

This is my general life. I do this with everything. Even jobs. I start out SUPER EXCITED about my job, learning everything, being a top notch employee and then the months go by and i slowly start to lose enthusiasm. At this point, i need to look for a new job. Once I have the new job, the cycle repeats.

WHY AM I LIKE THIS. Its so damn frustrating.

Do I just accept my fate of jumping around and never being able to stick to one thing!???

Please help.",22Apr2020,1

Food doesn't usually cross my mind till I'm 'starving' and then I put if off until I'm really really hungry which then makes the chore all the more annoying cause it's now something that is making me uncomfortable and is going to interrupt me from getting on with doing other things.

Because of this I have only done computer work recently. Working from home has been deemed not an option because it requires VPN access to the company network that most of us don't have. It's also very slow with all the direct employees using it so the VPN option isn't even being pursued for contractors.

95,"I thrive in competition and challenges. When I feel I need to prove myself to someone, I work insanely well. But competition and challenge is almost the only way I work

I study to become the smartest, get the best job. I do my best in exams to have the best grade. I decorate my house to have the prettiest house. I work out and do as many activities as I can to be somehow the greatest person in the room

It sounds bad but it's not as bad as i made it seem there. I am very happy studying and working and doing activities, but my motivation comes from being challenged and becomong the best.

It has mostly worked for me so far. I know that noone cares what gade I get other than myself, but I convince myself that it's a competition and I have to win. I've realised it's my way of working and I make the most of it.

However, i'm worried it might become unhealthy. I don't play my instrument, workout, do art etc... in front of people because I'm not perfect enough at them yet. I don't get disappointed and sad when I'm not the best at something, but I'm worried I might start feeling that sometime. Also, i get my condidence from being better than people, and I don't like that mindset

99,"Why 'confessing to your crush' is essentially flawed

Dear redditors,


We've all been there. There is this one girl (or guy) that just blows you away. You are crushing hard, and you're trying to think of a way to make your dream come true.

I see a lot of people around here asking for advice on how to 'confess' to their crush but here's the thing. Having feelings for someone is not a sin! You haven't killed anyone, so why confess?

I get it, you're insecure, you're afraid they won't reciprocate your feelings and you'll be shot down. But if I have learned anything in the 21 years I have been alive is that insecurity will bring you nowhere.

If you tell someone you have a crush on them out of the blue they'll probably be a little freaked out. So instead, just talk to them! Ask if they want to go do something with you, tell them they look nice, give compliments and smile.

It's human nature to be attracted to the unknown. Think about this, how do you feel when someone spoils te end of a movie? Exactly, annoyed. You can't enjoy the movie the same way as if you hadn't known  the ending.

So, in conclusion here's my two-cents:
If you like someone, go and talk to them. Ask them about their lives. Show interest and compliment them. Go do something together and just enjoy yourself. 
Worst case scenario you waste an afternoon or evening doing something fun with someone boring.
Best case scenario they are interested in you and you make some nice memories.

Stay strong kings!

105,"Here's the thing, I'm 18 years old and from the day I turned 18 years old, I've noticed that my family is kinda throwing me stuff all at once. I had to be responsible of utting my name in the contract so we have WIFI, but that's apparently still no reason to take me seriously. Adults have this weird aproach were you're ignored unless you're useful. My parents taught me how to clean, wash dishes, do laundry, cook, and all that stuff I can simply Google, but none of them have tought me how to get a job interview, how to organize myself, how to make a routine, how to speak to other people, how to do taxes. 

I've been always discouraged to comment on adult topics because ""you wouldn't understand it"", which led me to back off and stare, so now they complain that I'm ""in an island"" and ""have no idea how the world works"" like, thanks for noticing, genius, maybe I'd understand a little better if you explained this to me BEFORE. 

Like, you go from not having any freedom at all, to suddenly having to be entirely independent. Do you think that's logical? Do you think that makes sense? 

Also, what is this idea of ""adulthood is terrible"" that you seem to put in EVERY SINGLE MOVIE? 

You see, it actually goes like this: teenager has some superfluous problem (because in the mind of an adult writer, teenagers only have superficial problems like ""I have acne"" or ""My parents don't understand me""), so they decide to be an adult and for some kind of magic (often birthday magic), they become one for a while. And from the moment they turn into adulthood, their lives turn into massive hell: they suddenly have a house, and bills to pay, and mortgages, and tedious jobs. So at the end, the kid decides to go back and is traumatized for life because she knows that one day, she'll grow up, and one day she'll never be able to come back. I know the message is: ""enjoy your teenager phase"" but, being a teenager is awful, and they're telling you that you're life will be worse when you grow up. 

You know what message is that movie giving to me? ""Adulthood is hell, you better kill yourself before you turn 21"". You know what also is this movie saying to me? ""We, as adults, failed to teach you how the world works, but we'll complain about you not understanding because we had nobody to teach us either"". 

So that's why I'm scared of adulthood, because no one tells me how to approach it and everyone tells me is the worst thing that could ever happen to a human being.",22Apr2020,3

I have a relatively nice life, I feel very little anxiety now and I am not depressed. But I miss being excited for things. Perhaps it is just a part of being an adult.

109,"So I just started to read a book titled Plato's Socrates. Where the views of Plato on Socrates is discussed. 


To be honest though reading the first few pages of it is confusing but I sort of enjoy/hate being confused. I love rationalizing my own beliefs, deconstructing and reconsctucting them to be somewhat better and understandable.


I started reading this book because I myself am confused about a lot of things going on in life. I want to find purpose and meaning to life as certain life events occuring recently have shattered my beliefs and values. Putting me in a position where I finally start to question whether they are right or not. 


As I have read the book, its stated in the first few pages that ignorance, is believing that you are right all the time and not absorbing any criticism and pulling down other's beliefs along with them. Which I think is the kind of person I was before and now I think I hate myself a bit for doing that. 


I started to realize the person that I am and I am in the search of who I want to be. 


Anyway, this is getting too long for me to even digest my mind into it. It will get better soon self, I promise. We'll read the rest of the pages tomorrow and finally have a grasp on who we want to be


Note to self. Try reading this again when you finally acknowledge that not a huge piece of plastic garbage drifting towards the sea as you see it now. Maybe after reading the books jd taking the time to understand them then maybe life could be a little more or less complicated


To any one reading this with me who might be going through something in their lives. I urge you to keep reading. Its rather interesting on how philosophers think of each other as how we are right now.

However, what I did find out while I laid in bed for 4 hours focused on breathing and slowly losing myself into my own thoughts, was that I have unconscious twitches and actions that I do to inflict pain on myself. 

It starts with scrunching my face and tightening my face muscles as much as I physically can when I spiral into another anxiety induced insomnia night. The more I fall into the rabbit hole of my mind, the more my body reacts physically to these thoughts. When I remember anxiety inducing memories it triggers my hand to go to my right eye and I press my palm into it, slowly adding more and more pressure to the point of bruising. I now realize that the raccoon eyes I would wake up to were not from a restless night but from this unconscious physical reaction. After years of doing this to myself my right eye has become lazier, weaker, and my lens thicker.

I'm an 18 year old guy in college, I'm back home now because of coronavirus. I grew up in a small town in Canada where everyone knows just about everyone. I graduated last year and just 2 months before i graduated there was a car accident that claimed the lives of 2 girls i was supposed to graduate with and 2 guys from another school. Basically it was pouring rain that night, and on the highway where i would normally be going 110km/h i had to go 70km/h and was still hydroplaning. It was one of the girl's birthday and she had just turned 18, the 4 of them went to McDonald's and one of my buddies surprised her with a cake and she said she would eat it when she got home. That never happened because at around 10pm that night the guy who was driving the car they were in passed a car (which ended up being their friend's car) going about 140km/h and hydroplaned into a guardrail and that launched their SUV up into the air and landed upside down in a pond. The friend's who they had just passed stopped and saw just the wheels sticking out of the water. Rescue crews weren't able to get the car flipped and get them out for 20 minutes. All 4 of them passed away, one of the girl's was said to have died on impact and the rest from drowning. 
Now after grieving and going to all their wakes and funerals and going through graduation and prom without them i thought i was doing okay up until a couple days ago when it hit the 1 year anniversary (which would have also been one of the girl's 19th birthday).
I just can't seem to stop thinking about what those last moments must of been like and it's driving me crazy.
Like, were they knocked out on impact and stayed unconcious throughout the whole drowning process? 
Were they awake the whole time and went through all the pain and fear of drowning while trying to escape? 
Were they unconscious and woke up to water rushing in and then went through all the pain, fear and panic? 
These are questions I'll never know the answer to and i understand that, but i just can't stop thinking about it.

dimming of vision

Loads of floaters 

And little white dots moving around

150,"Hi,

I'm 21 years old and have no idea what I'm doing relationship-wise. I fear intimacy, yet long for it. I want to be loved by someone, but find it very hard to love someone myself. I'm quite emotionless (didn't cry or really feel hurt at the funeral of my grandma or when losing my favourite cat and never cry over movies or anything). I have never been in a relationship and had platonic sex once, which I didn't enjoy at all (the person it was with is someone I don't like at all and I hate myself for it that she was my first time).  
I have friends but the coronavirus shows how bad I am at maintaining friends. Since the start I have seen only one of my friends. They're good friends, but they have other friend groups as well which I don't really, making me feel lonely all the time.  
I have waves of depression (now is one haha) where I just regret so much in my life and I believe this feeling will never leave me. I was born into this state of mood swings.  
Relationship wise I just feel stuck. I have no problem talking to girls or whatsoever, but I do not meet a lot of new people since I don't have that much friends. I also look about 4 years younger than I actually am which doesn't help as well.  
I'm afraid of pursuing relationships because I'm not really in love and doubt that I will be. I have been talking to a girl for a long time and I know her for two years, yet I'm scared to go a step further and ask her out because I don't know if I will be able to love her. Then again I don't want to wait another year for a relationship, especially since my mom is constantly nagging for me to come home with a girlfriend, especially since my younger brother has no trouble doing that.

I met a girl from England and she is the only girl I have ever had such a good connection with, but somehow I fucked it up be declining sex and making up some stupid reason for it , while it was actually pretty easy to explain.  
What I'm really asking is has anyone here been in a similiar situation regarding relationships, feeling stuck? Regretting things they haven't pursued all the time? Should I text the girl from Vietnam, should I go for the girl I'm talking to now or should I go for a girl I have seen once and had a good conversation with and later met her on Tinder and hit it off there?

154,"My original thread got deleted from the r/Windows10 subreddit so I'll just leave it here. I'm obviously being hyperbolic, but it's kind of how I felt after someone there gave me a non-answer regarding File Explorer search functionality. Anyway,

The Post:

I do not. I repeat, DO NOT want my file explorer search to index my entire computer. I DO NOT want it searching in indexed locations; you giving us the choice doesn't make it better or easier to FIND SHIT, MICROSOFT. 

Sure, I don't do file explorer searches 90% of the time in Location X. But then what about the 10% where I DO need to search for something there, huh?

HUH?? YOU WANT ME TO GO INTO MY DAMN SETTINGS AND CHECK IT BACK ON, HUH? FOR WHAT?? 

WHY ARE YOU MAKING LIFE HARDER ON US? ARE YOU TRYING TO REMIND US THAT WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE OR WHAT?

**I JUST WANT THE FILE EXPLORER TO SEARCH WITHIN THE LOCATION I'M IN AND ITS F'ING SUBFOLDERS. IS THAT ASKING TOO MUCH, MICROSOFT, HUH? YOUR PRODUCT, OF WHICH YOU HAVE A MONOPOLY, IS MAKING ME SUICIDAL. YOU WANT BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS, HUH?????? AHH?? !!!???**

GIVE US BACK THE ORIGINAL FILE EXPLORER SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY RIGHT NOW.

156,I was wondering if anyone who had experience or even just opinions could weigh in on what I should do. My recruiter told me meps is reopening next week and I've had time to get worried and rethink myself. Does anyone have any opinion on this or joining the military in general? Thanks,22Apr2020,1
157,"Dear diary,

Positive day today and even started talking to a few new girls on Tinder. it’s still early conversations but I guess I will see how things go.

My Xbox should get here by tomorrow as got email that it has been collected from depot so I’m guessing all that’s left to do now is to deliver it from the post office.

Went a whole day without looking at photos of her which for me trying to get over her seems like a little achievement but it means a lot. 

Every time I wanted to look on her profile Today I solved it by messaging a friend to distract myself and it seemed to have worked. 

Onwards and upwards!!!",22Apr2020,1

160,"I’m turning 26 this summer and I’ve never had a relationship. It may sound stupid, but I think it’s true what I hear, “stop trying to find the right person, and focus on becoming the right person”.  

I like to believe I’m a good person and I’ve made a lot of improvements over these past two years, but I still have a lot of work to do. 

I’m not exactly good looking, but I believe it’s my personality that others find unattractive.   
I have insecurities, self-worth issues and lack of confidence. I see people with worse issues than me who still manage to have a relationship and that would make me mad, but I have to stop comparing myself to others. And I can only imagine how any relationship I managed to find would turn out. 

If I’m not happy with myself how can I expect others to be happy with me? I can’t have the mindset that someone else will come along and make me happy, that’s a lot to put on one person. 

I hope to get to the point were I like/love myself, lead a healthy lifestyle and were I’m content going through life single. If someone comes along great, if not, no problem I’ll still be happy. 

Sorry if it’s a cheesy post, just felt like expressing my thoughts.",22Apr2020,1
162,"So my son has been breaking quarantine regularly for about a week now. I have caught him sneaking in and out when he thinks we won't notice. Since early february I have stressed to him the urgency of proper social distancing and hygiene, due to the dire consequences of this virus.

Specifically, I have told him that he is not to leave his room under any circumstances and may only join the rest of the family when I give him the all clear by knocking a secret knock on his door. But what does he do? He sneaks out and goes into the kitchen, plays video games on the living room big screen tv during the night, and basically ignores my strategy for minimizing the impact of the pandemic in our household. Just the other day when I made an emergency run for some dunkin donuts, I come back to find a god damn frozen pizza baking in the oven.

I just don't know anymore. Kids these days are so, so entitled and think they know everything. I fear such reckless behavior of his will endanger us all. Any ideas on how to get him to take this pandemic seriously? I have thought about grounding him, but he says I can't since he's 24 years old but I just tell him to shut up and ground him anyway.",22Apr2020,0

164,"It is a 12 hours shift, no meals provided, and probably very very boring job. I would much rather be caring for Covid-19 patients but the recruiter has yet to call me for an interview. I am a very human-interaction orientated person, and I love caring for others. Well, whatever that pays the bills. This is only temporary work for me.

Dont call me a hero. It is just another job for me. I am planning to exit in a week if it isn't for me (because my passion lies in caring for others, watching them get well).",22Apr2020,1
165,"Pretty much the title. I've done nothing but slack, eat and have sex for the past four days. Quite frankly, it's been amazing. Got my stimulus check, still getting checks from two jobs and have literally done jack shit for one of those this entire past week. Will officially be done with college next week. You know, fuck Coronavirus but sometimes life really is all the rave. 

This will be a period in my life I escape to while listening to some bald fuck drone on about performance reviews at a board meeting. 

Hope you are all staying safe and can't wait to see you all once this is over and behind us. Big blessings my people. 🙏",22Apr2020,1
