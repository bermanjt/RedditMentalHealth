3,"To dwell on darkness and to choose inaction is a cowardly choice. Either seek help or end it. Choosing suicide is a brave act. You understand you are not made for this world. You offer nothing. You are a burden. You chose an action. You are no longer suffering.

I had a friend commit suicide in 2014 and I envied his choice. He did not want to live a life of mediocrity and had no desire to create a better situation for his life. He chose the path that would benefit him the most. 

I wish I had the courage to do what he did. But I'm a coward. I choose to sulk in bed and dwell on how I came to the darkest place in my life after a year of multitudinous malfeasance.

12,"I have been waking up daily with chest pains and physical sadness for over 2 years now. Before I lost some people in my life, this sadness and rumination was more manageable but since losing my last connections in the past month I have regressed worse and worse. I can not see any light, I can only see death and dying in my future. My life has not been easy or privileged by any stretch of the imagination. I have gone through so much that I feel too broken inside to come back to my old personality and beyond recovery. I feel that my soul is expired and world weary. I feel no ties to life anymore, and distraction against my thoughts and depressive gut wrenching rumination tortures me for much of every day. I have nobody to talk to, no emotionally available adults in my life, and I feel no love in my life. There is a heavy sadness I have carried since a child, medication resistant sadness and a deep sense of not belonging to or in the world. I cry daily now and every night I fall into uncontrollable weeping. I don't know what to do anymore as I have reached out to 10+ therapists with no response. I have no social supports, no resources for help I can find that I have not already pursued, my friends have disconnected from me and I continue to fail in building new connections as my negative spiral downwards can be felt energetically. I have reached out to many therapists and never heard back from any of them. I have never felt that my friends throughout life have cared for me the way I cared about them. I have never felt secure in a relationship through family, friendship or romantic and it hurts so badly. I have prayed to God, and wonder how I have served for my past faults but I have never inflicted any depth of the pain I am contesting with on anyone. It's beating me down to no return, and I feel like I am on the edge of life now. Emotionally numbed except for sadness, despair, anger and extreme loneliness. This disease has eaten me alive.",26Nov2020,1

He lied and continued to talk to her. She ruined her own relationship to fuck him in my home.
He cheated because I was working every weekend and he claimed I didn't have enough time for him. He was never home, always out with his friends. But he isolated me from mine. 
I took that weekend position to save money for us to get married and buy a house.

He chose to pick a fight with me on easter.
The first major holiday I've ever spent apart from my family.
Because Covid.
I was working for Amazon as a supervisor alone in my department. I think that says enough about the stress I was under.
I was depressed. I was stressed. I was so worn out.
He picked a fight about cleaning.
He tried to punch me in the face.

16,"I'm a 24F. I'm really lonely. I haven't had any close friends in over 10 years. I've always been deeply introverted and socially anxious. I'm afraid that I have schizoid personality disorder, but I desperately want to have relationships. I'm afraid that I'll start making friends, but it'll be too much and I will prefer loneliness. People with schizoid personality disorder don't want relationships, but this at least partly comes from their inability to maintain relationships, preferring loneliness. 

I have an active fantasy life, which comprises mostly of me having conversations and fake relationships. I would prefer real friends, but my social anxiety, and more recently the pandemic, has made that difficult. My daydreams fulfilled my psychological need for connection in the past, but now I'm getting lonely and desperate for real connections.

All I have is my mother, and kind of my father, to guide me through this difficult time. 

I'm scared that I'll never have any other close relationships besides those with my parents, that I'll never marry.

20,"I (m24) got a new car today! And my goodness am I in love with it. I got it because the car I previously had has just been running through issues. The previous car was a 2007 Mazda 3, and was my first car. I bought it from a highschool teacher of mine who had been a pretty good friend for a time after graduating highschool, he sold it to me for a decent price and for 3 years I had a not too terrible car. It never had air conditioning, and over time I never took the greatest care of it, so when issues seemed to come up (I'm not a car person so I couldn't even tell you what issues these were specifically apart from noises that didn't sound too good) I felt as though it was just time to look for something new. I made the conscious decision to find something new a month ago and put in vacation time from work for this week so I could go out, see my father for the holiday, and look at some cars. Well today we went out, and I found a beautiful car I fell in love with, a 2019 Toyota yaris, and for 15k, I thought it was a good deal. 

While I do love the car, I still feel a bit saddened to see my Mazda go. I've put in a lot of time with the vehicle and always loved driving in it. So seeing it get put up for sale at the dealership feels weird almost. It makes me think ""wow this is actually happening"" in a way it almost feels like I've lost a friend. My family would never let me drive their vehicles anywhere before I had a car because they never trusted me, for a time I felt stuck, and when I was given the offer to buy the car off my friend I took the offer as soon as I could. It made me feel free, and I loved every bit of freedom I got with the car so I used to just drive around anywhere I could just to be out of the house, away from family, alone and watching my surroundings pass by me. My mazda came with a few stickers on the back/trunk/bumper area and I thought it was really awesome, so I ended up adding to that collection by a lot, it became my little nerdmobile, with Pikachu, a lapras, some star wars stuff, dragon ball's capsule corporation logo, etc on the back of the car. The car symbolized me, and my interests. And now its in a dealership, ready to be sold for the next person.

21,"I feel like there's probably a scientific name, but I haven't come across it while taking psychology classes.

Same with happy, except it's a lot more vague than anger. I think it's moreso just me categorizing more happy feelings as happy because idk what else to call them???

26,"I work as a credit risk model validation analyst for a large bank. The job is very boring and I assure you, no one grew up aspiring to be this job. In fact, I didn't even know this job existed until I was 27. I have been in this field for 5+ years now. A good way to describe our job is we are the ""statistics police.""

I got a graduate degree in econ and someone who had finished a year earlier than me told me about this job, so I went for it and got it.

This field has some unique characteristics. It is a quantitative role that is often hated by other quantitative people. They call it ""data science"" now but 10 years ago it was called ""quantitative analytics."" If you get into that area, you want to handle data and make models to analyze it. But my job is about validating and challenging people who make those models. Our output is mainly documents.

So, you have this contradiction. The field needs people that can do things that data scientists do, but also be able to kindof write like a lawyer. Our work is reviewed by the Federal Reserve and definitely has legal implications. But, the people who are attracted to data science jobs tend not to want to write documents. Add in that most of the field is made up of immigrants who came here on H1B visas  and you get a talent pool that doesn't want to write documents in English.

I was born in the US so am a native English speaker. My field (I have worked at 2 different banks) tends to give more time to writing documents than is needed for a native speaker. It takes me \~ 2-3 days of low intensity work to write our reports (not do the replication and other stuff, just write it assuming all else is done). But it often takes my coworkers 2-3 weeks to write reports that often need a lot of editing to be ready.

Before COVID, we got one WFH day a week. I mostly used that day to do nothing because I only need about 10-12 hours a week to do my actual work. With COVID, I am actually only working 10-12 hours a week. Before, I had to drive to a job 4 days a week (1 hr each way at least) and often had to pretend to be busy. At least now I don't have to.

The thing about this job is that a bad validator is going to be a bad validator no matter how many hours of work they put in. I hate to say it, but this job requires an innate ability to determine what is bullshit and what is not. Validation as a whole has very high turnover because if you can't do that, you will miss things and get in trouble with the Federal Reserve (and maybe get fired). 

But, I have been consistently able to be good at this. I read the work that coworkers do and can see how bullshit most are. A lot of my coworkers raise issues with typos in model documentation (model developers submit documents to us in addition to models and data). This is a common practice of the complete incompetent moron in my field. What your supposed to do is tell them quietly about typos and they fix it (and you don't fucking raise a damn issue about it because they will hate you and not cooperate next time we have to work with them).  Worse, they will often raise issues with things they don't understand and generally miss the important things.

So, if you get to the point where you can do it consistently and not worry that the Federal Reserve will raise issue with your reports, you are in for an easy career. Covid made the field a lot more open to remote work, so it is very likely most of the rest of my career will be working from home entirely. I make about $115,000 per year, and I took out about $60k in loans to get here.

In general, what Id suggest is to look for jobs that have high barriers to entry. A job being technically difficult creates its own barrier to entry. You get into those fields by working your ass off for a few years and then coasting on that work. Thats where I am now - I did a lot of work to learn statistics and am now coasting on that.",26Nov2020,1
28,"Just feel like typing this to get it off my chest. I went to college as a freshmen last year feeling so excited and ready for school. Things went pretty good that first semester, and then pretty quickly went to crap. I ended up moving home because of the pandemic, and it totally disrupted the few friendships I was struggling to make. I have had an eating disorder for a few years now. Went to residential treatment before my senior year after being forced by my parents and doctors, but came back out and lost all the weight I had put back on. I have also battled depression since before the anorexia developed which I still struggle very hard with. This semester I was excited to get back to school, but only 2 of my classes had an in-person component. I was spending maybe 2 hours a week in class in-person, and my mental and physical health just plummeted. My suitemate had to cancel her housing, so I was alone in the dorm. I ended up calling my mom crying every night until she told me to just come home. So I did, and worked out a deal with my in-person teachers to finish the semester online. All of my classes next semester are all online, and I'm living at home. I thought that coming home would really help my mental health, but it is very hard for me here too. I once read a statement from someone who suffered from depression that said depression felt like always feeling the need to go home, but nowhere feeling like home. I understand that feeling. My family is the best part of my life, but they are very chaotic and struggle with lots of mental health issues themselves. My parents are constantly fighting and making up, and it stresses me greatly. I feel like a total failure when I look at where my life could be and where it is. Instead of going out with friends, I sit at home counting out the number of goldfish in a serving and doing 1000 piece puzzles. I don't really enjoy that much anymore, which brings me to the whole reason I started this post. My birthday is soon, and I am dreading it. My parents will likely be fighting, and celebrating in any form will probably exacerbate the issue. Covid is making it so I can't see my extended family here, but I don't really want to anyway. Whenever I see them I feel judged for my body. I know it is out of concern, but their comments really hurt me. After my birthday, it's Christmas and New Years. I just don't feel like I have the energy to pretend everything is ok and exciting. My mom really loves Christmas, so I'm trying to psych myself up to make sure her holiday is enjoyable. I also know my parents are struggling financially, and so seeing them make unwise decisions with money for presents stresses me out a little. I don't know if any of this makes sense at all, but if you read this, wow. I'm seriously impressed. And thanks, for taking a little time to read my ramblings. I hope you are in a good place right now, even with all the craziness going on. Have a good Thanksgiving.",26Nov2020,1
29,"I was a train wreck of a human. My last day in active addiction was something I can only describe as divine intervention. I was on the run from probation and homeless. It was 13 degrees outside and I was in the same clothes from September. I had been praying to die. There’s a tattoo on my foot that says “let the caged bird sing” and I stared at that while figuring out where I would sleep that night. Something just clicked that I wanted to live and needed to turn myself in to get help or face whatever consequences. I spent that night in an unfinished basement.
I walked into the court house the next day and immediately walked back out because the unknown is terrifying. I started walking down the street and just started thinking “please help me”. My probation officer happened to be driving down that street towards me. He didn’t recognize me (I had lost 30 pounds by that point) but his partner did. They pulled over and I immediately started crying. It felt like a weight was lifted. I woke up the next day in jail...and clean. I have woken up every day clean for the past 5 years since that day. 
I now work as a recovery specialist and am able to help other people find their own way to living clean. If anyone is struggling, I encourage you to reach out to me or someone you trust. I’d be more than happy to help. One of my biggest barriers was lack of support because I don’t have a family. That doesn’t have to be a barrier for you if you’re reading this and need to talk.

30,"If there was a way to end myself without hurting him, I would already be gone.

I’ve considered just not leaving a note. Simply disappearing, having very few, if anyone, knowing what happened. But I almost think that would be worse. I wouldn’t want him to live wondering what he did wrong, when he’s never done anything wrong to deserve being ghosted (no pun intended). But if he knew, I know he owns too many guns, and is too impulsive, and has lost too much himself not to join me. And I wouldn’t want him to - not because I don’t love him, because I do. I just think he has a lot of potential, he could offer a lot to the world. He’s a wonderful person who could do wonderful things.

Me? Not so much. I’m a burden on everyone I know. I can’t function right, and have been depressed quite literally the majority of my life. I have seen specialist after specialist, and nothing works. I can’t take medicine due to my brain chemistry. The only thing I could do is force myself to be better, but I’m too tired - mentally, emotionally, physically, to do much of anything. My life is one big reck. There aren’t many people who would miss me. At this point, the most beneficial thing I can offer the world is my death.

And yet. I’m too cowardly. I don’t want to hurt my boyfriend, because he’s such a wonderful, kind person. He deserves happiness. I’m just waiting for the day he realizes it’s not with me. The day I can finally end myself. He says I make him the happiest man in the world, but I’ve never bettered anyone’s life. The day he realizes that, is going to be the day I can finally let go.

31,"My dad broke his femur Monday morning.  Literally was walking and suddenly felt really, really bad pain.  If not for the fact he was using his walker he would have fallen.  He called me and I took him to the ER.   They use a portable X-Ray machine now, sensitive plate goes behind him, when they hit him with the X-Ray it takes a digital image and transmits it to the main unit and it comes up on the screen.  I'm a geek, I think that tech is incredible.  I stood where I could see the image when it came up, it was a really bad break at the top of his femur just below the ball that goes into the hip.  Tuesday evening the docs called and said there are multiple tumors on the X-Ray and MRI and they were taking more images.  He femur had been weakened by the tumors and it broke under load.

They put a rod in his femur today to repair it, and found what I expected after the above news, but certainly not what I wanted to hear.  No pathology yet but surgeon was certain it was cancer.  The other femur will need a rod to keep it from breaking the same way.  There was a visible tumor on his ureter also.  Which very likely means the primary cancer is elsewhere and metastasized to his bones.  So now the docs are making a game plan of what to do.  I think yet more imaging to try to get a handle on where else tumors might be.

My Camaro kinda even though winter is coming and I do not like having to drain money I don't have in it like for gas and other stuff. Then music cause I am always rocking out to something. I am losing weight so I don't end up like the villian from austin powers.

&amp;#x200B;

First problem is I do not enjoy anything and just more or less watch paint dry other than two things above. I am tired of video games. School which is easy for the most part. The main part is I do not even pick up my guitar anymore I want to so bad put I just can't bring myself to and it sucks because I want to be good at something.

Second, school :/ its just the boring same shit every day. With the weight problems the only sport I do is bowling yet I am just sucking some day cause of knee problems which I am working on. So I have not so far this year made varsity which is fine but I want to do well but I just cant when I know I have the ability to bowl well.   


Still second/school, Friends, got none for the most part. A robot who ill probably dorm with. A buddy who moved a state away I never talk to. Dude from ps that ive talked to tri monthly for years. Ex friend who is just idk broken even though we still talk and act like friends some times (pitty? probably). I feel the main reason is I used to be a major asshole but have improved my personality a lot but still can get really cynical cause I try to be logical when it comes to things.

&amp;#x200B;

Third kinda still in second, I like this girl, I have other posts about her on my account. But anyway ive liked her all hs and have done stupid shit to get her attention. Never pushed hard enough to get a chance between being a scared lttle fat bitch to bad timeing. well she just got out of a realationship with a guy who could be classified worse than me (cough cough ... cough drugs). She may or may not get back with him but I got her a bday card a bit ago after they broke apart. But with tg break who knows what will hapen till then. Nothing I really can to but wait. When it ends I really do not know how to talk to her, or convince her to not see me in such a bad light and give me a chance for once. We would honestly have a lot in common from the bits I know about her. The card handing process was I would say better than expected from me 10 seconds. The worst part is I care about her as much as someone in my position can even though, it wont happen since she out of my league and she knows ive liked her for a long while.

33,"I work in a promotional products factory.  I primarily silk screen images onto various bags.  For a while I have felt down about my work.  I have felt no joy or purpose in my work.  

Most of the orders I do are for companies promoting their businesses. I derive no joy from promoting capitalism.  Occasionally  I get to make something  for a wedding or a birthday.  I really enjoy those orders.  I imagine the looks on the customer's faces as they open the box and see the quality of the image for the first time.  I try to make it so they are blown away by how good it looks.

Today was different.  Today my supervisor brought me an order and asked me to do my best on it (as if I don't normally) because a coworker who is no longer with us helped to bring the job to our factory several months back and we just finally got the order. 

As I looked through the paperwork I saw why we had just received it; it was a bag being sent to a place in DC and featured a quote from Kamala Harris on it.  It was a very pretty design and I felt so good creating it.  It made me feel like I was personally taking part in a momentous part of our collective history.

I (F/23) dreamed about men in life a lot - my father, make teachers, classmates, strangers, ex-lover, and so on. And in my dreams, they always look miserable and tormented. Some even just cry and shout my entire while the others are angry. During the dreams, I always somehow try to approach them and am always hesitate because of just how miserable they look, especially the ex-bfs. 

I'm not a heart breaker at all. I got dumped, too, in my dating efforts and I moved in, that's it. It hurt when it happen but damn, it was always a good idea one way or another. 

Yet they come to haunt me in my dreams (although most of them dump me) and I always feel so guilty in those dreams although I didn't do anything to intentionally cause harm. 

I'm starting to think they have become like a torment man archetype, a symbol of some sort, rather than a representation of the real people.

Apologies for bad formatting I’m on mobile. 

Im not exactly sure what subreddit this belongs in so sorry if it does not belong here.

Anyway, I am a young teen with quite a few interests and hobbies. I could try listing em off, here:

Hockey, baseball, retro video games, painting, drawing/sketching, prop making/cosplay, carpentry, collecting a lot of random stuff, reading, vinyl records,cassettes, fishing, and so many, many many more. 

Anyway, these are only a small amount of my hobbies/interests. But I want to get into even more like I really want to get into leather working because it seems so cool with the rustic look and all that. The weird thing is that I usually go through cycles which is strange. So for 2-3 months I’m into art, then the next 2-3 months is prop making. I don’t know why I have these random cycles. Some stay constant like retro video games (which I have only gotten into last March), collecting, hockey, etc. Also my parents won’t let me have any more hobbies lol. 

Anyway, all I ask is for a knowledgeable guy just to clear this up for me (I.e. why do I want to do so many things, why do I go Thru cycles, etc) if you can’t give any advice, that’s okay! I appreciate you reading this anyway.

She used to be in love with me in highschool, and i treated her like shit because i wanted to seem cool and like i was a player but im not.. i was a total piece of shit to her for no fucking reason 

I would constantly play with her emotions and the way she felt and i really only now (while im drunk which is the only reason im writing this on reddit lol) realize how wrong and disgusting my actions towards her were

She was the only girl i have ever felt comfortable around, the only one that i didnt have to put up an act for, the one that i could be myself unapologetically around and not worry what she thinks, because shes the same way as me.. 

Since we graduated she found a boyfriend but i just know shes not happy with him.. He doesnt understand her at all, hes manipulative, hes a total idiot and doesnt treat her the right way (i know because one of my close friends is still friends with her) 

Shes the only girl ive ever loved, and actually i mean it when i say love.. and when i dream about having a family and children one day shes the only one i want by my side for it..

I fucked up sooo badly by treating her the way i did all i want is to know whether the damage is irreversible.. because i need to find out if theres any resolve to this.

We both have relationships as of right now but im just praying to whoever is possibly up there that i  an have another chance with her to show her im not the douchebag she knew me to be and that i would happily give up anything to be with her..

Ive never felt strongly about almost anything in my life so the fact that i feel so *certain* about this, like i see it so clearly makes me think that perhaps this is what true love is.. and i really dont want to end up wasting this opportunity with the woman i love because i was a giant piece of shit",26Nov2020,1

50,"Hello Fellow Redditors,

Before I begin my novel, I hope you all are doing well and staying safe.

\*Sigh\*

I really don't know where to begin.

Like the title says, I'm broken...I've been like this for I don't know how long and I'm so tired and done with everything. I'm a 20 (soon to be 21) year old Male and I have some amazing parents and three older sisters. Being the youngest and the only male other than my dad, I've been designated to do everything (I'm happy to help, it's in my nature to), however it's to a point that I'm starting to feel defeated.

This year with the pandemic, a lot of us are feeling depressed and mentally finished. I'm right there with that group, however I think mine might be of 20 years of shit thrown at me.

Now my earliest memory of anything happening was when I was 1 and 9/11 had just occurred (I don't remember everything, just small snapshots in my head)......so I don't think I had a good 'foundation' of memories, but I digress.

Following that, don't remember anything from then until about 6-ish, which is when I went to elementary school. From then on, I was bullied by my classmates. I was teased, made fun of, harassed, nicknames, etc. I had a volley ball thrown at my stomach, a basketball thrown at my head...fun times. At that time, I coped by eating and became a heavy kid.

I ended up leaving when I was 13 and went to Middle School somewhere else, where I again faced bullying. Only then did I realize that my mental and emotional state wasn't that of what it used to be.

Albeit I was a bit of a crybaby when I was younger, but I don't have many memories from that time. From what I was told, we were almost dirt poor, we didn't have much to eat, and my parents almost lost their home. They own a small business so they pay for payroll and they \*knock on wood\* have never missed payroll...ever. Not once. We've gone hungry, almost had foreclosure...my mom cried herself to sleep for months because of this.

Now I wasn't one to really say anything so i began to cope. Cars were my coping mechanism, so I did okay through elementary school, but middle school really changed me. I met a great friend and we were really close. He was a great guy and a good friend. We hung out a lot. We unfortunately grew apart after Middle School and we haven't chatted in a while.

Following my Middle School Fiasco, I went to High School. At the time, I was friends with my crush (she was the popular girl), super kind and caring...She had a heart of gold. In complete honesty, I think I was in love with her...and I might still harbor feelings for her now. To make it worse, later on I heard 'down the grapevine' that she had feelings for me too, but I'll go into detail later.

When High school started, I thought I'd be okay and I'd get better, but this is where a lot of shit started to happen. I became friends with another popular girl around the same time, however she wasn't as nice or friendly as my crush. About a day in, she was trying to manipulate me to change (I was very insecure so I kinda started to take her advice. She was telling me that I should dress a certain way, have my hair cut a certain way, not talk to her at school). After about a week, I had a bit of a small breakdown and I kinda became a little needy (around this time, I had a friend that we used to talk a lot, but we had a falling out and stopped talking). This kinda 'set her off' as she went after me on social media and I kinda went back at her...which was not smart at all, but she really took shots at me that messed me up a bit and she hardcore judged me (I hadn't told her anything about my past until then, but she didn't care). Really since then, I've been messed up...I can't even watch regular porn without a sense of anxiety setting in.

Following this, I distanced myself from her and unfortunately my crush and I stopped being friends (not sure why, but she just suddenly stopped talking. I feel that this was due to what happened above). Looking back, I know now that this wasn't the smart thing to do, but I think that's when I started to have some more mental and emotional issues begin to develop.

High school itself was okay but it was set up very much like college and it was a huge struggle. I ended up failing a class and had to retake it (I wasn't ""held back"" per say, but I had to retake the class I failed. Basically this school was exactly like college). This amount of stress from 14 to 18 didn't really help me at all mentally, but I thought it would be important to mention.

Following High School, I went to community college and stayed at home. At this time, everyone but the oldest lived at home (My middle sisters graduated from college and my youngest was at community). This is what really drove me downhill. 

After moving in with my sisters, I lived in our former guest room. I was messy but it was good since I didn't share a bathroom and got to live in peace. However a few months later, my oldest sister moved back home and took the guest room, so I had to move up to her old room. This room was a decent bit smaller (I have a lot of computers and a server (work related), let alone all the shit I have soo...yeah). The biggest problem is that the 3rd sister (she's almost 2 years older than me) inherited cats that pissed all over this room, so my dad and I spent half a year tearing everything out from it. Not only that, they've caused probably a quarter million in damage of stuff around the house (my mom used to sew but has some sort of arthritis so she stopped, but made some beautiful curtains...they tore it up. They tore up the leather in my dad's car, they scratched every car we have, peed all over the house, clawed anything and everything, broke two of my computers, and infested our house with fleas every year (we gave them flee medication)). I got mad because my first car (I paid my, at that time, life savings of $12,000 for a 2004 BMW M3 with 90,000 miles. The car was meticulously maintained and they destroyed the paint in it and peed on it. It'll need to be repainted). This really upset me as cars are my hobby and passion, yet she didn't so much as apologize. I also had to spend a lot of time cleaning and taking care of them too (vet appointments, cleaning the litter boxes, feeding, buying them stuff, etc) and in all honesty I didn't want them. It sounds mean, but I'm not a cat person. 

After that whole fiasco, I moved into that room (which still is not finished to this day, but I want to change it around even more, so I don't know how long it'll be) and that's when all the shit began to happen. 

So my middle sister and I share a wall. I can hear if she's talking/typing/making noises and she can as well. We also share a bathroom, which is important as well. At first, everything was okay. We kinda kept to ourselves and didn't bother each other. However that really changed after I started working later. My middle sister doesn't work and goes to school online (due to covid) so she doesn't work too much. She does clean around the house, but not every day. Meanwhile I work from 5:30 AM to close to 9 PM most nights (I have school at specific times and my schedule works around that). Now I work for my parents, but they will have me work till I drop...and it happened once, but I digress. 

So I work long hours so I usually come home, unwind, eat, shower, and get ready to sleep. I usually do it in that order, so it's a consistent schedule. If I'm in the bathroom for more than 20 minutes (I brush my teeth, shave, shower, use the restroom, and pluck my eyebrows on a daily basis, so it's usually longer), she'll come over and start slamming her palm on the door and yell...while my parents are asleep. She'll be so loud that she'll wake them up and the dog, who will proceed to bark. She'll also slam on my door if I make any noises (laugh, listen to anything too loud, play games too loud/late, etc) which would be fine if she didn't talk to her friends for hours on end. She has talked with friends longer and more times than I have, as well as later at night. I also won't go banging on her door...I usually knock lightly and ask her to please keep it down. She'll usually scoff or yell at me. 

My oldest sister will basically lie and snitch on me when I do anything that she knows my parents don't like (saying fuck, going to the kitchen to get something to drink (she thinks I'm getting food), complain when I curbed her wheel (I paid for it to be fixed and it's a 2013 BMW 335i), whine to my parents when i don't let her drive my car (I just purchased a 2013 BMW M3 for $19,000 and she always wants to drive it)). 

My youngest sister will always over-dramatize everything about her car (a 2008 Mercedes Benz C300) to either make my parents buy her something or take my car (2013 BMW M3). She'll also make everything about her. Not only that, but today I asked her for some advice on relationships (I've never dated anyone and she's had like 2-3 BFs). I asked her something along the lines of ""Can I get your advice on relationships. This is serious and please don't tell others"" (She's a tattler). She basically said ""I don't care about your relationship issues"" or something along the lines of that. She complains about her phone all the time to try and get a new one, will disrespect my parents and other siblings, and will be an all around jerk and manipulative to get her way. She's the most spoiled one of the family (my parents bought her a horse). 

I've also paid for every single one of their car insurances, maintenance, and tires. My oldest sister has a job that pays her more than 3x what I get. My middle sister has a lot of money saved up (She'll brag about the $20k in her savings but won't pay me for $1500 in car maintenance I had to pay). My youngest sister has lied and will be manipulative to get what she wants, whether it be her complaining/breaking stuff on her car until she gets a new one or refuses to come down (she lives about 2-3 hours from us) and help out my parents with some work stuff. 

With all three of them, I've paid more than the cost of my car in maintenance for theirs, put up with their shit that they give me (for her birthday, I was going to let my oldest sister drive my car but I asked her one question and did the stereotypical tongue click, audible sigh, short response, and walked away. My middle sister refuses to help my mom cook Thanksgiving (I have to go into work for Thanksgiving as we have a ton of audits going on virtually and it's getting all the paperwork in order) and will spend her day in her room cleaning (Why she couldn't do that any other time...I don't know) and my youngest sister will always be nagging about why her car is broken (in all honesty, its a great car and it's a good commuter. Good on gas and reliable.) and that she needs something new or that she should drive my car since it's ""not fair"" that she drives a car that's not as nice as mine). I also get asked to do anything and everything related to computers, internet, and electronics for them, every. single. day. No matter how much I work or how tired I am, I have to fix something (and one of them has a Bachelors in Computer Science). 

Now the thing to do at this point would be to talk to my parents. The problem is that my dad's side family is dealing with a lot of drama atm (Affairs, marriage problems, and drama all around). He also had a stroke over the summer of this year, so I don't want to cause any stress to him or my mom. I don't blame them at all for what they did (I love them, will continue to, and I will never hold any ill will towards them). 

TLDR: Bullied when I was in elementary and middle school, got into a pretty public and nasty argument with a popular girl in HS that may have led my crush to stop talking to me, and have a strained relationship with my siblings. 

Now after reading this (or if you just read the TLDR), I do feel broken. I haven't felt happy or any sort of bond with anyone and i do feel that I don't have luck in life, but I also feel like I'm just making excuses for my own shortcomings. I know I definitely have shortcomings...probably a lot, but I can't go to anyone to get advice... so please let me know. Do you think it's me trying to 'get blood from a rock' and that I should just take it with a grain of salt, or do you think this is justified and that it's not just excuses? 

All I ask is that you please be honest and tell me. I'm not a fan of beating around the bush, so please tell me straight. 

Thank you everyone and I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving.

Also my apologies...I'm like 3/4 of the way asleep after a long day and I really need to hit the sack, so I'm kinda jumping around and falling asleep as I type this. I may go back and clarify, but I think this may be a good starting point....we'll see in the morning though.",26Nov2020,1

57," I have ocd. My ocd has to do with promises to God or Gods. The reason of the promises were to force myself to stop do an ocd compulsion.

 For example, if my ocd is telling me to do a compulsion, I make the promise about not doing the compulsion and a punishment/curse was being asked in order to use the fear of the punishment/curse to force myself not to do the compulsion.

 One time, I told God that I would mean a promise only if I validated it by doing the cross sign 3 times because I think I was telling Him that I do not mean those promises and I make them because of my ocd. One time, I tried to validate a promise but I think, I stopped validating by stoping to the second time of the cross sign. The reason of the validation was because ocd kept giving me worries and just by thinkiing the promise did not work. Anyway, I think I stopped at second time and canceled the promise.

 I am not sure if the promise was canceled. now, I have some other fears and worries too.

1) what if the promises/deals were accepted by other Gods in case Christian God is not real?

2) what if there are promises/deals that I do not remember?

3) my mind has intrusive thoughts about making new deals/promises to Gods and almost, every 1 minute or 30 seconds I pray compulsively in my head to explain that I do not make promises.

 I feel depressed. I cant be free. Whenever I am in my computer, I am worrying that I will see something or say something that will break a promise or an hypothetical promise.

 When I am not in my computer, my mind is having intrusive thoughts. I get so tired and anxious sometimes that probably, makes my system not work properly. I get prostate pain and my bowels probably, do not work properply. Sometimes, I lose my sleepy mood because of it.

 I pay much attention to this ocd issue, because 2,5 years ago, I started witnessing some coincidences that I connected them as a bad sign from Christian God.

 










Can these be considered as negative signs from Christan God or other Gods? I used to believe in Jesus but now, I am lost. I am writing some coincidences that happened in the past.

1) I was in my bed, 2 years ago. I asked from God a specific sign to happen, if in case, lets say, my ocd is right. I asked something like if my ocd is right, to hear a door opening/closing in the building that I used to live, then. The sound in order to be considered as a sign, should be heard til 5 seconds pass, since I ask it. If the sound happens after 6 or more seconds, it wont be considered as a sign. I asked for that sign and even though, I changed my opion about it due to a possible coincidence, I heard someone unlocking his/her door apartment. it was before the 5-second rule. Since, then, I would find myself between sleep and awake, and I would have the very first thought of the day. Randomly, with my eyes still closed from sleep, I was having random thoughts like "" door sound, i will hear a door"" etc. And after some 5-10 seconds, I would hear a door. That happened more than 5 times, I guess. It was as if my mind was predicting that i will hear a door. It was not a dream. I suppose, my subconscious was scared by the door coincidence, and in my sleep, I would hear sounds that are similar to door. For example, even calling the elevator would sound as a heavy door closing. If someone unlocks his/her door aparment and then, closes the door, I would hear it in my sleep and get the random thought ""door sound, door sound"" then, I would hear the man/woman calling the elevator which sounds like a door closing with force, so, I guess that created the misunderstanding that I was predicting a door sound, every morning.

​

​

2) I was praying and had my eyes closed. In the blackness, I was thinking about my ocd fear and that, created an image. That image was a japanese monster that I watched, randomly, on internet days ago. I opened my eyes, and started looking random stuff in facebook. After 5-10 minutes, I saw an article about that monster that it popped in my mind while I was praying. it was the first time, that I saw it on facebook.

​

​

3) I was watching a video. the guy was talking about a symbol. I heard him saying the word sign, but was not sure. I decided to close the video because my mind started thinking stuff like "" I will hear it again and it will be a bad, scary coincidence, i better close it"" I wa ready to close the site but my new thoughts stopped me. I was thinking "" what if when i close the video, I will hear the guy saying the word ""sign"" as the last word before closing the video? that would be scary"" I just wanted to close the video because I did not want to hear the word ""sign"" and when I tried to close it, i stopped because I feared that I would hear the word ""sign"" as the last word before closing it. So, I waited some seconds in order for the guy to somehow, change the subject and when I felt that it was the right moment to close it, I closed it, very fast, and uninentionally, without knowing that he will say the word ""sign"" I closed it with him saying the word ""sign"" as the last word. It was so unlikely to happen. The guy was speaking fast. If I had closed the video 1 second earlier, I would never have heard it. But I was so unlucky that I closed it randomly, when he was saying the word ""sign"" I know he said that word because I op How my mind predicted that I would hear the word ""sign"" as the last word before closing the video? I checked it and the guy indeed was saying the word ""sign"" and I am worried because if I have closed the video 1 second earlier or later, this scary coincidence would never happen. how you explain that?

​

​

4) A coincidence happened in youtube, with a video game character from Mortal Kombat, known as Scorpion. He transformed to a scorpion and i do not remember, exactly but that generated a random thought like "" I guess, Scorpion will give me some worries about my whole ocd-coincidence case"" I was playing Mortal Kombat 4 after a very long time, and the first opponent was Scorpion. I lost the match, and it the moment that Scorpion was to give me the finishing strike. I got a random thought like "" i hope he wont transform to a scorpion"" and he did! first match and he transformed to a scorpion. i was playing against the computer. there are many other moves that could computer use in order to finish me, and the computer choose to transform to a scorpion. that is not so common when playing against a computer. I fought him again and lost again. I was thinking "" I hope he does not transform to a scorpion 2 times in a row because that would be very rare"" and yes, he transformed to a scorpion again. 2 times in a row! I was watching a youtube video with a collection of all mortal kombat finishing moves. It was about 1 or 2 hours. I randomly, clicked the timeline in a random second. It was the second that the Scorpion character was transforming to a scorpion! That was about 7 seconds. So, from all 60-120 minutes of the video, I randomly, clicked on the 7-second scene of scorpion?

​

​

5) My ocd fear is about asking punishment from God so i was thinking about a similar example. I was thinking that if someone would have asked from God to lose his arm in an accident, that would never happen. that calmed me down but 1 minute later, I saw someone in the street with one arm only. was that a sign from God to tell me that I should be afraid of what my ocd says?

​

​

6) I ended up having random sound coincidences with other daily sounds, similar to the door sound. Like car alarms and dog barking. I would be thinking about my ocd and then, I would have random thoughts like "" i hope i wont hear a door or a dog or a car alarm"" and yes, i would hear one of these things. many times. I would be writing about the door coincidence in the internet and I would get a random thought like ""I hope i wont hear a door sound, now tha i am writing the word ""door"" because that would be a scary"" and yes, i was hearing a door sound.

​

7) I was having a scary thought for many days. i was thinking ""what if one day, I hear these 3 sounds (dog,alarm,door) together? that would be super scary"" One day, i was thinking about my ocd and randomly, a dog barked. I thought "" just a dog, i would be scared only if it was the 3 sounds together"" the dog kept barking for a minute and suddenly, I hear a car alarm ringing the same time with the elevator sound. The elevator sound, sounds like a heavy door closing so, it can be considered as the 3 sounds happening together. I was in a different neighborhood, and I heard a car alarm the same time with a door opening/closing in the building. i remembered the 3-sound coincidence and I was like "" the only thing we miss now is a dog"" and a dog started barking.

​

8) I was writing many times, on internet, about these coincidences. One afternoon, a friend that knows nothing of my problem, send me a spam message. he wanted to complain that I always cancel when we arrange something. the message was like

"" Coincidences are good but is it a coincidence that I agree? everytime we arrange to go out, you cancel it, is that a coincidence""

I freaked! why he randomly, used the word ""coincidence""

​

9) An internet user, suggested me 3 books related to my ocd problem, somehow. I was not interested in these books and as I was ready to close the site, i got a thought like ""what if there is a sign hidden in these books? choose one of them"" I randomly, searched one of the three books, for its summary in wikipedia. The ending was almost, 80% my ocd fear and the summary was using words-phrases that I used to describe my ocd fear. was that a coincidence? my mind predicted that I would find something there and then, indeed I found something related to my ocd fear so much?

​

10) A friend of mine was speaking about the thiefs that steal wallets from random people. I was thinking about my ocd fear and got a random thought like "" Perhaps, we are cursed from God"" and at that moment, I hear my friend saying "" the thief curses when he steals a wallet that it is empty due to the economy crisis"" was that a coincidence?

​

11) I read the word ""curse"" on internet and I hear from the tv, which was playing a scooby-doo episode, saying something like "" he was cursed"" i freaked and the tv kept saying "" his worst nightmare came true""

​

12) I entered the room in which the tv was open. It was a show about mythology. The narrator was saying a story. When I walked in the room, I heard the narrator saying "" She cursed herself and the sea and asked from God to be transformed to stone and God granted her wish"" That was my ocd fear! asking a punishment from God. I was writing about that coincidence on the internet and as I was thinking to write "" Was that a coincidence or not"" I hear my grandma saying to my father something like '' these are signs"" was that a coincidence again?

13) I was staying in an airbnb apartment. I was looking the bookcase that had a few books. after some time, I looked it again, and had a book with the title ""THE SIGN OF GOD"" i did not freak because it was a time that I started ignoring my ocd and was thinking less about the whole coincidence-thing. But still, why i did not saw that book when I checked for the first time?

14) I was writing about an ocd worry on internet and as I was ready to write the word ""movement"" in greek, I heard an ad saying something like "" bla bla bla bla.... movement"" I got worried and I was wondering if it was a coincidence. At that moment, I heard from the tv, probably, from the next ad, saying something like "" psoriasis signs"" and I freaked because I heard the word signs.

15) I was thinking about my ocd worry and heard a door sound the same time with a dog barking. that reminded me of the dog-door-alarm coincidence, and at that moment, I noticed that I coucld hear the sound of a van sensor/alarm or something similar to that. I do not know if it started when I heard the door/dog or it started earlier. Anyway, I probably, heard the 3 sounds together again.

16) I ended up connecting as a bad sign, a butterfly. While I was thinking about a small coincidence with a butterfly that I saw in a series episode, I randomly, looked the toilet paper and saw butterflies printed on it.

​

can someone explain to me, what he/she thinks of these coincidences one by one. These coincidences are the reason that I cant just ignore my ocd that easily. Because coincidences happen that perhaps, tell me that my ocd is right and I should worry about it.",26Nov2020,1

63," 2,5 years ago, I may have made a promise to Christian God about not washing a specific part of my face compulsively. I tried to make the promise in order to force myself stop doing that compulsion. I worry because I may have asked for punishment in case breaking it. I cant remember the promise or if I asked for punishment. But I remember stop washing that part of my face compulsively, because I was thinking that I made a promise.


 Today, I brushed my teeth and without analyzing it, I rushly, swept my mouth and tha part because it was dripping water and I did not want drops to fall on my home office desk because of an other compulsion. 

 I now worry, that I may have broken that promise from 2.5 years ago that was about not washing that part of my face compulsively. Though it was not 100% the same compulsion.

68,"I have ocd. My ocd has to do with promises to God or Gods. The reason of the promises were to force myself to stop do an ocd compulsion.

For example, if my ocd is telling me to do a compulsion, I make the promise about not doing the compulsion and a punishment/curse was being asked in order to use the fear of the punishment/curse to force myself not to do the compulsion.

One time, I told God that I would mean a promise only if I validated it by doing the cross sign 3 times because I think I was telling Him that I do not mean those promises and I make them because of my ocd. One time, I tried to validate a promise but I think, I stopped validating by stoping to the second time of the cross sign. The reason of the validation was because ocd kept giving me worries and just by thinkiing the promise did not work. Anyway, I think I stopped at second time and canceled the promise.

I am not sure if the promise was canceled. now, I have some other fears and worries too.

1) what if the promises/deals were accepted by other Gods in case Christian God is not real?

2) what if there are promises/deals that I do not remember?

3) my mind has intrusive thoughts about making new deals/promises to Gods and almost, every 1 minute or 30 seconds I pray compulsively in my head to explain that I do not make promises.

I feel depressed. I cant be free. Whenever I am in my computer, I am worrying that I will see something or say something that will break a promise or an hypothetical promise.

When I am not in my computer, my mind is having intrusive thoughts. I get so tired and anxious sometimes that probably, makes my system not work properly. I get prostate pain and my bowels probably, do not work properply. Sometimes, I lose my sleepy mood because of it.",26Nov2020,1

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

87,"TLDR at bottom. If you read the whole thing beware, lots of cursing...lots of well deserved cursing. Also if you’re feeling down today my PMs are open

Feeling thankful and want to reflect on what has been the best and happiest month of my life 

Growing up I had an unreasonably negative mindset. I was a kid on a mission to find the negative in anything I could. I feel like I should say that there was nothing was wrong with me mentally. Like I didn’t have any weird rare mental illness’s or autism or anything like that. I’m not saying that people with those kind of issues act like I did, my parents just thought it was unusual to be 6 year old who thought the way I did. I was a healthy kid with loving parents. I was only ever thinking the worst. I was never mean, or had anger issues, i was a normal kid with the mind of a grumpy old woman. I don’t remember a whole lot from when I was younger but my parents said they started to notice it when I was about 6. They didn’t know if I was just being a typical bratty kid at the point or not. Let’s be real there’s not a whole lot a 6 year old can be negative about. I would get an invitation to a kids birthday party and immediately think they only invited me because they were forced to or they just gave me one so I didn’t feel left out. If I didn’t understand something in school I would cry to my parents and tell them I’ll never get it because I’m stupid, I’m going to get held back because I couldn’t pronounce all the words in my book correctly. I was a smart kid, did well in school, but was convinced I was going to fail. My parents would beg me to tell them if I was being bullied at school to try to have some reason for why I said and perceived life the way I did. This isn’t the end of the world right like I was healthy, I didn’t have depression, I was a social kid, i was apparently happy, but the negativity was always there and we all just kind of got used to it. 

Once I was older and in high school is when the real stuff would come out. Yet again, my parents wondered if I was just a hormonal teenager or if I was just a genuinely negative minded person. This is when it started to affect me more because i was able to understand my feelings a bit better. I soon became extremely self conscious about my appearance for no reason other than I told myself I should feel self conscious. Basic high school things for a girl! No big deal we all go through it! But even as a child I would convince myself nobody liked me without having any reason to think that...huh?? Why?? So that’s when I started to understand that I was choosing to feel this way. I knew I had no reason to be worried about the way I look but every time I would convince myself I was fine I would immediately go straight to thinking I was just lying to myself to feel better. It was a classic case of “I have no idea what I actually look like”. I was in a constant battle with myself. I kept telling myself you don’t have to be like this. It’s easy to just be positive instead. Something just wasn’t clicking and I decided that I was just one of those people who were born miserable. I still enjoyed high school. I had a good group of friends and did all the things a normal high school kid would do. I had a negative attitude about absolutely everything, but I was good at keeping those thoughts to myself so my friends didn’t have to endure this torture with me. I was never diagnosed with depression, didn’t develop an eating disorder even with how much I hated my body, I never had problems with anyone besides my own self. This is why it’s so weird to me. I don’t know if I was lacking certain hormones to the brain, couldn’t produce the good hormones, maybe there’s a tumor on the part of my brain that can think positively, I was thinking of anything to make sense of it. Through high school and some time after I accepted whatever was going on in my head, did the best I could to see the positive in things and try to control my thoughts but no matter what I could never really get out of that negative mindset. It was always something. I was disgustingly self conscious about my looks when I didn’t even need to be, I was easily irritated, I could only focus on the cons of the college i was attending, if I didn’t hear my from parents I assumed they were cutting contact with me forever, when they did call It was always an inconvenience to me, everyone and everything sucks, I hated my body, ruined what would be a perfect date to anyone else by saying “this is nice and all but the music playing ruined it I’m leaving”. When I tell you I was negative about fucking everything.....I mean it. I was a miserable human being who wanted to be better but demons weren’t fucking around.

So it’s a year after I leave college and I’m doing the same shit but now I’m seeing a Counsler. I figure I need to so we can reset or retrain my thought process or figure out what the actual issue is if there is one or if I’m just really a miserable human being for no absolute reason. This had taken over my entire life. For what! I was smart, always thinking you don’t have to think this way try to control it, I ask myself what are the logical reasons for why you feel like this, can you justify why you’re thinking this negative thing? The more I tried to make sense of my emotions and the reasoning behind why the fuck I’m like this the negative would take over and win. I could never answer those questions. At this point I am so tired of not understanding any of this and accept the possibility that I’m just a fucking psycho, deal with it the best I can and maybe one day it’ll be better. 



BUCKLE UP
Okay. One month ago. I cannot make this shit up. If a higher power is indeed real, they are straight up messing with me at this point. Or I was under a curse this whole time. Or this is a giant coincidence. Or I just woke up from a coma idk. 


So it’s COVID year and that’s cool cause everyone gets to feel all negative feels and shit with me. I’m not the only one. Great. I , being a bored at home twenty something girl downloads the app I swear I would never get, fucking TikTok. I’m ashamed to say I first heard the words “main character energy” on the everybody’s favorite cringey app. What is a main character energy? It’s meaningless and stupid. A trend. It was just a video of a female telling her friend she was giving off main character energy. Cool cool cool, whatever I didn’t pay a lot of attention to it since it’s just another TikTok thing Gen Z came up with. I continued to see this saying throughout my social media apps. Still didn’t think about it. Completely irrelevant. Then on this one regular boring day I was venting to my friend about how hard it is for me to say no to picking up someone’s shift because I have plans already. I just hate saying no. My friend looks at me all normal and casually says “fuck em you’re the main character you do you”. 

I don’t know what kind of voodoo shit was going on but for the rest of that day all I could think about was “you’re the main character, you’re the main character”. These four RANDOM MEANINGLESS WORDS slapped me so fucking hard that I realized yes I absolutely am the main character in my life. Cool cool. Im having a positive thought about myself. Waiting on my brain to go into overdrive and do it’s thing. Instead all I’m thinking is why the fuck had I spent so many years acting like a non player character in my own life?? Any finding something negative about everything no matter how good it was?? I couldn’t come up with any good reason as to why I was refusing to allow myself to feel like anything but a extra in my own damn life. For whatever goofy ass reason these stupid, meaningless, irrelevant, beautiful four words...

The next day to now I wake up, remind myself that I AM the main character and allow myself to ENJOY ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. I can spend time thinking about what I like about myself and not feel like I’m just being self centered. You mean I’m allowed to actually like things about myself?? Yeah I’m the main character. You mean to tell me that I can feel good about myself and what I’ve done and am doing in life??? I don’t think there’s always a negative side to things?? I was so delusional my whole life and I don’t even know why. 


I highly recommend telling yourself on the daily that you’re the main character. Allow yourself to feel like the main character. That’s it that’s the mindset. That’s all you gotta do. Do things for you and only you because you want to. I’m not even sure what it exactly means but I’ve been telling myself that I’m the main character and my mentality has completely changed. I’m still going “what the fuck?” I’m shocked and sometimes feel like I’m crazy that this stupid saying, it’s not even deep or inspiring or anything, from some teenyboppers TikTok is what undid all the negative. It’s just so stupid to me that THIS, OUT OF THE HUNDREDS OF MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES, MOTIVATIONAL SPEECHES, THE EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF POSITIVE POSTS MY MOTHER SENDS ME DAILY, was the thing to open my eyes and flip the switch in my brain from always hating on myself and comparing myself and being so negative about everything to simply not giving a fuck about what people think of me, enjoying things I told myself I didn’t deserve to enjoy, learning to love myself and accepting the fact that I’m honestly just a really freaking awesome person. I promise I’m not trying to be cocky but I really do give off good vibes. Now.

If you’re struggling with not liking yourself for any reason, feel unworthy, feel like less of a person because you don’t look like this and haven’t done that in life or what have you, try to allow yourself to feel like the main character because life is too short not to be!!! How you feel like the main character in your own life is up to you. It can have different meaning for everyone. Even if you don’t struggle with these specific issues and just need to remind yourself, or others, who the fuck you are from time to time. This whole whack ass thing has convinced me we might live in a whole simulation on a giant spinning rock where nothing matters so while you’re here BE THE MAIN CHARACTER. 

I am in no way a mental health specialist or doctor of any kind. I’m also not saying this is a proven technique for a better mindset. I’m not saying thinking like this will magically make everything better. I think for me my brain was tired of all the bad vibes up there and was like here have the entire dose of serotonin you didn’t get your whole life lol have fun!! I just want people to know things can, will, and do get better. I know I’m not the only person who has gone through it. Hopefully in your case you realize all these things like a normal person with the help of a therapist or a good drunken heart to heart with your best friend or by having a life changing conversation with some hobo on the train.

Since it’s Thanksgiving let me just say how incredibly thankful I am for this weird unexplained thing. I don’t even care if I sound crazy anymore. I’m so thankful that this is not another Thanksgiving where I’m telling myself over and over I was only invited over today so they wouldn’t feel guilty, they’re hoping I don’t show up, nobody is thankful for me. I will never ruin my parents Thanksgivings anymore by saying yes they cooked all this amazing food for hours for us but there’s no green bean casserole therefore this meal is ruined and I stomp to my room questioning why the fuck I just did that. Today there will be nothing but love and positivity. And lots of champagne. 


Life is fucking crazy. 



TL:DR - Spends most of my life in a state of constant negativity &amp; self loathing, understands I can try to control how I think but negative thoughts win every time until my friend tells me in a casual conversation “you’re the main character” and it blows my mind so hard that I’m cured and am now dumb happy but also questioning my entire life and my sanity.",26Nov2020,1

The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, other have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign States, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere, except in the theatre of military conflict, while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. The needful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the National defence, have not arrested the plow, the shuttle or the ship. The ax has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect a continuance of years with large increase of freedom.

No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.

It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and voice, by the whole American people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea, and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of thanksgiving and prayer to our beneficent Father, who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to their tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with the divine purpose, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity and union.

In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. Done at the City of Washington, this third day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.

I've thought about going and wearing a mask, but I don't think that would help much in protecting myself.

92,"Hello, I come here bacause I am doubting myself. For a little bit of context I was taken away from my parents 8 years ago to go into foster care. I didn't know why and I remeber the police coming to my school to take me to a communal house, since then I have changed houses multiple times, was separated then reunited with my brothers, went back home, was taken away from my parents again and now I am truly back home since I turn 18. Now my mental health is a mess, anorexia, anxiety and depression have all come and hit me hard in the last year and I'm wondering if my childhood may be the cause of it because I told my therapist that I didn't find my childhood that hard. 

Somecof the things that I feel around my placement in foster care are a great reluctance to talk about it ( crying sometimes and doing my best to forget it), a great feeling of shame and most importantly an intense feeling of guilt around the event which now makes me feel guilty about everything.

95," 2.5 years ago, ocd was telling me to return home in order to get paper napkins. I did not want to do it so, I tried to make a promise to Chrirstian God about not returning home to get paper napkins. I made the promise in order to force myself not do the compulsion. I tried to cancel the promise but I am not sure if it was canceled. What if other Gods accepted it in case Christian God is not real?

 Today, I was going home after going for a walk. I was worrying not to think about napkins because I was worrying what if it looks like as if I am breaking the promise just, because the thought of napkins are popping up in my head without my will? 

 While i was entering home, I tried not to think the napkins and tried to change the thoughts by thinking something else. For a half second, due to worry, the thought about napkins popped up strongly in my head.

 did I broke the promise? what if it looked like as if I returned home to get napkins just, because when I was entering my home, the thought napkin popped up strongly for a half second? what if just by thinking about it for a half second, even accidenatally, broke the promise?

 the promise was about not returning home to get paper napkins.

 and I went home in order to stay and continue my night but due to ocd, accidentally, the thought of napkins popped up as I was entering the house. Is it broken?",26Nov2020,1

Reality often seems altered for me; every now and then things will seem further or closer than they actually are, the world seems to spin, and sometimes things swirl around or look like someone took a smudge tool and smudged something like a book or computer.

I’m finally getting an appointment and my mom is already doubting me (I only told her.) I admitted everything that has happened, how longs it’s been happening, and what I experience.

When I told her, she didn’t seem to believe me. Now, this morning, she talked to me and said it’s probably just because of tiredness or not drinking enough water. That doesn’t make sense because of lately, I’ve been drinking a lot more water than I ever have and I’ve been getting a bit more sleep than normal.

I don’t know what to anymore because the one person who I thought was actually going to get me help is thinking I’m making this all up. Like, she’s getting me help but not believing me. I just, ugh.

101,"I'm just going to rant about all my issues that can easily be fixed, but for some reason I can't be bothered to fix these issues and instead I just continue to bitch about them. 

My health. I'm dieting and in a consistent calorie deficit to lose weight (I'm not arguing with you about diets btw so don't start) and it's been working, and I'm so happy that I'm feeling better... But I don't exercise. I have a sort of active job and I work long days, and by the end I don't feel like exercising. You don't need a gym membership to exercise, I could literally do cardio and body weight exercises and I'd be so much more fit and healthy than I am right now. I just want to be strong and healthy. 

My grocery budget. I keep buying more shit than I need at the grocery store. I'm already supporting myself and one other full adult without any help and that's tough enough, but I can't even be bothered to stick to the grocery budget. I keep buying extra snacks and extra processed foods and blah blah blah. I need to spend less money there, but I just don't put the effort in to be creative in my meal planning to lower the bill. Stupid. 

My ""fun"" budget. Okay, it's non-existent. I need to save money for my rainy day fund after I had a few things come up and I had to use half of my already small emergency fund towards my emergencies/surprise expenses. I don't have extra money right now and yet I keep shopping..I'm not talking 10 dollars once in awhile either. I have this collection that I keep adding to and I'll mindlessly blow $70, get mad, and then do it again in the next week or two! What the hell. Also, if I never save my money, how am I going to buy a home? I'm not here to talk about outrageous house prices, because I have an okay budget and I can support myself, and I live in a lower cost of living area. In fact, the house I currently like is only $114,000. 

All of these things are so easily accomplished, but I just can't be bothered to do what I need to do to reach my goals. If you're not taking steps that you can to reach your goals, then they're just piles of lies to yourself.",26Nov2020,1

103,"I am head over heels in love with the girl of my dreams but there are a few small problems

She used to be in love with me in highschool, and i treated her like shit because i wanted to seem cool and like i was a player but im not.. i was a total piece of shit to her for no fucking reason 

I would constantly play with her emotions and the way she felt and i really only now (while im drunk which is the only reason im writing this on reddit lol) realize how wrong and disgusting my actions towards her were

She was the only girl i have ever felt comfortable around, the only one that i didnt have to put up an act for, the one that i could be myself unapologetically around and not worry what she thinks, because shes the same way as me.. 

Since we graduated she found a boyfriend but i just know shes not happy with him.. He doesnt understand her at all, hes manipulative, hes a total idiot and doesnt treat her the right way (i know because one of my close friends is still friends with her) 

Shes the only girl ive ever loved, and actually i mean it when i say love.. and when i dream about having a family and children one day shes the only one i want by my side for it..

I fucked up sooo badly by treating her the way i did all i want is to know whether the damage is irreversible.. because i need to find out if theres any resolve to this.

We both have relationships as of right now but im just praying to whoever is possibly up there that i have another chance with her to show her im not the douchebag she knew me to be and that i would happily give up anything to be with her..

Ive never felt strongly about almost anything in my life so the fact that i feel so *certain* about this, like i see it so clearly makes me think that perhaps this is what true love is.. and i really dont want to end up wasting this opportunity with the woman i love because i was a giant piece of shit

104,"So i grew up in a pretty homophobic place, though I've never been homophobic. From a very young age the LGBTQ community never bothered me in any way, until now and I want to change that.

         I'd say I got into the internet pretty late compared to my other friends(I got my first device at 9). Being on the internet obviously exposed me to a lot of things, one of those being the LGBTQ community. I've always been extremely supportive of them (secretly because of where I live) and still am but I feel like now I have a bit of problems that could be considered homophobic.

           I used to watch a lot of gay romance movies and books (mlm and wlw) though not being part of the community myself. But now I don't know I just can't. I tend to not watch a lot of romance movies in general because a lot of them I find boring but recently there has been a lot of gay romance movies that I discovered and I wanna watch them but can't. I have watched them before but I just can't anymore. I know I don't have to watch gay romance movies to support the community but it's preventing me from getting to see very good storylines. One of the reasons is because I feel like a fetishizer(this is more in reference to bl, a lot of these fandoms tend to be full of girls who go crazy over their ""oppas"" kissing and it kind of makes me uncomfortable (wlw movies/books don't tend to have majorly weird fandoms as far as I've seen so that's why I'm not really talking about it).

             Next thing is that a lot the tropes tend to fall around ""straight guy turn gay"" and I've read books and seen movies that have good self discovery things like that but a lot of them just seem like some kind of mission to ""turn people gay""(there also a lot of obsession with girls wanting to turn gay guys straight and guys wanting to turn lesbians straigjt but it isn't that specific topic I'll get into rn) I really don't like this way of thinking but I just can't change it.

             The other thing I don't like is there""hatred"" for ""cishets"" , I know it shouldn't bother me but it does, I usually ignore it but I have two friends on the spectrum that constantly send and talk about their disliking of straight people, and it's getting on my nerves. I mentioned this to them before but they kind of just brush it off, they're really amazing people but this thing that they do just really annoys me. They always talk about how stupid me and the other straight friends for liking men(they are both girls one is bi and one is pan) and I had said that gay guys also like men only and they something about the dynamic being cooler or whatever.

            The random claiming of songs. Anyone can put any meaning to songs but when anyone of the lgbt puts that sort of meaning to the song, it becomes a song for them only and straight people can't listen to it. Usually these songs have no type of actually meaning that would lead to it being a gay song or maybe I'm not seeing the ""gay subtext"".

          I dislike the pushing of sexualities on people and claiming it's justifiable because of representation. I know the LGBTQ community is a small portion of the population, However we are talking about real people and you can't force them to be a certain sexuality for the sake of some even-ing out.

          The thing is these opinions change randomly, sometimes I have ideas like these and other times I'm completely fine. I feel like two sides of my mind are fighting against each other and I'm gonna go crazy.

109,"i would love a discussion about this in the comments as well if y’all have any input 

i’ve recently finished high school and am in the military now. i’ve only made a full grasp of it now, but i would say i was aware of it in my younger years though i didn’t work on it 

I believe the proper term for this is called foolish thinking. here’s what i mean. At times, decisions i have made were made with inner foolish intent that didn’t benefit my happiness. An example would be of this. I remember in HS, there was a girl i liked, and i all i knew is she had math down the hall from my class. So my foolish decision was to take time away from my class so i can go to the bathroom(which i didn’t even have to go) just for the chance of her to see me walking in the hallway. things like that ultimately drove my actions and i realize now how stupid it is. 

I just stopped myself from doing something similar. I wanted to go to the outside common area on this base that i’m on to sit down . Then i asked myself *why?* do i truly want to go, is it to just be outside or is it to socialize? i realized it was none of those things and that I only had this idea that if i’m there i could possibly run into this other girl that’s here aswell. 

side note, Things happened with this person and then stopped happening so that why i probably feel the need to get out there 

But back to the story at hand, after i came to that conclusion, i realized i shouldn’t do anything that i don’t *truly* desire to do, if that makes sense. As people I feel like we sometimes do things less for ourselves and more to satisfy the foolishness of our own minds. And when i realized this i felt more at ease knowing I no longer act on my own impulse and i can focus on what makes me happy. I bringing this to you because , all of the above gave me anxiety.

At this time, I was overweight, had terrible grades, and had been fired from the best job I had at the time. The thing is, my dad had been conditioning me to have horrible mental health, which has led to my awful physical health and work ethic, and to top it off, HE'S the person who got me fired from my job.

I was very depressed and was even suicidal during this time, but I spent the next year losing weight, fixing all the problems with my mental health, developing good studying habits, pretty much learning to be better at and enjoying life. Right now, my career path has changed to nursing, which has a 3-year program I'm able to begin in sept 2022 (I'll be 25 when I graduate in sept 2025). 

My dad has been giving me shit because he's comparing the age I graduate at with traditional students, telling me I wasted time because I'm not exactly like them. Of course, I now know better than to listen to him, and I'm happy with my current plan moving forward, but it's just fucking annoying having the major cause of my life problems continue to try to influence me to be my old, massively flawed self.
