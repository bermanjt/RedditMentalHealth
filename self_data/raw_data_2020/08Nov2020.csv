1,"Hey first time poster on this subreddit.  I feel like I’ve been going through a rough time, but I know everyone else has also.  I’ve been so lost lately.  In my hometown I feel that there is nothing left for me here and all I’m reminded of is bad memories.  

I like warm weather and was thinking somewhere south, but I’m always worried that I won’t be able to make by myself.  I’m 30 and make 15.45/ hr and feel like it’s not enough to live off of.  College is not an option.  

I can’t be in my hometown anymore.  People say I’m just running away from my problems and maybe I am.  I feel like I have no friends and that there is nothing to do here.  I get that because of the pandemic a lot of places aren’t open or functioning but it seems like there is absolutely nothing.  
All the people I know are in relationships and have families, while I’m the only solo person.  They get to stay locked down with their SO and I’m left with no one to talk to.  I’m not really attractive so online dating doesn’t work for me.  

But yet idk if moving away will solve any of those problems.  My only thought is that maybe I’ll move away and actually be alone instead of staying in my hometown and feel like I’m all alone.  

If anybody has any input feel free to comment.  And thank you.",08Nov2020,1
2,"As the title indicates, I’ve been a Republican my entire adult life who voted for Trump twice and was a member of r/trump which I’ve now been banned from because yesterday I posted an article from the AP about GOP senator Pat Toomey stating there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, which I said I agreed with because I also haven’t seen anything compelling to support this argument. 

I engaged in civil discussion and never once broke any of the sub’s rules, yet now I am banned because I had a different opinion, even though I’m your side. 

Anyway, fuck you r/trump. Sorry I refused to get on the damn crazy train with the rest of you. Before the election most of you thought we were going to lose anyway and now suddenly they are stealing the vote. Some of us are still actual patriots who believe in democracy and you are making all of us look like fools. We lost. Deal with it. 🕶",08Nov2020,1
3,"For whatever reason, I've been spontaneously having flashbacks to my past. Not even one specific time, but random memories I thought I had forgotten about from many different eras/grades/years of my life. I don't know why, but I've been delving into more existential things lately, and my mood has improved greatly in the past few days, so maybe that's it.

As to what I'm remembering? The thing that started this was watching videos and listening to music from the mid 2010's. It reminded me of my last few months of elementary school. Sitting outside on the grass on a sunny afternoon, eating lunch with all of my friends. In those last few months, there was... bliss. Really thinking back on it, those months were the conclusion to my real childhood. We were all about to move on to another chapter of our lives, so we really were just enjoying the moment.   

Man, maybe it's not fully nostalgia. Maybe I'm feeling the growing-up blues. Times were so much simpler then. My biggest worries were about what was going to happen at recess. 

I just had a flashback to kindergarten. In the room I was in, there were a few big computers we played Starfall on. The tables were little and the stools were bright colors. And of course, the big rainbow rug in the corner of the room (these were in every K-3 classroom). I remember there was a man who was a friend of my teachers who sang ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" while playing on his guitar. A memory that I thought had been lost in time.

One last thing: a video told me to imagine walking in a park with your mother (for some other point they were making) and the image they showed on the screen made me go all the way back. I remembered being in a park with my mother. Lots of green trees, in an early 2000s afternoon. Maybe I made this memory up, maybe I really did go back to being a toddler, but I did spend a lot of my childhood in nature, so I wouldn't doubt it. 

Anyways, nostalgia is weird, isn't it?",08Nov2020,1
4,"Hey guys,  that’s my first time posting in this sub. I am currently in bed crying. Not surprising though, I do this a lot lately. Crying myself till I cry. 

So here is my story. 

I am a 20 years old male, currently on university, studying medicine and miles away from my family. 

The issues is myself, how I look, how I feel and other conditions I have. Everytime I think about all the issues I have in my life I got so depressed. I just wanna cry for hours. Sometimes I feel like it would have been better if I was never born or I was dead at the moment. 

I have too many medical issues to fix about my body, sometimes I wonder how I am even alive. That’s probably also why I chose to study medicine. 

So let’s start. 

My mom has this unique MUTATION(probably only me and my mom have on the whole fucking planet) which makes our hands not fully functional and it’s hard to fully open our hands(we can still use them and do most things other people do but they look so ugly). Since the day I was born I have been to physiotherapy for 12 years but it did almost nothing except from taking away from me the chance to play with my friends back then. I have probably seen more doctors in my life than any person ever probably has. All the physicians etc all know my name at the hospital and university in my hometown, even though I don’t even remember seeing them. The thing is that there is literally nothing I can do about my hands. No person knows anything about this condition/disorder/syndrome. Call it what you want. 
I am probably gonna do some genetic research on myself later after graduating. Maybe. 

The other medical problem I have is Hyperhidrosis. 
If you don’t know what it means, it makes you sweat a lot more than the average person even when the weather is cold.
Sometimes I just can’t stop sweating and it makes everything so harder. Even thinking about something is harder with this condition. I am pretty sure that’s why I got social anxiety too. Let’s get to the next one. 

Acne. 
I know what you gonna tell me. I know everyone has acne. But mine started 10 years ago and I am still not finished. Currently on my second course of accutane. I hope that would be the last time. It gave me so many scars on my face and my body I can’t even stop thinking about how I am gonna fix them after the treatment. If I can fix them and afford the treatments. 

I also have Scheuermann’s Disease and probably I could have been 10 cms taller. I makes me look uglier than I am. Also why I have body dysmorphia. I probably will have to get a spinal fusion surgery which sound really crazy to me rn. 

I need to fix my teeth but I don’t have enough money. 


I am ugly and gay. 
Literally except from older men, no one is interested in me. 

I am just gonna cry for now. Maybe I can complete this story at the comments later.",08Nov2020,1

9,"Transcript of the first part of his speech:

My friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Sen. Barack Obama — to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.

In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans, who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president, is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.

This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight.

I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. Sen. Obama believes that, too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.

A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to visit — to dine at the White House — was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States. Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. 

Sen. Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day — though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.

**Sen. Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.**

**I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our goodwill and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises, to bridge our differences** and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited. 
Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans. And please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that. 

It is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought — we fought as hard as we could.
**And though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours. **

I am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset. But your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.

7 Months ago I got friend zoned by someone I had a huge crush on. We were really good friends beforehand, and it hit me hard. Since then, with Covid and all, I just haven’t talked to her much. The last time I talked to her was about 4 months ago. It wasn’t a bad conversation or anything, we were just catching up.

Anyways, fast forward to today and I find out she stopped following me. I have one of those unfollow apps (I know, i'm aware it’s weird) and it showed me that she just unfollowed me on Instagram. But the crazy thing was, it said I wasn’t following her anymore. Which is weird because I didn’t unfollow her. And the only way you can make someone unfollow you is if you block them first. So anyways, she blocked and unblocked me simultaneously and not just on Instagram, on EVERY social media, including linkedIn!

Any idea why she would do this? I didn’t post on social media recently either so this is completely out of the blue.",08Nov2020,1

I do wanna take a moment to express the love to Kamala Harris being our first female VP, our first black VP, Indian VP and child of immigrants, this is what I call a win for all of America, the real pride of what we are as a country and it’s about damn time!

I support Joe Biden, I support Kamala Harris, I’m happy to get rid of Donald Trump, Mike Pence and the mess they caused, but more then anything, I love y’all, each and everyone of you, American or not, red or blue, I love you and I’m so happy your here!

29,"Today my twins turned four. The past few months have been hell. We lost our home, our storage unit, and went through a parental abduction. I’m slowly rebuilding, we have a roof over our head now after being homeless but not much else.

A few weeks ago I was able to get both girls a toddler bed and a blanket each after all four of us were sleeping on the floor. When they saw the beds my sassy twin made the comment “no take our beds we be good girls”. I took it as she thought we lost everything because they were “bad girls”.

Fast forward to today and we went to get balloons (all I could afford) and to the park. She started talking about all the toys she used to have and how we used to always have food in the fridge, “memba we always had food”. And then she got really quiet and said “oh but we bad girls now”. That broke my heart!

The last few months have been a huge shock to all of us, it’s a night and day difference. I've never once told them they were “bad girls”. The only time they haven’t been with me is daycare and when their dad took them a few months ago resulting in an amber alert. We don’t have a tv so I have no idea where they picked it up from.

I’m trying my best to make things work but I don't get monetary assistance or food stamps. How can I make this transition period easier so that they don't think they are bad?",08Nov2020,1

I like Trump more than Biden based on personality but I dont really know what I believe politically wise.

32," 

So I honestly do not know where to post this, but, I'm writing this here for anyone who needs hope or something to remind them that there is something out there waiting for you. This is a throwaway as my name suggests because there is so much to this story which can genuinely land me in deep shit, but moving on.

I have always lived in a very religious environment, that the slightest doubt in that religion can either have legal or cultural consequences. I've lost faith when I was a teen, and constantly had to be careful of what I say or do just in case there's someone who would out-me or worse... report me. I was beaten since I was a kid relentlessly, I was called the disgrace of my family, I was publically bullied and humiliated for literally nothing. But, everyone goes through that and their fair share of other awful experiences; but that's until the beatings got me hospitalized. I lost hope in my family, I had ZERO friends, not even acquaintances, so I feel into depression. I got so used to attempting that it was almost a game of chance to me. ""Hey! If I don't die that means I'm meant to live! but if I die... game over I guess?"". I lost hope, faith, morality, and even self-respect. I just didn't want to go on. Why should I?

Well, that's at least till my first semester of Uni. I had told myself ""Just one more chance, just one more f\*cking chance, anything, just one thing to live for, anything!"". And I sh\*t you not, 2 weeks into uni, I found a reason to go on. I found my soulmate. It's funny, isn't it? Everyone goes through the same thing and they break up in no time. But this was different. I've been in so many relationships whether they were toxic, valuable, flings, to waste time, love, you name it I've experienced it. But. I felt like I finally found out what caring for someone to the point of wanting to better yourself means, to care and love that person so much that being you, isn't so bad; that yeah, shit happened... but that's it, it happened and you got to live with what you got even if it takes much longer to reach your goal or your happiness, that maybe if all of that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have met the person who made life life! I finally found out what I want to be and what I want to do with my life.

So don't give up just yet, even if it is clinging on to life by a spider's silk, keep going, you got this.",08Nov2020,1

I don't want to fight and kill either. Hell, i just want to start up a small photography business and run a podcast while writing a book on the side. The thing that makes me not right for that shit is simply this; the Jargon and the Atmosphere. I hate all of their verbiage when I comes to military shit. Like, please speak English. I know they gotts keep shit confidential and professional, but can't they be honest and straightforward at all for the enlistment process?!?!?! My recruiter told me and my group to lie about our health issues (one guy straight up had chronic asthma and suicidal depression and i had a hip effusion and COVID). When I backed out at MEPS, I told my group some b.s. like I failed my medical so I didn't look like a bitch. Recruiter somehow found out but told me he wouldn't tell anyone about the mishap. Today i find that he lied about saying shit either. So you know what? Fuck the military. I said it. Fuck it. I respect the people who serve and put up with all that shit for us back at home, but fuuuuuck. Plus, we just elected a Democrat for president and those fuckers are warmongers.

45,"Hello Reddit. I'm just posting here to get my thoughts out of my head and see what people think, maybe the internet would have a different point of view, maybe I'm just stuck in my head.

I'm a 27yr old girl from the Philippines, not married, supporting my family (brothers and dad, my mother died two years ago) and I myself don't even know what's going on in my life right now. I feel like I'm lost with my career yet I'm supposed to push so hard so I can provide for my younger brothers. And I've just lost my sense of self or what my purpose is.

I feel like my life is just a mess even with how many achievements I've done, in the end I don't feel like I'm doing it for myself even if I say that I am.

I feel like I've done so much only to come out as a jack of all trades with half-assed skills. I've just been doing these things and pushed so hard and had high hopes only for it to die in the end. And now I'm in a big financial debt... on a sunday morning, trying to think of how I'll survive the next weeks.

I don't know reddit, maybe I just feel alone right now, maybe I'll delete this later, I just feel lost. **What would you have done? What dyou think I should do?** Maybe this story is too vague of too long to read, but hopefully I can get insights.. I feel like I'm tiring everyone I talk to anyway..

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps I'm just stuck in my head and overthinking. I don't really have a lot of friends, I only have about 5 people I genuinely talk to in the last 2years and only 2 of those on a daily basis. So I don't know.. I'm just writing this out and share... I may have done something wrong with my life but I can't really pin point it.. so here goes...

What I've done in the last 2 years..

&amp;#x200B;

**I built up a 3D Architectural rendering freelance business,** this skill I have been working on since I was in college and went into upwork and getting clients locally, **I was getting good at it,** I can actually make money for myself and I felt like it was going to be my career. However I had to put this on hold because I worked for our family firm.

*(But currently, I feel like I've been left out in this industry as there have been programs that came out and it takes practice, repetition, and time to study how to make those realistic renders and actually get client and projects that pays properly and compensates fairly. )*

**I've become a registered and licensed Architect,** but only worked with relatives and all our projects (big projects) just went into shambles and I still feel traumatized or afraid to continue on with my profession as I've just had a bad experience with construction + clients.

I've never worked for any firm outside our company and I feel like my skills are stuck between being **""the boss"" and being technically incompetent** *(I just went straight up to ""basics of managing""  but don't know much about technical things that would make up a complete architectural purpose.)*

I was just all about designing but not really engaged in site work and all that. So even if I say in my resume that I was handling operations and meeting with clients, I can't really apply as an Architect because I never really practiced that..

As that endeavor felt like a fail.. and as COVID started and we're all stuck at home and broke... I went out to get a loan from friends so we can survive the quarantine... we never really had any savings...

I tried, but as the projects started dying one by one, all my savings were gone too to the point that we only had coins to buy rice.

**I do a lot of random things on my spare time**, I did clay art, played the piano, streamed games with my brothers, bead arts and sell online, had an etsy shop to sell other crafts.. make small money here and there

**I got a job as an outsourced Administrative Assistant for a construction company in the US**,

I feel like this is the only right thing going on in my life right now... I still get to practice some of my professional knowledge because they're in construction and Its basically what I did anyway when I was working for our company, so this I know how to work with and I can survive with (but the pay barely keep ends meet for my family)

**During COVID, I came up with a small business with my Dad**, a craft he kind of ""invented"" and I was the one who marketed it, made facebook pages, all the client gathering.. and that business kinda took off and we got a huge client... unfortunately, as that project started, the production didn't go as planned. Basically I am now in debt trying to fund that project so we can finish it and be in good terms with clients.. but througout all that, I've just been in the biggest fights with my Dad that I don't even like going home anymore, I just feel like I've seen him at his worst and I do not want to do any business with him anymore..

**CURRENTLY**

On this sunday morning, I took this day to be alone in the apartment and think things through... I feel like it weren't for my brothers (whom I love very much and we're all very close) I'd just jump off the window right now. but they need me, I just live for them..

So... what will I do next, 

I'll probably come up with some craft I can sell, anyhow that's what I'm good at. Maybe I'll stream games again, at least I'm happy on those moments and talk to random strangers and forget my real life..

Maybe I'll remake 3D rendering website.. maybe that'll help down the road..maybe someone finds it again randomly and hope I'll get clients..

If anything, If I know anything about myself, **is that once I put my head into something I'm all into it, I do it 100% all the time, I don't mind loosing sleep, I like being productive**, I'm the type of person who'd feel bad on a Tuesday if I did not do anything productive that day. I miss that version of me, but right now I'm just stuck with all these problems. 

I also genuinely think like I'm just better off on my own. Whenever I do something, It's all good and great until I involve someone else (relatives for that matter, but this is another story) I feel like I'm just being constantly disappointed and with this come my fear of continuing on that path again, whatever that endeavor would be. It's just become a cycle and I'm just tired. 

I've just become so weak-hearted with all that has happened. I literally cry and breakdown or lash out so suddenly after a week of so much stress. And I know this might be a personality problem, but I don't know how to fix it either.",08Nov2020,1

Recently, I(18M)  feel extremely conflicted. I saw that post about Scotland banning smacking children and it reminded me of my upbringing. 

If we did anything bad, we were smacked/slapped as kids. If we broke a glass or something, we were yelled at. Other times, it would be if my brother and I got into an argument, or if I ""talked back"" to my mum during a disagreement. Every time a hand was laid on us, it was our Mum. My dad never did anything of the sort. 

But is he just as bad? He knew what was happening. He knew it was wrong. He should have stepped in.


The time my mum stopped smacking us was when I was in fifth grade. I stopped doing any of my homework and really started slacking off. No reading, no maths homework. All I did when I came home was play Skyrim on my PS3. I did this for like a quarter of the school year. Then my parents found out... 

My mum smacked he so hard that morning when she looked in my bag and found a slip she had to sign for me to tell her I wasn't doing my work and I was being a bad student. That day, I went to class and worked through the day untile recess came and I had to stay back to get some work done. I was so stressed out, I just told my teacher what had happened, how my mum had smacked me that day. In my face, on my back when I fell from the first one. Later that day, DYPHIS(idk how to spell it) (now CPS), came to our house and interviewed me, my parents, and my siblings. I never wanted to get separated from them because I thought they had been good parents. They got me everything I needed, all the necessities. I still got birthday/Christmas presents. How would I know any better?  They explained to me that slapping/smacking was still ok punishment as long as it wasn't punching. I'll never understand this. Then they went to talk to my parents and siblings. 

When they left, my parents explained that we could've been separated as a family and I was terrified. ""What if they had put me with a family that would really beat you?? 

Then when they left, my parents changed. They never laid a hand on me again. They only taught me right from wrong verbally. They spoke to me like people speak to people. Ever since that day, they have never laid a hand on me which is great! And I'll never lay a hand on any of my kids if I ever have any in the future. 

But there's one thing I can't get off my mind. 

How could she slap/smack me when I was just a kid? When I couldn't defend myself. When she was stronger than me and I was constantly scared of her. And now all I feel is anger...but also understanding. 

I feel this anger because I hated feeling this fear if I mess anything up. I still have this constant fear of failing or messing things up or being unable to complete/achieve something. I have confrontation issues where I can rarely stand up for myself and I'm extremely awkward in social situations. I struggle like hell when it comes to asking a girl out.  My anxiety whenever there's a chance to fail goes through the roof. I feel this anger that I wish the same feelings to her. I hope that when she gets old and can't defend herself, she feels that same fear. I hope she goes through that same creeping around anything she might not be able to do. I'm angry at my dad for never standing up for any of us. Never stopping her before she could do anything. How can you stand by as one of the two people who's duty it is to protect your child?!?! 

But I also feel understand her perspective as well. She's human. People learn and people change. She was maybe just a bad parent and didn't know what she was doing. Who does? Maybe she was confused. What if she was raised the same way and thought it was normal like I did for a long time? The same goes for my dad too. I really don't know what to think. I want revenge. I want justice. But I also need to be the bigger man. I need to be better than my parents. Every generation should be better than those before. How do I process these emotions and improve as a person?",08Nov2020,1
47,"I was saying this to my wife today and I used the analogy of a friend of ours; let’s call him Brandon. Brandon is a friend of ours who is known to rub a lot of people the wrong way. In fact he rubs me the wrong way constantly. However I still consider him a friend. 

A lot of my friends hate Brandon and refuse to hang out with him. 

Supporting trump is like being friends with Brandon.  I would give Brandon the shirt off my back if he needed it, because we’ve spent enough time together that I care about him.... but at the same time I understand why my other friends hate him and I don’t blame them at all for not wanting to invite him out or hang out with him. 

That said if there was an election for... I donno... president of the junior hockey program in town and it was between Brandon and someone I didn’t like, I would vote for Brandon.... but when brandon inevitably lost I wouldn’t go marching down the street claiming fraud I would be like “yep... that’s about right... most people hate Brandon.” 

so why are trump supporters so unwilling to accept defeat? Is it actually so unbelievable that a guy who has spent his entire term dividing the country has come out on the losing side of the election???",08Nov2020,1
48,"I won't do either, by the way.

I haven't drank much since covid, and when I do it's with friends and I get home late and crash. Tonight I was drinking with my dude friends but got home early, pretty drunk. I feel a bit flirty/social still, so I messaged my gf of 6 months but she fell asleep.

I hopped on Omegle, which I used to do for my social fix as a teen, but 99% of people on there are teenagers or creepy dudes, so as a guy in my 20s I gave up on finding anyone normal and my age there pretty quick.

At lonely times like now when I was single, I'd drunk snapchat an old FWB/ex and chat them up a bit. They never minded. But... That seems obviously scummy. I haven't talked to any of them since I started dating this girl.

I was briefly tempted to reinstall tinder just to chat but........ That's obviously a bad idea.

I just feel flirty and lonely and bored, and the gf is asleep, and I'm tipsy/drunk...

Ugh. This feels weird. Don't worry, I'll just sulk a bit then sleep, I guess.",08Nov2020,1
49,"Honestly, people can only handle being pushed away so many times before they give up, whether temporarily or permanently. 

If you’re actively pushing everyone away on purpose and admit to it, you don’t really have a reason to get upset when people stop trying to talk to you or invite you to things. 

Why do people do this and then get hurt when people give up on the person? Some people give up out of respect for the person’s wishes. I don’t get it.",08Nov2020,1

And there's so much to love about all of you. Cassidy, I love how smart you are. You're knowledge of algebra and geometry astonishes me, and I admire your ability to explain large, complex mathematical concepts in ways that don't scramble my dumb brain around.

You look so cute too. You're large glasses are adorable and I can't get over your adorable bushy hair. I love it when you laugh happily, with joy oozing from your vocal chords.

Alli, you've helped me through so much. So many of your soothing massages have gotten me through terrible, fear-filled nights before tests. Your hugs and embraces feel absolutely blissful.

Molly, you're so fucking pretty. I love your blonde hair and cute nails. Your British accent is fucking adorable. You've soothed me after horrid hallucinations and made me feel as if I had allies in my fray against schizophrenia.

You make high school more bearable.

I can't wait for this all to be over and for us to watch movies together and have sleepovers yet again.",08Nov2020,1

56,"This election has truly been utterly awful. Everything about it has been awful from the candidates, to the belabored process of the election, and to the meltdowns. I can see why certain religions prohibit involvement in politics entirely if this is to be regular. You had a choice between a man whose only redeeming quality was the memes and a man who is a placeholder for someone with actual power once he dies in his sleep. I don't expect Joe Biden to last in office for that long when the presidency aged Obama consideredly before his first term was even halfway through. 

Both candidates on the winning sides have said or done morally reprehensible things. I am not saying that should disqualify them, but it was more than enough to raise a point of conscience about it. If people who liked trump for deporting illegals are okay with having a vp who is the living embodiment of a corrupt cop stereotype, and a president who is going to resume normal interventionist policy (endless war) then somethings wrong. There were plenty of candidates I wouldn't have minded voting for on the democratic ticket, but they turned shill (Buttigieg, Sanders) or just got crushed too early on. 

I guess I might as well consider becoming extremely reserved with anything political since the wheels of decaying status quo march forward.",08Nov2020,1

58,"Just found out my parents did 🅱️ump.


   All I gotta say is “Oof”. Look I could care less about all the political BS. I’m a grown woman with my own decisions who doesn’t need to justify why I’m not voting. Frick em both. Seriously, you’re just another pawn to these people once they get into office. My mom says “If you’re not gonna vote, I have no right to complain about what happens to the US and how it affects me in the future”. She also believes that “T (you know who I’m talking about) is the president we need because of his iron fist of authority and leadership, he’s short straight and to the point”. Look, we can have all that in a president.....minus the stupidly, racism, childish threats, fake crap, and also not giving a flying frick about others. 

   I told her “Ok first off, I’m not having this conversation with you. If I even HAD to choose, I’d go with blue, but as I said....I COULD CARE LESS”. FRICK. THEM. BOTH. I’m not letting this political crap get in the way of my daily life, and the good relationships I have with my family and friends. The fact that my mom has this kind of mentality, has kind of made me feel disappointed in her. She’s a good mom, but when it comes to this stuff, it’s sad. I’VE SEEN TO MUCH VIOLENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS BROKEN BECAUSE OF CRAP LIKE THIS. Religion being a problem too. Heck even all the racism and riots too. 

   Also I will not begin to even listen to probably the nasty comments I get from this and downvotes. As I said, my political views and opinions do not matter to anyone except my own. I’m human, we all are, and the sooner we can put aside our differences, we can be a stronger and better race. Unfortunately that doesn’t seem like that will happen anytime soon. I’m glad to have gotten this off my chest. The one thing I can say for us all, is that whatever happens, happens, and hope for the better future we all want one day. Life is too short, we all have to make the best of it, and share the little love and kindness we have left in this world with others.

61,"I never want a snack.  I only want meals.  The problem worsens because I don't like, for a lack of better words, low class meals.  Something like a TV dinner, instant mac and cheese, I find those disgusting.  I basically want to eat out twice a day, but can't afford that.  Like right now, I don't want potato chips or cookies.  I could go for a real burger, like raw ground beef, fresh grilled, but being single it would be wasteful to buy all the ingredients as buns come in like an 8 pack, etc.  I could kill some lasagna now, but I don't have the $40 or so in ingredients, nor the hour of prep and hour to cook.  Some Indian food would be amazing, but I got no clue on cooking that.  I'm sure I could watch a youtube video, track down an ethnic grocery store, spent a lot of money, an hour cooking, plus cleanup time...but I also don't want to waste 3 hour for 10 minutes of eating.

63,"My dad has made some huge mistakes in the past when my brother and I were both very young. I’ll just say they were affairs but won’t go into detail. My mum was hurt by his actions and had a very hard time coping with it. She never divorced him back then because she didn’t want us to grow up without a father. We always knew that my parents didn’t have a good relationship as they fought constantly. It wasn’t until recently that my mum decided to tell us the reason behind her resentment towards dad and why they fought so much. My dad apologised to us after. Everything made sense and I told my mum to get a divorce if that makes her happy since my brother and I are both adults. I guess I did push her a little to divorce my dad since that’s what I thought would be the best solution. 

My parents have been getting therapy/counselling together and hoped it would make things better, but it didn’t. My mum and dad are  basically treating each other as shadows in the house and my dad leaves during the day to lessen any engagement with my mum and comes back home at night. I don’t live with my parents anymore so it’s not as suffocating, but my brother seems to be very uncomfortable staying between them. My dad has been asking me on how and where to find houses etc recently and I figured he was trying to move out, but didn’t think it would happen soon. Then yesterday my mum told me that my dad would be moving out either next week or the week after. They’re not getting a divorce though as it’s too much paperwork (according to my mum), just living separately.

I honestly thought this is what I wanted, but now that it’s actually happening, I can’t hold back my tears. Every weekend when I come home to visit my parents, I won’t be able to see my dad. Every time my family has an outing, my dad won’t be there. The thought of not seeing him so often makes me so sad. My dad is old, he doesn’t have a proper wage, he doesn’t earn enough to live in a house by himself. He most likely will live in a share house with strangers and the thought of it makes me feel disgusted. I worry about my dad. I love both of them so much but I don’t know what to do. How often do I see my dad? How often do I see my mum? What if something happens to my dad and theres nobody to help him? I don’t know anymore. I don’t want this to happen but I can’t stop it from happening.",08Nov2020,1
64,"When I was twelve (I'm 25 now), we had three cats. Two were kittens. And one by one they ran away. And I think it was a very traumatizing thing for me because I haven't stopped thinking about it for 13 years. They were outdoor cats, by the way, so it's not like they were kept indoors and escaped. These guys just left, and never came back. My mom admitted to me that she wasn't very good at checking to make sure they came back at night, and I'm honestly not sure if I can blame her for that, because sometimes people just forget things and that's not their fault. What gets me is that I keep wondering if they did try to come back, and what if none of us were home to hear them? What if they were crying to get in, and we weren't there, and they thought we hated them?

That's the traumatizing part for me. And it's haunted me for thirteen years. I just hate the thought of suffering, especially innocent animals. It doesn't matter to my anxiety if they were found by someone else (though that would be nice), because for me it's the fact that I might've caused them pain, in any way at all, however indirectly, because of all this. And that makes me cry. It makes me cry a lot. And I just wish none of it ever happened. That they could've had a better home from the start, that wasn't us.

Oh boy, does today feel like Christmas. Like the bad juju is slowly dissipating. It has been a tough year for everyone and its not over yet. Who knows what's the next year got in store for us? But today has been one of the best days of 2020. Today I actually felt that hope is real. And its a beautiful feeling. 

I'm sorry for Trump. Clearly he's lost the plot and the people that got him there are also to blame. But this kind of reckoning was coming. I'm sure he knows deep down that his bad behaviour, his projected machismo, blatant lies and misleading rhetoric will one day come to an end. And it will soon enough and the world can't wait. It will be a long, tough road to get us back to how we all were, even rougher road to make everything better. But today's victory only shows that if we all work well together, if we all check the facts and open our eyes, we can make everything happen. Trump is not the only worst person out there thats in power. He just happen to be one of the loudest and the one to enjoy the spotlight. To his supporters, do not fret. One day you will find someone to represent you, someone who truly cares for you. Someone who wouldn't feed you with misinformation and keep you in the dark. A true leader will make you be a better person. They will help create a world and opportunities for you to enjoy the freedom to learn for yourselves to make decisions for the benefit of everyone, not just for humans but for also this Earth that we all live in. If we all work together and do the right thing, good things will happen and today only shows that. The past few years made me lose my faith in the world, this just shows there's still a little bit worth holding on to. Trick is not to lose this momentum. 

Let the last few years be a lesson to us all. We don't have to contend with bad governance. If you know your leader is false and only cares about themselves, you have the right and the voice. Use your vote in the next election. Do not settle for anything less. Nothing is easy and nothing is plain black and white, but things can change and it will only change if each and everyone of us does the right thing. Do it for your family, your friends, your neighbours. Do it for the Earth and do it for yourself. You deserve better. We all do. 

Now let's all try to keep our heads together and if everything feels dire, remember this day. Differences are petty. Race, gender, religion, your political ideals. In the end they mean nothing. We are all humans, what matters in the end is how we chose to live our lives and how we affected each other.

 It will always be hard and tough, but sometimes it helps us see what is wrong and what isn't working. Sometimes it pushes beyond our limits but it is up to us to put up our hands and say no. Enough is enough. Change only happens if we actually all work together towards an elusive common goal. It is up to us to see and accept the truth and this day proves that. Hopefully, this will be the first victory and there will be plenty more.

I went out, read stuff about dating, tried to communicate better. It didn't work so I looked into it further. I focused on myself, when I was happy with who I was I went back into the dating scene. 

I went to a dating coach, took paid courses, went to premium online dating websites. On the rare occurence I got a date, it never went further.

Right when I was making the decision to change career, covid happened and shut down my industry but also made it even more difficult to start something new.

I want to leave this city anyway and move somewhere with more nature, where I can afford to live by myself instead of sharing with strangers.

I’m going back to my home country to stay with my parents for Christmas. At least I can save rent and be with family for a bit. But I’m scared of going back and getting stuck. 

I’m so lonely and I’ve fallen into a major depression and anxiety that’s making it impossible to know what kind of work I want to do or where I want to go, because everything just seems exhausting and isolating. 
I just miss my partner so much. And I want to be around family and friends and people I love, and feel a sense of community. But I am so completely alone here.

I've seen it - of course - on religious subreddits. I've seen it on r/mademesmile. I've seen it on gif subreddits. And lately I've seen a few wretched examples on many female subreddits. Parenting, pregnancy, feminism, child raising, toxic partners etc. These places are supposed to be encouraging, validating and appreciating subreddits. Respectful and tolerant discourse. Quality posts that were controversial were often upvoted regardless. People just didn't care as much about who was right or what their own opinions were. 


What the hell happened to Reddit? Back when I first joined, there was this cohesiveness. There was lots of diversity but it was wholesome and tolerant. Things were definitely not perfect. People still disagreed. Trolls still existed. But all in all it was a much more enjoyable place. 

Sorting by controversial lets me now see people. Real humans. The voices that are seldom heard.

They’ll defend themselves all

Through the spring to the fall

The snow in the fields to the beach

Each one of them always

Comments and pathways

Statements just thrown to the wind

About sexual progress

To the sports they impress

Because that is the life they bask in

Where I quirk and I wiggle

Leading kind hearts to giggle

A core infrastructure of life

While I find it amazing

Some others find hazing

Called for joy overthrowing its strife

Some find it required

To add fuel to the fire

This seems all to be done in fear though

We should always take moments

From the grind and ignorance

Because life is too serious not to be a magnificent weirdo",08Nov2020,1
81,"Title basically says it. My mail carrier brought me my ballot this year and I am pretty grateful. I was raking leaves when he brought my mail and I ""thanked him for his service"" so to speak. I didnt think about it until he left but I thought I was going to get him a card with a little cash. I thought even further about it and thought it would be super cool to start a new American tradition. I know we tip our mail carriers on Christmas, but that seems like kind of a dead tradition maybe this could breathe new life into it.

Next year I am going to ""celebrate"" on 11/7.

Per USPS and a quick google search - you're supposed to tip $20 or less.

""All postal employees, including carriers, must comply with the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Exec­utive Branch. Under these federal regulations, carriers are permitted to accept a gift worth $20 or less from a customer per occasion, such as Christmas.

I naturally gave a warning that he needs to either calm down or leave, or I can make him leave. Que screams of freedom of speech im a liberal blah blah. Then shockingly he took a swing at me. I just stared a couple seconds before sighing and forcing his arms behind his back and forcing him to walk out the door.

Told him that I will be calling the local police (since its policy and I have too) and forced him to the ground and held him there while I called. He'll be spending a day behind bars.",08Nov2020,1

102,"So, yeah...I really REALLY loved Harry Potter. Was a proud Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff, watched all the movies and remember all the books in English and Spanish. 

Harry Potter was the first book in English I ever had, and it got me to read in a other language. Mom gave me all the books so there is that emotional part of them being mom's gifts. Now that mom is gone I kinda kept them because they remind me of her.

...But these last years, with what JK Rowling has been doing and saying, I just can't even look at content around Harry Potter anymore.
I just feel...jaded? Lost, angry, resentful, hurt because a childhood memory is tainted and I can't even properly come to terms that YES, DEATH OF THE AUTHOR IS A THING.

It is mine to do as I please and screw JK Rowling...but, as an artist myself, I realize I can't. Her work is her work, the work of some nefarious being in my opinion but still hers. How to kill the author and enjoy the work? I can't really detach them from each other, in my mind they are together.

So, I'm actually a bit at a loss here.
It been now, two years? Since I have even touched my books. I miss doing a re-read 
I miss laughing at Harry Potter jokes.
I did like Ravenclaw and actually had some merch. Hell, even made some myself!

103,"Regardless of what you think of Trump, you have to admit that society is a lot more polarized. Everything is the other side's fault, and people from one side are lumped into one big ""undesirable"" category by the other. I've seen friendships be destroyed just because of which candidate someone supports, or which side someone takes on a particular issue.

Every Biden, Trump, Clinton, Bernie, or Jorgensen supporter, every Democrat, Republican, Independent, pro-choicer, pro-lifer, gun-lover, and gun-hater is a human being. Every one of them is more than their politics beliefs. I don't understand how people can end friendships just because of a few political views (there are, of course, exceptions, like when someone only talks about X candidate or Y issue). Why can't we focus on what we do agree on, or a shared interest? There's no need to bring up politics in every conversation. You don't need to agree on everything or even most things. If you're saying that everybody on the other side of the political spectrum is a misinformed idiot, take a careful look at the people of your own side. 

Personally, I think that social media is a huge factor now, allowing people to live in their own reality. I suspected this before, but The Social Dilemma really convinced me, and I've noticed that the most partisan of my own friends are the ones who spend lots of time on SM. Please comment any other theories of why this is happening.

In the Obama and Bush years, I feel like we could talk to people we disagreed with without politics ever being brought up, or have a more civil discussion if it were brought up. I certainly don't know of many stories of people cutting ties with a family member or friend for supporting a candidate in 2004 or 2008 or 2012.

And please, no comments about ""Liberals/conservatives are all in a hivemind!!!!"". MOST people aren't super informed about issues and politics, and hiveminds have always existed on every side. I don't see why it has to be such a huge issue now. And if you accuse one side of being a hivemind, but all of your friends agree with you, are you not in a hivemind too?

Above all, I want this huge middle-ground to be refilled. Regardless of who's president or governor, I just want to be able to go about my daily life without hearing someone talk about how much they hate people who disagree with them politically. 

Try to make some friends on the other side! Talk to them. If politics comes up, don't be accusatory. Be curious, not condescending! Talk about other things! Surely you have some shared interests. There's no need for this polarization. It wasn't this bad before. It doesn't have to be this bad. Can we please try to agree to disagree and move on?",08Nov2020,1
104,"Short version: I'm 28, virgin, never kissed and think about sex all the time. My libido is sky high and it annoys me to absolutely no end. I'm not in a position to find someone right now, even before the pandemic, and I won't be before another year at least.

Until then, I think about sex and physical intimacy. I masturbate immediately to get rid of the thoughts bu they creep back a few hours later. It's like I can't get through the day without wasting half of it thinking about something out of reach.

110,"About a year and a half ago my last relationship ended, it was a rough breakup. My first love, so it goes. I spent the time until now just working on myself and focusing on what I could do better in a relationship and who I could strive to be outside of a romantic relationship. 

I tend to keep to myself for the most part. I’ve always been very reserved when it came to speaking what was going on in my head. Making new friends has always been a very stressful situation for me. I never know what to say or how to word certain thoughts when asked very in deep questions or for advice. I’ve been friends with the same 3 people since graduating high school, close to 5 years now. 

There was this girl I had my eyes on back then, and every year she would just get prettier and prettier to me, and we would talk every now and again just shooting the shit because we had classes together. I never took my shot then because I was a kid with no job/car/ no idea of the type of person I wanted to be. I felt like without having the third thing that I had nothing to really offer to the girl of my dreams. Lo and behold a couple weeks ago she had actually PM’d me on Facebook right before I was going to delete the app and account entirely!

I was at work at the time she had messaged me. I couldn’t get around to responding until a few hours later and when I did I ended up not getting a message back I all the hope I had went away... but a few weeks later I get a message back, and I learned from the last time so bolted to the bathroom to talk to her. We talked for a few minutes before she stopped messaging again for a few hours. Towards the end of my shift I was invited to go out with some coworkers, one of them knew how I felt about this girl and told me to ask her to tag along. I had never even thought that it would work, but he was right. I asked if she was free and if she would like to come with me, and she ended saying she wasn’t sure if she would be free because it was last minute, but if she was she would like to. She wasn’t able to make it. OH MAN WAS I FREAKING OUT! At the time I was already a ball of stress even taking the chance to ask her, but then to be told she wasn’t going to make it. Oh that made me feel like she just wasn’t interested really. Some of her messages had given me the feeling that she was just being dry and short, but I have no idea what’s going on in her day to day or how busy she is.

Skip to about two days ago, we’ve been messaging back and forth when we can, I gave her my phone number and we started texting a bit. I felt like I was back in high school all over again doing projects with her. I told myself if I didn’t act fast I would miss out, just like I did back then. The perfect situation arose, with me not deleting Facebook because she messaged me, she shared a date idea that she said would be really fun (Barnes and noble starting to sell alcohol and food and just browsing the aisles looking for books to eventually get to)! I took the time on my break at work to check and see if it was legit, it was! Sadly starting on the east coast, and us living on the west, I googled to see if there was a place like that in our city. There was one! JUST ONE! Oh my god, a smile stretched across my face, I saved the links and typed out a message to her asking her out once again. This time receiving an automatic “Yes, that sounds like so much fun!”

The whole day leading up to our date I was watching the clock. Every time the clock got an hour closer my stomach would roll. I can say that this was the most nervous for a date I have ever been out of the few relationships I have had. Come time to leave I do one last look in the mirror and hop in my car to pick her up. I FaceTimed my friend talking about how nervous I was and he calmed me down a lot and just told me to be myself and gave me the reassurance I needed until I got to her apartment. Get out of my car a few minutes before I’m supposed to actually meet to make sure I know where I’m going and get to her door and knock. After what felt like months went by before the door opened. We get in the car and I just started talking to break the silence. Like I said before I’m not good with putting myself out there, so I looked up some handy dandy ice breaker questions and had her laughing the whole way to the bookstore! We looked around for a bit before deciding to go sit down and get some alcohol to calm our nerves. We got the same drink and it was delicious (dragonfruit mimosa, we got it because of the name “The Girl With The Dragonfruit Tattoo”). I came prepared to the date, I had no idea what to talk about or how to build a relationship with somebody I’m practically meeting all over again. I bought a card game called “We’re Not Really Strangers” which I highly recommend for getting to know people in your life, new or old. We played through every card and ended up crying at some questions they asked. We explained what we had been up to the past 6-7 years of not talking, and then got up to go browse books and hang out a bit more. I explained how stressed out I was before the date and she told me multiple times throughout she was having a good time and thanking me for asking her out. She told me she canceled plans to go out with me! 

We ended up getting kicked out because we accidentally stayed 30 min past the time they close. We left laughing and apologizing to the workers, and got in the car and just listened to music the whole way back home. 

I walked her to her unit and her friend was standing outside waiting for her. She let her in and explained to me that she had invited her over to have drinks and talk about how much fun she had on the date. We said goodbye, hugged, and when I was backing away to leave she held me there for a second and asked if she could kiss me! What the hell just happened?! I walked to car so happy and just drove home in silence with a smile on my face. Euphoric was probably the best word to explain the drive home.

I’m beyond proud of myself for taking the jump and asking her out. I think it’s safe to say that there will be more dates with the girl of my dreams. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

TLDR: I asked out the girl of my dreams, girl said yes. Went on date, stayed till after close talking. Drove home, got to kiss her, life is good.

111,"I can’t put all the blame on my stupid decision, but it all leads back to it.

I had gastric bypass surgery at 18 because I was tired of being a joke, tired of being the fat girl, tired of boys only talking to me so they could win a bet or make jokes about me, and I was so naive to believe it would solve most of my problems. See, my mom had it years before I had and she got so much better afterword, and she became much more happy and men find her attractive and people didn’t look down on her once she reached her weight goal. 

But for me, my decision to follow ruined my life. 

After surgery, my family ate in front of me in my recovery room. I wasn’t even alllwed ice chips and all I wanted was water so bad. Once I was able to return home, I couldn’t keep liquids down (you’re required to be on a liquid diet for some time) and threw up every broth I tried and the a month into it I couldnt even drink water without vomitting. My mom called me a drama queen, she thought I was pretending to be sick because they got to eat solids and I couldn’t. Another few weeks passed and I was debydrated and starving and couldn’t get out of bed; my mom finally called the surgeon and got me in. I was close to starvation.

My new stomach had closed. It kept closing for the first year and I was constantly in the hospital getting it blown open with a literal balloon (it was thick and green); I would be okay for a few days and it would close again; this happened 4-5 times, I can’t remember because this was back in 2011...that entire year is a blur, I just remember being in the hospital hoping I would die every time they stuck that balloon down my throat. Finally, the last time I had it blown open, I was forced to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks to see if it would close again, and when it finally stuck, I got excited and thought my dreams would finally be fulfilled.

My dreams because just dreams again. Almost immediate afte, I began developing this horribly painful pains in my back and neck and the entire left side of my body. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia...learning that, the life I planned for myself, the strict diet and exercising and plans for schooling all went down the drain, so I was stuck in my bed or in the hospital in constant pain. I took so many vitamins and did physical therapy (through the burning and ripping like pain and throbbing in my left side) to gain strength and get rid of the extra skin, but it all was for nothing. God...my body is just...I can’t look at myself naked without wanting to cry. I look and feel worse than I did when I was close to 300LBS. My mental illnesses have gotten worse, I still wear my fat girl clothes because of my loose skin. I’m 28 now and I really  thought I’d have a college degree, thought I’d meet a man who found me attractive and didn’t date me as a bet or a joke, and thought maybe I’ve be married and planning to have a child.
None of that will more than likely ever happen. I don’t know even know how to talk to people face to face.

And, Jesus Christ, I tried so damn hard. I forced myself to workout and tried to be optimistic and tried to embrace this gross thing that is my body, but I just can’t. I hate how much I couldn’t work harder to even be semi decent looking. I mean, I’m not smart, not good at anything, I don’t have friends, I can’t work, I don’t know how and can’t cook with how bad my legs and knees are, I’m not funny, I’m not anything other than a burden. I can’t work now because my bones are so weak, despite the abundance of vitamins I take and the exercises I do. I’m in constant pain and no doctor believes me; I’m looked at as a young millennial who doesn’t feel like working and want pain medication (and I know this so I never ever ever ask for anything to relieve my pain, because I know I’ll be denied). All the medical professionals I have seen make me feel like I’m faking or that I deserved all this pain for taking the easy way out to losing weight. 

And the jealousy I feel towards my sisters who seem to have nothing but good luck. Especially my little sister who treated me like garbage after I took care of her when her legs gave out and she couldn’t walk for a year. My family, who she would verbally and physically abuse, supported her when she was a coke addict and alcoholic. My mom taught her how to drive and when I would ask, my family would laugh at me and ask me “Where would you even go?” So I rely on rides from my mom when she has time because everyone seems to need her, which leaves me at home, and I’ve grown accustomed to just staying in my room waiting to die.
My older sister, who I admire and love, has the most amazing and envious life. She has a great job and she has a super nice house and an awesome and funny boyfriend who fits in our family perfectly. She has 2 older boys with a deadbeat, and she’s doing better than he expected her to; and now she’s pregnant with a little girl. All I can feel is disgusting jealousy. I didn’t even go to her gender reveal party yesterday due to to my stupid sadness that she’s a baby with a fantastic partner and that’s all I ever wanted. I’m so beyond happy and so so so proud of her, I’m just childish and jealous and can’t get over it.

All of my petty jealousy and anger over a dumb decision I made at 18 because I thought it would be a great tool to help me become more social and finally find a friend or go on my first date and hold hands with a man who thought of me as a person with feelings and not a bet. My sisters are living the lives I wish I had even a fraction of. I’ll probably never know what it’s like to get my license, drive my own car that I paid for, go into work and make my own money again, rent my own home and have my own place where I’m not anxious all the time. I’ll more than likely never experience my first real kiss (one that wasn’t one forced on me as a child by my rapist), I’ll never feel a loving hug or my hand being held, never fall in love with someone who’s in love with me too, or planning a wedding, and then planning future children’s names.

My mom and family tell me I’m too old for anything that and I need to focus on how I’m going to make money since I can’t work and my filing for disability will probably take more than 9 months (I’ll probably be denied again, so I’m not even bothered with that). I really wish I had just stayed the fat girl, at least I’d know why men don’t want me and be okay with knowing my out of control eating ruined my chances at being more than an insignificant burden on my family.

Republicans call out the Democratic hypocrisy while being almost absurdly aloof of their own. 

“Quit rubbing it in. Calling people losers is disrespectful.”

“There definitely wasn’t fraud in 2016 but now there is.”

Republicans are nothing but whiny children who can’t make a good argument to save their lives. Their entire platform is calling out democrats for the same shit they do and nothing else.

Democrats on the other hand don’t deliver a damn thing they promise. They’re all lip service. Just look at all of their “attempts” to stop Trump.

They act so smug about taking the high road and then just waste what little power they have.

When you have these two parties as our only options you stop building any sort of rapport and just turn to fear-mongering about the “other side”.

I can accept not being allowed time off or vacations, I can accept shit pay (lowest paid person in the entire mall), I can accept working six 8 hour days a week, but I cannot accept putting other people in danger. Not sure if I'm gonna call and resign or let them fire me, I've only worked there a month so I guess it doesn't really matter. I actually kinda liked the job, and I didn't mind working.

125,"We broke up in April. We have a 2 year old child. We had a home together. We wanted to be a family.

Now im broken inside. We broke apart. My dreams are crushed. I tried it so many times since April. Sometimes we had great time together again. We were fooling around like its our first date. Now she dates another guy. It hurts. It hurts a lot. I helped her with everything, even after the break up. I wanted to show my support to her. How much she means to me. That i would do anything for her. But shes already on the next step. Forgetting me. Forgetting the years we spend together. 

Now im sitting in my new apartement. Thinking about her. Feeling horrible. 

I dont want the new guy to be the Dad of my child. Im the Dad of my wonderful child. I love her more than everything.

I also want to forget. But i cant. I love her. I proposed to her. Married her. Supported her in everything.

How do I forget? When does this pain end?

Today I said to myself: ""From now on, I will light this candle every evening, watching it slowly burning down. And the time its completely gone, I will move on. I will stay strong. For me. For my child. For my parents. For my friends.""

Is this possible? Will I be able to do it? I dont know.

We can’t even reproduce with other tribes. These are all efforts to weaken our genes and eliminate Native people, and these views invalidate those who are mixed. 

I thought the statement was an attack on MY appearance, on MY personal cultural expressions, but it’s an attack on all Native people. It’s genocidal.

133,"This is probably going to take a bit to type out because my thoughts are just everywhere and it's hard to word them.

I'm AFAB but, I'd say most of the time, I don't like it. I don't like my girl-pitched voice. A lot of the time when I speak, I think ""I don't like my voice"" or I think about how I'd like it to be deeper. I sometimes try to speak in a deeper voice but it's always higher than what I hear in my head and makes me sound/look weird. 

I don't like my frame- I've always wanted a more masculine, rectangular frame, and knowing there's pretty much no chance I'll ever get to 6foot or anything makes me sad.

I don't like being told to act 'ladylike' and I hate women's clothes because they all look either revealing or form-fitting. I like baggy, masculine clothes, 

I have a love/hate relationship with my hair. I always wear it up, I guess to make it feel/appear shorter but I would be too scared to cut it off. I don't think I'd suit it short and I'm a rather anxious person. Changing it would probably draw too much attention to me, and I'd hate it more if I hated the cut.

And of course, I hate sexism. I don't really get any sexism directly targeted at me but seeing it happen hurts. All the 'make me a sandwich' type of jokes annoy me, even if they're jokes. Or the fact that places view females as less, or dumb really pisses me off. 

All 'famous' people I look up to are male. I want to be like them but I always think I'll never quite get there. I know a lot of it is personality but gender's there too (In my opinion). 

Being an anxious person, I don't know if I could face changing myself or identifying as something new, but I don't like being female. I always think my life would be the same (Minus the dysphoria, if that's what it is (?)) or better if I were male. I feel I would have more confidence. But on the other hand, I would probably always be thinking about how I wasn't always male and that would mess with me.

It's a bit like being stuck in an endless loop. I could carry on female, not liking it 100%, but trying to make things better for others/proving females could be as good as males in things like youtube (gaming etc) (I forgot to say I sort of want to do youtube, even as a side thing but, idk)

People have told me ""F\*\*k what everyone else thinks, wear what you want, act how you want"" etc. And that's a good message and all but deep down, I'd still feel the same as I do now.

I don't know. My thoughts are rather all over the place. Maybe in time, I'll have a more certain idea.",08Nov2020,1

141,"This will sound perverse and rotten to most of you I imagine but to be honest I enjoy torturing myself mentally inducing negative emotions like shame, embarrassment, guilt, frustration and longing. 

I think this is partially because the idea of not being self-aware of my faults terrifies me and I never want to forget them (so that if/when someone else points them out it won’t be a surprise to me). But the other maybe larger part is that I’m becoming addicted to the emotional intensity, and negative emotions are as good as positive ones in satisfying that craving. 

This isn’t an excuse, and I know I’m capable of changing, but I’m finding it difficult mostly because I don’t really want to stop. But part of me does. The main reason I want to stop is for the sake of others around me, and for the sake of other people’s perception of me.

They really don’t? I thought they did. Isn’t that the most disappointing thing. You are alone. You are utterly and absolutely, savagely alone.

Would anyone care if you would just step outside right now and just do whatever the fuck you want?

The burst of light followed by a sound of danger.

As the breeze blows it away softly and the ambulance cries, the dark luring in the back looks tempting as ever. The darkest part, right in the middle.

I passed well got a government loan/scholarship to study in another country, this was a great gig u had going here. Like nice university, pretty good course like all I had to do was fucking pass and maybe I'd be really better off. The corona situation happened...

153," I'm 16, my uncle passed away today of a heart attack, and I really didn't feel anything. I didn't even bother going to my grandmas house with everybody because I would feel super awkward being the only one not crying or showing any emotion. The same thing happened when my grandpa passed away last year, I didn't cry or feel much emotion, I just distanced myself so I didn't seem like an insensitive asshole. I'm not trying to be edgy by sharing this, but I've seen a few pretty graphic gore videos as well and they didn't really have an effect on me. As long as the person didn't suffer and the death was quick it didn't bother me. Now obviously I don't go searching for gore in my free time, but when I accidentally saw these clips or was shown them by someone at school, I was fine with them.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that death doesn't seem to bother me.

155,"I don’t know where to start with this one..guess I’ll preface by saying I don’t want to give myself “victim-status” by mentioning anything about depression. I’m the type of person to roll my eyes when someone tells me they’re dealing with depression. 

I tell myself “how can you be depressed, it isn’t that hard. Take care of yourself, do something that makes you happy, and live happily ever after.”

Only, I’m finding that my once creative, positive, and ambitious mentality is slowly being replaced by dull, repetitive thoughts, and might I add, actions.


I’m a barely 21 y/o male, living alone in my studio in Denver. I used to have a girlfriend, but we aren’t together anymore. And recently we started reconnecting, only to once again dry up and get mad at each other for silly things. Clearly, not working out and won’t. Just dealing with that emotional burden. 


For a long time I’ve envisioned a life for myself along the merits of financial stability. This would take shape in the form of successful entrepreneurship.


But some days, arguably most, it’s like I don’t care anymore. Like I’ve submitted to the idea that the rest of my life will consist of living paycheck to paycheck, coming home and playing video games, thinking about how great a relationship with my ex could’ve been. 


I don’t want that for myself. I always saw myself as “one of those guys” who could afford nice sports cars, and have a million dollar home, and a cute wife and kids. But more importantly, I see myself as a visionary and pioneer of future innovation. These are my aspirations.


You may think to yourself..”this guy is very young, he has all the time in the world..”, but I deem that problematic for a couple reasons.

Namely, I see those, perhaps “average folks”, who likely work their mundane jobs, come home to a mundane or unhealthy family / relationship dynamic, and carry on a vigorously unchanging routine. This is how it starts. Complacency. The same thing..day in..and day out.


And further, the idea that I could be among the few financially “set” young 20 year olds is very appealing. It always has been. It’s like my shot at being top of my class since I wasn’t in school. 


Don’t get it twisted - this isn’t about materialism. It’s about proving to myself I am what I thought I could be. 


Considering this, I feel unable to move forward. I feel unable to do anything, other than go to work, play video games, think about my ex, and masturbate. Occasionally I’ll go hang out with my buddies. 


How do I break from these chains? Yesterday I bought a toolkit for phone and computer repairs. It’s interesting to me, so I thought it would get my creativity and drive back...but I find myself putting it off. What the hell is wrong with me?


Tl;dr - What immediate actions can I take to overcome my complacency? I smoke weed once or twice a day, I hardly eat anything nutritious, let alone consistently. There’s a lot of factors, such as a recent break up I’m going through, financial stress, few outlets. I feel depressed.",08Nov2020,1

My entire life has only revolved around school and academics, and I never really fully lived out my “teenage years”, and now I’m in a situation where I don’t really have any close friends or memories and feel quite lonely. Also my school is very competitive and academically focused which has just made things worse as I’m feeling really overwhelmed and burnt out by everything right now, and it’s making me not want to do anything at all. I stay at school daily until 6 to get my work done, come home eat dinner and usually chill until I go to sleep. 

I’ve found myself getting progressively more and more lazy, not wanting to do anything and just spending the free time I do have in bed or on my phone or procrastinating work and I guess not really having people to call up or to go out with (even though covid has made that impossible anyway lol) is just making it worse. I also struggle to talk to people at school too which makes me dread going in.

161,"I’m one of these people. And I would love for someone to actually ask me these things. I get friends and family praising me that they are so proud how well I’m doing, how far I’ve come (you can read my story below). They always ask me for advice and know I’ll be there for them no matter what (I actually dedicate a good hour a day checking on friends and family and also people I haven’t heard from in a while) I know my husband is struggling with not working and covid lockdown so I’m always trying to make sure he is okay. And making sure my daughters mental health is okay with the pandemic too. 

Personally- I’ve got so much to do and have no motivation. It’s getting worse everyday.  

I am not sad. I don’t think it’s depression. I feel happy. I love my life. I just have no drive. I feel anxious. Overwhelmed. I don’t want to feel like this. I don’t even know who to turn to. I had therapy for a while but can’t do it in the pandemic. 

On the surface I am a young mom to a 13 year old daughter, I have my own three businesses, energetic, I homeschool my child, I live in a nice city. I have a nice circle of friends there and also back in my home country. All my family and friends are healthy. I have a loving husband. My rent isn’t high. My businesses are slow at the moment because of covid but are starting to pick up again. I don’t care about money anyway as long as I have enough to feed us and live. 


I’ve been through a lot in my life (survived escaping a religious controlled marriage, survived my ex husband trying to murder myself and my daughter, survived an abusive relationship from someone who made me believe he was saving me from my husband) a decade later I’ve come out the other end. I made a life for my child and I. We travelled. We grew. We flourished. I started my own businesses while being a single mama. We live in a wonderful city across the globe now and I’m remarried to an amazing honest man who would do anything for us. I don’t have to be scared of my exes anymore. I survived. 

I’ve never once complained or played the victim to what happened to me. I would dust off, and get on with it. I had to show my daughter we could be survivors not victims. I would not let those people ruin our lives. I showed her resilience. She has turned out as best as I could hope so far so it was worth it. We have an almost 95% great relationship (realistically the other 5% is pure teenage hell and I would give to the nearest person walking by if I could in those times haha) 

I am actually a very optimistic person and people are drawn to that. I feel happiness. I am all about love and I don’t need material things in my life. I get off on hugging my family and getting affection. Gummy bears make me million times happier than diamonds. People see all this and see what I went through and think wow she is doing great!! And how can I get through things like her? And then to me for advice and know I will always be there for them (because I will I love them and want them to be okay!!!) they will ask how I am but in a general way like how’s life? How’s hubby and kids blah blah but they aren’t asking like R U OK type vibe 

I have one friend who asks me how I really am. And she is the biggest sweetheart who has a shit show of her own life and I just can’t bog her down anymore with my worries. She is one person i will go above and beyond to look after over me because she is so genuine. 

Everyone else either doesn’t care or doesn’t notice or think to reach out to me because they don’t think I need it. 

Can reddit be my support right now? I’m feeling terrible today and only got up just before to eat. I’m all smiling faces for my daughter and husband who have their own thing going on but literally just their voices are irritating me today.  Nothing to do with them. It’s on me. Please give me some advice. Some thoughts. Motivation tips. 

I should add Im also sick and they don’t know what’s going on so I can’t worry people about it especially most of my friends and family live across the globe and can’t come and see me anyway and it will just worry them. I am seeing a neurologist to try get test results to find out what’s going on (I keep having these stroke like episodes that can last 2 mins or 3 hours where I can’t move or respond but inside I’m awake) I’ve lost 10 pounds in 3 weeks and now I’m under weight. I can’t eat like I used to. I am sleeping fine. But never feels like enough. 

I just stay in bed and it takes me 2 hours to even get up and get moving then suddenly I get a burst of energy and want to EVERYTHING and feel motivation and then start doing stuff and it stops after a couple hours and I’m left with a million half finished things and my lost growing and then I get anxiety over not getting stuff done. It’s getting worse everyday. I’m not balancing things. I give my self some alone time for half an hour a day but I go outside to do this and it’s going to get too cold soon. Social media also makes me feel sick and sad so I’m avoiding that but I need to use it for work. 

Basically I get these pangs every half hour of anxiety in my head when I think of my lists and to do things and how I’m not doing squat. Like time is short and is going to run out really soon!! 

I am being retested for ADHD as I’m on a minimal low dose that does nothing anyway. I don’t think that’s it. I’ve had that my whole life. 

I miss my family and friends. I’m worried I’m dying. I would never ever do anything to hurt my self it’s not about that. I mean sickness way. I won’t get to see them for another year at least (2 all up)
My body is tired. Achy. I am trying to do things to help. SAD lights, tai chi, eating healthier. Water. LED lights. 

But I also have so many things I want to do. I am trying to balance my businesses and grow them (and if I just had more energy I think I could do well with it - I’m literally the only thing stopping them growing) I could be doing better with homeschooling. I have a lot of free time. I am at home most days and nights. Only see friends twice a week in my bubble. Time isn’t a factor. I beat my self up daily that I didn’t utilize the time to work more, exercise more, learn more, get this job done. Instead I take two hours to print something 

I can’t do online therapy as we live in a small place - no privacy and I can’t risk going in. This would be helping me right now. I love therapy. 

Thankyou for listening to me. I wrote so much I’m sorry! But it felt good to get it down on paper without burdening any of my family and friends right now who would just worry.",08Nov2020,1
164,"I am currently 21. 

My life has moved so slow for sense the start and ever sense Covid started up...my life had ground to a stop. Well things are kicking up again and my life is gaining speed again.   
I enjoy being an adult very very much but I am starting to become overwhelmed...with the world events going on in the US.....im just so sick of being in fear that my tiny dreams will be held back even father....  
I should have gotten my first car when I was 17 like everyone else...but here I am...21 and just starting to learn to drive.   
I should have gotten my first skiff boat when I was like 15 like a proper fucking caption....but its going to be even longer before I can get one.   
These dreams are just so small, why are they so hard to achieve?...",08Nov2020,1
165,"I graduated with a master's in Social Work. I follow many of them on instagram and other social media. I am planning to leave this field because it has traumatized me. I am a light skinned girl but from India. So I am not a white nor a Black girl. However, I am targetted for being light skinned and ugly. If I have conservative values, thats how I grew up. I am forced to change things about myself. If I am happy being light skinned and conservative, why do the social workers want me to change. Socia workers should learn how to balance things out. Just because you are not beautiful and not light skinned why take out the anger and revenge on others. I find dark skinned people good looking and have never asked them to be light skinned, infact have been in relationship where my boyfriend was dark skinned. If people who are light skinned allowing you to any color you want to why are you telling me to change my color and tell me that I'm ugly etc.....Everyone has rights and can do or say what they want. Why are social workers being biased and favoring who are dark skinned and not light skinned people even if they are not ""White"". Why so much of one sidedness. ""Social workers and social activist are diving America"" They have a problem with everything. WHy spread so much hate? Guys if you have mental health problems see a psychologist/psychiatrist or go to a church or temple but not to a social worker. America is getting complicated and valueless every day because of the social workers.",08Nov2020,1
