4,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

I’m 6ft tall and thin and lanky and she’s very pretty tbh",28Aug2020,1
5,"I'm pretty sure a lot of people who've experienced the other side of my situation will tell me that it's actually quite chill to sleep alone, but it's getting pretty old by now, and it really gets to me. It's especially bad after meeting my friends and knowing none of them will be alone during the night, while I just browse through my phone listening to music until I'm tired enough not to think about this stuff anymore. 

Anybody in a similar situation and looking to vent about it a bit?",28Aug2020,1
6,"We used to consider kids getting sick and getting over colds / viruses as a good thing, ""building up their immune system"" for later in life - at least this is what I was always brought up to believe. I'm not sure of the scientific validity of that. As such, I was wondering if any smarter folks out there could chime in - will keeping kids inside and distanced, etc. cause them to have a weaker immune system or will this not really be an issue?

P.S. I am in no way advocating for anything but safety - we need to keep our kids safe from COVID. Social distance, wear a mask whenever your around other people, WASH YOUR HANDS and please just use common sense everyone and we can hopefully be back to normal quicker than later. Thank you.",28Aug2020,1
7,"I've been dealing with a lot of people on Reddit that are sanctimonious. A fancy term intended to upset the educated Urbanite.

It basically means the following,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Sanctimonious:** Deep down your belief is correct and anyone who disagrees is hateful pi\*ce of sh\*t, homophobe, xenophobe and other Ad Hominem attacks.



If you call me a terrible person, sh\*tty person, xenophobe, homophobe, and other non-sense. You just met another wording for Sanctimonious. I'm a piece of sh\*t and your a saint. I get it....",28Aug2020,1

10,"I have to catch myself creating these scenes in my head, emotional ones, ones that include close loved ones, Sometimes i have to tell myself it never happened because in the moments it feels so real and i have all the emotions i would have in the situation. i have no clue what it means or if anyone else has this.",28Aug2020,1
11,"I'm 58 and have been divorced five years. I was married for 22 years and have three great young adult children with my ex husband. He and I get along very well.

I won't go into a whole lot of detail about what narcissistic abuse is in general because there is a lot of information online and there are sub Reddits about it. What I will say is I lived with my ex boyfriend for 18 months, ending this spring. After the experience with him, for the first time ever, I developed trust issues with men. I told myself all men weren't like my ex but that I also needed to scale back my typical speedy approach to starting a new relationship. 

So I'm sharing now about how dating behaviors by men that I would have dismissed before are now setting off screeching alarms. Most recently, talking about how so much alike we are -- e.g. ""We're both metacognitive and self actualized."" That was from a man I only shared a couple of dating site messages with before I stopped replying.

The other behavior was more subtle. Had it not been for my experience with my ex, I probably would have sensed something was off but would not have seen it as an omen of doom like I did this time. 

In a nutshell: This man and I messaged a few times, then texted a few times, then talked by phone for a few long conversations and had a Zoom meetup. This occurred over a little less than two weeks. I made it clear up front that I was not going to spend lots of time texting, that when he wanted to get information from me or simply have a conversation, he'd need to call.  Yet, kindly, sweetly, nonchalantly, he kept trying to get me to tell him, by text, what days I'd be available for a live date this week. The last time he did it was a few days ago. I texted back playfully that I'd whisper the information in his ear by phone when he called me to get it.

That was the end of that. Haven't heard from him since.

At first, I felt a little down about it. I thought we had potential. But then I realized he had no regard for my clearly articulated boundary. As highly narcissistic people do, he tried to manipulate me into doing what was convenient for him -- text --  regardless of what I wanted. And he was sneaky about it, making it seem like he had no idea he was asking me to do something I said I would not do.

There is more to this cautionary tale but I'll leave with a summary of what I've said so far:

1. Beware of the total stranger who insinuates you two are psychic, spiritual, emotional, or some other kind of ""twins.""

2. Beware of the guy who tries to get you to do what you don't want to do, no matter how much he sugar coats his attempt to manipulate you -- because, in the beginning, he definitely will hide his intent to control you under syrupy sweetness. Not only that, he will display this behavior (being manipulative/exploitative) from the very start -- you just have to know what your'e looking at when you see it.",28Aug2020,1
12,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘this is brilliant news, very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",28Aug2020,1
13,"I love good maps, i look at it all the time and now I will enjoy looking at it even more.  The water is bluer and the greens are greener.  Best of all the vast majority of land outside of parkland is also a shade of green now rather than grey.  So now you can easily see where the cities and towns limits are without having to click them.

Yeah I am a map nerd, you got a problem with that?",28Aug2020,1
14,"I (22F) am currently pregnant with my and my fiancé’s (24M) second baby. We lived in a single wide mobile home far south Lake Charles with our baby boy who turned 1 August 20. When hurricane Laura was forming we decided to get out of dodge and evacuate to Texas. We had to leave almost everything except a few days worth of clothes, diapers/wipes for the baby and important documents. We woke up this morning to news that our home flipped completely over. The storm ripped it out of the ground and flipped it. The awning we had is currently folded in pieces in the ditch in front of our home. This hurts. I’m due in December and currently in college (the school is highly damaged as well). I have no idea what we’re going to do. We have house insurance but we have no idea what they’re going to cover. This all feels surreal and I’m so numb to the photos right now. Has anyone ever been through something like this? What would be our next step?",28Aug2020,1

18,"Me and a friend were planning on going to IKEA together after work yesterday, but she flaked  last minute. I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to it, but I also get it. She's got a long commute and I've done that before, I understand how it wears you out. But I would've rather not found out she apparently adapted in the span of 24 hours. Hard to avoid thinking that I'm part of the equation and she'll make time for some that she won't make for me.   
  
(Also I really like breweries and I'm jealous.)   
  
This incident is affecting me a lot and I hate it. Somebody else living their life shouldn't dampen mine. But I'm really lonely right now; I just graduated college and while I am lucky to have a job, I started out WFH and we're staying remote until at least the end of the year, so I'm not getting much/any socialization there. Nearly all of my friends have moved away too. I'll go weeks without talking to somebody in person, which is part of the reason why this flake is hitting me so hard; I just wanted to talk to somebody without a damn screen and network connection in the way. Video chat sucks and I'm tiredly of society collectively pretending it doesn't.   
  
Also I have a huge crush on this girl. So that's just gasoline on this mental health fire. Nobody likes receiving evidence that your crush isn't nearly as into you are you are into them. I'm trying to get over her, but it's hard to do when there aren't many other people in your life, ya know? Thanks COVID   
  
I guess my point is that this minor incident has shown me how shitty my mental state has gotten. I shouldn't be thinking much of it at all, shouldn't even be classifying it as an ""incident"" because it's not. Making a reddit post about it? oof   
  
I've never had issues with depression before, but I'm worried something might be developing. I haven't really been able to focus on much outside of work lately, definitely haven't been enjoying myself in my free time. I've been going to bed increasingly early too. Not so I can get up earlier, just because I don't care to stay awake any longer. I hope this is a temporary phase and doesn't turn into something bad.  
 
EDIT: Well that was a lot longer than expected. Read it or don't, I don't care. Just wanted to get it off my chest",28Aug2020,1

20,"when i was younger (7 or 8 maybe younger) my mom's friend would bring her son over (who was a year older than me) frequently. he would hit my brother and bully both of us in general but we were still friends most of the time. 

i have multiple weird memories surrounding him that are foggy if that makes sense. here's some examples:

-he used to try and get us both alone and say we should kiss (i dont remember if we ever did i just remember always trying to leave and being uncomfortable)

-he locked me in a room and blocked the door and wouldnt let me leave until i took my clothes off even though i was crying. i feel like i remember him holding me down (this ones very foggy) i know i was super uncomfortable

-after that happened i told my older sister and her friend that the boy had touched me and they yelled at me for lying. i was so embarassed about getting yelled at by my older sister that i never brought it up again. i just dont know why i would say that and have that memory if it didnt happen? maybe im in denial about it?

-i hated this kid for years and could never really explain why 

-my mom has also asked if i was molested as a child by him 

-i used to touch myself at like age 8 which ive read is a sign of childhood sexual abuse",28Aug2020,1
21,"This is just a brief, pointless, post-cleaning ramble, because man, I am in a great mood.

A year ago, I quit my job and left my state to move in with someone way too early in the relationship. We had been friends for years and finally figured out how we felt, but we both still had some emotional baggage to deal with, and we were too hasty. I moved back in with my folks and we broke up. It was pretty devastating.

Afterwards, I spiraled into a deep depression that lasted until basically a month ago. I never bothered to move all the boxes of miscellaneous belongings out of my car from the move. Never really bothered to clean my car much either, inside or out. I had a ton of fast food wrappers, beer bottles, and moldy lunches amongst the boxes and under the seats. I just did not care. (I never drove drunk, I’d just sometimes sit in my car to be alone, or had one on long lunch breaks. It’s hard to find alone time when you live with your parents.)

Recently, things started looking up. I am working again, and I really like the work that I do. My mental health has improved a great deal. I’m making healthier choices, and thinking about my future as something to build towards instead of something that will just happen to me. I’ve reconnected with a number of old friends, and the ex from last summer? Neither of us ever really let go, and now we’re taking it slow, hoping to avoid the mistakes we made before. I am happy, and I feel healthy. 

So I cleaned out my car, because I’m going to see him tomorrow, and I feel like I finally let go of all that baggage. It feels SO FREAKING GOOD, even if it is just a small thing. Feels dumb, but I’m proud of myself.",28Aug2020,1

23,"As a child, I have always been very sensitive and emotional. I'd cry over anything, as ridiculous as it was. It has always been my coping mechanism for stress, and it always helped. I'd cry a little doing my math homework, thinking I couldn't finish it, and I was perfectly fine right after.

It's been a while since then. I don't cry as much anymore, and especially don't cry in front of anybody, no matter how close they are to me. I just swallow my crying, and go about my day.

I've had a terrible breakup recently, with my partner of almost a year. I loved him very much, but the relationship was completely one-sided. I bore the weight of the world on my back like fucking Atlas for somebody who wouldn't lift a rock for me. I changed myself completely for him; all he had to do was ask, and I'd push it to my limit to change. 

I didn't even shed a tear. It hurt terribly, don't get me wrong, but it couldn't drive me to tears. This lead me to notice I'm getting colder and colder overtime. I don't have a clue what is going on with me; it feels like I'm incapable of crying or laughing; the hiccups just get stuck in my throat, and won't come out. The tears decide to stay in, too.

This is bringing me many problems. I'm accumulating stress, and have no means of letting it all out. I'm scared I'll end up blowing up on someone sometime and say something stupid.

34,"Christians, as a group, are the most judgmental, hateful, and two-faced collection of people that has ever existed on this earth. They profess to follow a teaching that has as its second greatest command, second only to loving their God, to love everyone as they love themselves. The teaching, backed by a story that makes it clear that every other human being is your neighbor to whom this applies, to treat every other person's interests as equal to their own, if followed, would be characterized by selflessness, tolerance, and concern. They sing a song, ""They Will Know We Are Christians By Our Love"", that correlates being Christian with someone who shows so much love that they are recognized as members of a group that is supposed to be defined by this attribute. The only people I have seen most Christians consider to be their neighbor are other Christians; showing love only to their own kind in ultimate selfishness and hypocrisy. And for non-Christians? There is no tolerance and no concern, only judgment. How can so many members of a group with love as its only requirement be filled with so much hate?",28Aug2020,1
35,"As a black man in America, I’m tired. This country is not racist. The majority of its people are not racist and I don’t believe Donald Trump is a racist. That may seem random, but that’s my life.

I have a lot of family and friends that do not agree with me. The claim to be “Woke” They say it’s all over the news and social media. “How is that NOT racism!?” They get angry at me and look at me like I’ve lost my damn mind. 

I’ve experienced racism. In my pre-teen years, 20s and 30s. Both direct and indirect. Still, racism is not a major problem facing black Americans. I’ve been called a “nigger” I’ve been assumed to be a drug dealer while sitting in my parked car at a gas station while waiting for a friend. These things do not happen anywhere close to often. I have not lost any sleep or felt I needed to protest. I assume most racists to be very ignorant people with some type of learning deficit because in this day, how do you operate that way? 

Racism is not a major threat to the black community. 

I think of the days of slavery. The Jim Crow era south. The past 6 decades as a whole. Let’s say we didn’t have mainstream media shoving race down our throats. Would anyone in that time period walk through our world today and feel the same hate? I get so sick when I hear black Americans compare what’s going on today to what our ancestors went through.

So many black millionaires. We have black billionaires. In racist America. 

We will NEVER get over this hump until we start thinking for ourselves. In the past I was apart of the hive mind. The black American that voted blue because reds were racist. Trump ran for president, he’s the poster boy for racist whites in the south. How? To this day, people still bring up edited sound bites and clips from the campaign days and go “See, he said that! He’s racist” they don’t want to see the whole statement that contradicts their original thought. It’s too late. Fuck facts. Facts are long gone. It’s assumptions now. 

“Dr. Ben Carson is an Uncle Tom”
A legit brain surgeon!

Nancy Polosi kneels in African Garb in solidarity during George Floyd. Pandering like a MF

Kamala Harris’ family admits to being involved in slave trade. Says she’ll take your guns.

Joe Biden says “you ain’t black” if you don’t know whether or not to vote for him. WTF

“At least he’s not Trump. Can’t do another 4 years of that!” 

Of what!? Record low black unemployment? Huge drops in percentages of people on Government assistance and food stamps? 

“Police are racist and hunt us down!” Not even most!

“If he was white!...” 

“This doesn’t happen to white people...” it does. We have google. This isn’t hard folks.

330+ million Americans. 200+ million 911 calls made/year. Thousands of police interactions everyday. How many of us have actually witnessed an officer shoot someone? Ever actually see an officer brutalize a completely innocent citizen in front of your face? How about a guilty citizen? Very few officers ever pull their gun with the intention of shooting another human being. Yet we are made to believe this is happening at an alarming rate. That we as black people are being hunted down for no reason. 

“Voter ID restrictions are racist”

As a black man in a predominantly black neighborhood, it would be hard to find another black person without an ID. Even the. “Poor” black folk need ID to continue with social assistance. Even EBT Cards have pictures on them!

37,I feel unlucky all the time. I’m cursed with a horrible past that affected my life in the worst way. I had some serious tooth problems because of inadequate dental care overseas.

38,"If anyone makes a post about how covid has given them lot of financial issues, just be wary. I hate to say this, but I think we have some scammers here who are just taking advantage of people's generosity. 

I found one account who has been making these posts repeatedly. He just deletes older posts after a day or so, and then makes another post. I just posted a comment in his last post and he deleted the post immediately. I wasn't sure if I should report him to mods, but I just thought I'd warn you guys. I am not sure if I should just share the username here. 

I don't want you guys to stop being generous. I know that this is a difficult time for a lot of people, but it might be a good idea to do actually go through someone's profile and comment history before offering them some cash. That's all I'm saying.

42,"I feel like I'm a magnet for sexual abuse. At least I use to feel that way. Now that I'm an adult, I'm antisocial, I don't have many friends and I have a lot of mental health issues. This story is not for the faint of heart, I'm not seeking attention, this is an attempt of therapy. When I was little some of my first memories are of being molested by one of my grandpa's friends. I was maybe 4. I just remember him touching me inappropriately. My grandpa ended up looking under the table and seeing what was happening. He beat the living shit out of him and dragged him off the property. I never saw that man again. When I was around 10 or so my brother was taken away from us by his father. His father eventually let me come visit him after months of not seeing him. It was fine as first, until one night when my brother was asleep he made me play truth or dare. He dared me to kiss him. I wasn't at all comfortable with the idea. He said okay and said it was time to just go to bed since I was no fun and couldn't play along. I woke up to him covering my mouth with his hand and pulling my clothes off. I struggled and fought as much as I could. I eventually got tired, while he laughed he raped me. When he was done he said if I ever wanted to see my little brother again I would never say anything about it. He said he would make sure no one believed me.  The next day I tried sleeping in the same room as my brother. He came in while my brother was asleep and told me to suck his dick. I told him that I didn't want too. He pulled out a gun and said he would kill my brother if I did not. I cried and did as he asked. When I eventually went home I said nothing to anyone. He had my brother. I didn't know what to do. A few months later I ended up in foster care. Me and my youngest brother were together and my case worker eventually gained my trust. I talked to him about it. My hope was is that they could go get him and he could be with me too. So I would have both my brothers. But being young and knowing how nothing worked, there was no proof. They informed my brothers dad of what I was claiming and I never saw him again until he was an adult. I was in foster care for awhile. I was able to see how the other half lived. Foster parents had their own children, that they loved in a way I never experienced. My mother had chosen meth above all else. We had lived in so many houses, most without windows and doors, then once she scraped all the copper from that house we were off to the next. I took care of my brothers, I was their mom. I was my own mom. So seeing these kids loved and cared for grew in me a new hatred for my own mother. Anyways, eventually my grandmother took me and my youngest brother in, out of foster care, the older I got the less people wanted me to stay in their homes. I went back to living a shitty life, where no one cared about me. My grandma got tired of me, whether it was me writing lyrics on my bedroom walls, self mutilating myself to feel anything at all. Whatever the reason she had my mom come pick me up with a backpack of my things and she told me we were going on a trip. I was just starting high school at this point. We drove for hours. We came to this trailer park hours away from anyone I knew. She stops the truck and tells me I am going to be staying with my biological father. Someone I had only met once, right after he got out of prison for armed robbery. Now at this point, I wasnt surprised. I knew I wasn't wanted no matter where I went. My grandma had killed every pet I tried to have, and between her and my mother I had no self esteem to speak of. So My mother left with a huge bag of meth and I was left standing in front of a small RV with 3 people living inside. At first it was okay. I had family who took an interest in me. They were happy to meet me. I thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad. My dad and his girlfriend fought all the time. He ended up being abusive towards her. He was about 30 and she was around 60. She ended up going to the hospital for a long time. She had to have a quadruple bypass surgery on her heart. So she was gone for awhile. During this time my dad started acting weird towards me. Asking me if I had been having sex. Which I was 15 and considering my history it was the last thing I was ever interested in. I shrugged it off figured maybe he was trying to figure out how to be a dad. I use to sleep on the floor right next  to the couch in the RV. He slept on the couch. My great uncle slept on the other side of the RV which was the only actual bed in the whole thing. He started pulling my covers off. I slept in normal clothes. After a few days of him pulling my covers off he said he wanted to set up a tent and sleep out there. That he was depressed his girlfriend was still in the hospital and wanted to do something fun so I went along with it. We stayed out in the tent that night. His questions got weirder. I already knew where it was going but I was in denial. That night my father raped me. I didn't cry, I didn't scream, I didn't feel. My life was over. He eventually moved me out to a shed, that had a small window, not big enough to fit through. One door that locked on the outside. His girlfriend came back after she recovered and everything was fine for a few days. He would lock me in the shed and come in at night and rape me. He would anal rape me. I had been to the hospital with him right by my side for torn assholes and my throat would be swollen and black from bruising. It became a routine. I would roll his cigarettes every morning, make his coffee and his breakfast. And stay locked in the shed until his night visits. One night while he was visiting me, his girlfriend came in and freaked the fuck out. His immediately got up and kicked her so hard in the chest. She went flying, she hit the ground and was knocked out. He locked me back in and left. I don't know what he said to her, what was done, but the next day she left. Before she left she told me she was so sorry. I never saw her again. At this point I'm sure you are wondering why I didn't run. Why I didn't say anything to anyone. He used to make me fight him in the front yard. He beat my ass everyday. I'd black out, from the punches, from my muscles screaming that they were tired. He would threaten me daily. He beat me while he raped me. I have never been so scared of someone as I was him. His sister, my aunt eventually told me her jaw was metal from him beating her face in. He raped and beat his own brother. He did coke and drank daily. One night he said he was going to a party and locked me in the shed as usual. He told me to be ready to roll his cigarettes and get his bed together for when he got back. At this point he started sleeping in the shed with me. He had a computer in the shed, it was that aol shit. So when he wasn't around I would text old friends and see if they would come get me. They never helped. Well anyways, 2am roles around and he is still not back and I'm so tired. I eventually fall asleep, which is a big no no. That night he broke both my legs with a baseball bat. He laughed about it and passed out while I layed on the floor crying with bone sticking out of my leg. He left the door open though. Which now had an inside lock since he started sleeping in there. I pulled myself 15 feet or so to the RV and called my other uncle to come take me to the hospital. I didn't tell a soul what happened. I lied to the hospital, I lied to everyone. He would kill me. No matter where I went he would kill me. This went on for years. On my 17th birthday he put a machete to my throat,he cut my face, my neck and punched me until I was gone. I guess he was scared that I was getting older, I was getting better at fighting him. I was getting better at taking punches. He stopped letting me go to doctor's visits, I ended up getting pregnant. With that he ended up moving me out to the middle of nowhere, so no one would see it. This is where I started my plans. I promised him the world. I promised I would never leave. When I felt like he believed me, I talked to him about letting me finish school. Letting me go stay in my shed at my great uncles and finish school. I didn't have much left anyways. He agreed, I was so fucking surprised when he agreed. I went to school, I started skipping and met a guy. I didn't tell this guy I was pregnant. When we got close and I thought he was in love with me I told him my dad beat me and I needed to get out. I had nowhere to go. Do I feel bad I used this guy? Yes.  I don't regret it though. He and a friend of his drove me to my shed. And I started getting my shit. My great uncle saw this and called my dad immediately. My dad showed up before I left. He beat my face in with a metal coffee can until my ""boyfriend"" and his friend threatened him at knife point, they dragged me to their car and took off. We ended up living with his friends aunt for awhile. My dad sent the cops there multiple times for a welfare check up. They couldn't make me go back though. My mom called me and told me she was coming for me and going to take me back to him. Even after I told her everything. I was about to be 18 there was nothing they could do. I had prayed to God everyday and nothing changed. Well after all the phone calls and people coming and vandalizing this woman's property the cops showed up again for yet another welfare check. I told them everything. I was still covered in bruises, scars and I was pregnant to boot. It took years for him to actually go to jail. Court date after court date, lie detector tests blood tests on him and the baby. The evidence was too much. On our last court date my brothers father showed up and testified against me saying this was not the first time I tried to falsely accuse someone of rape. I mean the fucking balls on this guy. I wanted to kill him. I wanted to kill my father. I had fantasized about it everyday for years. The last thing he screamed at me before they hauled him off was that he would come for me and the baby. That I was his and his alone. I stayed in the same town for awhile and was terrorized by his friends and my family. I ended up giving the baby up for adoption. I ended up moving as far away as possible. Now I'm an adult and it's been nine years. I'm still plagued with nightmares, I'm depressed, I have anxiety, ptsd, DID and I'm developing schizophrenia. I've tried to kill myself on several occasions. Ending up in getting my stomach pumped, many hospital visits, many therapists. I still always ask myself when will I be okay. I guess I'm getting there. I hope I'm getting there. No matter what happens in life fight for yourself, fight for your future. Your being should be your number one priority. I had to do things I never want to do again. I had to pretend to love someone when I visualized killing them everyday. I had no one to help me but myself. I no longer believe in God. I just am. I just try to find happiness where I can. Idk what else to say. But for those who read my story, don't pity me. Just know that it'll be okay, maybe not now, or soon but it will be, but you have to fight for it and want it and take action, even if it's a neverending cycle, it will be okay.",28Aug2020,1

I work so hard to get good grades and don't cheat so I can get into grad school and I was just kicked out of that group chat for asking them not to cheat in the chat. I specified I wouldn't snitch if they did. I just said don't do it in the university email linked group chat. Or at least let me know if you’re going to actually discuss details so I could leave. It makes me so angry because I'm competing against people who have an unfair advantage.

Also, I feel so dumb for saying anything and not just leaving the chat as well. I just wanted to stay in the group chat because I’m lonely to be completely honest. I wanted to meet up and study with people on zoom or something.

45,"For context, I am also a kid (14). What these 2 have done to me has been not great to say the least. Their major move was an attempt at my life that was only cut short when a person walked over towards me and my friends (who had not helped much as they were terrified). They had hopped on me and started choking me, then me pinned down to the ground. It has been one of the most traumatic moments of my entire life, these two have gotten away without any kind justice being served. I say they should be put in juvenile (obviously for assault, they have many more crimes under their belts like thieving and public masturbation) and get taken away from their parents (one of them is spoiled rich cause their dad works Steam ((Fielding family is a piece of shit family)) but they don’t care what he does, the other comes from a poorer family that don’t monitor him well). Nothing has happened to them which makes me feel like I must take justice into my own hands and leave them to rest and my spirit will be set free from worry or anxiousness. I want to kill them, plain and simple, I want to end their lives. Nobody likes them and I tell people that if they died nobody would fucking care. These two have done so many awful things to people in just 4 small cities/towns. I want to be the one to bring justice to these monsters. There is so much holding me back though, like I don’t want to go to jail BUT I would be helping so many by getting rid of them. I want to move to Sweden and become a citizen once I’ve grown old BUT I could move there and not get a citizenship. I’m not sure of what to do, I tell myself to carry around pepper spray and a knife. If the pepper spray doesn’t stop them and they get physical I pull out the knife and end them there. I’m paranoid how this would effect my life and if I should do it or not (the fact I might have schizophrenia doesn’t help, these voices telling me to do it).

48,"Back in high school, life was pretty much normal for me. I had some things going for me and I also had my fair share of adversities. But my life changed one night when I went to sleep only to wake up, absolutely frozen in fear, while my brother assaulted me thinking that I was asleep. Not knowing what to do or how to react (or even if this was actually happening) I simply lay there frozen and unable to control anything. Things went on normally for the next month as I was too afraid to tell anybody out of fear of not being believed, stigma, and the potential harm it could do to my family members. I thought I could handle it for a few weeks and then it happened again. Only this time I refused to allow myself to be a victim. Him thinking I was asleep gave me the element of surprise where I was able to punch and beat the shit out of him without him expecting it. The scuffle obviously alerted my other family members in the house and just as I expected nobody believed me. Instead I was questioned as to whether or not I was high (I have always tended to smoke weed a lot, surprise surprise) I was basically made to move out of my home and to go live with a family member while I was made out to be the scapegoat of my family. There’s so many ways this experience has effected me over the past 5 years but I just wanted to finally get that out there and off my chest. I have tried to tell people over the years and More often than not I haven’t been believed. I made so many mistakes since then but being forced to be your only person of support really changes your character. I’m older wiser and in a much better place now. My brother and I haven’t spoken since. I have no idea where he is in the world or where he moved to. He could be dead for all I know.

I watch a lot of youtubers to somehow combat the loneliness, but it just is not the same. I like reading articles like those of the guardian and stuff which should act like a distraction. If I go to a student event, everyone drinks whereas i do not. and even though everyone is friendly, i find it hard to bond.

I have all these ideas, but they keep being secluded from actual execution, and i feel like i cannot get out of it.

59,"I don’t do it often by any means. Maybe once every few years. I grew up eating everything under the sun, then went vegetarian when I was 14-ish after I learned about what happens in factory farms, then went vegan when I was 20 after I learned how milk and eggs actually wind up on our plates. I have a lot of empathy for the animals and live my entire life in protest against their mistreatment and exploitation.  

But sometimes I am a huge hypocrite and I’ll be selfish and buy something with gelatin in it, or buy a milk chocolate bar instead of dark chocolate. It disgusts me to a point, because I don’t really see animal products as food anymore, but it’s hard to find vegan gummies and dark chocolate just isn’t as satisfying as milk chocolate. It’s a LOT easier for me to disconnect myself again from the reality of the product when it’s an ingredient and not the whole food (milk chocolate bar vs a cup of milk). I know I’m being super selfish about it, and it doesn’t even align with my own ethics, and it even hurts my stomach when I do eat non-vegan stuff now, but I figure if I have a weak moment and splurge on one milk chocolate bar every few years it’s not even remotely equivalent to buying dairy regularly in any capacity. Plus every time I eat it again, I can barely finish half of the chocolate bar before I’m too nauseous and then I have horrible stomach pain and diarrhea the next day lol kinda reaffirms me in being vegan 

It’s nice to get that off my chest. A lot of other vegans would eat me alive for admitting this and tell me I’m not a real vegan or that I’m a POS or that I never was ethically vegan. I know I’m a hypocrite for it",28Aug2020,1

61,"(22, M)I’ve been overweight for most of my life, so 1 year ago I decided to get in shape following all the general food advices, but without realising it I developed sort of Anorexia, where I would eat small quantities of food, mainly lean protein, and then crave the starvation and hunger feeling as good, coupled with extreme cardio training where I would nearly pass out. This led me to be severely underweight (1.91cm 63kg) and yet not satisfied with myself.
So my parents took me to a nutritionist to try and solve the problem, and since I was literally afraid to eat, it took 6 months to go back to a decent weight (71kg) building muscle as well.
However I became even more paranoid with food: I stopped drinking and smoking(I didn’t have a problem with it) and if I eat anything out of my “diet” that in reality should just be a suggestion, I freak out and start panicking. 
This led me to avoid social events since they all involve drinking and food, so I became even more lonely than I was.
Today I realized all this, that I have a problem with food, but especially with myself and my self image, it’s not possible that I sacrifice my life to follow a good diet, one shouldn’t be exclusive of the other and viceversa.
I seriously need some good advice on how to solve the problem and I can’t go to a therapist (way too expensive).",28Aug2020,1

67,"I have been thinking a lot about death; actually suicide. It's an issue that comes and goes in my mind every now and then. The thing that has saved me so far, is that I am afraid of hurting myself. I don't want to feel pain. My life has been so hard. My childhood was all about cancer and death. As long as I remember myself being a child, all I remember is my sick father. Him being a ghost of himself, him collapsing, him dying. In no way it was his fault. Neither my mother's. They did the best they could. But in the end it changed me. My teenage years were all about trying to stay alive. My mother had a developed an addiciton with alcohol. I don't blame her. Her life was hard as well. But we did get over it. Then therapy after therapy. And suddenly I was an adult. A hurt adult, an adult that desperately needed love and acceptance. And because of that I made mistakes, I believed people lying to me about loving me. Once again I was hurt. I am 30 now. My relationship with my mother is good finally. 6 years ago, I found a partner that accepts me, love me and respect me. I wouldn't change that for anything in this world. He is my rock, he is my friend, he is my everything. But now we have to deal with the economic crisis, unemployment, being broke, not having money to survive. All the things that happened has made me see myself so useless, so unimportant. I am trying to deal with that. Sometimes I succeed and some days not. I cry a lot, I talk about death a lot, I think of my fater a lot, I fall down (psychologically) a lot. I feel like I am 50 years old. I am done. I cannot try anymore. I cannot try to be positive, to have hope about the future. Nothing matters. It's like I have a B&amp;W filter on my eyes and people keep pressuring me to see the colors. I fucking can't.

The last months, due to the lockdown, I have started to observe myself and my friends more. What do I say when I am not feeling myself, how the react. And I realise that no one truly makes an effort to listen to me. They hear, but they do not listen. I have stated time after time how much I wanna die, how much I hate my life, how much I cannot take it anymore. Yet nobody reacted. I keep hearing ""Things will change, don't be dramatic, everyone is going through shit"". Nobody understands that I don't speak figuratively. Nobody takes it seriously. Nobody understands that I fucking scream for help.

What bugs me the most, is that, if I kill myself, everyone will keep wondering which signs were there, showing I would do something like that. Everyone will wonder what didn't I say more. But I did. The signs are here and yet you don't do shit. The signs are always there, you just didn't pay attention to them.",28Aug2020,1
69," On March 24t late at night, I was friending some people from a discord server, no big deal. Well it turned out to be one! I friended a girl and we started talking. We got along amazingly! We stayed up until the early hours of the day talking we got along so well. We would pretty much talk as often as we could staying up all night etc. We became really close over the next 3 months. Calling all the time etc. I got feelings for her pretty fast and she did too, but she was in a relationship, (That she admitted she was regretting and she felt no interest for the guy because he treated he awfully) But we buried our feelings because she was in a relationship. Then one day he breaks up with her and we start to date, but it was a rushed thing and we decided to pretend like it never happened after it failed. We got fed up with each other after the friendship and relationship went downhill. We unfriended each other three months ago, but I still had her in my direct messages so I could friend her back one day since what we had was truly special. I had to delete that discord account, and when I did i instantly realized what I had just done... I lost her forever.  I felt awful, I missed her a ton and thought about her everyday... And yesterday on a new account I joined a server and she just happened to be in it too. We started talking again and are getting along excellently. I hope sonething good comes from this like what are the odds haha.",28Aug2020,1
70,"COVID and politics are destroying me. Everything in the news. Everything associated with the George Floyd protests. The divisiveness, the hatred for one another, the murders of innocent people. 

I never watched the George Floyd video. I knew I couldn’t handle it. But I watched the Jacob Blake video. What the absolute fuck. 

I am so fucking broken and so fucking tired. I’m sure there are people who will relish in my sorrow and call me a snowflake and an over-sensitive millennial. I don’t care. 

I’m allowed to be sad when someone is murdered by cops. I couldn’t give less of a fuck what kind of history a person has. We’re all promised presumed innocence and a fair trial. The state has no right to shoot you in the back. 

I’ve been taking a backseat to everything lately because it’s too fucking exhausting. But I can’t keep quiet anymore. I am so hurt and so sickened by what I’Ve seen. 

People are dead, and they will never have a chance to have a voice. They will never have a chance to tell their story. They were robbed of their lives and their futures and their opportunity to raise children or land their dream job or do anything, really. They were shot in the back. They couldn’t breathe. 

I know a lot of people will have an argument against what I’m saying. All I ask if that you first please consider my point and perhaps reconsider yours. I’m using the only energy I have left in me for human rights and empathy and kindness. 

The divisiveness and hatred is killing me, but I’m not going down without a fight.",28Aug2020,1

75,"


My(14f) parents got a divorce last year but didn’t tell me until this year. At the start I’d live mostly with my mom and then go to my dads house every other weekend.
I have two older half siblings, but they’re both in their twenties

Around March my dad told me about his new girlfriend(M), but it was weird. Especially because I know her kids. We lived in a tiny town(760 people) so I went to the same school as her kids for 4 years. It was a really bad school in a really bad town, and I was bullied real bad for the six years I was there, and I even after I left I would have big breakdowns that could last for days, when I saw anyone I knew from that school. 

My dad kept asking asking if I wanted to meet his girlfriend, and I said no. He kept asking. For two months. Every day, multiple times every day. I finally gave in said ok ok sure.

That fact that I had met her didn’t stop him from asking just as much if not more. But this time he wanted her kids to come. yeah sure whatever. After that it was about going to a beach house with them. Sure fine. Except he said we were gonna stay one night and then when we got there he said three nights. I told him that I couldn’t do that, He said I was being silly and that of course I could be there for more than double time that I had prepared for.

It was hard but I did it. And when we came home i spent 3 days in my bed, and that made my dad real mad because I was ‘sleeping the day away’.
I told him many times that I physically could not get up. He didn’t believe me. I was just lazy and silly

And here’s the thing: I’m autistic. I didn’t know at the time but he did. He had know for a year. My parents kept my diagnosis from me for a year. And neither of them understand why I’m still upset. They even told my siblings about my diagnosis last year.

I blame my dad for his own behaviour, as I should (?). if he didn’t have experience with both having a teenage daughter and having a nerodivergent child (my brother) AND an autistic grandson, maybe then I could dismiss it as not knowing how to handle it. 

I can’t forgive him for dismissing my ‘bad’ autistic traits as me just being ’lazy’ when he knew. And I can’t forgive either of my parents for keeping it from me for that long.
He’s alway understanding when my nephew has a breakdown but when I do I’m being silly and whining. I’m also being silly when I don’t eat the dinner that he knows I can’t stand the texture of, but when my nephew doesn’t eat it for the same reason it’s fine

He has been sending me texts saying that he misses me and our dog(I take her with to his house)

It’s been a bit over a month since I saw him last. My mom says I’m not being fair and that he’s trying to change and I don’t believe it, because he’s said that a thousand times, and then he’s a great dad for a week then it goes right back to normal. I told both of them that it’s not that I never wanna see him again I just need a break.i don’t know how to forgive him if that even possible right now.",28Aug2020,1

79,"I'm currently not in a relationship, but I do see myself settling down and getting married in the future. 

Unfortunately, I do not really like people. I have Autism, so I find frequent socialisation very very exhausting.

The thought of having someone living with me 24/7 kinda freaks me out, too. I like being alone in my own space and rarely allow visitors because of this. I enjoy visiting people, but my home is the place where I recharge.

If we didn't live in the same house while dating, I'd be ok with that because it wouldn't be constant socialisation, but what's gonna happen when I get married and have to live with the person?

I don't even know if I ever will get married, but the thought of it both excites me and scares me. I want to get married, but I don't like the thought of living with someone.

80,"Need a 2nd opinion)




	
- [ ]i  work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were and when our is. Sue asked me ‘how old are you?’ (I was nothing to do with the convo up until this point) and I said ‘29’ then she reacted ‘awwwww are yer?’ 

- [ ] Then sue asked me ‘ when’s your birthday?’ I said ‘30th November’ then Sam out loud said ‘mines 21st’ in a bubbly up herself kinda way. Then sue  (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh, are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Jokingly as i said and then said sam whilst tagging clothes was like  ‘ooooo no, ooo no ooooo no, ooo no I don’t think my fella would like that, don’t think my fella would like that’   and looked annoyed a bit too but really arrogant too as she was tagging a shirt. Then it just went quiet. 


-she’s always been really pleasant with me and friendly in a normal person way but  I feel she got annoyed by the joke because I’m ugly and yet she stinks very very  bad of BO (the staff talk about it behind her back) and looks like a complete junkie. She wears the same grey tracksuit that’s delinquents wear everyday that she got locked up in.


- [ ] I didn’t say anything was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in on community service and he does call A her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes. And fancied another guy in the shop ( so sue said) and he ripped her to bits to me about how much she smells.

Edit: she’s Normally nice and she seems pleasant etc with me never had a problem with her before but I felt this was arrogant",28Aug2020,1
81,"My aunt, who is very sick, came to me and apologized. A week before she tried to drag me outside and it was extremely scary for me. She hugged me and apologized profusely. She started to vent. Her life isn’t great. She’s taking care of her 28-year-old son, who mistreats her. I’m not very old. She says I’m much more intelligent than her; she forgets how strong and independent she is. She doesn’t know what to do, so I gave her the advice on what I would do. She’s debated wether or not to kick out her son from her home. She hates the idea of it. She was crying horribly, because she doesn’t want to do it. She just can’t keep up. 

For context, my cousin is just deep into mental issues. I cannot say anything he has,
because we don’t self-diagnose, that’s bad. He’s currently just being a husk of his former self, in a mattress of dog feces. Not gonna lie, pretty shitty. My aunt acknowledges that she had a big influence on that mental state. I can confirm she regrets it.  She picks up after her son, who is just sitting idly, yelling at her to do stuff while she can barely walk. Not a very good situation.

Today, I convinced her, that while I do think she needs to kick out her son, she needs to help him. I honestly don’t know what that house looks like. I haven’t been there in months. She’s a good person. She suffered a lot of trauma and in return traumatized her son. She wants to reach help for him. Which is a pretty big milestone, since the church is against that. 

Now, I’m not really religious, she is. I told her my knowledge on the church’s view, as far as I know. She wasn’t taught anything about mental health. Even so, she immediately agreed with me. Touched my heart a little. 

A few years ago, my aunt would’ve immediately thrown my idea out the window. Now, she was so open, she immediately was curious. I’m saying this from someone who went to a church that believes mental illnesses are just being strayed away from God and can just be prayed away. For someone, who basically lives in that church, to be so open, I’m flabbergasted. 

She says she has opened her eyes. I think that’s good. I don’t know if kicking her son out is good for him necessarily, but she is sickly and cannot take care of him any longer. Okay, scratch that, I don’t think it’s good for him. I do think it’s good for my aunt and family. She loves her son. I love my cousin too, that guy is great. Though, he’s legit not working and doesn’t care about anything, yet expects his mother to still pick up after him. She can barely walk! 

My aunt has a big heart. She loves a lot of people. She loves me and she loves her family. Her son can’t mistreat one of the nicest people in world, at least in my opinion, like that. 

So yeah

82,"There’s this young youtuber who had a kid when she was a teen, now she is like 20 yo and they just had another baby girl in may. She married her boyfriend when they where 18. I didn’t really follow them but watched some of their videos once in a while. 

Today she posted a video explaining that her husband committed suicide. Leaving her and both daughters behind. Her video completely shattered me. I’m so deeply sad for her, she was broken and I felt it way too much through the screen. I’m so sorry for her, so heartbroken for her. I cried like a baby and I don’t even know them. I felt her pain straight through my heart. And I know I can’t even imagine how much pain she feels right now. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but seeing this I think, for now, that I would rather live in pain than cause this much pain to the ones I love. It shook me to the core. I hope I will never feel so much pain that it will become a solution again to end my life.

85,"So, firstly, for some background, I grew up poor, out in the country on an old farm. This area is one of the most economically depressed places in the country. It's pretty bad, and I've always known that, but it wasn't put into perspective until I began traveling. Also, it's a predominantly white area; not affluent, but white. Here in Upstate NY we like to call ourselves ""redneck thugs."" We are half hick, half city. We're a pretty dangerous breed of people, in all honesty. We're uneducated, poor, ignorant, tough, and typically have severe drug and alcohol problems. There's a lot of meth here, and of course alcohol and weed. Most of the people I grew up with fell into the proverbial ""rabbit hole,"" and so did I, but I managed to get out of it about ten years ago, but it's been a long road getting to where I'm at today. I am 32 and have very little to show for it, but things are going fairly well for me (I think?). Pretty much everybody I grew up with is either in jail, dead, or has moved far away. I am currently in the process of moving far away, but that's easier said than done!

And for even more about myself, I just graduated from a local community college, which is ""cute"" to most people, but that's a big deal around here. That school has a graduation rate of about %6. I am the %6! Getting through college was one of the hardest things I have ever done. Not so much because of the curriculum, but because I was simultaneously fighting several very severe addictions and trying to get off all of my medication. Sitting in class for 5-6 hours a day was definitely difficult, but I endured. So I have a degree now! ....what am I supposed to do with it? Oh, right, negotiate! I'm currently trying to land a ""good"" job, but I'll see how that goes. A ""good"" job around here pays about $25 an hour with decent benefits, but they'll work you into the ground. That's probably shocking to a lot of you.

Culturally, people around here like beer, cornhole, hunting, trucks, and shopping at walmart. Most people here are elderly and/or severely (read: VERY severely) overweight. Pretty much everyone has a history of substance abuse, but hey, it binds us together! Life here is hard, and a lot of people have given up and gone on benefits for ""health-related issues,"" and this is where my personal opinions get in the way of attempting to draw a politically neutral picture of this area and my country. I believe adamantly that our welfare system is completely destroying our country, and it's probably deliberate on behalf of our government. What can we do? Well, I mean... vote???? I Guess????? Does voting really do anything anymore? I don't believe so. There's nothing we can do, really. Oh well!!! Most of this country is too 'fat and happy' to bother fighting anyway. It's done. It's over. We've been effectively neutered as a society and this is just how it is! 

I digress.

Anyway, are people here racist? I'd say no, not really. Are people here dangerous? Yes, I'd say more so than anywhere else short of bad areas within major cities. This area is very rural, by the way, so don't get lost! Especially if you're obviously not from around here. You're gonna get fucked with! 

Oh, right, my little adventure... I just spent three months driving, camping, hiking and backpacking all over the lower 48. I have seen pretty much everything. The only region I didn't go to is the South, mostly because it's too fucking hot, and also because I didn't feel safe down there, at all. I got to Kentucky and I was being threatened and harassed just because I'm from New York. But, all-in-all, I spent about 85 nights alone, in the woods, in a tent, surrounded by strangers, bears, elk, and other wildlife. I visited every major national and state park in the entire country. I also visited, or at least drove through, almost every major city. If you've been there, I've been there! Did I almost die or get murdered a few times? You fucking bet! I had very close encounters with grizzlies, massive stag elk, crackheads and thugs.

So who were the most dangerous people I encountered on my trip? It wasn't black people, or mexicans, or southeast asians, or any other minority, it was WHITE PEOPLE! And white rednecks at that. The sort of type of people that I grew up with, and that I fucking am! It really put things into perspective for me. Suddenly, I realized why so many people were scared, nervous or apprehensive of me. I am a crazy white guy from New York! Yeah, I definitely get it now, and I'm so sorry on behalf of myself and my ilk. I am not like them, though. I have no criminal record, and I have never hurt anyone, and that will never change. 

For some small examples of my encounters with strangers while I was backpacking alone all over the country: 

I ran into a gay couple from Cali while in Montana; one black the other white, and they were the nicest darn people I have ever met. They were very very poor... homeless... I had to leave the trail early due to fatigue, so I gave them all of the rest of my food, and they blessed me with their grace and sent me on my way. I will never forget those two dudes! They were the most resplendent folks I've ever talked to - just totally, utterly at peace with themselves. Thanks! I want to be more like you!

And I also ran into a couple of white crackheads (this term is crass, but honest) while in Oregon. I was camped at a sno-park and this woman, who was obviously strung out, approached me from behind (DON'T DO THIS!!!), scared the shit out of me, and then tried selling me a sob story about how her car broke down and she has no money blah blah blah. I explained firmly that I am not going to give her money, and became very annoyed and tried her story on me again, but to no success. ""I am not going to give you money."" She tried showing some cleavage and going that route, but nope, I am not into it. She got pissed and eventually left, and then about an hour later a truck, with her in it and a man driving, drove through the parking lot to check me out. I had nothing to defend myself with, and I realized that they were definitely going to fuck with me that night, so I left. I didn't even pack up my tent. I just broke it down, and threw it into the back of my car and took off within about 30 seconds. Then I had to spend $200 on a shitty hotel in that area. This was near Crater Lake, by the way. The park itself is nice, but small, and everything around it is a sketchy shithole, so keep this in mind if you plan on visiting there.

I ran into a gay trucker in Washington who tried getting me to connect to his hotspot, but I'm tech savvy enough to know that when you do that they can see all of your internet traffic. My refusal to use his hotspot pissed him off, so he comes over to me, shows me his firearm in a threatening way, and then tried talking me into ""checking out his truck."" Haha! As soon as he turned his back for two seconds I bolted. What a weird fucker. He was also white.

On a more positive note, I ran into a middle aged black woman while in a walmart in Chicago. She dropped a few bucks and I picked it up and handed it to her. She then began smothering me with affection and telling what a sweet young man I am and making me feel all warm and mushy inside. I've never felt more loved in my life, haha. 

I also camped near a mexican family (non-english speaking) while in North Dakota. They could see that I didn't have much food to eat, so they brought a plate of food over to me. Again, very amazingly sweet generous kind people and I love them. 

So, you are getting the idea. Of all the people I encountered on my journey, the best of them were minorities, and the worst of them were white. I have learned a lot about myself, this country, and everyone in it. There's a lot of ignorance here, where I grew up, but not racism. I do believe there is a difference. Not knowing something doesn't mean you can't learn something. I used to be scared of black people, but not anymore! I think black people are scared of us, and I can totally understand why. White people are pretty scary.",28Aug2020,1

From [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) \- ""Continuing to make payments between March 13, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2020, could help you pay down your loan balance more quickly because the full amount of a payment will be applied to principal **once all interest accrued** prior to March 13, 2020, is paid.""  


Saving grace is any payments that only go toward interest can be refunded.  From [Studentaid.gov](https://Studentaid.gov) ""Yes; any payment you made during the administrative forbearance period (March 13, 2020, through Dec. 31, 2020) can be refunded.

98,"Some humans would’ve stayed in Africa and moved north towards Asia and Europe. Another group would’ve developed separately in SA and migrated upwards towards North America and east Asia. 

I know that current geological estimates put the separation of continents much earlier, but geology far from an exact science and it’s constantly changing. 

It would make sense that an ‘asiatic’-looking group developed separately into the Natives and east Asians. SA has a lot of very old civilizations with rich histories and mythologies. I think this version of history makes a lot more sense than the idea east Asians and Europeans developed so differently while so close to each other.",28Aug2020,1

107,"He lied to his friends. He told all of them he treated me like a god. ""Treated me like a god""? More like ""treated me like a goddamn sack of rubbish"".

Here goes some context: I broke up with my boyfriend two weeks ago. He was very insecure and jealous. If I didn't reply to his texts, he would freak out, and give me the silent treatment for like, half an hour, before coming back and apologizing to me. This happened every time I didn't reply, no matter what I was doing; I could be watching a movie with my parents, or at the therapist, but if I didn't reply, he'd ignore my ass.

This wasn't the only reason I broke up with him, though. Whenever he asked me to change something, I'd push it the farthest I could to change, but he refused to even *make an effort* to change if I told him his jealousy wasn't doing either of us good. He'd always say crap like ""it's just how I'm wired"" and ""I can't"".

He was always getting angry at me for everything, and just wouldn't let it go. He said he would, but the next time we argued, he'd bring it up.

One night, I exploded. I've never felt so angry in my entire life; I left him. It was the best decision I've ever made. It's great to know that I can now sit on my couch and watch Friends without having to apologize or explain myself to somebody.

Anyway, after I broke up with him, a mutual friend of ours called me. Told me he was having a meltdown, and he'd told everyone for months that he treated me like a divinity. Great. Not only did he make me feel guilty for the tiniest shit, he also lied to everybody behind my shoulder. How nice.

I think it's best if I sign off of relationships for the time being. Thank you for bearing with me.",28Aug2020,1

Dear Google,

I’m officially breaking all ties with you.  It’s not me, it’s you.  I’ve been using yahoo search in chrome private mode behind your back.  You also have a small toolbar.  


You continue to release half baked products with limited support and no direct knowledge on how to fix issues.  I currently have 6 nest minis, 2 Home displays, youtube tv since day 1, YouTube premium, YouTube music subscription, and 3 Chromecasts. 

My main issue, I cannot stream music for longer than 1-2 hours regardless of streaming service. Music will stop randomly at random times in playlist, albums, radio stations, podcasts, news, etc.  no routines blocking, not trying to stream multiple accounts, not running out of music on playlist, etc.  

When we first met and I gave you my first set of data, you promised me you would always be there, 24/7.  Your support was an absolute joke when I needed you the most.  It’s always my fault.  You can never take responsibility for your actions.  I’ve always remained loyal, restarted you when you weren’t feeling well, ensured you always had the latest firmware, unplugged you during severe thunderstorms, and even defended you when you took all my friends data without their permission. 

Enough!  I can’t do this any more. I am sick of waiting up at night just to see if you will work.  You never listen, even with that super sonic hearing you always brag about.  You never initiate any conversations. What’s the point, Google?   I mean, okay google.  What’s the point?       

When I first started to talk to you about my issues and our future, you pointed the finger at me.   First, the usual, try resetting everything. I played along and nothing. Then, it’s prob your router.  It’s not.  I have 50 devices on WiFi, a google nest router and multiple hard-wired points.  1gig up and down.  Then I was told routers couldn’t handle 50 plus devices. I said it’s a google nest router and Google’s own description for it says up to 200 devices.  Then you said, it’s probably because you’re using a non-google email as your google account email address.  It makes zero sense, but okay.  I created a new Gmail address, factory reset speaker, created a new home, assigned speaker to Gmail account, and guess what, the same thing!!!  Then I was told, oh, let’s test the stream on Bluetooth connection?  Okay, nothing to do with WiFi, but sure.  Guess what, I could stream for hours this way because my phone is providing the music, rather than a google connection through the internet to the music service.  So after that test, it proved nothing either way.  Then, I was told to factory reset every device.  Bit the bullet and reset EVERYTHING.  Guess what, nothing!   Clearing music apps’ cache didn’t work.  


There are literately thousands of comments reflecting the same issue on forums, with no resolution.


So, I’m done.   If you would just approach things at times as if it’s maybe your end that’s not working or simply say, I know it’s an issue but have no clue how to fix.  Maybe my expectations are too high? All I want is to stream music up to 24/7 without interruption unless for a good reason like power outage, WiFi drops, etc.  

I hope you find that sucker you’re looking for.  

Okay Google: Fuck you, I’m out.

Sincerely,

Your ex

123,"I  studied at the mediocre Teachers College, Columbia University majoring  in Clinical Psychology and it is NOT a license-eligible degree that  provides any sorts of councilor training for students. I’m not eligible  for licensure anywhere and I had absolutely no supervised clinical  experience prior to working as a therapist, but since I live in a 3rd  world country it doesn’t matter. Thankfully, my boss, highly esteemed  psychiatrist Dr. Mohammad Alsuwaidan looked the other way and hired me  in his clinic as a clinical psychologist. It feels wrong but no one  cares, I’m at least getting work done and also feeling like I'm making a  positive difference in some of my clients.

It even clarifies that my degree is more theory than practice in the student handbook:

“Q: Can I acquire a license to practice therapy with this degree?

A:  No. This brief (36 credit) MA Program is not designed to prepare  students for MA-level licensure in New York State. Most graduates are  interested in ultimately studying for more advanced degrees.” *TC Clinical Psychology 2017-2018 M.A. Student Handbook.*

To  make matters worse, Teachers College isn’t really part of Columbia  University, but only loosely affiliated with it. TC is NOT Columbia. It  has an independent board of trustees, budget, endowment, and multiple  admissions standards. If the end degree didn't say ""Columbia"", TC would  have far fewer applicants each year. If you just want Columbia on your  degree paper, go for it, because TC is probably one of the easiest (and  maybe the cheapest) ways to achieve this. It seems like they accepted  most people because they need the money to fund research/PhD students/  building's renovation. The teacher to student ratios are quite large and  it was far from a rigorous program. You're just being given basic  articles to read and papers to write.

Most  of the classes in Teachers College have a minimum of 30+ students. Some  have more than 50 with little to no class discussion. A good number of  classes are taught by graduate students and adjuncts. It's something of a  bait and switch because you think that your classes, especially  required classes, will be taught by faculty, but really they aren't.  Also, classes are hella expensive in return for a Columbia branded  resume (with not what one would expect at a master's level in between).  If you fail out of this program, it is because you never showed up for  class or the tests, ever.

So, I  basically lie to people by saying that I’m a qualified clinical  psychologist and that I studied at Columbia University. All in all, it  was a horrible experience but I can’t publicly admit it to anyone 'cause  my ego.",28Aug2020,1

125,"His name was Lloyd.

I’ve been back at my dad place since I broke up with my ex. Plan was to stay shortly just to get a quick cash down for a condo or a house. My sister and mother( they both live elsewhere)  didn’t like it because it’s a toxic place with my father in it. It didn’t bother me at the time because my dad has a large farm house and a stable to play around . I would not interact with my dad much, eating in my room and playing video games when I come back from work. 

I was coming home early from work, grabbed something to eat while driving, then went in my room. 

I went to the kitchen to get something to drink and then my father said something like “ by the way, your dog is dead.” He seemed it in a manner like it was an annoyance dealing with it. I thought he was joking. 

Then he said “ no he jumped under the tires of the neighbours truck when she came in our driveway” ( neighbour is his ex ) 

I wasn’t feeling well, so in confusion it happens to say bad things, but instead of comforting me, he defended her and insulted me back. Belittling me. 

I went to my room, called my mother which I know really liked my dog. It’s a reflex to call a parent in such circumstances, right? She cried alot on the phone, told her I’d join her because she’s in the back of the ranch training a horse with my sister. 

When I went past to exit the house, I asked “where is my dog?” 

He told me he buried my dog, the most important living being to me, in the mound of shit behind the stable. Where the shit goes when you clean horse stalls. Saying “he’ll decompose better in there”  while slouching over his cellphone at the dinners table. 

Told her he was a heartless miserable person. 

He went up and followed “ my boy if you talk to me like this you won’t sleep here tonight. It’s not my fault your garbage dog went under a truck” 

I’m really not a violent person, but I pushed him hard that he almost felt down. Then I realized what kind of action I reacted with. Just we both grabbed our necks and he threatened me to beat me up. But I just didn’t want to press further, he has health problems, he isn’t supposed to do exercises as he always heat junk food, his veins are clogged and next time he has a malaise, doctor said he’ll probably die. I didn’t want to ruin my life for this asshole so I just went to my mother.


We cried in her car, then we decided to put the car next to the stable. 

My father didn’t tell me where exactly he was so I’ve passed an extremely long 15-20 mins digging around in a literal pile of shit to find my beloved friend.

Then I hit something with my shovel and saw a paw. 

Emotions overwhelmed me as reality revealed itself before my eyes. 

I’ve dug him out, he wasn’t bloody, nor did he seem deformed. He was just still, peaceful. I just knew he wasn’t there anyway, with his eyes still open. 

Took him in my arms. Put him over a blanket I took. Just starred at him. Took a picture of him like this to remind me how I felt at that moment and to remember what I just lived. 

Then rolled him like a burrito like I used to do after he took his bath. 

Put him in the trunk of my mothers car, we drove to her home and I dug him a grave. Took him one last time in my arms before delivering him into the grave. 

He was my fucking dog, my friend full of life that had many quirks, personality and routine we had together. Now he’s gone in an instant. 

He was with me the night before, playing with him in my bed and I was thinking I couldn’t wait to have my place to take care of him better, to have my friend follow me at my new home. 

I even gave him food the morning before it happened, thinking of him and telling him good bye. 

But you’d never guess it was the last time you’re saying it, right? 

I took all my stuff from my fathers place, went to my mother’s and my idea of a future happy self with my dog is broken. 

I’m really eager to have my place, but I fear it will feel empty without my best friend. 

I don’t feel happy with the reality I’ve been given, this doesn’t even feel real that all of this happened. Thinking is my mind tricking me? Is it just denial? I feel like when my mother would take my dog weeks to train him for a tv ads or something. Like you know where he is but you’re still missing him. But in the back of my head I know he won’t come back and it’s very hard to accept.  

I don’t even think of my father or what happened. All I’m thinking about is my dog, my comfort, my future  and the present moment. 

I love you my friend, Lloyd. I’m really really not a religious person and not a believer. But i really hope I’ll meet you again one day.

127,"I feel extremely restless about my life. 

I recently graduated high school, and am currently enrolled in my freshman year of college (online and living at home). My dream is to travel the world. I understand that traveling isn't practical given the world's current circumstances, and that it won't be for a while. But even if coronavirus weren't inhibiting me from traveling, I feel like I'd still feel stuck. I'm in college, I have a great boyfriend of almost 3 years (who I'd like to keep), and a single mother who battles with addiction. How would I just drop everything to go overseas for an extended period of time? 

I've always been a dreamer (I don't mean that to come off in a cliche sort of way). My biggest fear is getting old and having regrets about what I could/should have done in my life (""when I came to die, discovering I had not lived,"" as Thoreau would say). I'm a huge advocator for living life to the fullest and discovering your life's purpose/what makes you feel ""alive"" and pursuing it. I understand that this can mean many different things to many different people, but to me, that's immersing myself within other cultures, encountering and learning from people of all walks of life, and exploring the world's history. The only way I've caught a glimpse of this so far is by watching Youtube videos of people living that dream, and the idea of that makes me feel even worse! I'd hate to be someone that's all talk and no action, it's like I'm starting my journey on a pathway to a life of regret. 

Maybe I'm thinking about all of this way too seriously. But I can't help it. I've felt this way for several years now, and each day that goes by I feel even more restless. I am extremely lucky have been faced with all of the opportunities that life has given me so far, and I don't mean to sound ungrateful. I've tried to channel this excitement and passion I have for adventuring into my current life situation, hoping that would bring me a stronger sense of fulfillment and gratitude. But I still am longing for something more.
