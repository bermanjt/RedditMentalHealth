1,"I’m really struggling right now. I’m hoping someone reads this that could donate to me to help feed my kids for this week. We have nothing at the moment but about a cup of rice to cook and some frozen broccoli. After my kids split that for dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow we’ll be out of food. I don’t have transportation but I do I a grocery store within walking distance. I’ve been looking for work but I can’t walk far enough yet to get to a business that’s hiring.  I have extensive nerve damage in my left leg and am building up my tolerance by walking further and further every day. 

All my bills are past due. 
Rent electric water and sewer. 

Please God let someone answer my prayers. 

In desperate need of a blessing tonight. 

I have paypal, cashapp and Venmo. If you can help in any way please reach out.",05Jan2020,1
2,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat. 

Edit: I’m ugly so I don’t believe she likes me. I’m 6ft tall and slim 

She has instagram pics with around 200 likes from thirsty dudes so she wouldn’t be short of options",05Jan2020,1
3,"I've posted more on reddit, than i have my facebook page. Its solely based on confidence (for me anyway). No way i would spill my guts on facebook. The anonymity of reddit, just makes it amazing.

5,"I decided to learn japanese at the moment after I encountered a university program and decided to go for it. After downloading a little language game, I decided to also improve my other two languages I learned in past, spanish and korean. After a short period of learning, I’m surprised at how much I already know. Maybe it’s because I’ve been exposed to all three languages in the past but I feel rather powerful after unearthing this ability.

8,"So I get into these moods from time to time when I just wake up not necessarily in a bad mood, but in an indifferent sort of mood. I’m more quiet and everything feels more calm than usual. While I enjoy those moments, they don’t last long because they are usually followed up with a really bad mood. And I mean bad mood. For example, today was one of those days. I was driving to work, quiet and calm, thinking how I’m just contemplating my life and that’s ok. But I get to work (I work retail) and one of the first things to inconvenience me sends me over the edge. I don’t yell, I don’t slam things, or anything like that. I just can’t smile, I’m more direct, and I’ve been told that I look like I want to murder someone. In placement of the yelling and slamming, I tend to get passive aggressive towards coworkers when they annoy me, which in this mood doesn’t take much. With customers, I just help them but my tone is usually monotone with a hint of annoyance (usually through no fault of their own) and like helping them is tedious. 

The thing with these moods is that it’s usually me looking for a reason to be in a bad mood. It’s not the customers fault that they don’t know something and stupid questions are kind of par for the course in retail anyways. My coworker was just trying to help me out with something even though they misheard what I said. Hockey is just a sport, even though the Bruins can’t win OT to save their lives and are making so many stupid mistakes. My bad mood was on me and me alone. No one else and I recognize that. But for some reason, I could not get through that bad mood today. It lasted all day. 

So my question to you guys is... when you’re in a bad mood like this, what do you do and how do you handle it?",05Jan2020,1

10,"My whole life I have felt like a burden. I was bullied, never had many friends and my family has always made me feel like I was such an inconvenience. Teachers saw me bullied and never did anything. I feel ashamed of who I have become that I struggle to open up to other people. I am nearing my late 20's and do not have any friends and have never been in a romantic relationship. I have tried my hardest to make friends but there were several instances when my invitations where ignored or I have been left out of events and it hurts me SO much. I have never been asked out and tried to ask guys out and have been turned down. I am terrified that I am just as unlovable as when I was little and I honestly don't know what to do. I can't afford therapy right now so I thought I would just write this out here. I feel truly unlovable and am wondering how to overcome the feeling of being ashamed of myself? If there's another subreddit that I can post this on that would be more appropriate please let me know.",05Jan2020,1

&gt; Relationships are a lot like smoking meat. Sometimes both people are the same type of meat, and they can be put in the same smoker at the same time and come out perfect and delicious- but sometimes one person is a pork shoulder and the other is a beef brisket. They both can go into a smoker at the same time and temperature, with the same seasoning, but one will need to be taken out sooner than the other. The pork shoulder needs to come out before the brisket, or else it will get too dry. If both meats stay in the same amount of time they both will get ruined, and that’s how people are. While things may seem like they will work out in the beginning, sometimes someone just needs to be let out, to save both, so they both are delicious and juicy",05Jan2020,2
12,"This probably seems like some teenage boy's fantasy, but I feel like it is a serious problem for me, especially as of recent. I really do not want her to think I'm into her, or for her to act upon this potential liking of me.

I am fast approaching 16, the age of consent here in Enlgand. My step-mum and I have always been on good terms, but never too close. However, she's recently been getting closer to me by:

• Commenting on how handsome I look 
• Flaunting her body around me
• Touching me a lot
• Taking ""group"" photos where I am the central focus.
• Using adult humour openly, when she used to hate it.

She has called me handsome a few times in the past, but she has recently been calling me handsome, hot, gorgeous and a stunner. I have never heard her even use these words before, and never known her to compliment me at such a frequency.

Five months ago, I accidentally walked in on her topless, to which she reacted by immediately covering herself up and shouting at me. However, just three days ago, she made a big point about how she was going to change her clothes, then left her door, directly opposite where I was facing, wide open. She stripped completely to her underwear, and when I looked up and saw her, she made eye contact with me and then smirked. Much different to what she did 5 months ago.

In the 7 years I've known her, she has probably made physical contact with me less than a dozen times. In the last week, she has held my hand for a short period of time, kissed me on the cheek, placed her hand on my thigh in the car, lay a hand on my back and even stroked my chest. She has done all of the above several times in the past week, except kissing me on the cheek, which she did once.

We were recently in a playground, and I pushed my brother and step-brother in a spinny chair thing. She took a photo, zoomed in so I took up 2/3 of the screen, of me bent over to grab the handle to spin it. She shared these in the google photos album, where half of the photos are of me, or mainly me. She has also very recently taken a photo of me while I was bent over to grab a bowling ball. The photo was zoomed into me and I was the only person in the photo. She shared this with me only, did not put it in a family album.

A few days back, we were playing scrabble, and I told my brother ""I can see your rack"". She laughed and said ""That'd be so much different if you were saying it to me!"" I laughed with her, but was concerned. She has never made adult jokes around me before, she used to act like I was 5, censoring her own swearing and telling my dad off for making remotely adult jokes, so why did she make a joke herself this time?

This really sounds as if it is some fantasy I'm living in, but I'm genuinely concerned. What if she tries to take it further with the unusual touching, or makes a joke that crosses a boundary? What should I do? Is this a problem at all or am I worrying too much now that I'm nearly 16?",05Jan2020,3
14,WW3 is basically here. Our earth is dying. My anxiety and paranoia is at it’s peak. I’m basically a ticking time bomb of emotions.

Hello! 

Apologies in advance due to being on my phone and just trying to get these thoughts off before i forge (long read incoming)
 
I’m not here looking for pats on the back or empathy really, but more so answers. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety throughout my entire (short) life so far, and my entire life has been filled with sadness and emptiness. On top of that i come from a dysfunctional family where my father is out of the picture and my mother relies on my emotionally and financially. I left my home at 19 to join the military and create a life for myself and hopefully start over and find out who i am and what i am. I’ve always been referred to as a bright child, level headed, and determined. But I’ve never been able to see these qualities in myself. I’ve never experienced a period of happiness and am not sure what it’s like to live as a “functioning” human being. I wake up everyday with a genuine hatred for myself and the life i am living, going on as a zombie and coming home to reset and start over the next day. Despite this I take all the recommended steps to counter these feelings and state of mind. I spend my free time researching and discovering ways to better myself and relieve myself of some of the pain i deal with but to no avail. 

I have am in a LTR with my wonderful and successful girlfriend who’s on her way to having the world in her hands. I have my own apartment, a job that I hate but pays the bills at the end of the day even though i work an inhumane amount of hours, and I can pay my bills and have been able to afford a car. I take of my finances very well and have high credit and all of the other snazzy things. I also see a therapist and Psychiatrist which has diagnosed me with clinical depression and anxiety and am currently on my third bout of meds with Bupropion(300mg) and Buspar(20mg) though they do nothing. I exercise sort of regularly with the little free time I have and always try to remain efficient and maximize my free time, taking part time classes online and handling my responsibilities as a young adult now. Despite that I hate myself.  I hate looking at myself (haven’t looked in a mirror in months), i don’t know who I am and i spend the day driving myself crazy internally. Nothing seems to work for me and I’m tired of initiating paths and goals for them to fail and collapse in front of me. I took 5 classes at a university nearby this past fall while working and got into a car accident because i was just frankly doing way too much. But i just wanted to feel like I was doing something for myself. I try to eat a healthy diet and follow proper regimes but I can’t seem to get the results I want (and have wasted a lot of money throughout the process) and I honestly just don’t know what to do. I don’t know where I am, where I’m going, and what’s going to happen to me. I don’t have many “friends” and many do not know of me and my personal battles and struggles. I speak to my leadership for advice but it just doesn’t click. I feel alone and fading and I don’t have much to build off of in this New Year. To sum it up I’m just asking for assistance and Advice in what i can do/what routes to take to get better and maybe function and be content with my life one day. Any help is appreciated and if you’ve read all this i thank you. 

TLDR; High functioning depressed young male, proactive and willing to do the work to get better but nothing has worked to actually help me get better. Do not know what to do or where to go. Medicated, , in talk therapy, healthy eater, exercise moderately, and nothing seems to work.",05Jan2020,1
18,"Hi, i’m sorry if this isn’t the right sub. I just need somewhere to write this all out without having consequences.

So i’m 14, 15 very soon. This might just be of puberty or teenage hormones or something... but i’m just a mess right now.

For some context, i manipulated my closest friends back in November. More specifically, my boyfriend (i’m bi). We broke up and then I manipulated him to get back with me again. We broke up again shortly after because he came to his senses. I was (and am) a horrible person for doing this. I put it straight because i have the tendency to fluff my stories to favor me. I still talk with my friends and my ex, but it’s very tense. I just want to talk to them like normal again, but it’s clear that that won’t happen.

On to what this post is about.

My mind has been going in a circle since this whole... thing happened. Basically my thought process is this:
1. I need to stop manipulating people. Ill act OK and repress my feelings.
2. No, that won’t work. Ill have to act tense.
3. No, that’ll be playing the victim card. (Note: that’s basically how i manipulated my friends)
4. Repeat thoughts 1-3.

To be honest, the thought process is more complicated, but it’s too long to write out. It really all boils down to this.

Beyond this point will be edgy stuff that i’ll probably look back on and puke. Or something.

I don’t know how to act. To be honest, I don’t know who i am. What was my personality before I went haywire? I had anger issues when I was little, was I always this mad? Have I always wanted to beat the ever loving shit out of my friend who “started” this whole thing (he didn’t. It was my mind that thought so)? 

Have I always been this much of a piece of shit? Probably. My old school friends always say that I was an asshole kid. I was just the “bully” in the lunchroom. My other friends always say that I was hard to approach. Maybe that’s why I didn’t have any friends in my first year of camp. Maybe that’s why I threatened to kill myself and maybe that’s why they all cared. They only cared because of my shitty manipulation practices. 

I’m a fucking disgrace. I’m not lying. 

The only escape from this dumbass situation is daydreaming. All I do is turn on some music, lay back, and just let my imagination take the wheel. I do this for hours. Late at night, during class, damn, even during meals. Its getting to the point where I can’t tell what’s real or not. 

What do I daydream about? I daydream about being a better person. Everyone would like me, I would have more friends, I would go outside more, I would be successful, I would be *happy*. 

Nothing really makes me happy anymore. Seriously. I’m an artist going to an art school, but even that isn’t cheering me up anymore. Drawing my dirty fantasies isn’t helping either. 

God, I’m not even religious, but there has to be something, someone looking down and judging us. Judging me.

I’m going to hell. Or something like that.

I’m a failure. I’ve quit every sport i’ve played, my grades are declining, and my art skills are deteriorating. I am utterly useless in every field of life. I’ve concluded a long, long time ago that i’m not fit for life.

There I go again playing the victim card. I really need to stop doing that. I need to stop. Everything.

Sorry about the long post. I’m not OK, as you can see.

I need advice on how to act or what to do, guys. Please.

Peace.",05Jan2020,2
20,"It’s been a while since I seriously considered my own mortality. After watching the new Star Wars movie and finally getting around to watching I want to eat your pancreas, it really hit me that Im going to die one day. Those 2 movies made me cry not because of death, but because of what happens after you die. When you die, you leave behind a legacy. A footprint on everyone that you interacted with. You leave behind both the problems you had as well as the strength to resolve those problems. Now I can clearly see what life means and what it means to die. It’s not that nothing matters in the end because we all die, it’s because of the fact that we’ll die that makes everything matter. Who cares if I haven’t completed my bucket list if Im not going to die? Every action that you and I make has meaning simply because we chose to use up the limited amount of time we have to do it. I will die some day. It could be today, it could be tomorrow, it could be 80 years from now. The important fact isn’t when Ill die, it’s what I’ll do before I die. I want to live life, giving and receiving as much love as I can. To love life as much as I can so that when my time runs out, Ill be fulfilled; satisfied, that my time on Earth was spent the way I want to spend it.",05Jan2020,2
22,"Living with family sucks and people always tell me to just move out. But moving isn't that easy. In fact I tried moving to an apartment based on my income (the projects), but because me and my mom were late with rent in our current residence, I was denied.

23,"I have a bit of a history with people misusing drugs. An ex partner of mine was addicted to snorting Ritalin and committed suicide and it’s very sensitive for me. I told my partner this. He used to be really into drugs but isn’t anymore and doesn’t do them. He got diagnosed with adhd last year and was given Ritalin. I told him to never share his medicine with anyone, it would disappoint me.

Today our housemate told me that my partner gave him 3 of his Ritalin tablets to party with. I’m really confused and don’t know if I should mention it and be upset or if I’m being sensitive and too silly. Any ideas? 

TLDR - partner gave housemates his Ritalin when he told me he wouldn’t give them to people as a party drug",05Jan2020,1
25,"I tried to kill myself in my mid twenties. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia at my hospital stay. I was living paycheck to paycheck and spending two weeks in the mental hospital meant I couldn’t afford rent when I got out. My parents came to the hospital and said “Yeah, bummer. So i guess you should plan on going to a homeless shelter.”

My schizophrenia was misdiagnosed as alcoholism up to that point because I was self medicating, but even in AA meetings and group sober homes I knew I was spaced out and confused and there was something else I couldn’t put my finger on.

I guess that’s how so many people with mental illness end up on the streets. You don’t just go to therapy and get properly diagnosed, properly medicated at the first sign of trouble. People are mad at you, you’re mad at yourself and confused why you can’t regulate your emotions. When you get to therapy what do you say? I’m depressed, I’m emotional. I’m very confused and delusional but I won’t realize that until years later.

Telling people “the best way to help is to not help.” is the biggest cop out, the excuse they’re looking for to “put it in gods hands” etc. 

My mom had cancer last year and I helped her every way I could. I spent a ton of free time with her taking care of her and she survived. Organically in conversation it came up how she used “tough love” on me when I was still hospitalized for a suicide attempt and she couldn’t apologize or admit that was wrong at all. I just imagined what if I had been so cold when she was at her most vulnerable? 

Interpersonal relationships are tough and I’m just not sure I want that person in my life who can’t reflect and admit it wasn’t the right thing to do.",05Jan2020,2

27," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",05Jan2020,0
28,"Hey guys, happy 2020. I wanted to share with you a recent period of empowering growth in my life: wearing goddamn comfy sexy thongs.

For the past year or so I’ve been buying online and wearing thong underwear. It was something I had been wanting to try for a while but was scared what that would “say” about me. I’m straight, have a girlfriend of 2.5 years and had been wearing boxers or briefs all my life. One day I see an Instagram ad for a free pair of male thongs if I sign up for a certain website. I brought it up to my girlfriend as a joke. “Hey honey, look, I can get this for free. Haha should I go for it, it’s free, it’s just for fun.” *nervous laughter from me.* She said of course I should go for it. 

So I log onto this website and sign up for my free pair, and I start browsing other brands/styles. G-strings, thongs, lingerie-style ones, lace ones, all of which seemed to be modeled by men who looked (stereotypically) like they’d be gay. There were some that I wasn’t quite interested in (only cause they looked uncomfortable) that were all flamboyant or sparkly or rainbow colored, which again furthered the notion that the consumer base for the website was probably predominately gay. (Something that might unfortunately scare many straight men away from buying thongs. Thanks toxic masculinity.) I added a bunch of items to my cart: some functional and comfy, some a little more frisky and sexy. 

When my cart was full I reviewed my items and debated canceling it. I looked back at the pictures of the models in the underwear I was getting. They all looked like the men I’d see walking down Santa Monica Blvd in West Hollywood during the Halloween carnival, bare butt flaunting and swaying, and I thought about how I might be perceived if anyone knew I was about to buy and wear these thongs. In hindsight, it sounds stupid and reeks of the same heteronormative/borderline homophobia/misogyny that I so despise. But even the woke-est of us accidentally fall into old traps sometimes. I told my girlfriend I was about to order a whole load of thongs and she said, “Fuck yeah, put your ass in some nice thongs.” And I ordered a whole batch of some nice things for my ass to go into. 

When they arrived I tried them all on and did a fashion show for my girlfriend. It sounds stupid but I was actually scared. (Which in hindsight is laughable to me.) “10/10 would bang,” she said. I looked at myself in the mirror, my weiner and balls all snugly tucked into the only part of the underwear that actually had fabric. I turned my waist and looked at my butt, the thong string wedged nicely betwixt my cheeks and the waistband accented my hips. I did a little twerk and a little twirl and the feeling I had next felt like a giant weight was lifted. I looked *good*. And then I realized how stupid and shitty my attitude was earlier when I was worried about seeming or feeling feminine. As if that’s even a bad thing, or even *relevant*. I told my girlfriend I’m a total asshole for even having the dumb worry that I’d be perceived as “gay”, again as if that’s even a negative thing or relevant at all. “Wear it proud babe,” she said. And I have been ever since. 

Let me tell you folks, there’s no such thing as non-masculine underwear. Gay, straight, queer or otherwise, thongs for men are amazing. You realize there’s nothing quite like wearing thongs when you get home at the end of the day, take off your underwear, and your balls actually smell *clean*. (Side-epiphany: balls only smell because they get overheated between your thighs and sweat. With thongs? They stay a little lifted away from your legs. Essentially NO ball sweat.) It’s fucking great. Just a clean, dry pair of danglies at the end of the day. Also very little ass sweat or annoying boxer-brief fabric rolling up your thigh. It’s like wearing a cloud. 

Another thing that’s fun about thongs is the knowledge that men wearing them kind of freaks larger society out. If you’re gay or queer? Sure, I mean *of course* you’d wear a thong. Women? You’re all but expected. Straight men? It’s boxers or briefs for you buddy. Walking around knowing that my little transgression is unknown to everyone around yet proudly worn by me, is fun and empowering. It makes me feel more in touch with my girlfriend (and thong-wearers as a whole) because now I can bond with her over the funny little nuances that come with wearing them. 

Men, I implore you, buy yourself a couple pairs of thongs. Try it out. It’s not going to emasculate you. If it does, you’re thinking about it all wrong. And, if you are looking for a relationship, find someone who not only is fine with them, but thinks you look sexy in them too.

There are literally no downsides, as far as I can see, to wearing some goddamn comfy sexy thongs. They look good, they feel like clouds, they prevent ball sweat and stink, and you get to feel like you’re giving a little “fuck you” to contemporary male masculinity standards. 

Buy a thong. Wear it proud. I’m probably not supposed to advertise a website but if you DM me I’ll send you a link to the website I use.",05Jan2020,18

31,"OK before people get their panties into a twist and say ""PEOPLE WITH SEVERE AUTISM CAN'T HELP THERE BEHAVIOR"" and blah blah blah, trust me, I'm fucking well aware. I've known this guy for almost 10 years. 10 GOD DAMN YEARS! In those 10 years, he has not learned a fuckin thing. I do this all now for his mother. But, I am trying to live my life. He has severe autism. Which used to be classified as Aspergers. I think it's ASD2 you can correct me on it Reddit. Over the last 10 years, I can tell you so many ridiculous stories. His mother calls me up while yelling at him, this happens at least once a month. I used to see him at the mall. Now I don't at all.   


So let me explain something - if you have never dealt with anyone with the severity of ASP/AUTISM like this, you have NO CLUE what it's like. I was in special ed my entire life, I sorta got stuck in there due to having severe ADHD and EBD. I'm not on any spectrum at all. This guy becomes way to obsessive. I WISH there was a girl this much into me. He messages me randomly, I tell him I'm busy. I get a message. I don't talk to him, I don't acknowledge his existence. I don't know what more to do. I've been telling him for fuckin years to relax, but that's not how this works. You have to be straight forward with someone like this. I am NOT a trained professional, I am nothing more than a friend to him. Even then that's sim as hell. That's like a tight rope walk with me at this point.

I hate to sound like a horrible person but I've up'd the price to see me to 50 bucks. I know, you guys are likely wanting to call me a horrible person because I don't want to put up with him FoR FrEe. I get it. Trust me I do. But deal with someone like this with little to know training or understanding for 10 years and you will also likely be like ""how?""

36,"This is a little bit random, but I just realized that whenever anybody ever comes to me about a problem they’re having with another person, I almost always tell them that the best approach is to be open and honest with that person about what you’re feeling, or thinking, or about the problem that you’re having. It just seems like the best way for anything, honesty is the best medicine as they say, so it’s what I always tell people to do. But am I at all correct in this?

I, like many people, am a huge hypocrite when it comes to giving advice. I always tell others to be open and honest with people about any problems, but I rarely do this myself. And when I do actually follow my own advice, sometimes it definitely works and sometimes it really feels like it doesn’t. I won’t get into specifics, but I’ve had a lot of hurt come from being open and honest with people about something, and I’ve regretted being open and honest about things a ton. I always try to rationalize it when it goes badly, I often say that it would’ve ended up worse had I not said anything and instead just kept quiet and let things maybe work themselves out, but despite these rationalizations I don’t always believe that. Sometimes it feels like keeping my deep, dark secrets deep and dark would’ve made things worse out way better for me than they did. Other times however, for those exact same thing, it feels like I did the right and best thing by confessing my secrets, despite the pain or sorrow or loss it brought me, because not doing so would’ve only made things end up worse. And as I said, I often have these feelings about the exact same things at different times, depending on my mood or how that thing is affecting me at that particular moment.

So I’m not sure if I’ve really been giving good advice. There are two things that I’ve believed for my whole life; one comes from my religious views, that everything happens for a reason, both the good and the bad; and the other is that honesty is always the best course of action, no matter what. In terms of my second view, am I wrong? The optimistic side of me says that this is correct, but for some reason I’m questioning that right now, and I’d like others opinions and perspectives on it, even if it may not ultimately change my mind in the end.",05Jan2020,1

41,"i like to think that i’m a hardworking student, or at least i thought i was. i went to a comprehensive school where i easily stood out from all my classmates for the extra effort i put into all my work, yet i was never really recognised by teachers for my work. 

thankfully a grammar school i joined last september was able to help me realise that i wasn’t just a mediocre try hard student who just wanted to suck up to teachers, but allow me to put my brain to good use and actually start using it to learn some relevant shit.
   
obviously i’m starting my GCSEs now and of course it’s a common worry that i don’t know if i’m gonna do well or not. procrastination plays a huge role in my studies and coursework, as well as having quite a low self esteem whenever i hear super smart kids easily retain so much scientific information. why accept me into medical school when you can take them instead? my parents are middle-eastern, and at first you may assume that yes, they expect a lot from me and that they always want to se me put 100% effort into everything, always getting a the top grades or whatever. 

however it’s not entirely like that. they just want to see me try my best. they always recognise my hard work and my effort into all my coursework and test scores, which i am INCREDIBLY grateful for. but now the word COMPETITION has come into play, being in a school with the uks top percent of academic students who will definitely end up as lawyers or surgeons. they want to see me be the best and i know that will certainly not happen. 

here’s where the problem kicks in: i don’t like competitiveness, i hate trying to be the best because it just puts too much stress on me. i want to carry on in this school just doing the best that i can do but everyone else around me seems to be doing much better than me and it really brings me down. i am interested in radiology and really want to be in that sort of field of speciality when i leave university, but this theme of competing seems to recur in every step of life. i hate it. so much.

it’s literally the last day of my holidays and i have two science tests to revise for and an art assignment to complete and i am fucking panicking. 

i want to change this mindset because i know right know if this attitude i have towards my school life carries on like this, i’m not going to get where i wanna be when i’m a fully grown adult. 

gimme some help, guys. i’m just a puzzled child and lost. i want to be happy in my future and i want to be the best i can be. i want to put my intelligence to good use, i want to show that to the world but i just don’t have the motivation to do so. gimme some advice: how do i psyche myself up for revision early before i leave it to the last minute? how do i keep thinking positively? how can i stop worrying about what other people are doing and just focus on my own path? 

your responses will mean a lot to me. any tips/ advice will greatly be appreciated thank you :)",05Jan2020,1

45,"I served from 2013-2017 and I guess I was enthusiastic for a month or two after I got out that I had served. After a while, maybe like a month or two later, the shine had faded and I was left with the veteran status. 

I don’t go around like them other fellers with the veteran hats or grunt style tees sporting their patriotism and their love for the military. I left for a reason and I didn’t feel like literally and figuratively wearing the title of a veteran benefited me any because... well... I don’t think I did anything in the service worth being called a veteran. 

I served in the pacific for three years but I never deployed. I never saw combat. The problems I faced pale in comparison to those that have actually faced the stresses of being shot at. So, for years now, I’ve just tried to avoid referencing my veteran status in public. 

That’s not to say I didn’t try to connect with other veterans, though. Believe me. I’ve tried. I’ve tried to connect with veterans at the military office at the university I attend, I’ve tried to join veteran groups online, and even went out of my way to participate in events that host other veterans. 

I know this doesn’t define how every veteran is, but most of my experiences have been less than stellar. Most veterans I’ve met have been quick to compare their service with mine and one or two shoved their deployment experience in my face as being more important than mine. One guy in an online group stopped speaking to me completely once he found out I didn’t deploy or saw combat. 

I’m sorry if that sounds like I’m complaining because I’m not trying to. I try to minimize conflicts with other people, especially fellow veterans. It just feels like I’ve found myself in this predicament post-service where I don’t feel like I can even connect with other veterans. I’ve experienced too much to be considered a civilian who didn’t serve, but I guess I haven’t experienced enough to be considered a true veteran either. 

I guess that’s it. Thanks for reading this far if you have.",05Jan2020,1

Warning: Profanity

There is no TLDR, this is a non-fiction story.

OB = brother older by 6y - YB = brother younger by 2y

I went to the first three years of high school in IL, then moved in with my OB in NC, so that I could graduate in 1993. I got pregnant within a week of graduating, despite diligent birth control, and gave my daughter up for adoption. The adoption agency was in NJ and after the adoption, OB loaned me enough money to purchase a rusty 1978 El Camino for $275, get it legal, and get it back to NC (about $800). My OB and I had a stereotypical(?) sibling relationship. He was/is a faithful Christian Corporate Capitalist., worked in the ""Wealth Management"" division of a well-known international banking conglomerate, and owned a two-bedroom, very spacious condo, in an upper-middle class subdivision.

Our mother passed away from a prolonged battle with brain cancer in 1987. YB and I have the same father, who is my OB's step-father. Our parent's marriage dissolved around the same time she was diagnosed.

YB and I are close. We had rarely been away from each other, farther than a few cities, for more than a few months. Living in NC, I became bitter toward OB for what I felt was coercion with regard to the adoption. I went back to IL, petitioned for, and gained temporary custody of YB until he was able to move to my OB's home in NC. While in IL, I sold the El Camino and took a bus back to NC.

Things weren't as easy in NC, as I'd hoped they'd be for YB, away from what I thought was a more toxic environment in IL.  OB’s condo was between school districts and YB couldn't enroll in the high school that had made such a positive impact in my life. There was a significant difference between the educational quality of the two, so he stopped attending. In the fall of 1994, YB and friend used friend's mom's car to go ""driving around"" and got charged with Unlawful Use of a Vehicle. The vehicle was returned unharmed, but YB was criminally charged. YB was placed in a group home.

While YB was in the group home, OB got a transfer opportunity that sent him out of town a lot. For the new placement to be permanent, he had to sell his condo. I worked at McDonald's, saved as much money as I could, and threw parties for randoms. OB originally just wanted to sell the condo, outright, but that idea created quite a bit of panic for me, so we worked it out that I would repaint the condo in exchange for the ability to rent the condo from him at $900/mo until it sold. OB had originally painted the interior walls a dark-seafoam-aqua-teal, and in order to put the condo on the market, he was required by the HOA to repaint it a color that was less ""holy shit.""

YB was allowed to be out during thanksgiving, but when the staff of the group home took the other kids to look at Christmas lights, YB was prohibited from attending. They left him at the home, so YB made his escape.

The authorities were looking for him for a few weeks, and I am not certain that I knew where he was. After some time, YB came home, took a sleeping bag and left. A neighbor called the police and reported suspicious activity as he left the property. He was picked up and taken to juvenile detention.

I made decisions that betrayed him out of fear for his safety. I thought that it was more important to know where he was than to let him choose his choices. I felt I owed him, and could provide him with, a better chance at success than just being tossed around. When the court date was set to decide whether he would stay in juvenile detention or return to a group home, in the spring of '95, I knew I had to be there.

There wasn't a bus that could get there on time, so I walked 8 miles in business attire, heels in my purse, sneakers on my feet, to be there for his hearing. Win! I petitioned for, and was granted, temporary custody of him, again, until such time that the court approved his emancipation. He asked for a cigarette when we left court, and of course I obliged! I've always tried to be a good sister, but I was not a good guardian. We did not walk back to our OB's, rather, we enjoyed the bus.

OB purchased a [Wagner paint sprayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjCRtRrlqRQ) for the job. This was one of the key decisions that secured our failure. We were in the dark days, before interwebs. You didn't look up ""painting tutorial"" in an encyclopedia. You couldn't check reviews on the efficacy of a product you weren't familiar with. No transportation = no library. I didn't know anything about painting over a dark color with a light color and, despite the sincerity with which YB was on board, he didn't know anything either. We began work on the condo that winter.

After high school, I had managed to keep in touch with one friend. She was co-conspirator on the partying, but we didn't really know anyone else. We'd go down to the beach, in her car, invite people to be at my OB's address by, say, 2am, and have a house party. We broke a lot of rules: throwing parties, smoking in the garage, using his bed. We were not destructive. On the contrary, I wanted to succeed.

We had about six weeks to complete the task: a living-room, two bedrooms, a L-shaped hallway, the foyer, the stairwell, the dining-room, and den. The condo had 15ft vaulted ceilings, as well. We painted M-F, all day. Each plastic paint canister that attached to the sprayer held a quart. Every quart required the spray nozzle be unclogged twice. Unclogging the sprayer involved disassembling the sprayer nozzle, using a brush to clean debris, and clearing it with hot water. Each wall took about 3 gallons. This task was way above my pay-grade.

We must have applied five coats of paint to each wall to prevent the blue from bleeding through. When the last week rolled around, we started smoking inside, as we didn't want to stop working for anything. We pulled a few all-nighters, but in the end, we did not finish the master bathroom/bedroom.

The anxiety and terror were real, but I don't remember trying to plead my case. I figured that I failed and deserved what came next. I met my future husband within a couple of months. He’s a professional contractor, or was before his body gave out. Over the 23 years we've been together, he has helped me understand that, even with his skills, there was no way that the job could have been done effectively with the tools we had.

On one hand, it's a shame, it would have changed my life forever to have not been homeless. On the other hand, who gets lucky enough to meet someone that they can tolerate, and can tolerate them, for 20+ years? If I had to choose between finishing that condo and never meeting my husband, well, I just don't think I could make that choice.

My big little brother (YB) deserves the most success out of anyone I know.

If I do anything of value, it’s because I want YB to be proud of me.

I was at the gas station minding my own business pumping gas, I was going to meet up a friend and I was already late. 

Some Hungarian dude in a white Denali pulls up talking about I lost my wallet, blah blah blah, I just need gas. I'm from New York.. please help.

""Sure thing I said"" It's happened to me before so I'll give em gas money. I gave him $30. He gives me this gold ring, talking about, ""it's worth $400, keep it. Thank you for being nice"" but something tells me it's fake.., why not just pawn it to get cash and go back home?  But fucl logic I guess. Anyway I'm like okay I'm done here.

 I check his plates they're from Pennsylvania... more red flags. 

He goes on to say he need more money for food and a hotel. My broke ass at this point I only have $70 in my account. 


And the funny part is that the fucking ATM wasn't working I tried like 7 times until it worked. WHY. DID. I. TRY. SO. HARD!?

IT WAS A SIGN!

But
 
I mean, what if he really does need it? Shit happens right? So he gives me this gold chain, this one.. this one is real, I felt it in my gut. Again saying ""give me more, I give you this chain""

$70 in my account. And my dumbass give him $70 dollars.

After I give him the money he goes "" listen you gave me, money right? For gas, food, but the chain, it's not enough for the chain, can I get it back""

So guess what I did. I gave it back. ""Keep the ring"" he says. I kept the ring I told him to have a good one and good luck on your journey.

Right after I go to a pawn shop. In hopes that my $100 will yield a nice ROI. I pull up the counter and say ""I found this ring"" Ashamed because I know I got scammed. And with glance she goes, ""it's fake."" She does the little nitrous test thing or whatever and it is.. it's fake. 

So here I am at 4:03 AM feeling like shit, thinking about why I was so damn dumb when I've turned countless people away. In the back of my head I really hope that he really did need money, but I know he didn't.

84,"I've had issues concentrating for about 3 years now. It got really bad last year in school, and even if I paid attention in class I'd forget what we'd learn or even what we did after school. 

The same applied to everyday life. Conversations, tasks, anything I found uninteresting, and even some things I found interesting never stuck with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate this term, because people love to throw it around like some medal and flaunt it as something that's cool to have, but I think I have ADD or ADHD. 

Last year, my mom wanted to get me tested. The issue is that my dad doesn't believe in ADHD. He said he'd go to court to block my medication (he can't do that, that's bs.) So, I being the total pussy that I was and still am, backed off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now.  I still have issues concentrating. I'll randomly zone out in class, and than reconnect with reality and realize I have no idea whats happening. I have no idea how to control this. Last year I tried to zone into classes but failed miserably. 

I think you see the problem.  I don't want to start shit with my dad because him and I get along well right now, and his house (parents divorced) is a really chill place for me because we have such a lack of disagreements.

87,"Another decade over. 

I'm soon to turn a quarter century. 

I had a great childhood, many friends to ride bikes, play hide and seek, video games and football with. I liked high school too. I had a lot of friends there, although I wasn't great with girls (still ain't). Decided to save my parents some money and go to a subpar college and stay at home. I didn't meet many people in college, especially as I kept in touch with some high school friends. I didn't learn much or ""find myself"" as one is supposed to. Still, I got a well-paying job as an engineer and worked for a couple of years. A few months ago I moved to London for graduate school. I still don't *really* like what I'm doing, but at least I got to meet a lot of cool people, joined a few societies, work out, swim, meditate. I never liked programming, but I never really liked *anything* else enough to make it my job, and I saw software engineering as a ""lesser evil"" in that sense. I had a girlfriend in high school who never really loved me, but nothing much after that. I did start dating after moving to London, but I'm so far removed from the scene, I don't really know how to make anything stick, and fuck up unfuckable situations all the time. 

I feel like I've wasted the past 5 years of my life. Even though it seems like life is better than before, grad school will soon be over, and I'll have to get back to reality again. Even if life does get better afterwards, I can't imagine it being any better than the golden days of being 12.

I don't really like what I'm doing, and I'm not good at it either. I can't see how any woman would ever love me for who I am. I got chronic back pain, and my knees still hurt from an injury 10 years ago, and it won't get any better for sure. My parents are only getting older, and who knows what could happen with them in the future. In a future where I'll have to take care of them. Without any siblings or relatives either. By the looks of it, without a wife either. I'm still young enough to not be too overshadowed by my friends, but that will inevitably happen sooner or later. 

I looks like my life jumped the shark 10 years ago and it's only downhill from here.

Anyone with me on this one?",05Jan2020,3

90,"These past few years have really ruined me. I've flunked out of a college I never wanted to go to, I spent all of 2018 trying not to kill myself, I've applied to hundreds of jobs with not one call. I've seen my peers either pass me and have successful fulfilling lives, or they're stuck without a clear way forward, and I don't know which makes me feel worse. People are constantly telling me it will all work out, that God has a plan, but that's what I thought when I went to CSUN. It was the only college that accepted me, so I thought obviously this is where God want me. But here I am, 27, overweight, unemployed, rejected by colleges and jobs alike, with few I would truly consider friends and so much fear of losing them that I don't try to hang out with them because I'm afraid that I'll depress them or I'm actually anoyying them. With all this it just feels like how do I know God's plan isn't for me to take myself out. I want to tell people what's really going on in my head but I've discovered that at best nothing happens when I do. Most don't bother really listening and offer quick fortune cookie-esque advice. Others have too much on their plate already and it's not fair for me to burden then with my issues too. My counselor says I have self worth issues, and I guess it's true, but how could I not. Schools don't want me, jobs don't want me, friends don't want me, and girls seem utterly uninterested. I fail at just about everything I try. My mental illness and lack of social skills has limited the jobs I could realistically do. All I want in life is to find a girl that I want to spend the rest of my life with and raise a family and have a career that grants me some financial security so I can take care of a family. Waking up every day with nothing to do, no purpose in life had left me feeling hollow.I comfort myself with thinking about better times, but these memories are bittersweet.

My morning started off with my roommate opening the front door. He sounded all nervous greeting the people. Then, he went into my room saying that “bro you fucked up.” When I realized it was the police and they were “looking for me,” I was freaking out, because I thought I did something. I was scared. 
 
Apparently I indeed did sleep on the wrong side of the bed enough to somehow had my iPhone XS Max SOS sent out in the morning to my family. Family got worried and tried to call but I was in deep sleep. They ended up calling 911 (?) —I haven’t clarified with them, but the police didn’t show up until like three hours later, so I’m assuming. But yea, I was so confused this morning when the police told me I made an SOS. I didn’t have my phone in my hands, so I thought someone made a prank call in my name and address, or something. 

I really thought I was getting arrested regardless I haven’t done anything though. 

My phone was sitting on my bed charging. I never thought this would happen!!

95,"Hello! First of all I’d like to say that I’ll be treating anxiety, suicidal thoughts and self harm, so if you’re triggered by these topics please stop reading.
I’m a 19 year old italian girl, living in Milan, and you might be wondering why the heck am I writing here in another language, well it is because I never felt comfortable opening up in my native language, I find it way more easy to do it in english, also because I think english is an amazing language and I really like it.
It’s been so long since I talked to someone about my feelings and my thoughts, and every time I’d be judged, mistreated, or told that I was only attention-seeking or acting. I have daily thoughts about killing myself, I already tried to do it twice in the past by cutting but didn’t succeed, I have scars all over my forearms and right leg, I even started to cover them up with tattoos but I can still feel they’re there, on my skin, judging me and tricking me into doing it again. People stare all the time, making me feel uncomfortable, one time a guy even told me that they were ugly to see and that I should cover them all up as soon as possible. It’s getting harder every day to get out of bed, I’ve been lying under my sheets for about 2 days by now, getting up only to go to the bathroom or fetch something to eat. Everytime I look in the mirror I burst in tears, thinking about how hideous I look. I spend my days crying, watching movies and eating junk food, feeling unworthy even of my own family and boyfriend. 
Everything started since my ex boyfriend punched me in the stomach and left me in a desert street at 4 in the morning. It took me more than half an hour to get home crawling and crying. He always reminded me that I was nothing without him and that nobody actually loved me except from him. He always said that my scars were scary and disgusting, and the last time I cut he brought me to my parents by force and showed them my arms, telling them that I needed help. I’ve never felt more ashamed of myself in my whole life.
Of course, I managed to break up with him, but he started showing up at my school, my house, crying his eyes out and asking for forgiveness. Police was involved, and he cannot stick around me anymore.
But, right now, everything he told me is still clear in my mind, and I often think he was right, that I am in fact worthless, stupid, a b*tch, an attention-seeker, when the only thing that I actually want is to disappear. 
I have an amazing guy by my side now, and he’s the only reason I’m still breathing, apart from my family that had to suffer because of me.
Guilt and depression are devouring me from the inside, these intrusive thoughts are destroying my everyday life, school is going downwards, my grades are obviously affected, and everything revolves around one single thing: suicide.
Please, forgive me if there are any grammar mistakes, I’d like to now if somebody is or has been in my same situation and how they got or they would get out of it. I really need advice, and venting to a bunch of strangers is the only thing that I can do, since therapy is too expensive for my family and I feel to ashamed to open up completely to them or my boyfriend. 
Thank you",05Jan2020,1

107,"We've had this thing for a year now and here's my biggest problem with this thing, despite being 180 fucking dollars, you do not own it. For it to actually function you are forced into a monthly/yearly subscription to get full use of the device. It is active all day long, but will only record when it detects activity, that means depending on the software entirely if someone breaks into your cars or walks to the side of your house. You can set the detection area to the entire screen and it will still miss things because the software detection sucks at night except when someone walks to your front porch. We've had people break into our cars despite setting sensitivity to max and pointed directly to the porch and driveway. It has an app that lets you view the live camera feed, so I figure what the hell *shrugs* I bought a 5 TB hard drive last year, since I have the space I might as well do the recording myself since it didn't catch shit on it's AI and at least I'll have full 24 hour recordings. So I downloaded OBS software and an android app launcher and set my own recording setup since this device failed twice to record break-ins already. And do you know what Kuna does when you view the live feed for more than a couple hours? It disables the live feed. I thought it might have been a wifi problem so I gave it it's own wifi channel, gave it a static ip to connect to, and still this thing black screens. It is fucking ridiculous to me that they can do this to people who drop that much money on it and still have to be entirely dependent on their fucking subscription ecosystem that only detects reliably like 5 fucking feet from the camera at night and doesn't give you the option to have 24 hour/7 days a week recordings. THAT YOU DON'T EVEN OWN, the recordings go to their cloud servers! And you have to manually download each one. Even if you have a subscription, they delete the recordings if the device loses power or wifi. And if you try to do the recordings yourself it fucking disables itself to prevent people from using the fucking thing you paid almost 200 dollars for because they want you to use their subscription service.

126,"So, I’m mixed, mostly white but also Hispanic, so I ended up with very pale skin and hella dark body hair, right? It’s not particularly thick, but it’s long, so it looks thick, my calves are the hairiest, top of my thighs aren’t that noticeable, but the backs of my thighs are, not like my calves, but still distinctly hairy. I’ve also got super sensitive skin

I recently made the decision late August (2019) to stop shaving my legs, due to various reasons, sensitive skin included. I’ve tried almost everything, razors, nair, at home wax strips, basically everything except hot wax (again, sensitive skin, I knew that’d be a no go). All of these methods ended up hurting in one or way or another (the nair left a bald spot on one calf that’s only just grown back in). The only razor that’s ever not hurt me was a Dollar Shave Club razor, but shaving my legs still took me anywhere from a half hour to an hour or more, depending

I was sick of feeling self conscious, of spending money, and wasting time doing something i hated and only did because I felt societally compelled to, so I finally decided to just stop. I timed it to where I last shaved the day before my college’s band camp started, so as the hair grew back in it would just seem like I was too tired to bother (and I was) and the people around me would understand. Then, as the full season went on, I just never shaved, and if any of my friends (or others) noticed, they didn’t say anything. But that ended, and was the only time I wore shorts anyways, so it was easy to avoid the self-consciousness of being unshaven in any other situation

But spring is coming around soon, and my campus is in Texas, so it’s gonna get h o t. I seriously don’t wanna shave again, my skin feels better and is genuinely healthier, I save SO much time in the shower, but my anxiety is coming back full force. It’s one thing to not shave when you’re around friends who, if they did wanna know, would understand my reasons, vs around the general public, where some people have no qualms about letting you know how they think you should look

I’ve got nice tights that are fully opaque and thick enough that you can’t tell I have hair, but I only use those for when I’m at a formal event (ie a dress/skirt). men/amab folk are expected to wear long pants, which hides hair, so I don’t really mind that expectation for formal stuff

I guess I’m just tired of being afraid to let my body exist naturally. Adult females have body hair! It’s a normal and expected secondary sex characteristic! But for whatever reason only men/AMAB people are allowed to just, let it be. If it were truly about hygiene, like we get told, then they would be expected to do it too. I realize I shouldn’t care what strangers think but clinical anxiety doesn’t let me not care. Anyone else struggling with this?",05Jan2020,1
128,"I'm an 18 year old dude, currently at university. Loving it, made a bunch of new friend. I'm not amazing looking, I'm about average, but I have no problem talking to girls. The issue is, I have a big foot fetish. It's always been weird for me growing up, when me and my mates would talk about porn and what categories we'd watch. I've always been a good liar, I would sometimes memorise the names of pornstars that I'd never watched just so I could pretend that I was ""normal"" and join in the discussion. In reality, I've never really watched ""normal"" porn. Fast forward, and now I'm deeply embarrassed about my fetish. It's not like being gay or trans - society generally accepts people (as they should) who are LGBTQ or at the very least, people don't openly make fun of them out of fear of backlash. It's different when you have such a fetish. There is no movement that helps people with fetishes and they're probably never will be. People didn't choose to be gay, and I didn't choose my fetish, however, the former is protected and celebrated by society, whereas the latter is made fun of openly. 

At school I had to join in. I was too afraid of being labeled a ""foot fetishist"" and so whenever the topic of fetishes came up (however rare it was) I would be the first to say ""ew, feet are gross etc."". It worked, nobody suspected a thing, but now that I'm at university, it's harder for me to hide it. Not because I can't - it's very easy to hide it from other people - but I realise that my foot fetish is a part of who I am and I can't escape it. It's better to embrace it, and I can't keep running away from it, and need to be open about it with people that I want to have sex with. 

But it's hard. 

It's really really hard. 

For a number of reasons. For example, I like this girl in my halls of residence. I could have had sex with her several times, but I kept making excuses. Like, this girl literally dragged me to her room on her birthday and kissed me, but my dumbass told her I was too tired and left all because I was too afraid of my fetish coming out. What if she told people? What if those people told other people? I don't want to be made fun of. Especially at a stage in my life where everything is going so well. Also, I can't get hard without feet being involved somehow. How the fuck do I tell her that I need to see her feet. Even as I'm typing this I'm just thinking to myself how fucking weird I am. Also, what if, for whatever reason, I can't get hard. What if I'm drunk etc. 

I could ramble about this for ages, but my fetish is seriously starting to impact my life. I would give it up, but at the same time, it's very hard to be as open as I'd want about it in a society that shuns it and mocks you for it. Not as extreme, and I'm being hyperbolic here, but it feels like being gay in the 1960s. 

I wonder if I'm ever going to have a proper relationships. Or have a family. Or children. Id love to have all of these things, and if I didn't have a fetish, I could have easily achieved the first, but...yeh.

Sometimes I'd had sucidal thoughts as well. Nothing crazy, just minor shit, and if other factors in my life were in a much worse state then maybe I would have offed myself a while ago, but I'm thankful and lucky for my parents, friends and opportunities that I've been blessed with. 

It's just this little abnormality that is gnawing away at my mental health for a while now, and I'm not sure how to tackle it. 

Fuck. Vent over. Thanks for readinf this far if you did.",05Jan2020,1
129,"The main reason people who like their SO or future SO to have no social media because it doesn’t give them a chance to possibly cheat by talking to other people online or post pictures of their body on social media apps (like bikini pics on Instagram).

130,"I've gone to the hospital almost 5 times in 3 months. It's not like I want to go. I had shingles, a kidney infection, found out I now also have arthralgia (it's like beta stage 0 of arthritis), and 2 went again for something else but I Can't remember what the other 2 are.   


But I got a call from a collections agency say I own 10k now. Why the fuck does healthcare cost so much? I'll never be  able to pay all that. I'm not remotely rich. What do they expect? Me to just DIE? No. THROW ME IN PRISON FOR LACK OF PAYMENT! This reminds me of when Obama was going to try and charge people for not having healthcare. People who can't afford healthcare, BETTER MAKE THEM PAY TO MAKE SURE THEY PAY BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE!

135,"It absolutely sucks. Mental health issues are on the rise and family units are more fluid, which means the kids are having life changes more often. I'm sick of sitting though meetings about curriculum and the wording of a criteria sheet on an assessment task they will never remember, when making sure our students are noticed, known and valued comes last. I get so frustrated when I notice a change in one of my students so I take them for a walk around the oval at lunch and they start opening up about serious stuff but the bell goes and we both have classes to go to so we have to pick up the conversation later. I hated when a girl who lost her mother last year looked me in the eyes and said ""I wish you could adopt me"" and I couldn't even put a hand on her shoulder because we are not permitted to initiate physical contact with students. I want to scream when a student says ""you're the only one who really wants to know how we're actually going"" when that is so not true. I work with some of the kindest, most selfless people who desperately want to be there for their students, but we're all digging our way out from under constant avalanches of admin, marking and paperwork. It breaks my heart when a student gives me permission to talk to their parents about what they're struggling with, only for it to fall on deaf ears or for the parents to indicate that they, themselves, are not coping but reject support and references to services. I don't judge them, though, becuse I don't know their lives from the inside. 


I don't give a flying ferrit if you can write a perfect essay or score 100% on your tests - in fact, that often comes with immense pressure and can warp your sense of value and identity - I care that you're ok and so many of our kids and teenagers are not ok. They know they're inheriting a suffering world, they feel powerless and not heard. They are facing complexities we were blisfully ignorant to, new ways of connecting and viewing a world that has the constant undertone of ""you're not enough"" and ""you don't have enough"" and we're too busy making sure they know what a proper noun is or testing them on a mathematical concept they will never use again to debunk those messages.


I just wish we spent our time teaching kids to be good, empathetic people. Yes, they need to know how to file taxes and the fundamentals of being a functioning adult (which, by the way, I can't see in our curriculum) and they have every right to pursue learning and dive into academia as as deep as they want to - and we should be stretch and support their learning as far as they can and want to go, but their wellbeing should come first. Right now, I don't see that anywhere.",05Jan2020,1
