0,"I started 2020 pre-planning my whole life (29f) at the time and my only 2 goals were graduate with an Associates Degree after 3 long years of taking part time online classes at Community college and to buy my first house by June, which would be my 30th bday!! 

But the year had took a turn for the worst before I even knew how bad life could get. My father in law suffered his first heart attack, and then had a double bypass in February and my life changed forever I believe. I became his sole caregiver while also trying to raise my 10 year old peanut, my 14 year old stepson, console my loving spouse because men can’t bear to face reality if death is looming in regards to their parents and I was also working full time along with taking my college classes. 

THEN BOOM! March hits and COVID is lingering in America and states are preparing shutdowns as my father in law is now within a nursing facility to gain his strength back and by April, he would be released to us to finally come home ONLY to suffer his second heart attack and get sent right back to the ER all within a 24 hour period. And to add some bitterness, the hospital confirmed he was positive for COVID and the fact he was with us a full 24 hours prior made my head explode with fear for all my boys in the house. He is released after 4 days of monitoring on orders to be quarantined and if there was a bright side to it, I never saw my spouse clean the damn house so much within those 14 days we had his father locked away in the bedroom to ensure we wouldn’t catch it.

So fast forward to June and my father in law is healthy enough and now negative for COVID to get his 2nd heart surgery which went off without a hitch. End of June nears and I turn 30 which amounted to me downing a bottle of wine at my dining room table secretly wondering how life got so bad in 3 months but again, I had one more goal to accomplish!! I was house hunting and as houses came and went off the market due to the insanely low interest rates, I was devastated that every home I “loved” kept being taken off the market for $15k way over asking!! But I didn’t give up!! July hits and I’m finally done my 63 credits to be a college graduate, which I wanted my boys to witness that no matter what life throws, keep pushing (but secretly I was breaking).

And then comes August, August 1st to be exact, where in a rare moment in time, it was just me and my better half going furniture hunting for a house we didn’t even buy yet and he tells me the craziest idea, that he wanted one more child. I laughed and told him let’s worry about his father first before we bring kids into a pandemic when we are almost done raising our 2 boys. And that’s when it hit me, I was late on my period and I figured what is the harm in “just checking” that evening. And sure enough, the damn test came back positive.

So here I am, October and I accomplished 3 things instead. I got my college degree, I just closed on my new home on Oct 8th, and I am currently 16 weeks pregnant. A pregnancy that is blessed as this is the first viable pregnancy I’ve had since my son in 2009. I have suffered 10 miscarriages and 1 ectopic during that time and the fact that this pregnancy is here, during a pandemic and during the wildest year of my 30 years on this Earth, I can honestly say, maybe this year wasn’t meant to be the year from Hell. But the year were I learned so much about myself and the lengths I went through for my family that I honestly wouldn’t have had it any other way.",11Oct2020,1
3,"After years of recovery due to our mental health, my boyfriend and I are allowed to be together. We met in the psych ward, spent three days together, until life made it impossible for us to meet. We were sent to two very different rehab facilities and were reduced to nothing but letters because of HIPPA laws. But I had realized very quickly that I wasn’t interested in commitment, I wanted to use and drink and... I guess experience. I was 19 and very, very dumb. So I walked away. I ghosted. 
This man found me a year and a half later, we were both much better than before but he had advanced the most. The change was inspiring. 
After talking, and admitting that he hasn’t known anyone else in the time we spent apart I was crushed. How could I have done that to somebody? At this point I’m half in love with him again. I never expected what he did next.
He gave me a second chance.
In the six months we’ve been truly together, I became better. I had goals. Plans. I socialized. I cleaned up. My apartment is a home. My hobbies make me happy. I’m dancing.
This was it. 
And then today, I had decided that if he ever asked, I’d absolutely say yes. 
Yes.",11Oct2020,1

6,"So my child came home from school and was very upset that the teacher showed a documentary of a school shooting. It showed students been shoot and dying. My child now can’t sleep at night and is truly Traumatised of what was shown. I looked up the documentary and it was rated R and reviews had said definitely not for kids. It’s so hard watching my child have to go though these emotions, of something that could of been avoided.",11Oct2020,1
7,"Fuck 2020. My girlfriend and I live in different countries. She was supposed to be here with me for 3 months as she just finished her bachelor degree. I am a practicing occupational therapist and travel the country for emergency jobs where Healthcare is limited. 

I haven't see her in 10 months. She recently had an emergency medical procedure (this is my public Reddit account so I won't go into detail). I couldn't physically be there for her as she laid in a hospital bed for days in recovery. 

Then, my family and I test covid positive on my birthday. I sent my father to the emergency room and he's been in a hospital for over a week. We cannot see him. My brother was just sent to the ER because COVID can mess with the cardiovascular system, and after assessing him, had to make sure he was addressed asap. Hopefully he comes home tonight. 

I now may lose an important contract because I tested positive and was sick. Im feeling better though. 

I am in massive student loan debt, half my family is sick, my girlfriend is in tremendous pain, and I have Donald Trump telling me not to worry about COVID-19. 

When I do work with COVID patients, or skilled nursing facilities, I have compromised patients living in fear. I have patients who didn't, and haven't, seen their families in months.

2020 has been rough. Brutal. But, it has made me realize I really need to take care of myself. I need to make sure I am available when my loved ones need me. I am no longer living for myself, but for those around me. People depend on me. 

Fuck 2020, but thank you 2020 for teaching me something important while I'm only 30. Fuck you, but thank you.",11Oct2020,1
8,For those of you who don’t know in the USAF we call the person we share a bathroom with our pissmate. We don’t share a room or kitchen with them but there’s a bathroom in between our room.

11,"I am either developing depression or I definitely have it. Recently, I moved to a new place because I graduated from medical school and had to move for training. I always had these tendencies in school, but I lived with my mom who talked to me and was always nice to me so I never felt it quite like now. I could also use it to motivate myself to study, but that was a bad habit that I formed.

So, back to what I was talking about. I moved away for the first time in my life. I signed up for this prior to covid. I didn't want a roommate because I had bad experiences with those in college. So far, I've been totally isolated in my one bedroom apartment. I go to work where I have made one, maybe two friends who hang out with me maybe once a week and that is the only out of work social interaction I have. I have no family other than my mom, so she checks in on me sometimes, but not really.  I used to have a normal family with people, but they all died my dad when I was young and the rest in the past 2-3 years because my parents were older when they had me. This leaves me with a lot of time to... think. I should be studying, but I feel it is difficult to concentrate because I am so miserable here.  I don't even feel like calling my mom anymore because I just sit around and do nothing.

I try to make friends with coworkers, but they are all married and have their own lives going on understandably. I've never really had an easy time making friends, and there's no one who just moved here alone like me that I know. I can tell I am spiraling because I don't even feel anxious anymore I just don't care. I feel slowed down, I don't have any motivation to get out or do anything, I forget to eat and don't feel like eating anymore.  I don't have any interest in things. 

It sucks. I feel like I am losing it. I think it'd be nice to date somebody down here to have someone to spend my time with, but I actually have a fiancé long distance who I love or did love, but I don't hear from him too much and I think that is contributing to this. I don't feel connected to him. He wants to move down here next summer after we get married, but I don't know if that is right and that is another thing contributing to my mental state. Speaking of him, I can also see my deterioration in our texts because everything I say is super negative and dark when I used to not be like that.

I need to exercise and work through this. I want to do it on my own because if I don't and have to get help then you have to report that on your license for the rest of your life. I'm not suicidal and I am functional at work, so I am giving myself a chance to get through this. I say that, but simultaneously I am sitting alone in my apartment and am drinking a protein shake because I forgot to eat dinner. 

I am going to go to the grocery and exercise tomorrow. 

Thanks for listening to my rant.",11Oct2020,1
12,"four years ago I (33f) found myself going through a divorce at age 29. I was heart broken, broke and miserable. He did some very hurtful things that untimely led to our split, and I had to leave. He even ended up with our house (that I built and designed) because I couldn’t afford the mortgage on my own. I was decreased, moved in with my friend, and started over. 

Me and that same friend ended up starting a business together a year later. It was something we always dreamt about doing but would push aside (we’ve been friends since we were kids). The business took off and I managed to eventually leave the job I resented, I paid off my student debt, and most importantly, loved and felt fulfilled in my career. I also ended up meeting someone who makes me happier than I ever thought I could be. We recently got engaged. 

Even though after my divorce I thought things wouldn’t get better, I managed to persevere with the help of friends, family and a lot of therapy. Looking back, if I knew my life would lead me down the path to where I am now, the shame, shitty ex-husband, and countless emotional breakdowns would all be worth it.

I’m also just really really proud of myself for seeking help when I needed it, bettering myself, and finally following my dreams. Especially when I chose to do so at a time in my life when I was at my weakest. I feel strong! I just wanted to share that and say it “out loud” because I don’t know how to express that feeling in my daily life. Yeah, I’m proud of myself. :)",11Oct2020,1

This is a super important year for me because it’s when my life truly starts. It may sound cliche but it’s true.

17,"


It’s not like I love bossing people around. I kind of fear giving people my opinion if they don’t agree and am not pushy with others. I hate telling people no or that I disagree with them. I really enjoy giving others advice and helping them with their problems. My friends all say I give really good advice especially about guy problems. 

But I never ask my friends opinions about situations I’m in-it’s almost like I’m afraid to get advice from others because I’m afraid of different viewpoints or something I don’t know why. I feel when I open up to my friends I tell them the problem along with why everything is okay and how I’ve found the solution to the issue.. because by the time I tell others the issue I’ve found a solution. It’s like I’m scared of people knowing what’s going wrong in my life. I don’t think I’m afraid of my friends knowing I have flaws. I think if I tell people my problems before I’ve solved them it makes me to anxious but if I avoid telling others it makes me think the issue isn’t real.  But I always think through these issues all by myself and don’t want any consoling or any advice until the problem is fixed on my own or at least it appears fixed

I do value my friends opinions when talking about silly things like a guy. But if I’m  stressed about something I keep to my self completely about it until solved",11Oct2020,1

Now that I’ve lost weight, I wish I could get photos taken. I tried doing selfies and mirror selfies but my face look so... not confident. 

When I’m taking photos of others, I could give suggestions, capture the right timing and all but... when it comes to myself, I look like a dead fish.

I bought myself a whole new outfit and I feel amazing I’m them. I went outside few hours ago to take a self-timer selfie at a secluded place but... man.. I look so bad.

So they started playing guitar and we decided to buy some alchohol and throw a little party. We all sang and started having fun, when the last friend from our group finally called us. He said he could bring 5 new people (3 girls included) with more alchohol also.

So I said why not. They came, we turned on the music, sang and started doing shots while playing this fun drinking game. We stayed until 5am and all of us were having fun.

25,"I've gotten 2 speeding tickets in the last year. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and just happened to be going faster at the specific part of my trip than the rest. I do not try and speed, but everyone does at some point. I was stressed and overstimulated from being out all morning in busy places and genuinely just didn't feel like I was going very fast.

This time it's on a country road. I got clocked 81 in a 55. 

I was compliant, but the cops was pretty rude with me anyways. They always are. I've never received just a warning, or like they cared about anything other than getting ticket money. 

Anyways, that sucks. Whatever. I could be more careful. I try to. But I have a potentially $300+ ticket now. I can handle that. I have to let go of some things I wanted. But I can handle it. I'm concerned about my insurance going up. That's gonna suck. 

But now I'm stuck in a little depression. Whenever this happens tbe way the officers treat me makes me feel like I'm the worst person, like I just murdered some kittens and threw them off an interstate overpass. 

And I just feel like I'm absolute garbage for a while until it's paid. I just wanna stop being so sad. Cops are frustrating, and they trigger this (been harassed by them multiple times tailgating me around town for 30+ my mins, taking sides of people who file false charges against me, etc).

Backstory on my childhood.

My parents raised me and my sisters sheltered and isolated from the world. They didn't want us going to school with black children or seeing anything worldly. We were also unschooled and had no schedule. Days would just blur together and I spent years isolated in our house and backyard reading the same books over and over, watching insects, and living another life in my daydreams. My mom wasn't allowed to have a license and she pretty much ignored us our entire childhood except to try and catch me masturbating at night to shame me and make me feel awful. We had no privacy in the bathroom and we couldn't close our bedroom door or lock the bathroom door. It was awful to always have your body on display for everyone to see. My dad was also very volatile and verbally and emotionally abusive. I have always been a fighter so I would stand up against him for my mom or sisters. He even beat me when I protected my cat from him when I was 13. I was 80lbs and he said I raised my hand against him so he had to. When I was 11 I packed my things and I wanted to run away and be free. I didn't know why but I just wasn't happy and thought of suicide. I felt like I always had to be the strong one and that I couldn't talk or be vulnerable to anyone in my family. 

I did manage to be the first to graduate college in my family and I even moved across the country 2 years ago to finally start healing and build the life I want for myself. I am working on setting boundaries and not being a people pleaser. It is hard and most of the time I don't do it right but I am trying and that is all I can do.

I'm going by myself and the biggest reason that I'm going is to get away from my life and to fly. I haven't flown in years so this is the most exciting part for me. 

Today I had a thought and I can't get rid of it. I thought about how great it would be to stay in Illinois and not tell anyone. I could start over and leave my life behind. I could be as isolated as I want to be because nobody will know me. I wouldn't even tell the friend I'm visiting. I would get dropped off at the airport and just leave and start over.

You may understand how tempting that is. I can't leave this thought and the temptation behind. I can have my boyfriend sell my dolls and I can just be on my own, never to see anyone again.

I ALWAYS freak out with anything going to far south down there.

I've never even been able to use tampons because of how scared I am and how tight and uncomfortable it is and how much pressure I feel.

We went to dads on weekends and one year he had a cake and present for my sister, then for my brother and the weekend of mine he didn’t even bother to bake a cake. Kinda got worse from there. I used to want just one big bash, just a great party. I’ve always planned them for my husband and helped plan everyone else’s but nobody ever planned one for me. One year I decided just to tell everyone what I wanted (in my family others plan your  “surprise” parties.) we had this field we’d all get together and party in (close extended family) I told them for months I wanted a huge party in the field with kegs and a bonfire. My brothers 21st was that year. We planned the exact part for him. It was great. A few weeks later they didn’t plan anything for me. My aunt was in town so I figured it would be a great one. Nothing, and my husband agreed to take the overnight shifts that week so a didn’t even see him. I couldn’t help it, I just cried. My aunt ran and got me a cake that I basically ate alone in the garage. The next year I decided just to plan my own. I love Halloween and decided to do a costume party. I was one of 2 people who wore one. There was also a party downtown that night so like 6 people showed and they all left my 9:30-10 to go to that. That was the year I decided to never celebrate my birthday again. I don’t talk about it, I took it off Facebook so people will forget about it. I hate it when people remember. For my 30th I finally confessed to my husband how I feel and he tried to throw something but again barely anyone showed and by this point so many bad things had happened on my birthday and I’d been disappointed so often that I could only fake smile the whole night. There is so much more to it all and why a party is impossible now but character limit. I just need to write it somewhere for people who don’t know me.",11Oct2020,1
49,"... this whole fucking year has me fucked up. Realizing that my partners experience is real and that basically white people suck.

Please understand... my kid won’t be white and will live in a totally different world than I have. I have become very aware of how dangerous white spaces are for my partner.


Tonight, we had a zoom game night and Trump came up. Partner gets loud, I have to sort of keep things calm so my white friends don’t freak out...

Then my partner comes back and tells me to not assume what folks thought, that we were in a safe space...

But I knew they were like ‘oh (what dark partner) are acting crazy as usual.’ I knew this was a white space where folks felt it was cool to bring up Trump without an emotional response.

How can I tell my partner, as a white person, that was some serious white privileged shit. They are giving so much space BUT I know what was happening??

I just do t know what to do... I have fucked Up in the past and let casual racism just pass (just it’s cool, I’m white, why are you feeling this way?).

This Trump shit has me fucked up. I am so fucked up.... I am so scared that our family won’t be safe and my friends are just talking about it as if it’s annoying. And my partner says it’s fine. BUT I KNOW WHITE PEOPLE.... and it’s not safe. Not talking about it is what has brought us to this place.


TLDR: fu k white supremacy, I hate it and I struggle to figure out the ‘right’ path. Listen to the Black and Brown folks... except when it’s in white spaces and I can read between the lines. Just fuck it all.",11Oct2020,1

55,"Hi lovely Reddit people.

I need your help at identifying something about me. 
Ever since i turned 16 (currently 24) the day to day life has this ""fogginess"" feeling to it and its getting worse every year. 

At 16 i had a severe episode of depression and anxiety that i believe triggered this feeling, however lately ive been having the best years of my life and got out of my depression issues and anxiety after many, many years of therapy. 

I space out a lot, i can't remember anything well, vision is blurry (even when i use glasses) touch sensitivity is down, pain sensitivity is also down, Hearing feels like having a thin wall blocking the sound a bit and motivation to do any personal projects is lower with every year as well as energy. I feel sleepy most of the time and feel like im in autopilot to a point where i can't remember how i got to places or lose track of time or if i said something at all. 
If not for pictures and video i would forget or even question a lot of moments that ""I lived"" but outside those pictures its always really hard to remember what i did and even when i do i always misremember a lot of things. 

Living doesn't feel like living. My body and mind is there but doesn't allow me to live the moment. It almost feels ""dream like"" Its weird and i wish i could do a better job at describing it. 

I sleep 7-8 hours a day(5 at worst). 
Eating well and balanced 
No issues or anything out of the ordinary in blood tests. 
No depression or constant sadness. 
No anxiety. 
Confidence level is all time high. 
Social interaction is good 
I exercise constantly. 
No previous illnesses. 

Yet, it feels like I'm not there at all. There have been a  couple of instances where i felt ""In control"" i can remember them very well and in those instances my senses come back to me (better vision, sound, touch,memory) but, it always lasts a few minutes and are on what it feels at random times. 

General doctors always pointed it out to depression and anxiety and that it will eventually go away once i got that under control. 
Which now i do. But the feeling is still there and its now bothering me because I can't remember experiences that i had growing up from 16 to now(i CAN remember stuff in detail from 15 below), can't remember or feel the touch of many things, senses are low and even as a creative person (i love drawing, coding and animating) motivation is at all time low. 

I been to therapy for years and recently got discharged. 
Had multiple blood test and nothing came out of the ordinary.

I will be meeting with a psychiatrist this week but im not even sure if that will eventually fix it. 

I don't know what i have. Not sure if its a thing that can be resolved and I'm just trying stuff to see if it works at this point. 

If you had or have a similar experience comment down below and if you have a suggestion of what i could be i would gladly hear it. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that you guys have an awesome day.",11Oct2020,1

58,"I miss cuddling to the point I am dreaming about it. Dreaming about being held or holding someone. I dream about adventures, laughing and hand holding. Then when I think about it I cry. I have cried a lot lately. The kind where you lay there and the tears just run down your face. 

But finding that is hard or finding it with someone who loves all of me is hard. There is a part of me that needs to be loved that is hard to love and most people don't. Most people don't want that baggage or find it hard to relate. 

I realized I most likely won't find it, but at least I know what it is like now. 

I angry, sad, disappointed and lonely. Sex doesn't fill the void anymore. I want to be wrapped in arms and legs, kisses on my forehead as I bury my head in a chest.

59," So I (aged 26) met this girl (aged 22) while I was studying abroad for a year. She is taller, better looking and smarter than me. **I fancied her but never told her because I felt she was out of my league.** She ended up getting together with this alcoholic. Soon, I became **the person she'd turn to for comfort** whenever he'd be ignoring her or going crazy while smashing bottles etc. We were good friends during that year. When we returned to our home countries (I live in England, she lives in Spain), she broke up with her boyfriend and I started to notice her **dropping hints through text**, like ‘uhh I hate being single’, while texting and calling me more frequently and often talking about her sexuality. She kept talking about people that were in contact with her on Tinder and dates she was having, so I said ‘I’d love to be your date’ and she replied ***only*** with ‘Aww &lt;3’.

However, she asked me a few times if I could come to Spain to visit her, but admittedly I did not want to unless I found out the feelings were reciprocated (because I always felt awkward around her, as just her friend). I decided to phone her and tell her I fancied her; she stammered and eventually admitted she did fancy me before but she thought I hadn't been interested. And also pointed out we live in different countries and said a few things that made me feel **rejected**. I confronted her about all the mixed messages she’d been giving and said she won’t do it again and that she was sorry I misread everything. I told her that going to visit her would be too awkward for me because of my unreciprocated crush. However, she then said she really hopes I can visit her in Spain soon…and continued to talk about her sexuality and drop stronger hints than ever.(**Note:** *whenever I profess my feelings for her, she hesitates…and then when I give up and back off, she reaches out to me for more attention*). However, I ended up not having time and had to go to US quickly to start the job.

Her mixed and often provocative messages only increased during my time in the US. When I asked her again ‘do you fancy me?’ on the phone, she said ‘I don’t know’; I was infuriated and asked her ‘well, why were you sending me all those flirty messages and she told me she’d stop and agreed I should ‘get over her’. I asked for a break from talking to her for a month because I was hurt. **But after that month, she would not stop texting me everyday ‘I miss you’ and telling me she can’t fall in love with anyone because her mind is focused on me.** It got more extreme as time went on, soon she was **sending me love songs** she wrote for me with lyrics such as ‘I can’t help falling in love/ I want to make you mine’. She was sending me flirty photos of herself every day also. Anyways, I started to hate my job because I was lonely and she was advising me that I should quit and come to Spain to see her. She also kept dropping hints that she would love a long-term relationship. However, as soon as I quit my job, she told me on the phone she was sleeping with other people. I tried not to care though, it’s not like she was my girlfriend…yet.  So I said ‘I want to be with you, even if it means living in Spain’… **she told me that being more than friends would be too complicated** and kept listing all the reasons why Spain wouldn’t suit me. She told me although she has feelings for me, clearly mine are much stronger and we might just find each other annoying. But said **she wants to remain ‘really close friends’**. I was in shock. **Suddenly she has a change of heart just as I’m about to go to Spain to see her?!** I felt like she was just in love with the fantasy of me, and didn’t want to deal with the real-life version of me. I’m so heartbroken, I asked her if we could go on another break from talking for a while. Since then, she’s wished me a happy birthday while throwing in that she really hopes I can go to Spain soon to see her.. and sent another message saying how sorry she is for hurting me and that **I’m so important to her.**

Please help. What should I do? **She’s a really nice person** and we share the same sense of humor and have some sort of connection…. BUT I’ve always felt awkward around her. I think she gets more comfort out of the friendship than I do. **There’s a pattern forming where she needs my attention** and can’t help but flirt and tease me, and I want her so bad I convince myself she wants to be with me. I’ve been hurt so many times by this, I’m so anxious it’s going to happen again. But **she really loves me and would be so upset if I ended the friendship.** I’ve already asked for a break but she expects me to visit her in two months as ‘friends’. Should I:

a) cut her out completely as a friend.

b) tell her I need to take a break for a ***long*** time (up to a year)

c) Just carry on talking to her as a loyal friend

d) Go to Spain soon and try to pursue her romantically, even though she keeps hesitating (we haven’t actually met once in real-life since I’ve professed my feelings, but she claims she has a least some feelings for me.)

Also, from what I've said here, do you think I should totally give up on trying to pursue this girl? I want to believe that all the songs she wrote for me were real, I want to believe she loves me. But my head has been hurting for soooo long. If it wasn’t for me caring about her feelings, it would be so easy for me to cut her out of my life because her **indecisiveness**, her ‘**hot, then cold**’ behavior is **messing me up.** 

Any advice would be much appreciated! :)",11Oct2020,1
60,"Ok so I (30M) accidentally cut too much cuticle on my toes while I was cleaning my nails.
It bled quite profusely then showed it to my husband (60M).

61,"Shits weird a lot of shit just feels weird. I’m currently living back at home, for a little while. Nothing really has changed, as far as rules and personalities which is fine I guess. Actually rules are a bit more ... inconsistent. But the depressing personalities still persists. That’s cool I guess.

My mom met some dude she worked with like over a decade ago and he was cool initially. Mom asked me and my older sister was it ok for him to move in. I said yes so fast bc he would always play video games with me and buy junk food and shit dude was awesome. My father wasn’t around so this was a dream come true. Well overtime he ended up marrying my mom and his true colors showed and so did my mothers I guess. 

The dude actually tried to have sex with my 15 year old sister and would sometimes pull her into the laundry room to show him her penis. My sister said nothing but would write all this down in her journal/diary. My mother learned of this and kinda flipped it on my sister and was like upset at HER for what this grown mans intentions were. My mom made us swear not to tell anyone what happened while she parades around telling everyone our business, (excluding the stepdad incident). “It’s no ones business “. 

She would eventually give him the right to I guess discipline me whenever I didn’t perform well in school and his way of discipline was retarded. Just threats and curse words and him saying he’s gonna fuck me up calling me ugly yadda yadda. I think at like 16/17 I stopped talking to my mother bc it seemed like she let this fucker do whatever! I felt like she was fucking weak as fuck and just wanted some man around with some type of power in her fucking weak ass life. I’ll never be weak! Fuck that! He’d always try to make me fear him and overall no one talked to each other in the house. 

They ended up having a son and dear lord he is adorable at first but...sefvoongtsxvonftfc this fucking kid can be straight annoyingly retarded. Like he’s not mentally challenged but he fucking acts like it. Anyway, when he was born my mom and stepdad wouldn’t shut the fuck up about how he’s gonna he spoiled, king of the house blah blah blah I wasn’t jealous I just didn’t give a fuck to hear it. I’ll admit the way he’s respected and treated and completely different from how my older sis and I were treated. We’re disposable as shit. My mother and stepdad talks fucking down on us to known gossipers, still. 

Rn in the household it feels so split. My mom, stepdad and their child is the REAL family. I don’t feel like shit to them, I just don’t feel any connection it’s fucking weird. I wanted and tried to be positive but it doesn’t work. They turn everything into a negative. I’m invisible to them. I kinda want to forget all of this shit and start my own fucking family one day.

I woke up at 5:30 to start the day early, everything is going good and I'm making my coffee when suddenly I notice a bag of candy corn. Mind you, I'm not normally a fan of this confectionery but I had just woken up and my brain was craving go-go juice and while I waited for the coffee to boil I thought to myself ""what the hell, just one"", famous last words. After I casually plopped said seemingly inoffensive  candy corn into my mouth my tongue immediately decides to spasm and launch this arrow shaped projectile down the back of my throat at full force where it gets lodged for a solid 45 seconds of steadily rising panic. 


45 seconds in and my life is flashing before my eyes at this point as I'm pretty sure this is the end and I keep thinking to myself ""am I really going to fucking die because of a piece of candy corn?"" then the panic subsides as I'm resigned to accept my fate when I notice the candy isn't stuck, my throat had just seized up and I hadn't un-clenched it as I was still struggling to push it back up, afraid that if I relaxed it'd be permanently lodged. I try to stop panicking and manage to relax my throat just enough for the killer confectionery shoot down my throat.
As I'm typing this I can feel it sliding down my esophagus, whole and unyielding as it pokes me on the way down, almost like a final ""fuck you"" from the murder corn.

I live with my aunt. I moved in with her because I moved out of my parents' house because of their toxic parenting. I'm 19 and have a part time job and I am trying to get into a college. My aunt has mental health problem. She has dementia and anger management issues. 

She talks shit about me , misrepresent me in front of strangers ( she has been friends with some of the people at our neighborhood). She spills too much information about my family to the strangers. And also about me. I graduated from high school a year ago and I didn't get myself admitted into any college. I told her multiple times not to talk about this but she doesn't listen. Recently I've overheard her conversation with another neighbor. It was about my mother's fertility issues ( I was born after 7-8 years of my parents' marriage because of that issue) I told her to stop talking about family problems and talk about regular stuffs instead. I told her not to talk about me and my parents and not to spill personal stuffs. She literally screamed at me for saying this and now she's not talking to me and giving me attitude. She told me that I don't need to teach her how to speak and she can speak they way she wants to. And I said , at least you could consider not to tell them all about my family because I need my privacy.  I said this calmly. But still she was screaming and acting rude. I feel helpless. I got no one to talk to. I have no friends. My colleagues are just toxic.

She's been diagnosed with dementia and anger management issues since 2008. And she doesn't want to go to therapy. She is kind of dysfunctional. She bursts out of anger if anyone utters the word 'therapy' in front of her. Once I told her that I need therapy for my anxiety and depression ( not severe though but still I want to get better) and she told me that i was mental because I talked about therapy. I tried to make her understand what therapy actually is but she didn't listen and mocked at me instead.  Also she has crappy hygiene sense. Because she doesn't wear mask properly and goes out frequently. If I tell her to wash her hands she yells at me. 

I still don't have enough money to move out and haven't got my license yet. I took the test last month. But I failed and she cussed at me.  She was pushing me to work harder before graduating from high school just because she wanted to brag about it. I was recovering from an attempted harassment by an uber driver and i was at a loss.  I had no money. I was absent from school for days. I gained weight and going through phases. She was body shaming me all along and told me that I will never find love. Whenever I needed a little refreshment on the weekends and asked her if I could hang out with my friends, she didn't let me. I've lost weight recently and she started body shaming me all over again.  She's been controlling me ever since I moved in with her (for 2 years). She doesn't even know what she wants in life.

I might have to stay with her for a year or two. Because I can't afford to move out again. Living with her is somewhat affordable for me.

How do I keep myself sane? :(",11Oct2020,1
72,"Reddit and the internet at large have this trend of making ""dark jokes"" or satire jokes which are clearly offensive and then when someone gets hurt, they blame them for ""not being able to take a joke"".

First of, sexist (for both men and women) and racist jokes are NOT funny. You are only contributing to the negative stereotypes and making a joke about the genuine experiences people have had.

RAPE JOKES ARE NOT FUNNY! ASSAULT JOKES ARE NOT FUNNY! Imagine a victim of sexual abuse is reading something and they come across a ""joke"" that belittles the traumatic experiences that they had. Whenever a subreddit criticizes such offensive ""jokes"", there are so many comments saying that the ""joke"" is actually funny. It's frankly gross.

Don't even get me started on the blatantly homophobic and transphobic jokes. I literally saw a post recently where the ""joke"" was about trans people committing suicide. There were a lot of comments commending the OP for such a vile ""joke"". NOBODY SHOULD BE MAKING JOKES ABOUT PEOPLE KILLING THEMSELVES! Imagine making fun of all the pain that the victim's family and friends must be going through.

""Everybody is just too sensitive these days!"" In about 80% of the cases I've seen, they are not being sensitive. Stop trying to use this argument to pass off your offensive ""jokes"".

I see some genuinely funny and creative content on Reddit. It just shows the lack of creativity in the people who resort to sexist, racist, rapist, queerphobic ""jokes"" for some internet points, you don't have a good sense of humour, you are just bland and dull with nothing new to bring to the table.

73,"You’re lying to yourself. You are perfect just how you are! Forget about all the fake instagram models and the “ideal” body type. You ARE beautiful. Who’s to tell you that you aren’t “perfect”. I know a lot of women who struggle with body image issues and it makes me extremely sad. They compare themselves to these crazy photoshopped standards that are unrealistic. Instead of trying to look like the women on social media, magazines, and billboards, learn to love yourself and be proud of your body. That is true sexiness. The body that YOU are comfortable in is the perfect body for you. Those small so called “imperfections” that you have, make you incredibly hot. Love handles, scars, stretch marks, cellulite, hair, moles, extra chub, freckles, wrinkles etc. aren’t imperfections. They are what make you unique and different and sexy. Life would boring if all girls looked the same. So be confident! Rock your body. No matter what anyone says to you, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

From what I can remember, the conversation didn't go awfully and one of them was interested in what I had to say. I was just slurring my words and being somewhat incoherent. The group spoke Spanish, and I tried to speaking what little Spanish I know. At the end of the night, I gave one of them a few bucks and told her to get herself another drink. She seemed pretty confused by this, but accepted after I said its what God would have wanted. They group kinda just laughed it off and went about their business and I left. I told the guy she was with that I ment no harm by it, and hoped he didn't find it disrespectful. They definitely thought I was acting like an idiot at that point, and im pretty sure my presence began bothering them. 

I feel stupid about getting so drunk and acting so foolishly. I dont think I did anything particularly awful, but I'm not okay with how I conducted myself. Im seriously disappointed in myself for getting so drunk, and don't know how to process my emotions. Im currently being very hard on myself, and can't stop thinking about how stupid I was. 

How do you deal with the guilt and regret of acting stupid while drunk? How can I move past these feelings of embarrassment?",11Oct2020,1

88,"2 days ago, my bf got CPS called on him, I know its BS, and everyone who knows him knows it. But he's going all out to find out who called, and sue them. 
 I feel crazy because I'm not as mad about it as him, and I think suing someone is way overboard (which he doesn't understand why I'm not so gung-ho). 

  I'm scared that its going to turn into an obsession for him. We already have a weird connection (he says he doesn't need me, blah blah blah). His daughter is the most important thing to him (as it should be). I just don't know how to not feel useless or uncared for. 

Maybe I am selfish for wanting him not to pursue the whole suing thing. Or selfish for wishing he made time just for me.  I know I am. I dont deserve any time. He has none to give, and I dont want to pressure him to make time.

96,"I have an anonymous Twitter account. My profile is called ""Pigeon"" and I have the pic of a pigeon. Only my friends know who I am. I use Twitter as a way of telling my friends and the people who follow me shit about my life. I vent, tell them things about my everyday life, I write funny tweets, share my opinions on politics and sometimes make some threads about academic stuff. So, even though I use a ridiculous and pretty random identity, people who go into my profile and know me irl will absolutely identify me. Why am I anonymous? You may ask... Well, it's because I don't want my parents nor certain people to see some of the stuff I share. It's not like I'm vulgar, inappropriate, I don't advocate for violence or anything... like, there's not much to hide... But it's my safe space where I vent and interact with my friends. Period. 

Besides, there are some extremist right-wing people in my country (I'm left-wing) , and if I happen to say something they don't like, they may doxx me, threaten me and whatnot. It's not really that safe to have my face and name out there, in the web.

So, anyway, yesterday my boyfriend came over and we were having lunch with both my parents and he accidentally mentioned one of my Tweets. My mom uses Twitter as well. My boyfriend's comment sparkled her curiosity. She knows I use an anonymous account and I've repeatedly told her I don't feel comfortable sharing my user with her. 

She spent the entire night looking for my profile. She said she had the right to monitor my activity in this social platform. I told her she didn't, as I'm 20 fucking years old, I'm not a child anymore. I said that I thought it was totally not okay to do this, but she's just so desperate to have control over my life... She claims to have found me on Twitter, but I doubt she did, as she told me that I was a dirty, vulgar, rude person on Twitter. I'm not, so I think she found some random account and thinks that's me. And that's worrying... I mean, I don't want her to have a wrong picture of me.

Besides... She's had control over multiple aspects of my life since forever. She tells me what to wear, how to cut my hair, how to behave, where to go, etc... Bitch, my Twitter is a safe space because I can show myself as I want to, without her controlling my appearance, my way of thinking or anything... I'm free, I can speak my mind, I can share stuff, I can be me... I don't want her there. 

Anyway, I was so desperate this morning that I took her phone to check her Twitter history. I felt so unsafe and exposed. Saw a bunch of random profiles, none of them were mine. She busted me with her phone, yelled like a maniac and threatened me. She said that if I touched her phone again, she would take mine and break it.

She insisted I was a vulgar, lewd, commie (I'm not, for God's sake). I had to deactivate my account so that she doesn't find it and I'm so pissed off right now. Why does she HAVE to look at every single thing I do? I've explicitly told her she was not fucking welcome on my profile. Besides, she threatened me, what the actual fuck???

Yeah, I know this is pretty stupid, but GOD, AM I FURIOUS. Why does she have to ruin EVERYTHING???",11Oct2020,1
97,"It takes me so long to organize my thoughts and express them in a way that is logical, clear and concise. This happens in academic writing and in everyday speech, especially in school. The feedback I’ve gotten from others is usually that it seems like I want to say too many things at once making it hard to follow, and also that I don’t follow through or fully finish my thoughts, in person and on paper. Indeed I usually do become exhausted frustrated and hopeless and often give up midway through. My professors are usually very enthusiastic about the thinking itself that’s happening in my written work but very frustrated by the fact that it’s unfinished, late and/or disorganized.

It sometimes takes me many multiple hours to write a single paragraph of an essay for university. And sometimes I’m simply rewriting the same thing but sometimes I’m not and the paragraph runs on and on and on and I never actually finish the intended point of the paragraph even three pages In. It’s like I feel it’s possible and necessary to expand on everything but the result is fragmented and layered. “A bit Overstuffed” was the only criticism one professor had for me on a paper I actually finished. 

I don’t know when to stop, and even if I do, it’s always too abrupt. It’s like there is a bridge to get from one side of the paragraph to the other that I need to build. And I keep adding plank after plank after plank to expand the bridge but for some reason I can never get to that last plank, the one that would connect one side to the other side. It’s like I can expand forever on something but I’m reluctant and unsure of how to conclude or finish anything. There’s always so much more to say. 

As for organization, I struggle a lot knowing where to put what and when to say what. The structure of my paper can be a bit odd, fluid or unclear. I do try to outline but I feel I must always abandon my outlines because they never work in practice. I feel a strong sense of everything being connected to everything else, like a literal knot I can visualize in my head, and the essential kerne of my argument is right at the center of that not, but the threads are so intricately and tightly interwoven that at some point each one becomes indistinguishable and the knot becomes an indivisible entity. It feels like one long paragraph or at least like everything if I do break it into paragraphs they are not clear or discreet entities, each one, but merely continuations of previous paragraphs. Where I begin and end seems arbitrary and I always feel acutely dissatisfied, as though I’ve only actually written 5 or 10 percent of what I meant to write. I run out of steam and give up.  

Let me be a little more concrete. Say I’m organizing a paper about Virginia Woolf and my first paragraph is about space, while the second is about time. Sounds simple enough but then the quotations most obviously about space are actually also about very much about time when you look closely enough! And not just that, but the very same thing that appears to be about space is also about time, not even different elements of the same quotation, but the very same words and phrases begin to mean many different things. And it’s not like it would make sense to analyze the quotation again later through a different lens because in this case, there is a very direct parallel (at least in my mind) between her conception of space and time. Also, in my mind, this expands to her conception of relationships and hierarchy and words and art. They all become related to a central paradox or conundrum, from which everything else arises and I start to see it everywhere. It is suffused throughout, in various ways. There are parallels and paradoxes everywhere but still there is often an underlying connecting thread that I sense very strongly and I always want to write about that, because that’s why all the other stuff matters, that’s what makes a paper worthwhile in my opinion, it gets to something essential. 

So then I decide to combine the paragraphs about space and time and instead organize in a different way. I sometimes try to base it around certain quotations so that I can talk about each in its complexity without having to jump back to it again but the problem with this is that there is no sense of growth because the first quotation is often just as rich as the last one. I lack a narrative progression because I don’t want to hold back in the beginning. Because like I said everything is connected to everything else and I can’t seem to untie the knot. I become overwhelmed, feel stupid, confused and lose steam. 

Often what I intended (in my outline) to be a single paragraph turns into the entire paper because once I start writing everything keeps expanding. And that’s after many hours of research/planning/outlining. It feels so difficult to condense what I want to say, and structure into paragraphs. I don’t think that it’s because I don’t spend enough time preparing, planning, and outlining because I spend a very long time doing this (and it’s my favorite part). I don’t begin writing until I have a complete idea of what I’m going to say, and evidence for it. 

Any idea what could help?

101,"Over the last few weeks, I've fallen pretty hard for my best friend (I'm 32M, she's 29F) after she recently ended her very long relationship she was already in before I met her. It's been a big deal to me, because I've always struggled with dating, and I've never found any women I've ""liked"" enough to really pursue. I've been trying to keep my feelings in check, though I keep obsessing over looking for ""clues"" about whether she might be okay with dating me or not. I'm trying to be good about it all, but it's hard.

I'm probably going to just talk to her about it in the nearish future. I'm fairly certain she will reject my advances, and I get it. I'm sure I'm probably too much of a ""friend"" for her to consider it. I'm not really bothered by the rejection, I'm just bummed out because my dating prospects (or lack thereof) aren't going to be changing any time in the foreseeable future, so I'm going to be alone for quite a while. Meanwhile, she's already out there, dating around, because there are lots and lots of guys looking for a girl, so she has plenty of options.

At the moment, I'm just starting to really struggle to keep my feelings in check. While I wouldn't actually say I'm ""in love"" with her, I use the word ""lovesick"", because that's how it feels. I'm at a point now where I just constantly ""miss"" her, I wonder what she's up to right now, etc. It's getting harder and harder to distract myself and think of other things. So, I know that the sooner I have this talk with her, the better. It might not be for a few weeks, though, unfortunately, so... I dunno. I'm just really struggling today.",11Oct2020,1
102,"I have this friend who is undiagnosed with mental illness but only because she’s never been checked. I’m not doctor but I think something is up with her like maybe personality disorder.

We met 3 years ago in college English class. She was faking an Australian accent to the whole class. She would just talk with it casually so I at first, naturally, I assumed she was from Australia. As we got closer she told me the accent is fake and she does it when she’s not familiar with people. I have anxiety too so I understand to an extent so no harsh judgement. But from then on out I just knew something was up with her.

After 3 years of knowing her she’s had so many questionable behaviors. I could go on and on but I’ll just say her personality can be a lot to handle for me.

Yesterday we hung for the first time this year and I met her baby. Her baby is cute and sweet but I’m not really a baby person which people should just respect. She literally forced me to hold her baby during dinner after I insisted I didn’t want to. It was unnecessary because the baby was just chillin in his stroller and she unstrapped him for me to hold him. I didn’t understand it. Like let him just relax in the stroller he just woke up from a nap.

We order a drink and I asked her before, did he eat and she said yeah he ate before his nap. So when our drinks got here we had like 2-3 sips. She realizes he’s still hungry and she starts feeding him. I don’t think 2-3 sips of alcohol will hurt him but still. I don’t want to be associated with that image. Idc about public breast feeding but doing it in the midst of drinking was embarrassing.

Also she’s really loud and talks about inappropriate topics this shouldn’t be loud. Like sex and drugs. Maybe I’m better at reading a room because she has no sense of her volume. We’re in this fancy restaurant and people can hear her say she’s done every drug besides heroin. We’re in the fancy restaurant and people can hear “Yeah I’ve tried crack and meth, are they the same?? Yeah everything but heroin”.

Before hanging out I told her I just wanted to get lunch and go hone because I have a lot of homework to do. She kept asking me if she could come over but I reminded her I’m busy. We get to my place and she said she has to use the restroom so I left her. She’s constipated and asking me for juice and Tylenol while on the toilet. She finally comes out and she just starts lingering and talking to my mom and watching tv with her. My moms cool with it at first but she was busy too. Once again she’s not reading the room because she’s just chillin in the couch watching tv. I start to insinuate it’s time for her to go but she’s deliberately  ignoring my cues. Finally I get more direct and she leaves. Ugh.",11Oct2020,1
103,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask for advice, but oh well.

I’m a 15 y/o non-binary person who’s mom is making them get confirmed. I was supposed to go through the process last year, but luckily she only enrolled us (by us, I mean my sister and I. We’re twins.) this year and chose the distance learning option. There have been about 4 or 5 meetings by now, and I haven’t even opened the workbook I was given. I was never super religious to begin with, but that changed in middle school when I was suffering from severe depression and discovering I am trans. I don’t consider myself Catholic but I also wouldn’t say I’m Atheist, as I do believe there is a higher power.

I’m not trying to demonize religion here. Believe in whatever you want, I really couldn’t care less. I just have a lot of bad memories and experiences associated with religion from both school and family, and the last thing I want to do is lie to everyone and say I’m Catholic and choose a saint. I would rather die than be confirmed. I want no ties to religion what so ever.

I’ve expressed to my mom multiple times that I don’t want to be confirmed, but she insists that I do it to make my grandparents and my godmother happy. Both parties are ruthlessly religious. I’ve looked up if people can force you to be confirmed, and so far from what I’ve learned it’s mixed answers. I’m just really lost on this I guess.",11Oct2020,1
