1,"On February 14th, 2018, an ex-student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida entered a building (of 900 students with only 2 sets of double doors) with an AR-15 and killed 17 and injured another 17 students, educators, and faculty. This student had a long disciplinary history and was [reported to the FBI and police](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3k7vej/all-the-times-nikolas-cruz-was-reported-to-authorities-before-the-florida-shooting) multiple times as a potential school shooter.

Since then,

* The school has implemented security checkpoints and requires students to wear ID at all times.
* Less than half of the students currently at MSD were students at the time of the shooting. None of the students will have been present at the shooting as of June 2021.
* The entire school administration, including principal, has been replaced. Superintendent Robert Runcie's diversion programs kept the shooter in school without a criminal history, but he avoided removal with loyal board members and [by playing the race card.](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-ne-broward-schools-pack-meeting-runcie-supporters-20190226-story.html)
* We perform code red drills (hide from shooter) at least once per month.
* 2 survivors committed suicide.
* The 1200 building is surrounded by a tall fence. The windows are covered with construction paper, the [doors bolted](http://i.imgur.com/yoYFluP.jpg), but [lights can still be seen turned on at night.](https://i.imgur.com/ujzbDrz.jpg)
* A new building to replace the 1200 building is [under construction.](http://i.imgur.com/VNpc0lf.jpg)
* [Little to no progress has been made](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article238516103.html) on the death penalty case of the shooter whose trial has been postponed. The average number of years between offense and execution in Florida is 16.60 years.
* A significant portion of students experience PTSD or paranoia when sirens or gunshot-like noises occur.
* Some security staffers treat students with extreme disrespect, causing students to resent them.
* Prevention measures, including national laws and local school policies, have not been significantly expanded.
* Security measures are ineffective and do not address the issues that made the 2018 shooting possible.
* Despite security changes, a nearly identical shooting could still occur--perhaps even worse, as a shooter would likely take advantage of vulnerabilities in the code red protocol.

I do not like being mere feet within the 1200 building every day at school. I hate the new culture at the school. I hate the PTSD and paranoia that too many of us suffer from too frequently. I went through periods when I could not stop thinking about the shooting. It kept me up at night and made its way into my dreams. Lately, I have been fine, but this has been/will be a hard week for all of us. I was lucky to avoid death on that day. I still wish every day that it didn't happen. I also wish that it never happens to anyone else.

I hope you found my post insightful. Any questions are welcomed. I will do my best to answer them.",14Feb2020,1
2,"The ""fasten your seatbelt"" sign had just came on. Though I don't bother to follow through anyway since let's admit it, the only niggas who survive plane crashes are japanese people.  My favorite part of plane rides, though unintolerable as it is, is the first eigth minutes when I can see the city and all of it's business, lives that are constant, the illumination of headlights from afar feels like cells through veins. Just one fucking organism. At first glance everything just looks like puzzle pieces, but as the plane reaches an elevation of 16850 feet in the sky  it looks as if everything fits into one giant jigsaw puzzle. Perfectly fitting into corresponding shapes, like those pixelated portraits, up close they just look like colored squares but when you take a few steps back it forms an image of a rabbit with flower prints on the corners and a cheesy quote that you can find on google. I wonder if the same can be said about people.

6,"I met my ex through his dog. I had moved away from home for college and specifically chosen a house with garden near a big park so I could bring my first dog, a black lab, to college with me. My first dog had been a solid part of my identity to the point that people in school would say it way weird to see me without him. But by the time I went to college he was already 10 years old, and my dad clung onto him as his last friend, and I was not allowed and also didnt have the heart to take him from my dad. 

After about a year and a half of breaking the balls of literally anyone who had the patience to listen about how badly I needed a dog in my life, I finally got a dog. There was an ad in my favourite pet shop (where I would go weekly to look at the rats) about a 4 year old american pitbull who needed a foster home for six months while his owner started a new job. I figured it was the perfect test situation to see if I could handle it, as many people around me were insisting I wouldn't be able to manage a dog by myself.

That was how Winston appeared in my life in a whirlwind. After seeing four photos of him, I met him and his owner for a walk in a city park. Two things struck me about the owner-dog duo: the owner kept being dragged away into the bushes by his powerful dog mid-sentence like a rag doll, and the dog made enormous efforts to maintain constant eye contact with the humans behind his leash despite going anywhere his nose took him. My main concern in adopting an adult pitbull was to not take on a case of neglect and abuse as I didnt have extensive dog experience, this was my first own dog. But both winston and owner were clearly genuinely doing their best and out of their depth. 

The day winston arrived at my house, we were expecting him with tennis balls and fleece blankets.
 ""Us"" was me and my two housemates. The very first thing he did was arrive in a car covered in dog vomit (stressed owner included), followed by running into the house and taking a huge stress-shit on our rental home carpet. I couldn't have been happier. This was everything I had wanted. One of my housemates had been trying to rile me up, saying it would be *his* dog, when he only ever owned cats and I could say with absolute confidence... the day this dog is gonna look to you for direction babes, you can go ahead and say he's your dog. But I've been preparing for this my whole life and you have not so step the fuck aside. 

Winston had skipped between a few homes, he had beed losing his coat to stress, he had rashes on his neck, chest and stomach. I didn't plan on really bonding with him, because I had previously bonded with a dog that was not my own in a foster family, and it had only made life harder for myself and the dog afterwards readjusting. But within a week of having him this wonderful boy brought out his pitbull personality and I think we just melted into each other. We mended each other's hearts. His owner began to come by my house weekly to walk the dog once Winston had the time to adjust to the change in leadership, and I remember he commented that he hadn't seen Winston so happy in a long time. I hadn't been that happy in a long time either. 

... to be honest I am giving up about writing this monolith of a personal story. Tonight was the first night that I truly allowed myself to have a good cry about Winston no longer being my baby after 4/5 years of building each other up. It was because I was watching queer eye and I saw someones true look of happiness as they filled their cat's food bowl, and it just came flowing out of me for the first time. I don't feel like going on. I will post this small personal record for those times I read back through my own profile and maybe in the future these memories will warm my heart, but I'm gonna call it a night for tonight. Good night me.",14Feb2020,1

11,"Was taking my dog on his nightly walk and halfway through started hearing violin. The way my neighborhood is built you cant tell where sounds are coming from (incredibly dangerous when you try to cross the street and hear a car but the sound comes from everywhere) so the violin was just everywhere. Idk if somebody was playing the violin or just playing a recording of one, but I’ve never heard anybody playing or listening to violin in my neighborhood before. I could barely hear it at first and I had to be outside but now I can hear it inside the house too, very quiet and only if I’m listening.

13,"Lately I am going through a period in my life, where the alarm of jealousy towards my partner, is constantly on, and the noise it makes is such that it silences all the votes of confidence that she constantly suffers in me.

 Jealousy is our most addictive problem when it comes to being in a relationship, and jealousy per se is addictive because they are simply wrapped in a vicious circle made up of:

 alarm / insecurity - fear of abandonment / intrusive thoughts that are not generally conditional on reality - impulsive acts of negative impact - erosion, wear on the relationship - stage of reconciliation (affective or sexual gratification).

 We are all gratified by the stage of reconciliation, which makes us feel reaffirmed as ""the only ones"", and we like to feel the pride of thinking that ""she belongs to us"", we love that vain power, and in the vast majority of cases,  they end up ending an emotionally shattered woman, with a deep disappointment and guilty of something that tentatively never existed as an intentionality of deception;  while man becomes increasingly aggressive because of that sense of imminent danger in the face of the competition of masculinity that bombards the paranoid brain of a typical jealous man: I know that feeling very well, I belong to that dire strain.  Jealousy as an unsolved problem, can ruin entire lives, and prevent the experience of enjoyment, trust and containment in which a healthy relationship is understood.

 There are two types of jealous;  the one who identifies the problem, has slips and cultivates communication with his partner to rationalize and identify possible triggers, in order to establish healthy limits, without prejudice to the freedom of the other party;  and there is the jealous gross, paranoid and aggressive, without sufficient intellectual and emotional capacity to try to resolve the internal conflict that triggers the alarm of jealousy, and thus resorts to the excessive control of messengers, and psychological and physical abuses that become an inevitable  final unhappy for both parties.

 Jealousy is the emotional manifesto of our internal insecurities.  How to overcome them?  I still do not know that clearly, but the only thing clear is that it is a deeply personal battle of each one, which requires the ability to travel without judging, or taking for granted, the intrusive, paranoid and conspiracy thoughts that invade our minds.

 It is true that the stories of life, called family nucleus or psychological traumas of each individual that derive in those insecurities that eat us day and night, have a noticeable influence on the discomfort and feeling of recurring threat in us, jealous men.  But even so, it would be very irresponsible of us to use that excuse as a vehicle of our bad acts towards our women, if there is commitment and proactive love, it is a problem that can be overcome by any couple, which nevertheless is corrosive to the love bond,  and that it is necessary to cure in time, this kind of emotional cancer.

 It is easier to conclude from the outside, that the girl must leave the jealous man as soon as possible, so that the ""disrespectful competition"" of the male sidewalk, can try to snatch her crumb of love from that injured girl.  A scavenger bird will always be a scavenger, cowardly and detestable bird.  Instead of maliciously judging the jealous man, put yourself in their place, understand their perspective and let the female couple decipher the true affective intentions of their counterpart, since I guarantee only one thing: a man is not jealous until he falls in love.  ;)

 If my beloved girlfriend reads this, I just want to ask my humble forgiveness for not trusting her word full of loyalty and healthy intentions.  I make a conscious effort day after day to be my best version, sorry for failing and sinning jealousy, and thanks for holding me back.

 Sincerely, another jealous man.",14Feb2020,1

15,"Look, I'm not just coming up to finding out about climate change, like everyone else I've known about it for years.  But 10 or 20 years ago, I had more faith that our species would pull it together in the face of the increasingly unarguable reality that we live in and take actual steps.  The last five years especially is proving me completely wrong about human nature and, unfortunately, completely right that climate change and our impact on other species is real and terrifying. 

I want to emphasize that word:  terrifying.  

I am terrified when I hear the estimate that 90% of the insect population is gone.  I am terrified when I hear that microplastics are corrupting the ocean population.  I am terrified when I hear that the arctic is melting, and may be gone not in a hundred years, but maybe five to ten years.  I am terrified that, without hyperbole, I might be in one of the last if not last generations of humans who live in a natural environment that hasn't been mostly warped by greedy individuals.

Of course, I know plenty of you will downvote this for several reasons.  That's fine.  I'm not here to argue politics, and I won't listen to any denialism.  What I'm here to do is lament.  I'm lamenting because I don't think the world needs to be like this.  But I'm much more cynical these days about the idea that human beings will pull their heads out of our collective asses to at least mitigate the damage we are doing to this planet, if for no one's sake but our own.

I'm still on board with anything that will really fix this.  But I fear that politics and denialism are more powerful even than self-preservation.",14Feb2020,1

17,"I used to have a crush on my friend back in high school. We are both male

E (will call him that for privacy reasons) and I have known each other since 8th grade. We talked sometimes and were cool friends and we hung around with other friends too. 

I’ve started to have feelings with him as high school progressed. We both like the same type of music and such. Not only that, but I was attracted to his physical appearance. He was really really chubby. He looked to be over 250 pounds. To me, I’m attracted to chubby guys so he was my type. (Thats just my preference) overall, I honest to god fell in love with him. 

I never asked him out nor have I told anyone about my feelings towards E because I’m pretty sure a lot of people back in my high school are pretty homophobic and I would end up getting bullied because of it. Plus I don’t know if E is actually gay or not. 

Fast forward, we graduated in May 2019 and haven’t seen each other or talked since until around December when we saw each other at target. I work there so we briefly talked and that was it.

i'm making this post about my own experience, outside of the tech world, mostly...

i regret setting up manjaro atm because of what the community is for me atm. which is the ghost of my past, set in the present. just had to `/ignore` two people on `freenode#manjaro` because of this shit. dogsnouts and andrito. andrito is little me sitting with my rapist, dogsnouts. this same situation keeps happening over and over and over again, everywhere i go, and i dno why people don't stop it or do something about it, instead people like reddit, twitter, gnu, and whom ever else, just keep letting this happen. dognsouts is pretending to be the older me, but they stole everything from me, and for some reason no one listens to anything i have to say about it. no one listened when i was 8 getting raped by him, no one listened when i was a teenager and still falling into further harm and abuse, and it doesn't seem like anyone is listening now. basically dogsnouts said to me, at the time, that andrito would be a good screename for irc, because i asked what i should choose, but it's just a mnemonic device for dognsouts name irl. the point is to confuse people about who is who behind a screen. because for some reason it's still left up to question about who i am.

that sucks

this sucks

don't see anything good or positive here, definitely don't see a future that doesn't involve homelessness and or sui 

dno what to here

dno why this won't stop happening

don't know why people think it's a good idea to let these things happen

dno why reddit protects pedophiles

dno why anything

basically i need a comic here

and it goes something like this:

a little bunny is born into a bunny family. but the bunny family sucks, and it's got a druken angry violent father. so the little bunny hops along down the road to find a better place to be.

the bunny has to cross through mountains of snow and blizzards and severe cold. but eventually, through the long and arduous journey, comes across a cabin which looks warm and inviting.

the bunny steps into the cabin, but it's filled with google, facebook, the cia, the nsa, and pedophile cops. so the bunny has to leave. the bunny has to go back out into the blistering cold and snow blizzards. and keep drudging on.

eventually the bunny finds another cabin through the storm. it looks so warm and inviting. but the when the bunny gets in, there's nothing but channers, trolls, and pedophiles. so the bunny has to go back out into the blistering cold and snow blizzards. and keep drudging on.

eventually the bunny realized there's nowhere safe to rest from the blistering cold and snow blizzards, and that the only thing to do is to drudge on until you die a cold and lonely death. 

so the shitty fucking morons start to feel bad, because the bunny was supposed to find friendship, retributions, and salvation in all of these distentions, but instead found harm, violence, tyranny, oppression. 

eventually the bunny is just dead lying on the floor. and the shitty fucking morons that started to feel bad create in infrastructure around it, place it into a box, and say, ""hey, look, it's ok, you can get a job and get help with the money you make from a job""

the but bunny is already fucking dead lying on the floor, fucking dead as fuck. 

but even still, the bunny manages to cripple hop to a job interview, but the interviewer says the bunny needs to look happy, but instead the bunny looks dead, because it is dead, so the interviewer denies the bunny any job.

so the bunny cripple hops back to the middle of the road, where it can lay dead, lonely, cold, and alone, and die, but not have the police called on it 

and the moral of the story is that shitty fucking morons fucking suck and only cause harm and suffering. a moral everyone already knew and no one needed to know

and the bunny is dead

I ask because I'm a little confused. I've always considered myself bi, but lately I've been hooking up with guys from Grindr, mostly because I can't find female company and I'm lonely. One issue is that I have strange physical tics (like a mild panic attack?) when arranging dates from there. And after going through with the dates (that I genuinely enjoy) I often feel ashamed, and as though I only did it because I have low self esteem or a lack of respect for myself. I also worry that people might think I was degenerate if they found out. I thought these feelings might be because I was giving into temptations and sleeping with strangers, but whenever I have one night stands with women I never have any of these feelings. 

I understand that some of these feelings might be conditioning from growing up and society and stuff, but why do I feel so paranoid and guilty about doing gay things? Is it genuinely wrong or do I just feel that way? I'm very confused, and hope I've fully explained the issue. I can answer any questions if needs be.

27,"Hi everyone, after lurking this site for a while I finally decided to make a post. As the title says, I am 20F and have not had any meaningful sexual experiences or relationships. I have come to the point where this has been really bringing me down in realms outside of just relationships and sex; I have found that it is a huge source of anxiety for me and has made my self-assurance diminish. Really hoping to seek some advice on this limbo I am in and in gaining self confidence and assurance in regards to sex and relationships from some of you more experienced friends out there. Here is some background:

1. I consider myself an introverted extrovert in that I like to be around others, but I would say my thought processes tend to be very introspective. This has gotten to the point where I am self conscious of every single thing about myself. I am an American born Indian but live in a very southern and homogenous part of the country, which I think has always made me feel pretty ""other"". I also used to be an athlete and have struggled with my body image as a result of having to maintain certain weights throughout my life. I have a tendency to over obsess about details of myself, my stretch marks from losing and gaining weight rapidly, the fact that my skin scars easily, the way I dress, what I eat, etc. These overarching things along with many others have really caused my self confidence in the way I look plummet recently and I never really know if I am correctly assessing myself or overthinking it all.
2. Recently, I feel an enormous amount of anxiety surrounding my sex life and my relationships. I consider myself very open to trying new things and I think I have a pretty good idea of what I like, however, the things I like may have been learned through media and the pervasiveness of porn; I tend to be a people pleaser so I don't know if my knowledge of what I like is influenced by this or is genuine. Also, it brings me down that so many of my friends have had their opportunities to experiment and grow in these areas while I have not. Admittedly, I am very shy in regards to initiating contact with people despite being friendly. I find that so many people stare at me and I will get compliments, however, no one really seems to want to approach me farther than that. Recently, this has been making me overthink so many things about myself and what it is about me that elicits this. An overarching thought I have is that: **It is almost impossible for me to believe that others find me attractive.**
3. My overthinking has honestly deepened some social anxiety I have been experiencing, to the point where I do not even want to be seen in public or if I see someone I find attractive I will literally walk the other direction regardless of what tasks I have at hand just to avoid me being seen by them. When I think of sex or relationships, every aspect of it makes me anxious, I overthink everything: What if I am not good enough? What if my lack of experience will turn them off? What if my stretch marks or my body isn't right for them? What if I can't give them what they want? I am in this horrible limbo of really wanting to experiment and be more confident in these realms while also fearing them entirely. How do I stop overthinking every element of myself and of sex? I also tend to compare myself with everyone around me and this cycle of comparison has really led me to my fall. I tend to classify people as out of my league or just feel immediate inferiority to others, I think mainly due to my social anxiety.
4. I find that I am not attracted to people who are attracted to me and this has caused a huge strain for me. I am very scared that I will not find compatibility in regards to attraction. It seems that I tend to go for guys who may be out of my social realm or out of my league, however, I don't know if I am rightfully judging them or myself; if I am putting them on a pedestal and myself down. Pretty simple bullet but a really complex problem so any advice on this would be great.
5. How do I gain experience when I don't have anyone to experiment with? I want to have meaningful experiences but it just seems like I do not have anyone to talk to or learn from. Additionally, a huge fear of mine is that I won't be knowledgeable in the future if I miss out on this now.

TLDR: 20F who with fears surrounding performance in sex and relationships and without much experience. Constantly compares herself to others, tends to put others on a pedestal, and cannot find compatibility in terms of attraction. How to become more confident and self assured? How to gain experience?

My mom said she has actually injured herself and cant be left alone and will be submitted into a hospital for a few weeks. I am not someone who likes to talk much or be all lovey dovey with siblings, or with anyone for that matter, but I kinda wished I gave her more hugs.

Tbh, I have no idea what to think or what to do...all I know is that it makes me incredibly sad to hear this. Shes still so young and funny and sweet to do these things to herself or think this way. My mom said that she said something like she didn't want to be a burden anymore.

I could only connect with people online and even then they were horrible people

35,"I want to get this confession out because there's a nagging voice in the back of my mind that's been telling me something was definitely off.

When I was 16, my mom hired a tutor to help me improve my math skills for the SAT and ACT. I was never good at math and needed a lot of help in that area. The main reason she hired him was because of his rate, which was significantly lower than most other tutors. We met about twice a week for an hour at the local library for a couple of months.

Let's call him Sam. Sam was a fairly elderly man, about 55 years old. For the first month, everything went fine. My mom sat beside us for the first three tutoring sessions just so she could make sure I was doing the assigned work. Reassured that everything was fine, she left me after that to my own devices. Sam was friendly and helpful, and actually gave me a lot of helpful tips. He was patient and always tried his best to answer all of my questions. None of his words or actions gave me any feeling that something was awry, until this one time.

One day in October, I had to reschedule one of our Thursday tutoring sessions from 4 PM to 8 PM because I had a cross country meet that day. I remember coming home tired, taking a shower, and changing into a tank top and jeans. Perfectly casual for a warm October night. Then I gathered my study materials and drove to the library to meet Sam.

What began as a fairly normal tutoring session became an hour of dread as I counted down the minutes until I could finally go home.

It was almost closing time and there were only two or three people besides me and Sam. Fifteen minutes into explaining equations of hyperbolas and parabolas, he paused to tell me my hair was pretty and that the color of my jeans matched his. Off-topic, but okay. We continued. Ten minutes or so later, I felt his large hand on my back. I remember feeling my entire body freezing, wanting so desperately to shake him off me. His hand lingered there for about four seconds. He continued to nonchalantly explain math concepts that I was too distracted to understand, acting as if nothing had happened. I counted the number of times he put his hand on my back—five. Once when he wasn't doing that, Sam put his right hand next to his thigh so it just barely touching mine. I very discreetly inched away from him, but he started inching towards me the farther I got away. And then when we were going over slant asymptotes, he said ""slut"" instead of ""slant,"" which he quickly corrected himself. I might have imagined it, but it creeped me out nonetheless.

At that point, my mouth dried up and I felt like I was at the cross country race again. Except this wasn't the good kind of adrenaline.

The moment the session I ended, I gathered my things and walked back to the car, turning the lights off and locking the doors until I could clearly see he had driven away. All I wanted to do was sleep. The adrenaline had worn off and I was too tired to think about the implications of what he did/said. I just felt icky and disgusting. Maybe if I hadn't worn a tank top, or hadn't put my hair in a braid, he wouldn't have made those remarks or put his hand on my back. I kept wondering what was the change in my appearance that would have caused him to act that way, wondering if I might've said or done something. I blamed myself for what happened. I never mentioned it to my mom.

I took the next ACT and scored high. I immediately stopped the tutoring sessions with Sam. He texted me that he was proud of my accomplishment and asked me to add him on Snapchat. I never did. And then I blocked his number.

This happened two years ago and I never thought about writing it here until I came across my old journal that detailed exactly what happened that night. I still feel disgusted and violated thinking about it, but it's better to just move on and focus on better things. Thanks for reading :)",14Feb2020,1
36,"The question of who I am has been plaguing me for quite some time now. But more than that, I have trouble narrowing down what constitutes a personality trait.

Here's my main question. What is a personality?",14Feb2020,1

It even gives a chronological picture of what happened, showing the descent from being more or less normal to killing myself. Of course there are things I wouldn't want people to know even after I'm dead, so they'd all be sorta redacted I think. But still, I don't feel like I *owe* anyone an explanation but I do think it'd be a kindness of me to give some explanation.",14Feb2020,1

The point is to capture sentiment, todays culture, predictions, and polls. 
Some of the predictions are absolutely hilarious to look back on, and some are spot on. 

I love compiling this data, because it really shows in depth at a social level what people feel and shows the sequence of events as it happens, and the raw unfiltered reactions. 

I don’t censor any comments, some of them are extremely racist against Kamala Harris. 

I split them up into newer docs as “chapters” , so each one doesn’t get too full or I accidentally edit it and delete everything or something.

40,"Personal space has been a thing for me for most of my life. Thanks to a handful of sudden, aggressive, unwanted advances in my life, I've always avoided contact with people I don't know or at the very least am not reasonably comfortable with.

I sing karaoke at one of the nicer clubs in the city I live in and it's generally a really close knit group of people who all know each other and are really close, but recently, more randos from town have started showing up because the atmosphere is good and the drinks are cheap. Tonight the crowd was pretty thin, but despite that, there was a cluster of unknowns hanging out.

When my friend was singing, a very drunk woman walked up to her and put one hand on the small of my friend's back and another on her stomach and held onto her while she was singing. The woman's friend tried to pull her back and get her sat down. I figured she would be wrangled and kept controlled. Then it was my turn to sing.

I decided to sing a crowd pleaser and I guess that struck something in her to try to get close to me. She started off leaning on a pillar in front of where the karaoke setup is. As I progressed through the song, she started walking closer to me and I kept backing up. Eventually I was backed up against a table when someone from the bar grabbed her and told her to either sit down or leave.

I'm not shaken up or anything, just annoyed. I feel like, while I should work on getting better at dealing with people coming into my personal space, I feel like my feelings are still valid and that nobody goes to a bar expecting to get approached like that.",14Feb2020,1
41,"I suppose I just want to rant because I don’t want to burden the people I love with more issues. There really ain’t a point to this post but if someone can read this and relate to it and understand that they are not alone then it’ll be worth it. Or maybe I just want to tell someone and post this and it off my chest. I don’t care. 


I’m very frustrated lately. I feel like I’m losing time and no matter how much I work on things, it’s never enough. There are not enough hours in the day to contain what I need to do and I find myself wasting less and less time. I spend 10-14 hours at work giving excellence for no reason. Despite there being no immediate payoff to over performing, I would feel disgusted if I did the bare minimum.


I feel cycles of burnout every few months as I take on more issues without finding resources. I don’t have time to exercise as much, take care of my living spaces. Keeping time for my friends. Building professional and personal relationships. Pursuing my studies, continuing to learn new subjects.


I feel like every second I spend not doing life essentials, I’m wasting time. I don’t find writing an Ms reading fun anymore. It used to be my most important hobby but I just don’t care. It’s been months and I couldn’t care less at this point and I don’t even feel bad about it. 


Video games aren’t as fun. I just don’t want to do jackshit sitting in a chair. I don’t even like talking. I go through my days communicating the bare minimum and it feels better than wasting words. I feel fake. False. Something constructed out of the sun of my parts, as if I woke up one day as a semblance of Me, but not me.


I don’t find things to relate about and I’m mostly concerned about five other things in my head even when I am talking to people. 

The people I do care about are hurt by my indifferent attitudes. I can’t provide for their wellbeing because my cold aura is uncontrollable. I don’t want sympathy for myself because I know I have hurt them and it’s not about me. I just want them to know that I did give effort into valuing them but I may perhaps not be capable of meeting the level they need. I may not be capable of being the yin to their yang. 

All of these feelings have come rushing forward. Time has been passing by so fast. Every time I blink, a week zips by. Something is wrong but I don’t know what.",14Feb2020,1

43,"My life is at best fine (in terms of how much I enjoy it), I am in university, half a roof over my head, and okay friends. But there are a few problems that I really want to fix. 

Firstly, my friends are okay, I don’t mean they are bad people but at times I feel like we are just not compatible and don’t “jive.” I always feel like that 3rd wheel friend who is there just because you know the people from high school. Its not like they really want me there but they wouldn’t shoo me away either. There lies my dilemma as I don’t know how to branch out? All my classes are with them, I do extra curricular but I can hardly make long lasting friends (these were primarily from high school). Like don’t get me wrong they are amazing, nice all that but idk if its me I just get really stressed trying to keep them entertained/happy. 


Secondly, stemming from that, I feel like my emotions depend on them a lot. In the sense that when they say something (even if its not meant to be rude or anything) I may take it the wrong way and really get sad. I realize this is a really bad habit but idk how to stop doing it and want advice (if possible). I would love to be emotionally independent, so that my emotional well being didn’t depend on a friend calling me annoying or smth. 


Thirdly, and this may be the reason behind it all, I think I have some sort of an inferiority complex? No matter what I am doing/have done I feel like I don’t deserve it and got here by chance kind of. My friends are really smart and driven so I almost always end up making a fool of myself (purposefully-&gt; class clown type of deal) just so I have something which I can do? I don’t know if that makes sense much, but if one friend is really smart and another is really charismatic I feel like the only way I can be on level is at least to try and be funny even if its at my own expense?

Tldr: my life is not bad, I just feel like its stuck in a place where I am okay but not happy. Because of that I don’t know where to go/how to get there because its not like anything is bad to the extent where I need to leave my current goals and relationship.",14Feb2020,1
44,"I spent 3 or so years on a guy who made me turn completely submissive. I don’t really remember or have the same perspective as I used to but over the course of time and things he said to me and how he treated me, I became this person who was completely submissive to him. Like a robot or slave. I wouldn’t reach out or say anything unless he wanted to, everything was his choice, his decision. I did everything he wanted, I never opposed, I never spoke up, I never went against. I did everything he wanted. I was literally under his command, unless he asked me to do something I wouldn’t do it. I just was completely submissive to him, I became an empty human whose only purpose was to satisfy him.

I realise now because I’m with someone who wants me to have a say and to be initiative and put effort (not sure if effort is the right word, but my part maybe) into the relationship like 50/50 rather than 100/0. I don’t know how. I don’t know what it was like to message someone just because you “want” to, I don’t ever get that “want” feeling. I’m always on standby and when they want to I’m happy to oblige but I can’t feel any of my feelings. I can’t feel like a normal person I can’t just go oh I feel like texting this guy, it just never feels like that. I always need some kind of outline or guide like a fuckin robot. I don’t know what happened, or maybe I was always like this.

But I’m better than I used to be so I feel it was for the greater good but i just don’t understand, nobody really wants someone at their every command, they want someone with input, opinion somebody who engages and makes decisions. I don’t know how, how to be like that. It’s not that I’m uninterested, it’s just that I don’t know how, it doesn’t come naturally to me at all.

53,"Here’s a good thought experiment;

Imagine I offered to end industrialized farming wholesale. To set the animals free and guarantee that they won’t be harmed - in exchange for a human child to be sacrificed once a year for the rest of time. From our eyes, this would seem barbaric - yet animals make this choice in nature on a daily basis: it is, in fact how natural selection works. 

The truth is - that the lives of animals being treated kindly has a definite value, yet the death of the animal and harvesting of its sustenance via industrial ag far outweighs that value by orders of magnitude, as long as the culling is merciful. 

It’s not possible to quantify the practical value of the life of a child or that of a hamburger, but we can all agree that the children in our thought experiment should be allowed to live their short life as free of pain and stress as we could allow.

54,"i’ve had a lot of things going on the past month or three. in summary, i got involved with a girl who was married, who then subsequently left her husband, went back, found out she was pregnant (with my kid), came back, and has now gone back to him. 

i’ve had some serious thoughts about ending everything. today we had the first ultrasound. 176bpm. healthy baby. everything’s golden. 

but i just can’t shake this feeling. the baby will have a mom and a dad. i’m going to miss out on all the big, prebirth things that i was looking forward to, and while she won’t keep me from having half custody with the child once its born, that doesn’t make any of this any easier. 

now there are three things that are keeping me going. her, that baby (hearing that heartbeat today made a huge difference), and the idea.. that we may still work out. that’s probably just rationalization or denial on my part, but with them, if it hasn’t worked in 14 years, why would it work now? idk. 

i just couldn’t do it to her because she would feel guilty and then with her being pregnant, it puts the baby at further risk, and i just can’t.. i can’t do that to her. 

how do i get these thoughts to go away without self-medicating? i distract myself with games, sleep, tv... but coming home to an empty house is incredibly depressing. i know i should probably go out and do things but now i’ve got to save up for the baby, get stuff for the nursery, and on top of all that, get into the mental mindset that i have to make sure i’m there for the kid. i’m going to get to see the kid every day. i’m just so fucking scared because i don’t know that i can do it alone.",14Feb2020,1
55,"I shouldn't be. I've had every opportunity not to fuck it up. But I have, over and over.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm single. No children. No latent health issues. Still young (late 20s). I have a concerned, empathetic family. I've abused some drugs to try to fill the emptiness, and I know it just worsens things in the long run but I've been so depressed I literally don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

I've not tried enough to do things for others. I don't find it especially gratifying. Or maybe I just don't enjoy anything anyway, so it's not like I could really tell if charitable behavior would help. I don't think I'm wired correctly. I don't care very much about other people even though I try to, but I care about having a good public image, even though I try very hard not to care (I know it's not important). I don't have many friends, and I avoid people and responsibilities a lot because I have already flubbed so many chances to be a functional human adult. I can't take the feeling of shame at being a repeated failure, so I just backlog it by avoiding contact. I shouldn't, but I do

&amp;#x200B;

I ascribe my failures to a self-fulfilling prophecy. I've never felt like I can really do it, so the end result is an inability to. I was encouraged plenty growing up and definitely had an outstanding education, and even though I grew to have a lot of resentment toward parental figures for various reasons, I can't truthfully say life hasn't provided for me. I just don't have an internal motor for wanting to function. The source of my lack of motivation seems to be a disdain for the state of things, and the inertia of happy-go-lucky attitudes in people that just go about their day as if nothing is wrong. As if LGBT people aren't needlessly suffering from shunning and dated religious dogma, and animals aren't suffering just to be eaten and partly discarded after miserable lives in tiny cages. As if our entitlements don't make us insufferable bastards toward people who don't deserve it at all. As if we are not constantly abusing each other and pointing the blame at people and things who have nothing to do with our personal relationships. As if we are not being ripped off and being constantly sold things we don't need, and our health suffers directly from it. As if greed and corruption don't exist in every single social aspect of our species and as if we don't actively participate in those things.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I didn't feel this way. I wish i didn't blow the impact of these things out of proportion in my head, to the point where it impairs my ability to function. I wish I could take personal responsibility like most people seem to be able to, but it just doesn't feel like it would be enough. It doesn't really seem as if people are really doing everything they can to curb our collective carbon footprint on the earth. It doesn't really seem like anyone can set aside their entitlements for long enough to give other people a break. Everyone is addicted to something, but only some addictions get a bad rap, even though most of them are some degree of harmful. Nobody and everybody is to blame, and we are all oppressed in some way that is difficult to acknowledge.

I wish I felt like any of it is really worth it. I wish i had real reasons to complain, like illness, poverty, or homelessness.

I wish i could muster giving a shit about any of this. I wish I wasn't a burden. I wish I didn't have to make crybaby posts on the internet in order to feel any relief. I wish I didn't have to sound like I am constantly complaining. I know the world is in a good spot right now, better than it's ever been, comparatively.

56,"I feel like ive failed. Im 22, still in community college for a bit longer (applied for fall to some 4 years for 2 degrees that I dont care and are useless). Was only supposed to be a 2 year endevor to get general ed done.

My friends who I credit helping me get out of my initial depression are now all disappearing, slowly but surely. Most just find long term relationships, get full time jobs, or live in their 4 year colleges. Some have moved or will move to  other states.

 One even commited suicide not too long ago. Hopefully I wont be joining him but its hard. He was a real good guy. I wish I could have hung out with him one more time before he went. 

I feel like ive failed not just because ive taken so long, but that I achieved far, far less than what I *should* have.

I was essentially spoonfed to be successful ever since I was a kid; good home life, parents prioritized math, dual language, science, and piano/music. 

As a kid I knew I wanted to do something fucking phenominal, rare, amazing. I was *destined* to become a great inventor, composer, fighter pilot, game designer, etc. Or, at least thats what I thought.

I was good/still believe I am somewhat good at creative shit. Whether it be music, art, or inventing new solutions to issues I had in hobbies, I could do well. And yet (ill attempt not to go into detail as this is long enough already) at every turn I came up with an excuse as to why I couldn't do it; why it ""wasnt for me"". And I gave up on them. Told myself ""ill just do it later"".

Now here I am. Unspeciallized in anything. Jack of all trades, master of none. Held back by none other than myself. Comming up with excuses for why I can't help myself. Disappointing to all, yet no one is more disapponted in me than, well, me. Because I know I could have done better. I know its my fault.


When I was around my friends, I was much more enthusiastic and positive about life; ""We'll get through this/we'll all become successful together!"". Ive noticed my mental health has declined in parallel with my decline in time with close friends. I miss them dearly. 

I wish I could be my positive old self again. I wish I still had that enthusiasm and drive to tell myself ""HELL YEA Ill be the next hanz zimmer! Hell yea ill be the next einstien!""

So when I'm not working, I'm working on holding her together. I have one friend in the city I live in and all he wants to do is drink and complain. I don't enjoy any of the things I used to enjoy, I'm constantly pushing people away, I never feel like myself, and I don't feel like I'm worth anything. 

I just want to die. Killing myself seems too cliche and kinda' boring. Besides, I don't want to do any of the traditional things that people do to commit suicide. Slit my wrists, overdose, marry Courtney Love, CO2 poisoning, etc. All that sound like more effort than I'm willing to put in. 

I never had good experiences as a kid or teenager. As a kid, I was getting my ass beat all the time, or told I wasn't good enough at believing in God. As a teenager, nobody wanted to be around me because I didn't talk and didn't know how to connect with people. Now, as an adult, I've outgrown all of that, but I can't be bothered to go out when coworkers invite me for dinner or drinks, and it's not like you can just make a friend anymore. 

It's not even so much as I want die. I just don't care about the life I'm living. It's boring, tiring, there's no payoff in sight, and I'm just living the same week over and over again. I don't even know the day of the week or month; I never know the time, or how much gas I have in the car, or when I last ate. It's all a blur of work, and holding my girlfriend together. 
I'd give anything to break up with her, but she needs me around, we've been together forever, and she's the only reason I go out once a month. What am I going to do, take myself out to eat every 24th? 

Nothing matters to me. I keep up my looks because I work in an office, I watch my weight because my girlfriend constantly nags that I'm gaining weight, even when I'm not. I go to the doctor, because that's just what you do. It's all a routine, and I just don't care anymore. About anything. 
I hate that I've let this happen. I wanted to help people, goddammit! I wanted to make a difference and improve the world I was put into. I wanted to do good for the sake of doing good. I wanted to stand for something bigger and better for myself. I wanted to live a life I could be proud of. Now I'm just taking calls, filing paperwork, going to meetings, scheduling events, and having panic attacks. 

Life was supposed to be better. I was supposed to be better at living it. I busted my ass, stayed home, and barely had any fun as a teenager just to get a perfect GPA and what the fuck was it for? I'm just middle of the pack. It didn't mean anything. My parents didn't even care. I spent countless hours staying up late, not going out and trying to make friends, and when it payed off, nobody cared. 

And now I'm just what, pitying myself? 
Oh, poor me, I wasted my life and now I'm paying for it. Who fucking cares? God? My parents? 
What was I supposed to do? And if I die, what do I say? That I had all this potential and drive, and I died with no purpose? 

Is this just what being an adult is? Regretting the day before, over and over again until you die? I work and I work and I work. I put in the overtime, I exceed goals, and for what? That fucking gold star tacked to my cubicle? That 10¢ pay bump every quarter? Why do I work so hard, when nobody gives a shit whether I live or die here? Why do I work so hard to sustain a person's emotional health, when they can't be bothered to lift a finger for my needs? It's not like I'm doing anything I'm proud of so why bother? Like, is this a joke?
Just fucking kill me. Just, take me away from all this. I don't like this life, this world, this body, or these people. I don't care about about any of it. It's an unfixable, but completely uninteresting mess. 

God, if you're out there, just get me out of here. I failed, okay? I did it wrong, so just let me bail. I'll admit to my sins and proclaim your truth, just let it end, please? I'm sorry I messed it up, but don't make me actually finish it. We both know it's not worth it. I can't fix it, and even if I did, only I would benefit so it's not even worth it anymore. Just toss me into your busted projects bin and let me rot with Tim Tebow and that one televangelist who tried to not be a corrupt money grubber.

So, does anybody know how I can apply to be one of those people who gets buried under a tree sapling or something? If I can't do anything as an alive body, I'd like my dead body to at least help a tree or whatever the shit.",14Feb2020,1

I’m moving out of home tomorrow and I’ve just finished packing everything. I’ve spent my whole childhood in this house, specifically this bedroom, and I feel very strange emotions hitting me all at once. 

The moment that finally made me cry was when I found my old diary from my early teen years. I was bullied quite badly and in some not-nice mental places over those years. It was all documented in there, along with some things that really scare me, looking back. The plan was always to get rid of the diary when I felt like I was truly ready to put that part of my life away, moving on entirely from that and Highschool and old grudges and everything. 

I had a little flick through it and I couldn’t really bear it. I noticed that there was one last page left, right at the end. So I scribbled a quick note;

“I am moving on now. In all capacities. Thank you for everything, I’m so proud of you.” 

And then I threw it in the bin. 

I feel good now. But I can’t stop crying.",14Feb2020,1

Even the bad times I take in a positive light because they serve to teach me something and make me stronger, more experienced and wiser. It's impacted me so much I decided to make a [video about it](https://youtu.be/WRNh3vpXIzo).

Gratitude is focusing on all the good things in life and being thankful for everything that brings us happiness. It is about developing a thankful appreciation for all of life's joy and abundance, instead of focusing on life's negative sides.

There are four main ways to develop gratitude:

1. Mental Gratitude Exercises - Recount 3-5 good things that happened during the day, every night before bed. And remind yourself of all the good things that will be happening today, every morning.
2. Gratitude Journal - Every time something good happens, write it in. Big all Small.
3. Express gratitude openly and frequently - Express your gratitude for your friends, family and work to them directly. It will make them feel so respected and appreciated.
4. Gratitude Meditation - (Passive) Be mindful of all your thoughts, feelings, sensations and emotions, and observe them through the lens of gratitude. (Active) Actively think positive thoughts, grateful thoughts, and be thankful for all of we have.

Benefits of Gratitude: Strengthens friendships, Encourages humility, Reduces envy and jealousy, Increases fulfillment, Reduces selfishness, Improves physical and emotional wellbeing, Increases empathy, Strengthens self-esteem.

May we all develop a grateful mind and observe all the joy and beauty life has to offer. how to practice gratitude meditation.",14Feb2020,1
64,"I bought my very mature 5 year old an Atlas last week because he started to get curious about the world. Each page explains a piece of history. Reading it with him I wound up explaining how the Europeans took boats, came to America and killed most people. Then how they went to Africa, kidnapped men, women and children, put them in chains and brought them to the country where they had killed most of the locals and forced them to work and much much worse. Suddenly WWII didn’t seem like one of the only horrendous things that ever happened to humanity (I know, there are many more but...) and the Europeans became the Germans of the world.  As he was asking questions, the evil of it all was just sinking in. I can’t believe the BS they taught us as kids, how these Europeans discovered America, like they were some sort of superheroes, all the while what was going on was mass genocide, rape, assimilation, racism, slavery, cruelty. Our ancestors are vile creatures, they didn’t discover Anything and we shouldn’t celebrate any holiday in their honour, instead we should mourn and linger in the shame of what they did.

8 months ago we had my cousin's 26th birthday. We grew up together and he was my close best friend. More like my brother actually. So of course I was there. He was having a great time. The next day he did not show up for work. His boss, who I know, called me and told me to go see what's going on. So I went to my cousin's house where I found his dead body in his bathtub. I tried everything, but I was too late.

He had some emotional trauma that he did not talk about and he did not know how to deal with. I think he had some form of PTSD and depression. A year ago things didn't go well between him and this girl that he loved very much. He wrote some love letters to her, here on Reddit on the Unsent Letters forum. These letters show him quickly falling into a dark place. He figured that if he couldn't have his dream girl, then all he had left was his nightmares and depression, and that wasn't worth living for. He ended his own life. Nobody knew anything about how he felt. To make things even more horrible, the girl was absolutely devastated, and also ended her own life two months later. She was 24.

I see other people that lose loved ones. They grieve some time and then move on. I don't know how to. I still feel just as sad today as then. I don't know how to just accept that this happened and he is just gone forever and that's it. I'm trying to, but I'm lying to myself until I break down again a few days later.

We lost these two beautiful young people. They were friends because they couldn't be together because of circumstances. But they loved each other like they had spend 10 lifetimes together. And now they are just gone for no reason at all. She tried to talk to me after my cousin died and I couldn't talk to her because it made me cry to just see her. I hate myself for not being there for my cousin first and then for her.

Maybe this sounds stupid to other people and other cultures, but I really, actually loved my cousin. Like he was my little brother. I was always protective of him. Now I have all these thoughts in my head about where he is now and how he feels. I try to imagine that they are together somewhere now to make myself feel better.

I like this one dude. We're really really good friends, something like brothers or whatever. Yesterday in English class he wrote a letter real fast and asked the teacher to go put it in the box. I was really curious for who it was. Maybe me? Nah, he doesn't like me that way. I assumed it was for a friend since there are literally no lovey doveys in school.

4th period comes and we get our letters. I get one but don't open it right away. I wanted to see his reaction. He laughed and all good.

75,"this is a post for accountability (a rambling embarrassing stream of consciousness), because once the internet/CIA knows, i have to stick to it, right? 

i’ve been fucking up really hard recently. i’m sure this isnt a unique experience; in a transitory period of life, full of extreme highs and lows, daunting decisions, and cloudy headedness at the most inconvenient times. I started journaling again, only to find that my raw sewage of thoughts appeared as reflections of my worst self; at 22, i was a reflection of my 13 year old self, mentally fogged utilizing fucked habits to feel something. not eating, chain smoking, cutting myself (hadn’t for maybe 2 years) and countless hours reading others rationalizations for not killing yourself because the rationalizations ive sang to myself over the years became a song i overplayed to the point of moot resonation. 

of course, i survived ages 11-21, and learned a lot about coping with existence in those years. drawing on that, i drank 15+ cups of tea each day, chain smoked, worked out, extensively bathed, and read the most compelling stoic literature that i know of. i attempted to lose myself in violin, balisong, and hiking. i reminded myself that i play a part in catalyzing the revolution, and can positively impact the world through my privilege of logic, literacy, compassion, and ambition. i pet my dog and reminded myself that no one knows him, or will love him, like i do. i thought about all the places i havent experienced. i thought about how much further i can go with psychedelic exploration. i wrote poetry again. 

and still, i couldnt rationalize the fact that i am in control of my life, continually try what feels like my hardest, and continually fail where it matters. i am a bad friend, and fail to be there for those who reach out to me. i get lost in irrational anxiety about being in public / social situations. continually caught between hating myself for not going out and enjoying the human experience with friends who want to go out with me. or going out, still consumed by anxiety, unable to be my authentic self and being ashamed at the shell of my self that i displayed. i acknowledge my anxiety is irrational: on a base level i am happy with who i am. i do not care about others opinions on me, unless it is in the form of constructive criticism coming from a place of shared values. 

there is no one that has hurt me more than myself. not my birth mother and her god damn genetics, not my adopted family, not former friends, foes, or lovers. i hate myself, but i hate having to endure existence more than i hate myself. i am tired of knowing what i need to do, and failing. i am tired of accumulating worthless knowledge and skills, just to watch those i love die before i found the strength or wisdom to do what was needed. i am tired of failing at expressing emotions and thoughts that deserved and needed to be shared. i am tired of being a slave to anxiety and mental illness. since i became conscious of my mind creating false sounds, images, and ideas, i have clung to logic, telling myself that nothing can overpower my learned ability to detach and think logically. i found a double edged knife: my ability to openly and vulnerably express my emotions an unintended victim. the number of people i wish i had expressed my love and appreciation for before their death will only continue to grow, and i feel powerless against it increasing. i experience my biggest fear daily and do nothing to stop the growth of its magnitude. i no longer cry every day, because i am numb to it. again, a double edged knife. 

instead of following the call of the void, i did some psychedelics. honestly, i can’t say i feel better- maybe just softened. it reminded me how deeply soothing practicing things i love are, when i am clear minded enough to put my whole being into it. somehow poetry and fresh music are more of a compelling reason to live again. even if i continue failing, i will have the experience of feeling- whether that be exhilaration, joy, shame, or regret. at least i’ve still got my human experience. amor fati resonates deeply. even if my perceptions aren’t aligned with others, i know that as long as i continue to act with good intentions and honesty, it will be okay. honesty without tact is cruelty, and i will be mindful of increasing my gentleness to others, especially in times where i feel myself becoming impatient. i am in control of my thoughts, which translate into action. accepting the path of my life as it shows itself is a choice. instead of trying to drive straight because of comfortable logic, i will slow down to recognize the seemingly reasonless curves. 

as i was typing that, my dog came and put his head on my belly. all i need to do is what’s right until those i have an obligation to are gone. that may be awhile, or not. regardless, all i have is the present moment to work towards giving my dog the maximum amount of love and repaying my parents kindness. luckily and unluckily, the present moment is an eternity. so, i will continue on. i will throw the ball, ice cookies, and finish “meditations” by marcus aurelius. i will respond to my friends. i will inquire about the meeting sunday. i will experience all within my power and do what i can to help others along the way.",14Feb2020,1

78,"I [23 F] work in a popular STEM field. I graduated with my bachelors last year, but I started looking for full time positions about 6 months before graduation because sometimes the process can take a while and I wanted to get ahead.

I worked my ass of at school and graduated with a 4.0 so I had a lot of interest. I aced both interviews I got and received two job offers. Since they both sent the offers literally hours after my interviews, I assume I was a top choice (this is relevant later). The job I ended up going with let me sign the job contract 5 months in advance of my start date, and offered me a moderate signing bonus (4k) because to work there I had to sell my house and move across the country. The salary they offered was about 10k lower than I could have made at a larger company but I thought the work they were doing was really cool so I accepted. 

Well, I got there 4.5 months ago and immediately it was a mess. Literally my second day there, they had to lay off a ton of employees because they had barely managed to sell any product these past few years and investors were forcing them to cut their budget and said the entire company was getting shut down by November 2020 if they couldn't meet some (very steep) goals. The CEO called the entire staff into a meeting room immediately following the layoffs and admitted he doesnt know where the company will be in a year and said it might get completely shut down or sold.

Furthermore, the department I work for is a mess. Since I joined literally half the department has quit, and according to my coworkers ""about 12"" people quit in the past year or so (the department was fewer than 10 ppl when I started).

On top of this I've been struggling with some health problems lately that make it difficult to do my job, so I started looking for a new position.

I got an offer at a much more stable company a week ago. Their health benefits cover the type of medical therapy I need to start fixing my illness, their flex hours will let me attend said medical therapy and on top of that the pay is astronomically higher than what I make rn.

I handed in my two weeks notice and immediately everything went to shit. I think I was polite, thanking them for the opportunity and citing the layoffs and my health issues as reasons. The head of HR (Who happens to be the CTO's sister) took me into a meeting room and GRILLED ME for 15 minutes about my medical condition. It seemed like she was trying to catch me in a lie. Stuff like ""when were u diagnosed? What are ur symptoms? You could have told us earlier! Why dont you just get surgery it doesnt sound lethal or anything!""

Then she insinuated that I only used this company for the signing bonus to ""get ahead"", said they could have hired someone cheaper and insinuated that I was an asshole for screwing over the company and wasting their money. She said on a personal level she was ""very disappointed with me"". She then sent a follow up email saying the only reason I hadn't been laid off was because they expected me to stay longer. The whole time she acted like I was some charity case and like they did me a huge favor by hiring me. Literally all of this because I handed in a 2 week notice.

I am so confused and furious. First of all this was supposed to be a trainee role, I was literally supposed to be receiving training for 3 months and not producing results at all.

Instead my manager trained me for all of TWO DAYS and then gave me a solo project he told me to just ""mess around with"" and see if I could get anything done over the course of a few months.

I finished it in a month and SINGLEHANDEDLY FILLED 6 MONTHS WORTH OF INVESTOR QUOTA. I LITERALLY BOUGHT THIS COMPANY 6 MONTHS OF NOT GETTING SHUT DOWN. JUST ME WITH MY SOLO PROJECT. MANAGEMENT HAS ADMITTED THIS. 

furthermore, I got 3 more projects that I was supposed to ""just take a look at, no pressure"" and I got them done instantly and the work was perfect. My manager has admitted I put them ahead of schedule for the first time in forever and that I am integral to saving this company from shut down.

And after all this, HR insinuates I used them for 4k fucking dollars and interrogates me about an illness I havent told anyone outside of immediate family and close friends about BECAUSE I DONT WANNA TALK ABOUT IT. I stuck around and SAVED THESE PEOPLES ASSES in a role that was meant to have me training and producing no valuable results for three months!

It also comes as no surprise that they do not tolerate opposing views. I once tried to convince them that forcible suicide prevention on incels for arbitrary reasons was a horrible and dangerous idea and used a personal real life example, but just got insulted and had said example justified.

I've unfortunately had similar experiences with another community: the protectors of the plot continuum, a group of writers that parody bad fan-fiction through creating mocking recursive fics in which everything from the bad fanfic is destroyed. They claim it is supposed to be comedic but they tend to be incredibly heavy-handed and inflexible in their attitude towards violations of canon. Their responses to fringe content is even worse, actively seeking out and attempting to parody something that horribly disgusts them for little more than an ego stroking.

Which leads me to my final point: I am thoroughly convinced that ""mocking watchdog"" behavior is glorified, masturbatory, ego driven trolling, mirroring the id-driven and bigoted trolls they claim to mock/monitor. The two feed off each other like a brutal chain of mutual rape. Or like a snake eating itself, reproductive organs first.

87,"I’ve been anonymously cyberstalking and harassing my ex-boyfriend for 5 years. I keep swearing that I’m going to stop, but for whatever reason I can’t actually get myself to follow through on it. I know it’s a hugely fucked-up thing to do (and probably stems from a super unhealthy coping mechanism for my anxiety disorder) but I still do it anyway.

I have lied to everyone in my life about this. Even my fiancé to whom I tell EVERYTHING- this is the only secret that I’ve ever kept from him. Everyone is aware that my ex-boyfriend has a stalker, but I’ve denied knowing anything about it, faked evidence to show that I was stalked as well to throw off suspicion, and convinced many people that my ex-boyfriend orchestrated the entire thing himself.

Sometimes I feel bad about my behavior, but that usually passes. I don’t really even feel bad about the stalking, I only really feel bad for lying to my fiancé and my friends. Really I feel like my ex-boyfriend deserves this for cheating on me and being emotionally manipulative throughout our relationship. I still don’t think it’s right for me to be doing this, even if he does deserve the bad karma, I know logically that it is insane and unfair for me to keep coming after him like this just because of something bad he did to me 5 years ago.

Last week my best friend who I’ve had a long-term crush on rejected me. She has a boyfriend who she “loves very much.” She said she still wants to be friends, but there’s no use in that. I don’t deserve someone as great and pure as her. I’ve cut all contact with her.

I had to go back to another job I held and went back to $17 an hour. A massive cut. It hurt... I just finished paying off a bunch of debt because I was an idiot and over used a credit card.

Set aside also the oddity that they are a neighbor to a child or two in their school district. Mr. Feeney not only cares about his student's academic wellbeing, but their personal wellbeing as well. To him, being a teacher is basically being a second or third parent to an entire community of children. I think Mr. Turner was being trained by Feeney as his successor in that regard. If you've seen the show, you'd know how much he cares for Shawn, despite having zero blood or marital relationship to him. 

The sacrifices Feeney made to ensure the healthy development of his pupils are nothing short of Christlike. I always related to Shawn moreso than Corey growing up.  Single parent, lived in a trailer (at one point), had a half brother I didn't know about until later. Fortunately, my single parent didn't die, but my dad did. I was lucky to have a Mr. Feeney, despite it being only through High School.

103,"I remember making this account while sitting on the bus on my way to see my boyfriend for Valentine’s Day, even though we were on a break at the time. 

I was unemployed, living with my mom for the first time since I was 18, taking driving lessons at 25 years old, and had just had surgery for endometriosis after years of my physical and mental health going down hill from being in constant pain. I was in such an odd place in my life; a place I never expected to be. I had seriously retreated from life as I knew it, as was doing some major healing and growth, though I didn’t really see it that way at the time. 

365 years later, my boyfriend and I are back together, and living in our own apartment. I got my license, and I bought a car! Now when I drive I can’t believe that a year ago I was still learning and scared shitless. I feel like I’ve been driving since I was 16! I landed a job in my field which has a reputable name and I am well respected professionally. I have been pain free since my surgery, which has completely changed my life. 

I’m happy, I’m healthy, and I feel back on track from the detour that I was on one year ago. 

Happy cake day to me!",14Feb2020,1
105,"Uni plows us to have 20 therapy sessions for 25$. I could afford that, but after that I'll have to transition to private, which is 110$. I feel like I've created a good bond with my therapist, so I can't transition to someone else like that.

I've come such a long way in the past 4 months. But there are so many unresolved things I haven't dealt with. And I can't speak about it to anyone around me, but I can't afford a therapist either. I'm not sure how what I'm going to do about this going forward.",14Feb2020,1

109,"I (20f) have been depressed for a long while and after getting my antidepressant medication a few years back I just stopped going to therapy. I knew I needed therapy (depression, anxiety, panic attacks, suicidal ideation, and unhealthy coping mechanisms are baseline/normal for me) but I just kept saying I had good enough coping techniques and that I didn't have the time/money for regular therapy. In addition, there were a lot of psychological blocks.

After having a deep conversation with a close friend a few days ago where she said that she was seriously worried that I was heading for a mental breakdown, I finally scheduled a meeting with my school's on-campus therapist.

I talked with the therapist this morning and she said I definitely needed long-term therapy. She explained that now that I was on the school's radar, they would check in with me regularly and help me research and contact therapists to begin seeing long-term. I was in a rut and refusing to reach out to a therapist on my own, so this is exactly what I needed (i.e. someone who had the authority to check whether I was getting help and who I couldn't just dismiss or calm down with my usual bullshit)

So I'm finally getting the help I need. I should have started therapy years ago, but I'm proud of myself for doing this now. Better late than never :)

Happy Valentine's day!",14Feb2020,1

115,"It's a very successful local chain that is bright, dynamic, energetic and AMAZING! All their core philosophies and goals are aligned with what I am doing in my personal life, and it feels so right on so many levels. It is a great job with a high salary and benefits, which of course will be nice but the main thing I am excited about is the chance to learn, grow, and evolve myself. 

I am going to be in a leadership position, and I see my role as mainly supporting and motivating the team and helping to grow the business. I want to acclimate slowly and lightly, building a solid foundation of trust and respect with my employees. I want to listen more than I speak, constantly be self-reflecting, and let my ego stay home completely. I want to always own my mistakes, admit when I am wrong, always giving credit to others when due and embodying the idea that one person's success is everyone's success! I want to help foster positive changes and growth for myself and my team. I want to grow together with this company, the employees, the customers, and everyone I encounter. I want to add my own unique personality and talents to the overall dynamic of the restaurant and help make it as good as we possibly can...while having fun of course!

When I took them down, I saw that they appeared to be covered in blood. I was terrified. As a cancer survivor, I’d been told by a doctor that if I ever got lung cancer, it would be fatal. I turned on the lamp to call 911. I saw then that my hands were clean and unbloodied. It was just a dream. I’ve never had an experience like that where a dream merged into reality so smoothly.

118,"Writing down what you're going through is very cathartic. It's something I realized when I started journaling sporadically but  quickly abandoned. Much like the habits I've been trying to cultivate, the lack of motivation to follow through with things is the culprit here more than the desire to.


I'm realising with a certainty that most of the issues in my life are a manifestation of, well, me. I've been wondering why no one bothers following up with me anymore, while conveniently not realising that at least four people have asked me to hang out with them. Sometimes I wonder why I put myself down so much despite (quite possibly) adding value to other people's lives. It wasn't this way earlier, you know. I learned how to love myself and keep things in check, in a narcissistic way, sure, but the feelings were innocent, naive and pure. I wish I was the same. 

Things haven't been the same after the heartbreak, and the next heartbreak was easier to deal with but still a bother to deal with. Drunkenly asking a crush out isn't something I do because I have no reservations of doing it sober, but I thought I'd do it anyway. It turns out, after all the flirting, she wasn't really interested, which is a shame I guess, but this is one I won't take personally at all. I shouldn't have made a fool of myself in front of a party of 8, but at least I didn't hesitate from being a more open person. Do people even know who I am? I'm so reserved and hesitant, pushing people away all the time, yet upset when unable to make meaningful connections. It's like, is there a secret formula to stability? I know people aren't as happy as they seem, but even their bad side seems alright. Why are my ups and downs so extreme? Why is my physical health in the trashcan at 20? I just want to play the sports I love, work out, go for a hike without feeling a sharp pain in some random body part. Why is this so much to ask for?

Why do I feel like an imposter despite doing well for myself? Clearly people like my work, but when that dude messaged ""You grammar is atrocious, please don't message me again"", there was a genuine moment of panic, dude. Why can't I stop procrastinating, do my work on time and finish a book from start to end? Get back to photography, to drawing and painting? Learn the guitar, learn all those languages I've wanted to? There's so much to do and it's not like I don't have the time, or the mental capacity.

The motivation bit is the problem though. I could lose some weight too. That'd be great. Some good spending habits wouldn't be too bad either.

Life's an uphill battle. I just didn't think it'd be at a 90° incline. 60 would be great, 45 would be fantastic. But first, I think a good night's sleep followed by cleaning the room and the house is in order. And then on to tackling the world. Again.

120,"It's Valentine's day, 3 days ago you told me that you wanted to divorce. You also told me that you would still be my valentine that you love me so much. But you picked up extra on your day off, an extra long lunch and went to go check on an apartment for you. I can't stand that you're doing this to me.


 Today I added up all the bills, and divided them by two. We both got paid so I did the math and I took out every penny that belong to me and I opened up a new account. 

You're not going to be able to make it on your own what the bills that are in your name. But as of right now we are still married, so I took my fair share of everything that we have and I paid it. 


You have $200 left to your name I have just under a thousand, I hope you're going to be able to get your apartment that you talked about but I'm not going to help you.

 And if you want this divorce you're going to have to pay for the lawyer and the paperwork I'm not doing it. I do not want this divorce.

123,"Okay so, we're both University students and pretty shy and I get the impression that we maybe don't talk to each other as often as we might because of our shyness. (like for me personally, I don't wanna say something embarrassing to her so I tend not to talk to her all that much). That being said, when we do talk, she laughs at my jokes and I laugh at hers and I give her compliments from time to time. She teases/jokes with me but in a non-harmful way and I in turn, tease her a bit too. She also likes to ask me lots of questions as if she's very interested in me and always looks and smiles at me really sincerely. We also happen to be in a mutual group chat and she always immediately replies or ""reacts"" (like on Facebook messenger) to my messages.

Problem is, she always tends to hang around with her girl-friends, and I don't really feel comfortable going up to her whilst she's with them. Also, she technically my next-door neighbour as we live in the University halls but she stays with her parents instead. I get the feeling that if she liked me, she would choose to stay in the halls but it might also be that her parents want her home or something I dunno.

Also, we are both Muslim and am not sure as to whether we are permitted from being in a relationship.

So yeah, I really like this girl and I cannot stop thinking about her.

TL; DR: Want to tell my shy, Muslim crush that I like her on this most romantic of days but I'm not sure if she likes me back. How should I go about doing this?",14Feb2020,1

A little over two years ago I was almost 230 lbs at 5’5” and could barely walk up a flight of stairs, I was so unhealthy and miserable. My joints hurt all the time and walking for longer than 10 minutes caused crippling pain in my hips and knees. 
I decided I had to change and started slowly exercising and changed my diet. I started running sometime in May or last year, just casually. Never really pushing myself too hard because my body is still adjusting to being less heavy and working out.

She was so excited to see her favorite teacher and it was adorable. She hasnt seen her in 3 years because her favorite teacher was going through cancer treatment. She is cancer free now! It was the cutest thing when my favorite teacher (Ms W) saw Ms S. She quickly got up from the desk and hugged her. She introduced me to her and all the other teachers in the room thought it was cool. 3 generations of teachers. All inspired by someone in that room.

131,"There's something about Valentine's Day and weddings that make me spiral down into some very depressive episode. The funny part is that I'm in a very loving relationship. However, past relationships (ex boyfriend and my relationship with my parents and witnessing their divorce first hand) makes these events difficult for me to enjoy. 

I just feel so awkward and weird about them. I can't handle seeing others of social media spread their love because it makes me feel like I'll never have anything as awesome or as deep as theirs. 

This issue is completely my own head playing tricks on me, because I do have a wonderful, loving partner. Something happened, not sure what, that makes me believe that I don't deserve it or that it won't last forever. As far as a wedding, I love to think of of us marrying, but also hate it because of the way I know my family acts when drinking and the potential to ruin such a special day. 

I've been seriously lacking self esteem lately and needed somewhere to throw negative thoughts so thanks for reading.",14Feb2020,1
