1,"So smooth. Substantial, but not thick or unpliable. Even the edges feel nice; like they couldn't give me a paper cut if they tried.

It's the paper equivalent of ~~sex~~ heavy-petting.",17Oct2020,1
2,"The best example I can think of to explain the ""effects"" my condition causes would be to imagine a really shy guy who's never been with a girl and how nervous, flustered, they would get being with someone they really like for the first time and then multiply it by 5 and that is how I get when just reaching first base with a girl. 
Or, for the more cultured people, basically how a shota would react except more realistic of course.

Voice shaky, face flushed, heavy breathing, heart racing and beating intensely, my voice also becomes higher pitched. I nearly passed out and couldn't even get to third base last time (which admitted was my first time being with a girl since my condition started) when I was with a girl. 

That was also the last time I was with her, we only had a couple dates and met on tinder so it isn't like we had a deep connection or anything.

The cause of all this is a type of anxiety that is constant. Just one day out of the blue it started with a panic attack but instead of going back to normal it stayed like 75% of the way between a panic attack and normal. It took me a couple weeks to realize it may be (and was) a type of anxiety and not a heart problem because there was nothing I was directly anxious about, and if I was worried about something my heart rate would pickup and usually cause a panic attack until going back down to the same constant level.

After going to a psychiatrist and 2 years of taking a SNRI and (briefly) a SSRI, I can be off klonopin and it is only like 25% of what it used to be. Was never with anyone during those 2 years.

I heard from my friend that there are girls out there that would find those reactions ""cute"" (execpt for the nearly passing out part) but I have yet to find one.

For anyone who may wonder I am a skinny 25 y/ old guy with one of those young looking faces that make me look several years younger when I'm fully shaved and my hair cut short.",17Oct2020,1
3,"I'm teetering on the edge of a cliff after spending years patching up my wings, ready to take flight into the world. My mind is deeply unique with eloquence matched by a deep grounded sense of what it means to be Spiritual, a topic sorely misunderstood in this day and age of immense depression, anxiety, new age hypocrisy, and religious trauma that has warped the emotional connotation of these ideas. I have recently [made my first podcast](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSeventhState/comments/jc19kx/podcast_1/) touching on the foundational aspects of spiritual science for people to begin changing their prejudice towards the ideas. Everybody who has listened to it has given me great feedback so far.

Life pushed me to becoming a touch-therapist, and I can explain to you how energy healing works if you care to know. I am a trained massage therapist, a class with anatomical knowledge for the biomechanical aspects, a Reiki practitioner as the total ""wu-wu"" aspect, and Craniosacral therapist for a more grounded, scientific approach to energy work. On this path of mine, I have healed from cluster headaches that drove me to the brink of suicide, Borderline Personality Disorder from abuse and neglect, IBS after discovering that I had developed food sensitivities from poor diet, and become a Gnostic when I was once atheist. I have come from the edge of death at my own hand and discovered immense Love for the world with the ability to articulate why people have so much trouble finding it, if they give me the chance.

By the nature of the mirror neuron synapses in the human brain, I have an awareness transmitted through my hands and space that can turn off the hyperaroused state of Fight/Flight/Freeze that people get trapped in causing adrenal fatigue, low serotonin release, and poor digestion from a lack of parasympathetic activation. I can feel where your body is cold from stagnation and give it the awareness it needs to begin moving in flow once more. 

But today, I was feeling the pressure. I've been struggling to find clientele for my energy work with word of mouth being my primary advertising route in the past before Covid. An unstable home environment from toxic roommates made running this business nearly impossible, only seeing patients intermittently. The roommate who was in charge of rent previously, co-leased with me, had a drug problem that he was dishonest about which sent him into a state of psychosis after using bill money on smoke before walking out of the house and leaving me on the hook. The other could not handle a basic conversation without turning hostile, so I gave him 14 days notice to vacate because I could no longer handle the aggression in the house. Perhaps that was a foolish decision without a backup, but I already have my eyes and attention on a replacement who would be the perfect fit. My furnace isn't working properly and my landlord is getting on my case about back-rent with threats of eviction in his voice.

Not gunna lie, I was fearful today. My morning was spent scrambling, jumping between job applications and spreading my content for donation and finding subreddits that could help. My head was thinking about the cold winter, about how I can make it to my online class if I'm homeless, and about the emotional drain it would put on me to go longer without my practice being built.

All these anxieties swirling around me, my focus shooting from one thing to the next as worry overtook my body...when I was pulled to take a puff of the only medicine left for me. No caffeine, no nicotine, no more cannabis; after a morning of being in a panicked state, I smoked DMT.

As the feeling began to take hold, the fear began to revolt in madness bouncing around my chest like a xenomorph was hatching in my rib cage. I remembered the lessons of the Buddha and released attachment to the previous experience, grounding into This Moment of Now that is reality. In doing so, I realized why none of my pleas were working; I had forsaken my truest gift of inner peace because I had lost sight of the path that carried me forward in grace. 

My story wasn't supposed to be clamouring and fearful, it is one of hope blossoming from the darkness like the lotus emerging from mud. It wasn't my place to be a beggar, because my mind holds untold riches to be shared with the world. As an energy worker, it is purely my job to hold a place of safety and communion within my essence to be exuded outwards into the world. I will always sing a song of hope, even if my path is through a hard and homeless winter. I know that my desires are deeply rooted in care, compassion, and the transformation of our era shifting into a new way of being.

But I don't believe that is my path. I trust in finding the support structures I need to uplift me in these times of hardship, in continuing to put my energy into the places where I am most helpful, and to unshackle the bonds that are hindering my full prowess as a businessman who will change the world.

I am being offered an apprenticeship by an entrepreneur, who is waiting for the moment I have a solid income. When I gain that knowledge, the direction I take it will be for sharing my privilege with those struggling in the journey and its trauma, for rehabilitation of our ecology, and for infrastructures that will help us emerge from these dark ages we still linger within. 

Covid is a time for transformation and rehabilitation, but I need the world to give me permission to unleash my wildest dreams upon them...because in truth, I would be content meditating on a mountaintop until the days grow dark, but that is not the person I am meant to be. I am meant to be an illustrious demonstration of the healing journey, and I have gotten here by being helped and helping alike. 

Ask me about energetic blockages and I will help the best way I can. All I ask in return is if you can afford a tithe in support and faith of me to do so, because the gesture will be repaid forward a thousand times in a thousand ways.",17Oct2020,1
4,"Hi... I’m just wondering if anyone else is like me.

I am a 24-year-old girl (I still want to be young...) and just completed medical school

I have only realised recently that, throughout my uni years, I have slowly developed quite a distrust in everyone in general.

I’m not sure if it could even be classified as distrust, but I

1. Don’t trust anyone when they promise they would do something. I need to proactively follow up to make sure it’s being done.

2. Don’t have any close friends, because when one does anything to hurt me, I cut all ties with them. I think I see it as: if they have the capacity to hurt me like this then they can do it again, and I don’t have time for that.

3. Don’t need anyone but my family. Throughout uni I seem not to have learnt much from anyone. However, those who came into my life got some hard-earned research information and knowledge off of me. I really feel like I’m just consistently losing by having ‘friends’ and not gaining anything from it. I don’t find pleasure in hanging out with people either. I also see it as fleeting and unnecessary and in the end we part ways anyway.

4. When someone is  very nice (eg uni friend), I always have at the back of my mind the idea that it’s merely a facade. And I’d be more cautious not to tell them any personal things, just in case I’m swayed by their apparent kindness and the fact that they could use that info against me later and I would regret sharing it.

5. I used to go out of my way to help people in everyday life. I would be on a call with a friend for hours explaining biochemistry and pharmacology to them. But I was one of the top of the class and no one ever helped me with anything... And then we all part ways anyway. And I never learn anything new things/info from anyone (except professors) because I most often times already know it.

Not sure if the competitive nature of med school is getting to me. Or maybe I just have too much of an expectation of other people because I used to go out of my way to help others so much 🥺 

Wow, I sound like an emo 😂
I actually look normal and had friends I talked to at school 😂
(But all these thoughts were just hanging at the back of my mind and I knew I couldn’t expect anything of anyone)

I’d really appreciate anyone who can share anything relating to this :)
Thank you!",17Oct2020,1
5,"I can't remember the last time I cried like this and had this level of anger and frustration...and I have to admit, the reason is rather stupid. Even facing financial and other serious problems hasn't gotten to me that way recently.

I'm a very self-composed person that mostly reacts rationally and not emotionally, but not this time - and I don't know why since I know it's nothing important - I'm aware of this while still being furious and on the verge of tears.

So this is what happened (bear with me, I AM AWARE it's a mundane issue, I just want to get it off my chest)

I ordered custom curtains that were supposed to be delivered in person by the company and installed for me. I placed the order this way but they somehow got it wrong and sent it to me by mail instead.

What really annoyed me here was:

1. The E-Mail when I placed my order, which was sent directly to the consultant was literally just one sentence. ""I'd like to order this position with installation."" how the hell can you get it wrong?!

2, When I received the automated order-confirmation, I noticed they didn't count in the installation...I thought about inquiring, but I thought it's probably just an automated thing and will be counted in afterwards.

Also; I'm so TIRED of correcting other people, I thought I should try to not micro-manage this time and trust them that they get it right - after all, they make more money charging me for the installation too. Which proved to be a mistake...seriously, I'm TIRED of people making mistakes and having to fix it!

So I've waited for a few weeks for the curtains to be completed, and assumed I will get a call soon to organize a date for the guy to come in and bring + install them for me. Yesterday I suddenly got an e-mail notification from a delivery company - I was shocked and furious...I threw a tantrum and cried ( can't remember the last time I cried so hard).

I guess I regret not taking the chance and fixing the order when I noticed something was off - and it's also just the fact that I'm sick of not being able to trust peoples abilities to get things right.

So today I waited all day for the delivery. I work from home and I made it a point to not even leave shortly, I didn't shower, I didn't listen to music or put headphones on...nothing. The notification said the delivery would arrive between 9-10 AM, then they updated it at 11 AM to ""today"".

Around 7 PM I checked the tracking and I was shocked to see that it said ""unsuccessful delivery - couldn't reach recipient"" I ran downstairs and they actually left me a delivery note in my letterbox! So they were here but didn't ring! Not only didn't I hear anyone ring, I can see on my display when the last time was someone rand my door - and it wasn't today.

I just can't believe it! I was furious and close to tears again, I called the delivery company to complain...they admitted it's strange but the next day they can attempt another delivery will be on Monday.

This incident was just the tip of the iceberg for me! I cried again and while I know I'm being dramatic, I can't help it...I just can't comprehend how so many things can go wrong...and now my $1000 curtains are getting creases in a parcel while sitting in a warehouse until Monday.

This has completely ruined my day/weekend. It's my birthday this Sunday and I already know I won't be able to get this off my mind until Monday comes and if the delivery is successful, they ended up being pretty and not creased/ruined while being packaged, I will be able to hang them up alone with no problems and are happy with them.

I've now spend two days crying about this and I'm not completely sure why it's getting to me so much. It's the uncertainty that the delivery &amp; everything will go well on Monday that keeps frustrating me...all of this wouldn't have happened if the guy would have just placed my order correctly. I wouldn't have to deal with all of this if I had just inquired/corrected him about the order.

I guess the moral of the story is that I can't trust anyone with any work.",17Oct2020,1

10,"So on Wednesday night for psychology I decided to go ahead and read because I have a huge project for design and I finished my drawing project so why not get ahead of the game( I'm in Savannah college of Art and design), however, as I'm reading the subject stress is involved and the book basically says those who are prone to depression, have a hard time thinking positively, easy to become stressed out think with their right lobe, the book even said they are the cursed ones because after results of study negative things do tend to happen to them. And well my right lobe is fucked up because I had to have 2 surgeries on it to get rid of my seizures! 🤣 I just think it's funny because all of my life I told my mom that I was cursed.

2. Got called a bitchy like ape by a black boy mind you IM BLACK AND A FEMALE
3. Got seizures at the age of 14 out of nowhere 
4. On grad night at Disneyland my ""friends"" ditched me and 2 other girls while white male college students were trying to take us somewhere 
5. Finally got a bf who made me feel beautiful, then he strangled me
6. Had to work for a racist boss
7. Met a guy who told me he genuinely liked me then when he got frustrated told me all he wanted to do was ""smash and pass""
8. Graduated and got my associates degree for humanity arts
9. Got into an argument with my aunt whose only 3 yrs older than me on Xmas day mom agrees with her bc ""I didn't see her put her hand in your face""
10.had to skip summer school for scad bc of my 2 brain surgeries 
12. Had to move and still in the process of moving into our new house on base during school aka no fucking resources or tools for a gaddamn art school which means if I fail bc of this I lose my 10 grand scholarship 
13. Have to move back to cali

So yup there it is im cursed",17Oct2020,1
11,"Hello, I hope that this is the right subreddit to ask for specific assistance. I apologize as it might be a little long.

Well to start off, I am a 16 year old. When I was a little kid, I would always think and think about what ""life"" is, and what I was. I kept the thoughts to myself, as it would be hard to explain to others. I finally opened up about it to my older brother, and he was shocked that I was so ""self-aware"" as such a little kid.

As years went by, I continued to think. They were merely thoughts. Not very distracting, and only occurred a couple times a day. But as I continued to grow up and went through many depressive episodes, these thoughts began to take over my life. 

I started questioning more and more into what existence is, and what life is, and the power of our brains, and what I am. And this really started to fuck with my mental health and life in general. 

Now, these thoughts don't leave my brain. I physically cannot explain it in words. It's a feeling of being lied to and being in constant fear as I don't understand what everything is. When I am sitting in a chair and doing other things, the thoughts start to spike. I start questioning what it is that I am doing, sitting in a chair. I feel this sense of fear as I don't understand what I am, or where I am. I mean I know that I am sitting in my room, on Earth, but it's a feeling I cannot describe. Maybe it's more so where my atoms are, sitting in a ""physical"" world like this. 

I start ""fearing"", but not really ""fearing"". It's a feeling of confusion, but not quite. It's like a smudge in my eyesight and all I can do is stare at it. It's also spiking as I'm trying to type this all out, because my brain feels to be censoring some of my knowledge, words keep being blacked out and I keep forgetting what to type. It's censoring me from typing my feelings out because it's almost like it's trying to protect me from becoming completely ""self-aware"". 

It's just that I know for a fact that there is absolutely weird shit tied to being ""alive"" and I'm extremely lonely. There's almost like this language or thought barrier keeping me from explaining what I feel alone in my head to others. Some of my thoughts will always stay locked up in my brain and I can't escape them. 

I thought that the only way to really embrace this would be to learn about it philosophy more, and even spend the rest of my life dedicating myself to this subject. I've realized that I wont be content until I can find some answers to my questions (or at least try to). So I decided to take many classes related or self-learn classes where I can focus on this. My philosophy-like class teacher seems to understand. But we never talked about any of it. He just seems like the type to know what I am feeling, and it feels somewhat mutual. I don't exactly show interest in his class or the topic he teaches, yet he emails me or talks to me more than my classmates and recommends me many books. He is the one who signed me to take all these self-learn classes.

Here's the problem with all this, sure it might not sound bad, but it's really hurting me. I'm scared almost all the time. The only time I'm not scared is when I'm intrigued, and this occurs when I'm learning more about existence or I am around people who understand. My friends don't understand. No one seems to really understand what it feels like, and they aren't even interested when I tell them about my research. They live only in the physical world. Yet, as much as I wish for to only care about ""physical"" things, I feel that living in ignorance wouldn't be so great either. At this point, I don't care about physical things, like dating, gossip, or what ""normal"" 16 year olds should care about. I just can't give a shit. I can only think that all those things are not really ""real"", and more-so our brain's attempt at protecting us with drastically life-changing knowledge. 

I mean, it's only human nature that we're not supposed to understand. I just seem to be more self-aware of my existence compared to everyone around me, and even just the thought of that sucks. I have knowledge that other's would never know, because it seems that most of the world only cares about money, family, and being successful. It just sucks to know that I'm different and it's hard to find others like me who would actually care about me sharing my theories and thoughts. I bore people because I try to explain it to them. I also feel like an annoyance to others because they don't want to talk about ""deep"" things. 

Anyways, I'm not going to go much more into what I know and such. I'm honestly really surprised if anyone actually reads this entire post. 

Should I go into a career path related to philosophy if I can't accept working for society because it just feels too shallow for me? It's like, I respect those who work as doctors, teachers, office jobs, and whatever that helps society run, but it's just that I feel like society is ""shallow""? I can't think of the word again. It feels like the powdered sugar on top of a jelly donut. I want to bite into the jelly, and not lick the sugar for the rest of my life. It's just not enough for me to feel fulfillment I suppose. 

Also, I feel that I might have derealization. But it's also just crazy to me, those who know too much than the rest of the world knows is marked as having a mental disorder? I just don't think therapy or medication would make me happier, I don't really want to paint a mask on my brain and live like an average human with absolutely no philosophy questioning at all.

Since then, I've learned to become much less codependent, which has tremendously helped me with my mental health issues. I picked up my old hobbies/passions such as skateboarding, reading, and writing. Additionally, I've taught myself how to become more present by utilizing my time in more efficient ways. 

If you search for other experiences on reddit that can help you through your own situations, you can learn from that individual and perhaps not make the same mistake. So to anyone out there depressed and feeling like shit, stop writing and sulking in it.

35,"Basically, I met a woman like 13 years ago and got her pregnant the first time we had sex. Turned out she was an illegal alien, and a lesbian, at the time. I tried to make things work with her for our child, but her girlfriend put it into her head that I could and would take the child away from her, because of her status here, so she left for her home country right before birth. 

Two years later we started talking, and she asked me to marry her for a green card, and she would bring our daughter here. I did it, ofc. For the sake of that little girl. She showed up, she got pregnant again, stole all my money and took off again. 

Years pass. I know I have two daughters, but have no contact with them. Sometimes she would send me photos, but immediately block me again. Her whole family, who were nice to me at first, all blocked me early on, only god knows why. 

I become a full blown alcoholic during this time. I drank away the pain and suffering and loss night after night until one night a few months ago I had a heart arrythmia brought on by my program of self-punishment. I thought I was going to die. I quit drinking, cold turkey. Cleaned myself up. 

I find out that my ex had all but abandoned the children in her country with her family 3 years ago, and was using her now-citizenship to party it up in NYC.

And after 10 years, I finally find a way to contact them. I send a package of gifts and letters. I hide my phone number in the pages of a book.

The family couldn't lie to them any more about me. The gig was up. They called me, and I began a long distance video relationship with them (damn virus). All I do is buy them gifts, over and over. Things are great.

But, I guess, it is bittersweet. The thing I feared the most was being replaced by another man, that I would find them too late, that I never truly be their father. 

Then I noticed that they would disappear on the weekends. It was strange. No contact at all, no responses to text, just radio silence. And then they would be back on monday, my youngest calling me a million times a day, per usual.

Again, last weekend, radio silence. But they both updated their whatsapp statuses multiple times throughout the weekend.

One was a video of them, hand in hand with an unknown man, walking down the street, as happy as butterflies. More photos of this man, on his lap, he is tickling them, they are playing with him.

There he is. The man who replaced me. 

I walked around all weekend just devastated, like I was bleeding out from a chest wound. Part jealousy, part failure, part loss, full of rage from them taking away what was rightfully mine, another man having it. 

I cried for the first time in 10 years.

I had a panic attack, to boot.

I prayed multiple times for this awful feeling to go away, over and over, meditating, everything. Trying to talk myself out of it. Nothing worked. You can't talk a pit out of your belly. 

I came to realize the feelings I had weren't logical, no amount of thinking or praying were going to ward them away.

It was an emotional reaction. I was just going to have to eat shit, and try to enjoy it. 

Turns out he is a cousin's live-in boyfriend. This weekend, the photos are flying up again, no contact, here they come, one after another. Each one is a dagger. Everything I should be doing, they are doing with someone else.

They both changed their profile photos to him, just him, two hours ago.

You know, I used to think that men whose wives divorced them and remarried, and who moved away and started again were just dirtbags.

I have since reevaluated that assessment. Unless you are a father, seeing your own children treat another man with love you can't have is just personally devastating, and eats away at the very core of who you are. 

No amount of talking or psychology is going to cure the mixture of hatred, rage, loss and failure I see when these fucking photos keep being put where photos of me and them should be. 

I'm not saying that what those men do is right. I'm just saying that now I understand it. I get it.

Some men decide that it is better to start over than live sick with righteous anger and poisoned in your soul all of the time.

 I think, I was having these compulsions in 2007, and then, again, from 2011. One day, I stopped doing it. I do not remember how I convinced myself to stop doing it.

 I worry that I may have made a promise to Christian God about not acting compulsively with my food. I do not remember. Today, I left my toast in the kitchen and my brother said something angrily about it. And that generated the old fear. Before eating it, I checked to be sure that it is clean. My ocd was telling me not to do it because of an hypothetical promise to God but I could not ignore my other ocd which was saying to check it. 

 I worry that I may have made and broken a promise to God that I do not remember because maybe it was made 2-3 years ago. I am pissed off with myself from not being able to analyze the situation better.

The issue here is people feel guilty saying anything about them because they're 'liberal'. Indian person here.

Calling people red necks, the working class white trash, while themselves fucking angels. Acting like supporting a little shit like Hillary is so much better than supporting Trump, not due to any logic but their own elitism and privilege to support whoever they want without problems to their livelihood. Dehumanisng poor white people as dumb and that they cannot make decisions. Screaming at working class white people for not protesting while they're millenials living in their parents basement taking insta pics of lattes and pretty signs while protesting all day and not realising the majority of people don't have that freedom.Not letting Trump supporters speak though Hillary and Trump are pretty much equally corrupt shitheads. I always wonder why classist isn't used that much anymore as a 'righteous' indignation insult.

Disgust and disdain for Indian poverty, while praising the rich Saudis and Middle East despite corruption. The racism of realising they are cleaner and more well done up and that is why they should be given respect.

They get enraged if you question the justness of their coverage of other countries in the media (itself out of the 'nationalism' and American exceptionalism they accuse others of), thinking that only people with their superior knowledge and IQ can understand who needs to be bombed or threatened with bombs, that only they can intervene, and show them whos boss. They then try to look for Russians as huge conspirators to over throw their elections while not acknwoledging their country does the same. Once India is talked about, they show their true feelings, and talk about their own American superiority, but with Arab countries, they are quick to virtue signal and self deprecate.

They ban you from Reddit for talking about interventionist stances and how it has destroyed Libya.

They are fine with the idea of a conspiracy to suppress Muslims worldwide,despite most NGO's and the media giving them positive platforms. But if you give facts as to how our country India, is not as bad as it is portrayed, they call you a 'muslim hating nationalist' when you didn't even talk about them. The racism that comes to their mouth if you even say ' I hope our country improves' as an Indian. They go on with this disgust and horror 'how is that possible with your street shitting and Nazi government."" With the space thing, they were horrified, the racial slurs coming out of their mouth while virtue signalling on [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) about immigrants being rejected. They repeatedly call Indians low iq, stupid and incapable, slamming us for any achievements, and trying to show it was cheating. The way they intentionally make leaps of logic to pin Nazism on people they genuinely consider inferior in thought and morals, while pretending to be a human rights advocate, is fucking vile. Hindus were historically tortured and enslaved by Islamic invaders, and Muslims statistically still commit far more religious based crimes in India than Hindus, and get huge political benefits, but these progressives milik the hell out of India, and pin the blame on dark skin. The delhi riots for example started with several months of burning Hindu property and ripping the guts and eyes out ofa man, and killing another kid, but these shits blamed it on us. What these racists actually think is that the Muslims are like Arabs, while Hindus are dark skinned oppressive delusional patriarchy types. They think Hindus are the biggest rapists, despite India having statistically one of the least rape per capita, when including DEVELOPING and developed countries. But when they picture the Middle East they picture caucasian, clean people so they don't have the same picture in mind about rape. They have false concern for our country and 'the caste system' but don't even know what it is and treat the darkest skinned Indians the worst and blame EVERYTHING on the dark skinned Indians. The irony.

This affair has been on and off for a several years and I can’t seem to cut it off. To make matters worse I’m a sex addict who has been to years SAA meetings but I can never convince myself that I’m as bad off as the other people around me. At this point it is obvious that I am as addicted to sex as anyone on this planet and I keep using this sweet transgender girl as my booty call whenever I feel horny. I can’t seem to stop myself and this trans girl that I’m using as a fuck buddy wants more and deserves more. I feel like a complete piece of shit but I don’t know what to do. Telling my current girlfriend will completely destroy her and cutting all ties the trans girl will hurt her feelings too. Transgender individuals always seem to get the short end of the stick and I can’t help but feel that I am contributing to that stereotype.

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

58,"okay compulsory background information:
this boy and i are both from the same church, and he's someone whom ive known for quite a while now but never had feelings for (at least not up till now). 
i never considered him prior to this because he's always seemed so out of reach. he's smart, extremely well known for his looks, and also an overall very nice guy. he's extremely faithful in serving at church as well. so you get it, a total package and far too ""out of my league"", which is why i never bothered entertaining the thought of him.

what changed? well, over the entire covid period, our friend group of 8, grew closer. i got to know him better there and realized he's so real and down to earth, and i guess, ceteris paribus, i started developing feelings for him.


heres the complicated part:

1) ive received advice before, people telling me to just go for it! ask him out for coffee or something. that's just not possible. the way our friendship dynamic works, i can't even directly message him without it coming across as suspicious. I don't want people to know either bc he is from my church group after all and i dont want to make things awkward to the point i dont want to come for church gatherings. due to covid, irl meetings are also not very possible, but when i do see him, its always in a big group. he texts like a complete wall. his replies are so bad (in general) so even trying to develop a close one on one friendship is hard.

2) this other girl in my friend group likes him too and she told me. she doesn't know that i like him, and i was 100% willing to step away to let her like him, but im failing at doing so.

advice i need:

- what should i do about this boy? should i completely give up (especially since my friend likes him too), wait or try to actively do something? (also in church ive been told to not actively pursue a guy but indicate that im willing to be pursued, so im honestly feeling so stuck).

sorry if this story is a lil messy or if advice is hard to give, this is all i can offer right now bc my heart is a mess and i am extremely confused as well HAHA.",17Oct2020,1

I have a lot of social anxiety and I have a pretty fucked up self image. My girlfriend and I have another couple that we often go out on double dates with. One day one of them texted my girlfriend, asking when my birthday was because they wanted to mark it in the calendar. I was so shocked, in such disbelief that somebody cared when my birthday was.

Sometimes I act like a person who never had friends. Truth is, I lost them because they either turned out to be homophobic (I'm bi), they moved for college, they found a relationship that occupies them too much, or in the case of my longest childhood friend, turned out to be insanely toxic.

That being said, some of these friendships ended because of my own lack of effort. I either lost interest in them, I also became occupied with my own relationship, my coming out and person struggles.

I know it's normal to become distant with people in your 20s, you have an SO, college etc. But somehow, the part where a person ends old relationships and makes new ones, that didn't happen to me. I'm not blaming anyome but myself. I am anxious and I often don't know how to approach people. I have moments of exteme self confidence that switch with periods of all time lows. Because I feel like nobody can *truly* like me.

I don't understand the concept of friendships, but in any type of relationship, I dedicate myself to making people feel better when they need it. That's why I've always been there for others. I've been told that I'm the only one they can talk to, but then they wouldn't talk to me for weeks. I'd get an impression that they started disliking me, either because I did something, because I'm bi, because they feel that I'm going through a low and they have no intention on being there for me, etc.

I don't know why I'm like this, I have extreme trust issues when it comes to friends. I've been places in toxic and in one case dangerous, situations by more than one friend. I just don't know how to mend old relationships, sustain current ones or make new ones. It's all a big black hoke to me and I really wish it wasn't. I pushed away countless people who could've been good to me, all because I didn't understand what they wanted.

92," 3 years ago I had a pretty big crush on a guy in my class. I'm not sure why I had a crush on him, he was not particurarly attractive, he was not ugly at all, but not the kind of guy everyone has a crush on. (My friends thought he was kinda ugly, but I did not) And he was literally the quiet guy stereotype so he didn't have any friends in our class. He was the very first guy I had a real crush on and that crush lasted for almost the whole school year.

We talked a bit during the school year and we had the same interests so it was cool, but we didn't really become friends. Like we talked a bit by messages and at school, and we did a group project together but that was it, we've never seen each other outside of school and we don't talk anymore because we finished high school. I was also *very* socially awkward at the time and I guess he was too.

So I thought I was over him since it's been more than 2 years (I was 15 and I recently turned 18) but well, I don't know why but he still appears in my dreams from time to time (I actually dreamed of him this night so this is why I'm making this post today) And I (almost) always catch myself thinking about him when I think about being in a relationship, or just randomly thinking about him.

I had other real crushes after this guy but they were pretty short and not as strong as him.

So I don't know what to do and I'm completely lost. A part of me wants to contact him and see what will happen, and the other part thinks that he never gave a single fuck about me and wants to forget him for real and to move on.

So yeah idk what to do - If I contact him, how the fuck do I do that without making it the most awkward situation ever ??? Should I contact him ??? Honestly it's likely that he never had any single interest in me. And why do I still think about him, and how do I get over him for real ???

I'll gladly use some advices or recommendations because I'm a bit lost right now :(

94," I have decided I will start a comprehensive life regime for the only valid experience I have left:dreams. i dont mean ""dreams"" as in travelling the world,etc, but the brain state known as dreams.im keenly interested in lucid dreams too. Here is what my regime would look like in its peak  


A polyphasic regime. It would multiply the chances or the actual success ,of having different dreams within each 24 hours period  
Breath retention.It would make me requires LESS sleep(more on this below)  
sleeping sitting down on a chair. LESS sleep,too.also it tricks the ears center of balance into thinking you're awake:a good cheat for lucidity  
REM rebound:the 3 times i mentioned less sleep needed was all for this;science has proven less sleep equals more dreams.  


I would probably need 1-3 months to adapt,but,hey,what better thing do I have to do?  


bonus aids:  
melatonin pills, bananas,some form of fasting,sleeping with the windows open(its more healthy)",17Oct2020,1

104,"Because it's Nature not Nurture. 

Because I'm tired and didn't think out every syllable of my words, that means you can attack me. 

Because I don't understand things as easily as other people, that means you can yell at me. 

Because my brain is wired differently and I feel differently and I see things differently and nobody, likes things that are different. They hate it. They *loath* it. I learned that at an early age that having something wrong with my brain or having such a monumentally different upbringing sets me apart from others and how I would *love to* be like other people. How I dream of being normal and being someone you can be proud of and not living every day in such dramatic *pain* and anguish because I can't do the simple things that everyone else is born already knowing. I want to be like you so bad it's like a longing on the tongue but I'm not going to be like that ever. My limitations were set upon me at birth and I know them well. 

But you don't think about my life. You don't think about why I do the things I do. You simply see a glimpse of me that you take as an attack onto yourself. I said something wrong or I did something wrong and to you, I'm doing it to spite you. To make *your* life harder. You don't have it in you to think that there is a reason for someone else's actions that aren't some terrible wound to hurt you personally. You don't have the patience. 

You don't have the patience. 

And that's fine. You don't have to tell me how difficult and hard it is for you to be around and deal with someone like me. I'm me! You have it easy you can limit the time you have to see me or hear from me or even be reminded of me but I have to live with me. I have to see my face every day (which is why I turned all the mirrors.) I have to hear myself every day (which is why I speak so low.) I have to be reminded about myself every waking moment (which is why-) 

But it's okay. You don't have to go out of your way to be accommodating to someone. 

But please tell, at what point are you willing to decide who gets to be treated with human decency. Why, at the first sign of inconvenience to you, do you decide that you would much rather see the other thing burn to the ground and a fiery blaze that heats the light in your eyes, then to simply ignore it? To leave it alone? You don't have to kill all the birds the call just because you don't like waking up to their songs. You bare your fangs and eye the throat at anything and everything that so much vibrates at a different energy than you are used to. 

I thought the reason humanity got so far was because of their vivid interest in things that were different. Their need to explore the unknown? 

It's fine, it's fine. 

It's fine iT'S FINE It's fineit'sfine 

Because I know you can't do it. 

I know you aren't capable of compassion and this thing called human decency is just a made up spell from a far away fairy tale. I know, it is *your very nature* to be cruel and unyielding and just...awful. I know. 

I accept that about you. 

*And it hurts so much I wish I could just die so I didn't have to stay one more second in this cursed plane where myveryexictanceisunwantedandIknowI'mapainit'sjusthurtspleaseforoncewon'tsomeonebekind*

105,"I, 18, and my girlfriend, 19, have been together for a little over a year now. We've had so many fun times together so far and we've been living together for about 5 months at my Mom's, but everything has felt off as of recent. 
  For perspective, I work a part time job and my gf has as of recently been unemployed. I'm about to enlist in the Army and ship out in summer 2021. Me and her get into sour fights about 1-2 times a week (sometimes more). She is bipolar and depressed as diagnosed by a therapist. 

Here why I say there are problems:

About a week ago, she flipped her shit on me for almost no reason. It was something very petty we fought over, but she became very vicious and at one point physical (although she couldn't do much damage to me regardless). I couldn't bear fighting like this anymore since these kind of fights were starting to become frequent, and I told her I'm about done. I might as well have said I was done. But after her begging me to stay, I told her I'd give her a week to change and to not kiss ass either. Am I an ass for this?

 I love my girlfriend, i really do, but I check out other women, fantasize about being with them in the sexual manner and all. I've been feeling as if I just want to be single again, but I don't want to lose my relationship either, this being my first relationship. A part if me wants to be with this girl and another wants to screw around. I want a wild ride. I've always been a shy but prideful type, but as of recent I feel more social energy. I feel more likeable; desirable even. I don't want to chest either. I try to be a moral guy. So what im saying is that I'm stuck in the dark. Do i stay with my girlfriend who has rage attacks every so often but is lovable for a majority of the rest of the time, commiting my soul to this woman who i will barely see for 4 years due to the service, or should I ride out on my own, free from drama. I neither like nor dislike either choice. I just don't know. Can anyone help me? Can anyone point me in the right direction or give me some advice? I'm afraid i will regret my own decision if i don't think this through or get any help.",17Oct2020,1
