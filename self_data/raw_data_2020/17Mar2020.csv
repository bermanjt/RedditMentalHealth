The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt üëî and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Graham‚Äô I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

I have had a problem with restricting food from myself for a long time when things are rough. Today I was essentially thrown into a position at work that makes me uneasy. All I could eat throughout the day was yogurt. I finally (8pm) mustered up enough energy and/or determination to make food. That alone is big for me. I made (bastardized)!buttered chicken.

3,"Hey reddit. Fair warning, this is a rant. I'm also looking for some advice.

I'm a freshman at a college located three hours away from my home in central Texas. I got the call an hour ago that my school is shutting classes down for the rest of the semester. Y'all, this is the worst possible timing.

I was going to be promoted at my on-campus job after spring break ended. I was excelling in my classes and labs (which are now cancelled!) for the first time all semester. I was finally going to go to the beach with my friends, which was a big deal because I'm new to Texas and we don't have beaches where I'm from.

On top of that, I just really wanted to spend time with my boyfriend. We were supposed to hang out and enjoy the face that we've been dating for six months (as of last Thursday). I am deeply in love with him, and it's already been hard to be away from him this past week.

So now I have a decision to make. I either go back to working on campus for the rest of the semester and not see my boyfriend for several months, or I stay home and work a job that makes me miserable while being surrounded by my overbearing parents and three younger brothers. But, at least if I stay home I can maybe see my boyfriend once in a while (he lives an hour away from me).

I've been crying all afternoon because there is no good solution to all of this. I know either decision I make will lead to me being severely depressed, and it scares me that this stupid virus has ruined my life so quickly. 

Reddit, I could use some encouragement. If you also have advice for me on my situation that would be much appreciated. Help me out guys, please. This sucks so much.",17Mar2020,1

11,"For context I was just doing my job.

On Saturday, it was the craziest I have ever seen the store since christmas - but on steroids. At Christmas we are very busy but common sense and decency doesn't go out the window.

I was working on self serve, directing customers to our size self serve tills - my queue was busier than normal and I was keeping on top of the traffic. I had this one customer who went to one till and paid, he proceeded to call his friend over who was at the end of the queue and pushed in front of 15 people.

I calmly and kindly told these customers that they cannot push in regardless if you have a friend who is already there, it isn't fair on other customers who are waiting. They proceeded to have a go at me and shout, even pointing their fingers in their face and towering over me. Again, I told them it wasn't fair and this is not how we do things in the store, I was pushed by one of the customers and at this point I asked for assistance because I'm not there to be verbal and physically abused. 

My boyfriend and our other colleague who are team support came over to help and try to calm the situation down, this didn't and they were bother recieved verbal abused. These customers threatened to call the police on me because I was doing my job. Our manager finally came down but the situation did not calm down for another half an hour, they then threatened to report all of us to the police.

After an hour, they had finally left and we didn't hear anything else until today; my manager called me into the back office to give me a heads up of what had happened and that a complaint had been recieved by head office and I'm now being investigated. 

I am annoyed that this has actually happened and that I may lose my job over some senseless idiots, not only that but it has made me doubt myself that maybe I am not good enough for my job from actually just doing my job.

I really just needed to vent about this.",17Mar2020,1
13,"They're largely doing nothing. All they've done is implement more cleaning procedures, but added no extra labor to do them so they're either not getting done or we're all overworked and missing breaks. This is because just back around Christmas they cut our labor an EXTREME amount and we're still suffering (labor cuts and price increases suspiciously aligned chronologically with our CEO getting a massive bonus, but that's another conversation) . They keep giving us more responsibility with less labor, so we've been worked to the bone. They offered an extra ONE PERCENT labor per day to do all this extra cleaning but district management can say no and ours has. Our store management is even being commended for being under their labor allowance, even after that allowance has been decreased. Our allotted breaks are becoming few and far between. It's not uncommon anymore for us to work 8 hour shifts with no breaks, at least where I am. And this is all for about $9/hr.

They're saying even if you have symptoms you can only get up to 3 days off and that's subject to DM approval, and if symptoms clear up before 3 days you have to come back to work. Proof:

https://ibb.co/Y3f29G5 (yes i stripped the exif data of the photo)

The only way you can get a reasonable amount of time off work is if you literally have a confirmed case of COVID-19, have been in close contact with someone who does, or if you've traveled to China, Italy, Iran or South Korea. Then as it says you can get up to 14 days of catastrophe pay, again subject to approval probably by district management, possibly regional. Not sure which exactly. And of course it's incredibly difficult to actually get a concrete diagnosis and so health authorities are generally advising anyone who suspects themselves affected by the virus to self-isolate. (For definitely longer than &lt;=3 days) And why are Starbucks district managers given so much authority in making these health decisions? What qualifies them?

Also notice they say anyone of an especially vulnerable group such as the elderly, pregnant or immunocompromised should as a first option continue to work scheduled shifts. There are a few dozen cases in my area so far and that's only going to increase. Especially as businesses like Starbucks facilitate the spread of the virus. We've asked them to close the inside or at least limit transactions to electronic payments only but regional and district management have both so far refused.

I have a coworker who's spouse has an immune disorder and has been medically advised to stay home. They together have young kids, whose schools have been closed. This coworker asked Starbucks corporate to allow them time off to help take care of the kids and such but they denied that too. This coworker could take FMLA I think but wouldn't get paid for it. So this coworker is forced to stay away from home, go to work to support them financially, but can't see their spouse or kids for the time being.

I have another coworker who themselves is immunocompromised and is requesting even partially-paid time off, and Starbucks has stated this coworker needs recent medical documentation even though this is a permanent condition, and has said that this coworker must stay working until the request and paperwork are processed, I assume at the company's leisure.

Also, as schools and other businesses close yet Starbucks remains open, we've gotten significantly busier. Seems like an obvious profit-motivated decision to me: the competition closes and young people with disposable income get more free time, so stay fully-operational as long as possible to rake in the cash, of course at the expense of customers and moreover us employees who are forced to be in close quarters with hundreds of people all day every day.

So far it's taken gubernatorial action in states like Illinois and Ohio to force Starbucks to react appropriately. You may have seen that Starbucks may be removing indoor seating which is true, we were briefed today that this might be happening, but it isn't enough. The limitations they're potentially imposing still allow customers to come inside and order, they just wouldn't allow them to sit inside. This isn't a strong enough response, since it still puts us at risk of transmitting or receiving the disease. We'd absolutely still meet the 6-feet-10-minute threshold used as a rule of thumb by health authorities for transmission risk. This is especially true when, like I said, we've actually gotten more busy due to schools and other businesses closing. Last time I worked this increased business, increased responsibility and decreased labor meant we were more than busy enough that customers, even those who weren't staying, spent much longer than 10 minutes waiting for their food or drinks. I know it isn't set in stone and it's not that 9 minutes and 59 seconds is safe but 10 minutes on the dot brings a 100% chance of transmission, but Starbucks shouldn't be allowing and thereby encouraging gatherings of so many people for so long in close quarters. It's common for us to have more than 30 people inside at a time, for much longer than 10 minutes. Even without indoor seating this would probably happen.

Another factor is that corporate, regardless of if they remove indoor seating, is deferring the responsibility of explaining these changes to customers onto us -- the lowest paid people in the entire company. I guarantee some customers will be extremely upset about not being able to sit inside and will direct their anger at us, because that's how these people work. Whoever is closest to them and whoever they can yell at the loudest is who's at fault for the problem. Or what they perceive as a problem at least. Add that to the list of responsibilities we're faced with, with increased business and slashed labor, and you see the problem.

Starbucks is wringing every last cent out of the public, every ounce of sanity out of its workers, and risking everyone's safety all the while. Please, even if you're not overcome with a sense of moral abhorrence like I am over this whole situation, don't give Starbucks your money right now. They aren't taking proper safety precautions and I don't believe Starbucks cafes are a safe place to be right now. Protect yourself, your family, friends, and everyone. Starbucks doesn't value your safety or that of your loved ones and care only about profit. (Keep in mind this is the same company that has continued slave-labor scandals, but again I digress.) They are working their employees to the bone, forcing them to literally risk their lives in some cases and the lives of others, all for a not-even-liveable wage.

Make your coffee or tea at home right now. You'll save yourself a fortune in both dollars and calories, and might even have fun. Hell, I'm a hobbyist coffee snob and have been before I even worked here, message me if you want some tips. It's not as intimidating as it seems. I think it's fun.

17,"Hello,
I hope this is the right sub, but I‚Äôm at a loss. I‚Äôm obviously uncomfortable with our current state. I know I‚Äôm at the prime age (25) that if I get sick I will recover, however I already had the flu for the first time this year and I NEVER want to experience that or something worse again. Not to mention the chaos in my community and the news has really sent me into an anxiety driven depression. 

Here‚Äôs my problem. I just moved to a new state due to my husbands job. I am currently in the job market. I am supposed to have a job interview tomorrow and the manager and site lead want to meet at a public meeting place because they don‚Äôt have the time to get all the security stuff done for me to go in and interview. I‚Äôm hesitant on this job to begin with, but I figure, I‚Äôm unemployed so I really don‚Äôt have any room to speak. 

They will no do a virtual or phone interview which a lot of companies I‚Äôve interviewed with have been more than happy to oblige (and actually have suggested they prefer virtual interviews with how things are right now). They also will not reschedule with me at a better time that it is safer to meet in large meeting spaces. I‚Äôve been stressed most the day at the thought of being in a heavily populated meeting space for this interview. I don‚Äôt want to risk getting sick, or them for that matter. Also, if I do get sick there is a potential that my husband will have to stay at his work while I‚Äôll ride out the illness due to the nature of his work.

20,"This isn‚Äôt directly related to Corona, but with all the misinformation and fear-mongering going around (as with most big news) I got to thinking about this again. I say ‚Äúagain‚Äù because Ive had this thought percolating in the back of my head for a while now, and I finally wanted to put it out there.

Anyway, here goes. You know how we learn things? Humans are really good at it, we‚Äôre a really smart species because we have extensive forms of communication, written and vocal, that allows us to pass information far and wide over generations of peple. Pretty cool right? Well, the thing is...  how much of what we know is wrong?

Nowadays we have the internet, and anybody decent enough with technology *knows* that the internet is, as a whole, not entirely reliable. If you want to find the right information, you have to know where to look, how to find reliable sources, how to spot false information (malignant or not), and even then you might be wrong. And that‚Äôs if you want unbiased information. Everyone is a little biased, but how many people know that, and how many people who know that try to recrify it? Not many, I dont think. Its just a thought. So, what about our educational institutuons? 

In the developed world, we have access to universities that lead the way in science, technology, literature, etc. (some might argue that colleges are biased politically, yet i digress). However, not *everybody* is wealthy enough to afford the rising costs in education, even in the ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù world (I can speak for the US at least), and these people are left behind in the many underfunded and underdeveloped schools around the nation/world. Believe me, there are those who will persevere, but overall we are breeding ignorance to some level in all of our schools.

Even if you are fortunate to recieve a good education, there are fundamental principles we accept now that many decades down the line will be considered... ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. That‚Äôs just how science is, and thats okay. So its okay to be ‚Äúwrong‚Äù sometimes, but how much of our brain‚Äôs retrievable information is wrong?

Then we stumble onto another issue: is there objective right and wrong? Is objectivity acheivable, or are we doomed to the singularity, that everyday human knowledge will grow but will never reach ‚Äú100%‚Äù? I dont know, and I dont know if anyone will ever find that out. 

I dont really have any answers, and I dont expect to find any, but I wanted to write down my thoughts so that even if nobody else cares, I‚Äôll have it out of my head. But if you are reading this: take care amd have a nice life!

2. Buy foods and pack them into containers. (Ofcourse with rice, we filipinos love rice hehe)
3. Buy personnal protective suits.

4. Giving mask, medicine, foods for the poor using extra supplies. (No bit of donation will go wasted for personal expense, all of them will be given to the poor and our FPs.)

I am a common teenager of 14 years, the difference is that since I was born I have many malformations and genetic mutations, to start with since I was born I have a higher iq than the others and did not show to be left-handed or right-handed. I was able to use both  hands to color and write ... yeah I already was able to write and read, walk and run when i was only 6 months old. at 5 years old I showed good reflexes and physical condition, I practiced 15 sports, soccer, basketball, cycling, boxing, Kungfu,  Karate, swimming, skating and athletics, etc. at 7 they detected hyperactivity and attention deficit so they started to medicate me and study me, because it was supposedly a very rare case with different mutations in a single patient, I know that This surely sounds like the plot of a comic or science fiction movie but it is a very rare real case where a failure or change not necessarily bad triggers many others as the subject grows due to hormones and things like that.

so they took me to a center for genetic studies, it seemed like something out of the xmen movie with a huge park in front of it and many kids my age the only difference to the movie is that there are no crazy people shooting or coll powerfull teachers ...  hehe ... but anyway the point is that my parents wanted me to have a normal childhood so they decided that I would not stay, but they would accept support from the center (in fact if I remember correctly it was called cedat or BNGMI and another one that I don't remember) They prescribed multiple Farmacos for the iperactivity and deficit because of a that that did not allow them to classify me as of superior intellect but that if they ‚Äúsuppressed is immaturity‚Äù it would be a great discovery ... (if it sounds like the line that a villain would say in a  movie, so I was afraid of doctors, to make matters worse my parents are doctors)

the problem is that these drugs gave me night terrors but that was not the worst part, at 11 years old I developed hyperecinophilia (an atypical dermatitis that is practically a hypersensitive skin to the sun, cold etc. But it gets worst with stress) and reflexes like smell and hyper developed ear which sounds great  but it's horrible I can't enter the hospital or zoo without detecting every scent, or be in the sun or cold without feeling my body crumble, while involuntary reflexes and instincts caused me fear and anxiety to almost everything. I managed to control most of them, but then when i got 13 years old, my life turned into hell, the secondary hormonal reflexes and instincts were amplified by my anomaly. I cant being in a place with sweeting people because the smell just anoyme and i cant talk about girls or something indirectly relatef with sex without summonig the black mamba, i always sweet in nigth, but also it makes me inmune to alcohol, some toxines and bacterias, ok the 2 last ones are great but i cant get drunk!!!! Or use somniferes to help me to sleep. That why i need to control my body with meditation, and mental exercices soooooo... thats all bye",17Mar2020,1

I really can't wrap my head around this account. People calling in like some kind of Entitled Whackjob asking for a fulll refund because they dont have disposable utensils or they dont have the free bread and butter. I know some here will argue about but hear me out. I know that some customers use reddit as well and might have posted that Doordash sucks or whatever.

I was still not very worried about it until today, I saw a friend's Instagram story showing some racks of a store empty.

On one side I want to buy a few things just in case they run out, especially toilet paper since people are crazy about it for some reason?

But then I don't want to contribute to the panic buying.

But then what if when I need them there's nothing left because of people panic buying.

43,"I'm a history major so I read old journals and diaries constantly, and I have a ton of my ancestors' and relatives' journals and diaries.  I've been reading my great great grand-uncle's civil war diary and letters, and my great grandfather's diaries from 1919.  Both of them were at times of great change, and I see that happening now.  And maybe the biggest changes are yet to come in 2021 or later, but the near war with Iran, the wildfires in Australia, the virus, the election, they're all gonna be talked about years from now!  I want to have my own record of these events, changes, and experiences, and I want it all to be an honest reflection of my perspective.

2020 has been a mess so far, but diaries kept during trying times are extremely important to the future generations understanding of our time.",17Mar2020,1
44,"I've been staring at my ceiling for the past few hours. Isolation is nothing new to me, but this is different. I miss my friends. Friends I wasn't aware that Id miss. 

That's not true. I don't miss my friends. I miss a friend (Who we'll call A). I haven't even been away from them for long, the quarantine started today. But A didn't go to school today. I didn't get to say goodbye to them for perhaps the last time in weeks, maybe months. I kept glancing at their desk today in all my classes, hoping that they would somehow be there, smiling at me like they've been there the entire time. I stared at the door in hopes that they'd just walk through, laughing about how they are always late. But that never happened. At least we didn't leave on bad terms with one another. But I would have preferred I could say goodbye, maybe tell them not to forget about me. Make them laugh for the last time before leaving. Perhaps share another one of our many seemingly intimate moments. 

The ceiling, from earlier. It's a popcorn ceiling, meaning its made out of this cheap, dry, sometimes flaky material that has a very awkward pattering. Its texture's like popcorn, hence the name. I've been looking at my ceiling for a while. Even now, as I type this, I take breaks just to glance at it. Due to its texture, and how the light from the lightbulb hits it, it casts very odd shadows. These shadows seem to divide the ceiling up. I've been staring at the different sections. The sections look so tightly grouped. However, on further analysis, the shadows, in caparison, are massive borders that separate the neighbors. Entire relative miles between each section. It is not only the borders between the sections, no. The popcorns inside the sections are further apart than they first seem. They aren't the same size, and some have fallen off, leaving large, mountain among hills. Those mountains are so far apart from another. From a distance, they seem so close, but they are, just like the shadows, relative miles away. Is this me? I feel close to so many of my friends, but what if that's because I'm looking at the wrong perspective? What if I analyze it and I'm, emotionally, miles away from my friends? My group started this year strong, and It only got stronger over time. Friends came and went, but the group stayed loyal to be through thick and thin. But so many small things started appearing between us. Hills among our mountains. They seem so far away now. All of them but one. One has grown so much closer because of the death of my group.

I think it was worth it. Maybe that's why it died? A few days before I was willing to accept its death, two of my closes friends started to act distant. They (We'll call T and E) claimed that I was treating one of the members unfairly. I thought I did something wrong. I thought I hurt someone somehow, so I immediately apologized, asking what sin was committed. 

Lust. That was their hour-long answer summarized in a single word. They claimed I flirted with one of the members too much. That they did the same to me. They claimed the two of us were driving everyone apart. I was hurt. They used to encourage us. They would laugh when they saw us holding hands. They would tell us to get a room. They would tell us to quit staring at each other while stifling a grin. A and I thought we were having harmless fun, but the group seemed to take such a one-eighty. Why do they choose now to care? I saw their Snapchat stories later that day.

""Imagine flirting with another guy while having a boyfriend."" 

""I'm single, but I would go around messing with other guys if I had a bf.""

It clicked for me. I remember trying to talk to them, reason things out. As far as I was concerned, A and I was just having harmless fun. Something to do while passing the time. They called me naive. They said I was denying my feelings, that I was leading A on or being lead on, or just being stupid. I remember being angry. 

Anger is a weird emotion. I haven't felt anger in years. I felt my chest get tight, my face burn, my heart race. My stomach was in a ball. I remember making decisions I would normally never make. I killed the group that day. My anger pushed them away. I don't regret it. Im happier now. Me. I'm happy. Is A happy? She seems to be. She smiles more. Laughs more. She followed me when I left the group. She stayed by my side when I told them to I'd much rather be alone. I gave A several opportunities to go back to the group, but she just squeezed my hand tighter, moved closer, and told me to shut up.

I still don't understand the group. E and T were fine one day. Like I have said already, they encouraged us every time they saw us ""flirting."" Why the sudden change in character? Some narcissistic portion of me says they are jealous, perhaps they wish they were in A's position. A portion of me, a portion I'm not sure the size of, thinks they must like me. They didn't care before, but now they do?

But I've been neglecting a part of the story. A has a boyfriend. And one that isn't me. Someone she spends very little time talking up to, and so much time complaining about. She'll tell me how much of a jerk he is, all while holding my hand and tucking herself under my arm. Am I a jerk? I've met the guy, and he doesn't deserve to be dating A. But that's a weird statement. How do you deserve someone? Maybe everyone in this situation sucks. Maybe I'm being used to fuel some part of the relationship A isn't getting from her boyfriend. I don't know. I know she has used me as a payback before on multiple occasions. I have seen and heard, in person and from her, that she'll bring me up in an argument with her boyfriend. Every time she gets mad at him, she'll use me as a threat. ""If I was with [OP]..."" ""[OP] wouldn't..."" ""I'd be happy with [OP].."" ""I laugh with [OP]..."" ""I hold [OP]'s hand..."" And much more that I don't think would be best brought up. 

This entire situation is confusing me. What if I'm the bad guy? What if I'm not the good guy for helping someone out of a relationship they aren't happy in? I often think of how I'd feel if I was in her boyfriend's shoes. I would normally ask, ""Would I think this is okay?"" Why don't I ask this to myself? Because I already know the answer. I have talked myself into telling A I don't want to hold her hand, that I don't want to stare into her eyes and talk about anything and everything. But then she holds my hand before I can say something, tells me anything and everything, and then I start staring into her eyes again. I've stopped trying to talk myself out of it, I realized a long time ago that It was useless.

This entire situation is confusing me. I admit it. If dated several girls. I've had heartthrobs. I've felt butterflies. I've spent months with a person and haven't felt this way before. Somethings different about this time. 

This entire situation is confusing me. Do you know one of them, if not the oldest, works of surviving literature? Gilgamesh. Do you know one of the most prevalent themes in that story? Love. The love between family, brothers, friends. And love that's closer than that. Romance. Love love. Love with a capital and bold L. I don't know. History and literature, books since books were scrolls, scrolls since scrolls were tablets, tablets since tablets were paintings on a wall, have always talked about love. I thought I'd be prepared for anything by now. I've read hundreds of novels where the main character had fallen in love. It is always described in such detail, that I thought I practically could feel it. They were wrong. The novels lied. The movies lied. It is so much more than they ever prepared me for.

They told me about the long nights I would spend thinking about them. They didn't tell me I would say their name just to hear it. They didn't tell me that I'd look over every memory I had with them, living in the details. They didn't tell me that my new favorite color was their eyes. They didn't tell me that Id becomes fascinated by all the little things they did. They told me how nervous I would be around them. They didn't tell me that I would be lightheaded. They didn't tell me how I would find myself looking at them without even realizing t. They didn't tell me just how good it felt to see them after the weekend. Heck, how good it felt to see them after a period or two without them. How good it felt to hold their hand while walking down the hall or sitting next to them or waiting for the bell or anything. They didn't tell me that I would replay their laugh in my head hundreds of times. They didn't tell me how boring my life would be without them. They didn't tell me how I would find myself reminded of them from the smallest of details. They never prepared me for falling in love with their personality so much that I get bored talking to other people. This is all too confusing.

Confusing. Confused. I am.. confused. I hate the word confused. To be confused is to be perplexed. To not have the whole picture, or not understand a curtail detail. The Latin origin of the word is cofundere. It meant to mingle/together. Then, in middle English (Old French, and two types of English) it means to bring to ruin. The word confused is, well, confusing. Man. I really, really, really need to stop staring at my ceiling.",17Mar2020,1

Without emotion, without the full spectrum of experience, their is no reason to try. Your dog getting diagnosed with dementia is just as wonderful as winning the lottery. There is nothing to motivate you and nothing worth fighting for, not because the end results are inherently worthless, but because you lack the physical ability to appreciate the outcome.

57,"So what is the deal?

Well I been trying to become partner and affiliate for both YouTube for quite some time.

I have no job, I have tried to find work, I been at it, for over 4 years now without work.

Now with what is going on, this is a entirely new kind of like wtf moment... lol

But you might be like ok, Kiosu Batsu so what is the whole charity thing?

Well it‚Äôs hard to explain, it is really technically a giveaway and charity of anyone‚Äôs choosing, but only after I am affiliate or partnered but whatever man?... lol

This is a indefinite thing, for life!

This isn‚Äôt some concept I pulled out my ass because of the crisis either, I been trying to earn to give away money to people in need to save money on games and food since I started streaming again in 2016...

But I don‚Äôt know if it is because people think I am Asian, stereotyping, or that I am scammer, no idea?

But pretty sure I, 100% am not lying!

50% of all my income will go to views and charities of whoever wins that month. Or their own pockets?

As time progresses if I become popular or am paid well enough that is or get sponsors.

I will do giveaways each week eventually and if it does better than that it will be once to 10x a day because I am only one damn person... lol

And when I say, 50% I mean technically 41% as I have to pay taxes still... lol...

So why am doing this?

Because I feel like it.

I have wanted to do before this crisis and virus outbreak thing happened...

I do not see any better way to help either...

I get to eventually make X and then give back to the community watching and helping me to grow into a better, well, everything.

I have literally been at this for quite sometime...

Check out my YouTube channel to see what I mean, there is over 500 plus videos of me either not talking and just playing, to talking to myself or trying to gather folks, it has just never happened.

Now you might like, why now?

Well my family is having a hard time...

Before it was just me, I was just dealing period I have issues caring about myself and I do not like asking for help, period.

So I was just dealing with not asking for help period and hopefully that just maybe people would gather on their own of their own volition in hopes to earn from the giveaways and prizes I created eventually.

It will be ranging from straight cash, gift cards, consoles and games but all depending on how well I am doing.

As I entirely didn‚Äôt want Or needed a ton of money, so if my 41% is to high to myself I might be forking over extra cash to my communities 41% of my own volition, if or when I see it is to high.

As if I am just making minimum wage is better than then nothing I have earned in past 2 years.

But hopefully you all can see I just wanna help and have wanted to just do this prior to coronavirus.

As my heart and love, goes out to the people losing their jobs and the people dealing with this virus personally.

As my hometown is completely on lockdown, no schools, barely anything is open and I have to drive (which I don‚Äôt btw) about 25 miles out of town just to find work.

But please help if you can promote and tell your friends and family.

Also know this is a indefinite thing, I am not stopping even after there is a cure or if everyone magically became rich, I would still be doing this giveaway and charity towards the people who want to give their share to whatever charity of their choosing.

As any small amount helps.

But I am on Twitter, Twitch, YouTube and Tinder!

That last one was a joke obviously, sorry, my sense of humor is weird, saw a bunch of T‚Äôs and was like wtf, why not?... xD

And I have a discord but it isn‚Äôt done yet lol I am procrastinating, I am intimidated by it, I think.. ok man..? Lol

[Kiosu Batsu‚Äôs Discord](https://discord.gg/SvMA8cs)

But I repeat, not a scammer and this is a indefinite for life thing, been trying to do since 2014 while I was a dental assistant and lost first account to whatever hacker...

Then It took me 2 years to get my butt back into uploading and streaming again, but giveaways and contest I create will hopefully go on maybe, even after I die, ‚Äúif‚Äù, hopefully I will replace Santa Clauses because he isn‚Äôt helping anyone by remaining a myth, I am just man...

But technically I would be Santa Clause for adults? 

Granted I am fairly boring and a tamed individual with unfortunately a ton of self control. Lol

As all my content has a M rating on just in case I start cussing at video games or the content itself maybe mature and I am not going to filter myself because someone doesn‚Äôt like cussing or their kids are being censored from cussing, sorry even if it is rareish... :/ lol

So I ask, Reddit, redditers? Is that even a word? Lol

Can you please help me grow and others by proxy, by me giving away my money to random folks in need after I am affiliate or partner or whatever?

Sorry that this post is long or if I didn‚Äôt post in right place? This is literally second day ever on reddit, please excuse me.",17Mar2020,1

I had a girlfriend that was AWFUL. She constantly put me down and made me feel guilty for things beyond my control. I was afraid of her. Whenever I tried to breakup with her she‚Äôd do this thing to make me so afraid and guilty and I‚Äôd chicken out. The sex was good and we had some good times in our relationship, so I just put up with it, but I knew one day I‚Äôd have to leave her.
I even DID leave her once and she somehow got me to get back with her.
Now, here comes my big wrong-doing. I have always been attracted to men, at least to a certain degree, but I am NOT 100% gay by any means. I really enjoy sex with a woman. 
One day while we were out at lunch, some urge took over my brain and I just blurted out that I was gay and I was leaving her. My subconscious must have seen at as an easy way out without her being able to make me feel like a bad person for wanting to leave her. That‚Äôs how much she had me scared of her!
But I didn‚Äôt just tell her. I told my best friends, I told my co-workers, I told my family. Without any consideration or reflection I just came out as gay without any regard for what I actually wanted from life.
I almost immediately began dating a guy. It was fun. The sex was odd at first, but I got used to it. He and I broke up. I‚Äôve spent the last two years single and just hooking up with men anytime I want some kind of affection. I usually feel guilty and ashamed afterwards.
I realized recently that I want a woman. I may be physically attracted to men, but I know I‚Äôm my heart it‚Äôs a woman I want. I believe myself to be bisexual, but I‚Äôm afraid to acknowledge it.

There were SO MANY amazing, beautiful and kind women in my life that told me they were interested in me while I was dating my not so kind ex, but once they found out I was gay they moved on.

I wish I could just go back and be honest with myself from the beginning. I never should‚Äôve rushed into anything.
I feel trapped. I know what I am and what I want, but everyone in my life believes me to be 100% homosexual, when I am in fact bi-sexual with a little bit of preference for women.
I‚Äôm so scared that people in my life will think I‚Äôm phony for making such a bold declaration and then saying ‚ÄúOh, never mind.‚Äù I‚Äôm so lonely. And all of this is because I was too afraid to stand up to an awful girlfriend. (She‚Äôs engaged by the way) while I have been alone for 2 years.

We haven‚Äôt been getting many calls lately because people aren‚Äôt going out, so I‚Äôve started to do it during work and not just on my break like I usually do. 

Today the coworker beside me glanced over and caught some of what I was writing. 

She said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so selfish that while people are out there dying and losing everything that you‚Äôve got an entire book focused on how great you are. Show a little compassion. We‚Äôre supposed to be upset.‚Äù

68,"Recently life has been weird. Yes it‚Äôs corona time and all that shit but that isn‚Äôt what I mean. I mean the man, the house, and the ceiling fan. 
    I‚Äôll start with the house. All throughout my child hood I remember a house. It was white and it was in the woods behind my yard. It‚Äôs weird though because the house looked different in different memories. I remember the girl who lived in the house and her family. In that state the house looked brand new and perfect. I‚Äôm other memories the house was dirty on the outside and definitely going down hill but they still lived there. Finally I remember the house in ruins. The white was all started with brown and black and oddly enough there were red bricks smushed in the ground around it. However the house didn‚Äôt exist. It isn‚Äôt there now and no one remembers it. Weird but okay. A few days ago at 2am I was walking though my living room and literally jumped in fear because the house was back behind my backyard again and I could see the lights shining though. The next morning through now it‚Äôs gone again with no evidence of its existence.
    Okay I was tired, things are fine. Next we have the man. I just got back from NYC where I got to ride the subway! It was okay. However 2 days ago I was on the subway and I looked out and through the door windows between the 2 subway cars I saw a man. He was black and he looked dirty. The thing was the subway was moving and must have been going through the tunnel at 60+ MPH. He stared at one end of the window and quickly his head dropped down. It looked as if he had stepped down in the middle but that‚Äôs not possible. I mean no one can ride there they would fall off the only going down is onto the tracks where he would of been run over. No one saw him but me and there is no proof he existed. 
       Tonight we have the ceiling fan. I couldn‚Äôt sleep so I sat on the couch in the living room. I looked up and my fan was slowly shaking? Almost a weird wavy sway. I just kept looking and it began to sway so much I was scared to get up in fear it would fall on me. I have no proof and there is no reason it should of swayed like that. 
      This has been happening all my life. My earliest memory is of when I was 3 and there was a Bob Cat in my yard just sitting and looking at me why I sat on my deck and drank milk. I was so scared I ran inside and cried. Looking back it‚Äôs unlikely that Bob Cat existed. I‚Äôve seen faces in walls and by the time I was 7 I swore I saw faces in my mirror. I see shadows of nothing running and I randomly panic. It‚Äôs all just my imagination but it feels so real. 
    Over the past week I‚Äôve been dizzy and light headed. Colors appear places they shouldn‚Äôt be in weird hazes, I feel paranoid, and I generally have no way of explaining it. I know I‚Äôm just imaging things but why do I keep getting so dizzy, I‚Äôve had random severe and sharp pains I can‚Äôt explain, why am I seeing things that aren‚Äôt possible? I haven‚Äôt changed any meds, I have not changed anything. I am scared.",17Mar2020,1

today, i was supposed to go back to my dorm (i‚Äôm 22) and pick up my school books as well as quarantine with my boyfriend- since he lives close to my university. 
my parents were aware of this and then my dad stormed into my room later on saying they hid my car keys and he would cancel my car insurance if i tried to leave. they have been nice enough to let me build up money financially, but at this point i can afford my car insurance. i told him ‚Äúok, let me pay for it then,‚Äù to which he told me no and i couldn‚Äôt afford it. 
my dad has been going out to bars, going for runs in our downtown area, going to public pools, shopping, etc and I couldn‚Äôt even go for a walk around the block if i wanted to.

72,"
I've been annoyed continuously for a long time now (seriously long term) and today I got really close to crossing a personal line that I've drawn for myself, which would be physical violence. 
I got really. fucking. close. 

But, being well practiced from dealing with the day to day irritation, I managed to walk away, and fumed in the shower while acting out all sorts of vengeful scenarios in my head. 
Nothing stopping me from making those a reality either, I'm just recognizing that, though subtle, I am currently in red mist mode. And I waited it out, while promising myself that I would say this and that, which I never end up doing. 

Important to note here that my personality is overall on the relaxed side, and I don't get myself agitated easily, so it's probably easier for me to ""walk away"" from conflict because I'm just naturally more inclined to avoid/delay confrontation and I've had success with waiting it out. Other people may have less success with this ""grit your teeth n let it pass"" method of dealing with emotional outburst. There's also the added deterrent for me of previous failure/becoming extra upset when I DO attempt to ""talk it out"" with this guy. Just a brief acknowledgement here.

Back to my moment: I'm out of the shower, still seething, but by the time I'm ready for bed the intensity has died enough that I'm just gonna let it go (as usual). Well that and write it out kind of anonymously on Reddit. Bc I know I can vent out here without hurting anyone. It works out short term. 
(Long term solution would be to work out a compromised for this relationship that makes me so mad, but I don't think the effort is worth it at this moment, and they're most likely gonna be ""better"" in a year or two. (this assumption I make with precedent, btw, so it's only partly wishful thinking)

Now why do I say all this? Because I've had to go out of my way to comfort and accommodate this agitator when THEY'RE in the red mist, but when I'M in the red mist I can still take measures to make myself harmless while my chaotic rage urges go buck wild. 
They don't accommodate me at all. 
So the part of me thats still raging is hiding this is so not fucking fair, and what they do to me they deserve back. (not a good life policy tho, too simple)

I've wrestled with the idea that ""you can't control yourself when you're mad"" but I already know that you're still RESPONSIBLE for what happens during anger, and I've determined that you aren't excused for ""snapping"" when your mad. You haven't completely lost control of ALL rational thinking, seeing as you're still able to argue some sort of point, and it ISN'T really an extra step to just about face and take yourself somewhere to cool down. 

It's a me problem if I pursue you while you attempt to let us both cool down (although do say that that's what you're tryna do), but honestly I'm so irritated I can't come up with a clear point right now. Unless I want to go batshit and just start spewing accusations. But that's another line I won't cross because it's hard fort me to make up nonsense, I'm kinda easy to beat in arguments like that.

I'm kinda tired now but thanks Reddit very nice.

Also very last rage remark: you're a toxic asshole!!! 

tldr: you're not excused for acting up while in red mist rage bc you should be expected to make an effort to de-escalate/remove yourself.",17Mar2020,1

my toxic friends dropped me 3 days ago and I still don‚Äôt know how to feel

I‚Äôve never done this before and I‚Äôm still trying to get around reddit but hi :D I don‚Äôt wanna reveal my identity just in case they find this but I got dropped by my best friends a few days ago and I‚Äôm feeling plenty of emotions right now and I need a place to kind of rant/let things out 

so here‚Äôs a lil backstory:

it‚Äôs my 1st year of high school and things are obviously bound to change. I got past my 1st semester which was absolutely horrific and I‚Äôm in the middle of my 2nd and things have been going great.. well kind of. My core friend group consists of 7 people including me and we‚Äôre all extremely close. I‚Äôve known 5 out of the 7 people since elementary but we got close/closer this year. Everyday we all eat lunch together and it‚Äôs usually a fun time!

1~ they criticize my lunches

My dad packs me my lunches everyday and always wakes up super early to make them for me (he used to be a chef and food means a lot to him/he‚Äôs lowkey a perfectionist when it comes to cooking). My dad always gets super excited to make my lunches knowing that my friends love and appreciate his food too and they don‚Äôt bring lunches for themselves so I share my food with them, but lately, they‚Äôve been real dicks about his food. I‚Äôd bring a lunch, MY lunch as per usual and they‚Äôd try it, and spit it out in front of me, saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúgross‚Äù or ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù when it tastes fine or saying he can ‚Äúdo better‚Äù with his food. Of course I understand that sometimes his food isn‚Äôt the greatest but I‚Äôm nice enough to offer them my lunch even on days when I‚Äôm really hungry and don‚Äôt want to share it and they just start criticizing it? I don‚Äôt know.

2~ they judge the things I like/am into

I‚Äôm really into this celebrity, so much that I‚Äôm a part of their fandom and being a part of it makes me really happy. I‚Äôve made lots of online friends that I talk to on the daily and the fandom is super sweet. My friends don‚Äôt like that. I do talk about the celebrity sometimes but I don‚Äôt shove my interests their throats or anything like that. I‚Äôll be talking about the celebrity and they‚Äôll start calling them names, making fun of the tv show they‚Äôre in which I also like, and making fun of the friends I made in the fandom. Not too long ago, I actually got the opportunity to talk to the celebrity on a video call and I was so excited!! I got ready for 2+ hours (which when I look back at it is dumb asf but don‚Äôt judge I was excitedüòÇ) and when the time came to talk to them I couldn‚Äôt be happier. A few hours later I was hanging with my friend/leader of the group (let‚Äôs call her P) and she wanted to see the call so I showed it to her even though I really didn‚Äôt want to. She promised she wouldn‚Äôt make fun of me for it so I said fine and she watched it in another room. I should‚Äôve expected her to not keep up with her promises. Afterwards she laughed at me and honestly ruined the whole experience for me, pointing out how ‚Äúawkward‚Äù it all was and saying the celebrity looked ‚Äúlike a pedo‚Äù and I felt like pure shit afterwards. The next day I found out she secretly recorded the video off my phone on her phone and showed it to the rest of our friend group and they made fun of me for it too. After that I refused to talk about the celebrity in front of him, even when they bring them up themselves and make fun of him some more to make me upset.

3~ ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù

It was the last week of spring break and I just wanted to finish up all my work before the break and go home and relax. the week was going fine but me and P and her bf (also part of the group, let‚Äôs call him W) decided we wanted to get high on Wednesday because why not? long story short we took WAY too much and i threw up in 3 places and had to be walked home (not my proudest moment i must say) and didn‚Äôt remember a thing the next day. 
I thanked W for helping me out that day even if I couldn‚Äôt remember shit and I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt mind putting up with me and taking care of me, but after that day things started to get..weird? P and W started acting different around me and blamed it on Wednesday, going as far as to say they could ‚Äúnever look at me the same again‚Äù and P called me ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù, saying I ‚Äúruined their day‚Äù and I just felt so ashamed of myself, even though I still don‚Äôt even know what exactly I did since I can‚Äôt remember anything. at this point I started to get super fed up with everyone in the group treating me like shit and on top of that, my allergies were acting up BAD so I just felt like shit physically AND emotionally and didn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone. On our group‚Äôs group chat on insta, we were talking. W asked me if I washed his hoodie because he gave it to me on Wednesday since I was cold and throwing up and thought there was vomit on it. Since P wanted it back right away, I didn‚Äôt have time to wash it and I told him that. He said it was fine and that he was gonna wash it and I said ‚Äúyou do that‚Äù. To add to my already mood, P had to respond and say ‚Äúignore her, it‚Äôs probably that time of the month again‚Äù. And at that point I don‚Äôt know what came over me but I left the group chat and subtweeted P on my Instagram story, which didn‚Äôt end well for me. to put an already long story short, I told my internet friends what‚Äôs been going on and they dmed P and W for me and now I‚Äôm out of the group!! According to them I was never really a ‚Äúreal‚Äù part of the group despite how much I did for them all and basically i wasted 7 months of my time being treated like literal human garbage.

now that I‚Äôm out, I don‚Äôt know how school‚Äôs gonna look for me two weeks from now when I‚Äôm off my break. Any advice on what I can do to get through the year without breaking down in a bathroom stall? 

TL;DR - my friends didn‚Äôt appreciate the food I brought for lunch, couldn‚Äôt let me be on what/who I liked/what I was into, and continued to make me feel ashamed for acting out under the influence after I took one too many

83," its more of a question honestly.

i really hate it, but i did get into this type of mindset a while ago..

natural selection

people who are genetically inferior get eliminated, when superior ones get selected, they mate and produce healthier offspring

hypothetically, if someone gets depressed, anxious, or if even ends up lonely, it doesn't happen for no reason.

it means that you're weak, and its supposed to be like that.

people don't get bullied for no reason. at school for instance, it happens cuz your ugly, again, genetically inferior, you must be excluded or if you're weird, like weird stuff, that also is an indication that there's something wrong with you, no matter how romanticized it gets in today's media. bullying is a human way of natural selection.

you're destined to be something, a lower tier, or a higher tier. if you're lower, you will have no other choice, but to live a miserable life, but if you're higher you get everything.

it sucks that you can't really work your way up there. well to some degree you can, but you will always end up below someone, there's always gon be someone standing on you, feeding off of you, cuz again, they're born superior.

i really wish i was wrong, i really do.

and it sucks.

some people are born to die literally, i mean, even if you are at the bottom, you are still doing something tho, but not for yourself. you are born to be used, you are born to suffer, see, there's no top without the bottom. lions cant live without eating their preys. no preys. no lions.

its also possible that you might be a god tier, not compatible with the environment, but you will still end up alone, maybe even depressed. tho if someone's really superior, even in that situation, they won't kill themselves, and will ascend, make the environment fit them.

again, im sure that everything in this world will become more humane with time. and maybe it wont be this harsh, but it always will be there.",17Mar2020,1

Not for lack of willpower or any character flaw. It's just a huge amount of stress and fear. But when people can envision a better future, they become inspired. They find ways of getting through. They band together in finding solutions. So, I would like to hear about what you will do once this difficult time has passed. How will you better your lives? What things will you appreciate more?

It's to the point where when I tell anyone who doesn't live with me his behaviour, they look at me like I'm crazy. So basically since I was 12 he has been groping me, coughing on me purposely, shoves me or touches me in an annoying way, always starting unnecessary drama with me. He will tell me things that he knows will get me angry, he will lie on me, and put me in a situation to where I look like a jerk. Example when we were younger, he broke a vase and lied and said I did it, parents believed him since he is older and I was grounded for a week. Just stuff like that. Mind you he is 23 and has not grown out of this phase. He still lies but not as much but he does all of the other physical things that I mentioned. So since he turned 19 a few years back he left for college, he comes back home only on holidays. Now that school closed, he is back. So basically there is a routine he does, when he comes back from school he puts on an act for me that he matured for like 3days, then after 3 days he goes back to harassing me. So I will distance my self from him and then, he lies and turns things around ask me why I am ignoring him as if everything he does to me has not happened like 10minutes ago. He will then complain to my parents why I ignore him. Kind of like gaslighting or it is gaslighting. My parents don't really see the whole of what he does, as I said he knows when to start usually when no one is looking, and he is older so when I retaliate I look like a crazy. So my parents think I'm an a**hole. I can't talk to anyone about this because no one knows of what he does to me or the extent of it. My mom and sister are just aware of his nasty tendencies but dont see the full harrassment going on. All of my family friends thinks he is the "" normal"" guy (act) he puts up. I decided I will lock myself in my room for the whole semester since he is home and most schools are is closed for the semester. How do I deal with this, I've complained forever to my parents but I don't know if since I'm the youngest I dont have a voice, or I dont know what could it be?",17Mar2020,1

I didn't have real answers as to why she left me or what did I do wrong. I've cried a lot but for the past two week I've been feeling betyer. Anyway this is the past but today she messaged me and gave me all the answers when I asked for them, we got to talk a bit and tell each other our goodbye(perhaps she will message me again to play games tho so who knows if it was the real goodbye) Talking to her today I felt troubled at first but by the end I felt very good, I realized that yes I did move on, I still miss her but no feelings. I am very happy about this. She told me she believes I'll find someone better and so I said the same thing to her. If she ever messages me to play games I'd be happy of course but I am fine if she doesn't. I thought I'd never move on but talking to her today I know I did move on.

93,"Tl;dr, I‚Äôm an asshole but I think I was mostly justified.

Like many others, I needed to pick up some last minute essentials after work yesterday. My plan was to be in and out and avoid as much social contact as possible. I chose to go to the Trader Joe‚Äôs nearby. Everything went well until I arrived at the register. 

There was one customer in front of me with only a small amount of items. Both the customer and the cashier were women in their ~60s. They were chatting while the cashier leisurely bagged the groceries. I started to feel a slight twinge of irritation at how little urgency the cashier was using but I tried to remain calm. 

She would stop bagging and just chat. I was the only other customer in line and all I could think about was the fact that we were basically in a Petri dish and this woman didn‚Äôt have a care in the world. She is by far one of the most vulnerable people right now and was blissfully unaware and she didn‚Äôt even know that her behavior was putting herself and others at greater risk. 

And then I noticed her gloves. They were cloth winter gloves. That was her safety precaution for the customers. My mind was blown. I was furious that this was her, and her Trader Joe‚Äôs manager‚Äôs, idea of a safety measure. But I tried to keep my cool and stay kind. She probably truly believed that they were helpful. 

Then after what felt like a ludicrous delay she gets to me and my groceries. She is taking her time and bagging my stuff when she starts debating out loud where to put my bag of spinach. She keeps passing it back and forth in her hands and says ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt know which bag this should go in; I don‚Äôt want to crinkle it.‚Äù 

I almost snapped. But very tensely I said ‚Äúma‚Äôam please, I don‚Äôt care where you put the spinach. I‚Äôd just like to pay and get out of here. You‚Äôve already taken too long and I‚Äôm shocked at how little care you and the store has shown for our wellbeing. Please, just let me pay and leave.‚Äù 

I feel guilty for being so short tempered. I know I looked like the typical asshole attorney in a suit being a dick to a cashier or service worker. I know she‚Äôs working hard and her job is important right now and she‚Äôs also even more at risk of losing her job than myself and many others. Not to mention her health risk from being around so many people at her age. 

But I spent the day in meetings that were complete doom and gloom; The market crashed and I all day I was receiving updates ‚Äúxyz stock down 10-12%‚Äù; My new secretary was sobbing all day because as an hourly worker she will be out of work if the office closes; and despite most people having less work, I am about to be given a substantial amount more responsibility during this time to make sure my work continues to function. 

I vented to my mother and she bitched me out and said ‚Äúnot everyone is intelligent enough to be a big lawyer like you. You need to show compassion.‚Äù  I know she‚Äôs right, but It‚Äôs just so frustrating that I am expected to handle a massive amount of responsibility right now while still remaining compassionate but someone apparently less intelligent than me gets to put everyone at greater risk with no recourse or consequences. 

I know the following sentiment is elitist and even more asshole, but this crisis just highlights how ignorant, uneducated, and unintelligent the workforce we depend upon is and it horrifies me even more than that cashier‚Äôs behavior infuriated me. I just needed to let this out. Judge me as you see fit.",17Mar2020,1

95,"Don't get me wrong: the response humanity is having to this pandemic is the right one. We're all making personal sacrifices, and we're likely going to trigger a global economic recession, but we understand that the alternative is an even *worse* outcome as a result of 2% of the global population outright dying.

Why can't we make a similar sacrifice to halt the acceleration of climate change?

And hell, the sacrifice we'd have to make toward that wouldn't be nearly as life-altering. Consider the Green New Deal: largely a collection of public works projects funded through tax increases. Obviously this would mean a near-term slowing of economic growth, but if we can intentionally bring about a global recession in response to this pandemic, I don't see why we can't make a sacrifice to mitigate the effects of climate change.

It just pisses me off. We're clearly capable of action. We're taking action *right now*, and it's the right move.

The consequences of climate change will be far worse, but we're so oblivious to the long-term.

I'm just ranting. I'm glad for our willingness to make the sacrifices we're currently making, but it lampshades the fact that we're collectively unwilling to respond to an even *worse* threat.",17Mar2020,1

103,"I‚Äôve been living in my head thinking about what went wrong with this woman I‚Äôve fallen for. It's not exactly a break-up but we've gone out a few times!

We first met back in mid-2018, connected briefly, then went back to our respective countries which are on opposite sides of the world. We stayed in touch and met once again at the end of the year when I travelled to her country.

During the second half of 2019, we got in touch again and started text almost every day and have occasional scheduled calls. While we still lived far away, I felt there was a connection between us and the conversations have always been‚Ä¶ natural, raw and personal. As we grew closer, I picked up the courage to do things that I hoped would show how I felt, such as sending her a gift on her birthday, which she seemed to love. I‚Äôve been honest about how I thought she was special and amazing - although I never said ‚ÄúI like you‚Äù.

Then, we met again in Christmas 2019 when I travelled to her place again. At this point, I started to really like her but was unsure of what would happen with the distance - and the fact that there‚Äôs no chance of us moving closer to each other in the next 2 years at least. We went out a few times and had the best time. I did what I thought would show how I felt - flowers, gifts with handwritten notes, picked up the tabs and planned the dates to her liking. By this point, it was clear that both of us really enjoyed each other‚Äôs company. She has always been receptive of my advances and said she had lovely time with me, asked me to visit often.

I was still hesitant to tell her outright I liked her, as I was still hoping there would come a day in which we‚Äôll live in the same city together, and I‚Äôd stand a better chance then. Throughout our interaction, I've felt she's not the type who could do a long-distance. I was trying to make an arrangement in which I would live closer to her for a few months mid-year and wanted to use the momentum to tell her then.

Anyway, after returning home, we still texted. I did a couple more things to keep keep the ‚Äúsparks‚Äù, e.g. sending flowers to her office, which she said she liked!¬†

However, several weeks in, things turned different. After she came back from a trip to visit her parents, her schedules had turned busy with work and other commitments, and she started responding less. I didn‚Äôt have any reason to believe that she didn‚Äôt want to speak with me - everything was going well just before that. I didn‚Äôt hear back for a couple of weeks, couldn‚Äôt call her. Finally managed to hear back. She said she‚Äôd been hectic so wasn‚Äôt able to text anymore. I was surprised so decided to tell her outright how I felt. She then said she just wanted to be friends and saw me as a friend/brother figure and that she doesn't want me to waste my effort/time. I was surprised because she never referred to me as a ""friend"".

I've been replaying this to figure out if there was anything I could have done to save the situation. Or is trying to build a relationship someone you barely know long-distance a lost cause from the beginning?

I must be in Limbo or something, I feel like I am going to loose my mind, like something will slip. 

And as the fabric of our society slowly erupts at the seams like an over filled water balloon of piss, and people start to stab each other at Coscos with wine bottles over toilet paper, It becomes increasingly evident that we are all equally just as fragile in terms of sanity. Just like the wine bottle lodged in someone's chest. Fragile.

My life has been one big fucking broken record and what scares me more than absolutely anything is that this dull, wretched day will be exactly like the last. I will wake up and go to work and eat and sleep and fuck and shit like every single other day and be no more fulfilled than the last because I am some sort of self fulfilling prophecy of procrastination.

Today we received an email by the residence telling us that all other common areas outside of the kitchen and showers were closed, and that we had to stay at a 2 meter distance of each other. Hearing this, my Mom told me I should probably go to my sister's apartment before the situation gets worse. 
So I called my Dad, to ask him if I could. He refused, saying I'd likely contaminate my sister by using public transports. And now I have to tell my Mom he refused. Which she will of course freak out about. Which will then turn into drama. And then I'll have my Mom on my back, my Dad, and inevitably my siblings telling me I shouldn't have listened to my mother in the first place. 

I'm 18. I already have OCD, anxiety and depression. This pandemic is literally a living nightmare for me. My family doesn't really understand that, as they'll say it's hard for everyone and I have to do my share to flatten the curve. I agree.

I say we use the coronavirus event to improve our society. Forget fiat money, and let's nationalize the housing system. The rich people go broke overnight, for some sense of Justice. Why not?

The governments could enforce and issue a new currency that I call ""points"", everyone receives 100 per month, no matter what they do, because we can trust that people will contribute out of their own volition.

It's true, economy might slow down if there are no more lures of riches, but it's for the best. Who in their right mind want this crazy capitalism to go on?

People will contribute at the rate that is needed, and not over-produce for the sake of feeding their children. What world are we building? We can change it, if we just dare to believe.

Internet is changing everything, we are highly organized, and highly synchronous. We can build a new order. We are ready to change. There will be a new dawn, after this most troubling night.

I dare to believe.

The older I get, and the more I can see that truly, we are all equal. We judge superficially, while everyone has profound, hidden depths.

While we see evil, like hoarding people, we can also see that people are protecting their family. This capitalism is monstrous. It is time to end it.

Believe in your peers!

Everyone gets 100 points and a free house, but we control that people are not hoarding. Indeed it seems wild, but for the sake of fraternity we can dream a world which welcomes its children appropriately.

If it can't be done, then think, and I'm sure we'll find a way. It's the perfect time for disruption, like seeds crackling the soil. A new Eden is growing, if you just dare to believe.

127,"I will start by saying my girlfriend and i have an incredible relationship, we are so deeply in love with each other and plan on getting married. We have been together for years, live together, and run a business together. 

Since the New Year began, things have been HECTIC to say the least. My parents health is failing so a lot of my time has been dedicated to caring for them and keeping my family afloat. I own an italian restaurant and in December my girlfriend quit her job to manage and run the restaurant with me and we are opening another restaurant in the fall which is also taking all of our time and energy. We work 12+ hours a day and when we‚Äôre not working, we‚Äôre struggling to get things done like housework, laundry, feeding ourselves, making room to get enough sleep, etc etc. Now with all this crazy stuff going on our business is heading into a very scary direction (we live in America and are fucking terrified of the future of our country/income/all the employees under us). We are still open for dine-in and to-go but don‚Äôt think we will last until the end of the week. At the end of January an unexpected tornado destroyed our apartment and all of our belongings which we are still recouping from mentally and financially. 

To keep it simple, life has been violently busy lately. With everything going on, sex has been at the very bottom of our list. We are just exhausted. Neither of us have carved out the time to care for each other in that way. It‚Äôs not like we don‚Äôt want to have sex with each other, it‚Äôs just been impossible to make a priority. 

Either way, i‚Äôve still been wanting her in that way *so* bad. I‚Äôve missed her so much that I hadn‚Äôt even realized how much it‚Äôs affected me. Last night we were up late with all our anxieties about work and family and smoked a bowl in bed to try to relax. She starting dozing off snuggled into me and i couldn‚Äôt help but pull her closer and closer into me. Before i knew it, we were having sex. She was more beautiful than i ever could‚Äôve imagined. She felt *so fucking good* against me. She came for me quicker than she ever has and it immediately reassured me that yes she still loves me, YES she still wants me like that and needs me like that. I can‚Äôt get over how incredible and intimate it was being with her after such a long time... like it was my first time touching her ever. I needed that experience SO bad. A huge weight i didn‚Äôt even know i was carrying felt like it was lifted off of me when were done. 

Anyway, a small silver-lining in the Shit Storm we‚Äôre all experiencing right now. I love my girlfriend so much and i‚Äôm so so so thankful for the strong bond we have. 

If you‚Äôre going through hell in this wild mess of a world right now and you have a girl or if you have a man, hold them a little closer and give them all your love because at the end of the day it‚Äôs the most valuable thing there is. Thank GOD for love. And THANK GOD for sex.",17Mar2020,1

Guys I failed my LCSW test twice! Ok so the first time made sense to me to be honest. I didn‚Äôt prepare, and I actually ran out of time. I expected failed to come across the screen.

I was getting through them fairly easy with a tricky one here and there. I will say that once again I was down to the last min.

130,"The new US economic volatility is boggling my mind. Some context - I'm in my 30s and came from a lower income background and now make $100k+

In one group chat childhood friends shared how their wife was already laid off, a bartender is worried about making their mortgage payment and another is afraid of being let go because of having to stay home and watch the kids because of no school.

In another group chat, with people I've met through my programming career, the discussion is around finance  -- dip buying opportunities and how they've lost thousands already, but are seeing the opportunity to max out retirement savings now. Many of these kids are wealthy in the sense of &gt;$500k net worth.

Here's something maybe unexpected alongside it - the poorer friends are predominantly more politically conservative, while the wealthier friends are more politically liberal.

The gap is causing me to lose perspective. I have about $24k in the bank which is enough for 5 months with a tight belt... But I had always assumed consistent cash flow. That may not be the case any longer. I told my wealthier friends that that's all I had available and they raised my anxiety... while I'm scared to even open up to the childhood friends because they may be dumbfounded that I didn't think that was enough.

I guess my point is - the wealth gap in the world is personally giving me this funky dysphoria. I don't have a financial advisor. I also don't want one, as I have no desire to pay for one.",17Mar2020,1

It's not really a game; you can read notes that other real human beings write about the things that worry them, and you can send encouraging notes back to them.

The game has a subreddit at r/kindwords. I have no connection with any of it other than that it helps me feel better about things.

I joined a sorority, but didn‚Äôt really get into the already established friendship groups. They were nice to me, but I was an outsider to their main groups. This year I made one good new friend! She is became a close friend and I haven‚Äôt felt that in a while. I also worked on building new friendships despite not being super close and my roommate next year I feel like will become a close friend.

But I sit here alone in my room with everyone leaving college feeling worthless. It doesn‚Äôt make sense because I worked so hard for progress, but was it progress or a distraction? I have friends that are all away from me, and even though I have a boyfriend I feel that the relationship will end soon since I don‚Äôt think we are compatible for long term. So I have 3 weeks in isolation, seeing my boyfriend twice a week maybe but no friends. I can‚Äôt even see my therapist anymore.

So current goals:

Text friends more, especially the ones I was building friendships with

Ask that one girl I kinda know that lives in the college town to hang out

146,"Hey guys just need to vent a little today about some stuff on my mind.

So just a couple days ago I got diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder. I don't necessarily want to talk as much about the disorder itself but just my thoughts and worries.

So I'm in college and having a very rough time socially. I don't have any friends, I've never been in a relationship, and I'm basically just all alone. I go to like four different clubs at least once a week, but I never really make any connections.

I force myself into these situations, but I must give off some aura that makes people think I want to be left alone or something. Which is the opposite of what I want. I want friends, I want to know what it's like to have a girlfriend. But it just doesn't seem like it's going to happen. It's like I'm trying to shape a cool hunk of metal into a sword by hitting it with a rock.

Anyways I'm reading through what this disorder means, and it all does sound like me. And I look at these people talking about it and some of them are much much older than me, and are still alone. Still no friends, still never been in a relationship, nothing.

The thing is, I can force myself into social situations all day long, but every time I do it doesn't feel like I'm progressing at all. And the toll it takes is a lot. 

It's not like I just feel embarrassed. I feel genuinely ashamed of myself every time I go out there and can't find someone to interact with. Not to mention it's super exhausting.

About 8 months ago I asked a girl out for the first time ever. It was this girl I worked with before that I had a big crush on. We went on a couple of dates and then she ghosted me. And man I still think about it to this day. Like what did I do wrong? If I had said something different, would things have changed? It feels like I RUINED my one chance at being happy.

I'm just so afraid that maybe my fate is sealed already. What if no matter how hard I try, I never change anything? I want to know what its like to, damn, even hold hands with a girl. I think I'd have some kind of emotional meltdown if there was a girl that wanted to hold hands with me.

I guess it's the not knowing that's the worst part. If I knew that as long as I kept trying, everything would turn out okay in a few years or so, I could do it. But what if this is all for nothing? Why am I even here? You know what I mean?",17Mar2020,1

151,"Look let's just clarify something among all this 'stockpile shaming'.

There  are two types of behaviors where people buy more than usual. The first,  obvious type is very clearly irrational, fear-based and ultimately  detrimental to others: the buy lifetime supply of toilet paper because  your intuitive math ability is clouded by fear or you want to exploit  the situation and resell.

The  second is imminently rational, sensible and arguably commendable. That  is buying more than you normally do. We all eat every day, and we all  had different shopping habits in 'the old normal'. Maybe you eat out  three times a week, maybe you shop once every two days. Whatever. The  combinations are varied and infinite. Yours aren't 'right' or the normal way to shop, just know that for a fact.

Now  this coronavirus epidemic floods the zeitgeist. Not only do we see  empty shelves and hear surreal tales of lockdown in places like Italy,  but we are actively advised to:

1. minimise leaving home
2. minimise public exposure (going out to do chores)
3. minimise contact with others (going to the supermarket)
4. minimise touching things others touch (card machines, trolleys)

Further, we are advised to self-isolate for a minimum of two weeks if we develop symptoms.

Ok,  so given all the above, if your 'normal' shopping routine involves  numerous trips to the store and eating out, and if your fridge and  cupboard normally hold supplies for a couple days max, do you think it  is stupid and selfish, or whatever other derogatory term you'd like to  use, to buy more than normal? To get at least a few days' supply. It is  not stupid. It is in fact stupid not too.

And  if you get a cough. Is *that* when you want to go to the supermarket and  buy two weeks supply? Will there be enough? How many people will you  endanger on that outing?

So then,  forget case one as a compounding factor. Everyone suddenly buys double  what they normally do because it is sensible. They are not trying to  fuck over their neighbor, they are preparing to survive and change their  habits. What happens to the shelves? This little force we like to call  'supply and demand' dictates that supermarkets have achieved near  homeostasis where they only stock a little more supply than the demand  their models have forecast they need, from the past x decades.

It's  really not fucking rocket surgery and frankly the shaming is becoming  tedious as it demonstrates herd mentality, this odious need to blame  everyone else, to direct our frustration in a hurtful, self-righteous  way, at others. *Your* actions manifest in the present state of being as much as anyone else's.

The fact of  coronavirus and everything we have learned about it instructs us, not  only at the reactive animal fear level, to be prepared. We will need  more food to change our habits in these ways. This is sensible.

So  by all means hate on the people who take it too far -- and there are  many. But they are not the only factor in this equation. This crisis  requires our patience, understanding, and more than anything our  commitment to analyzing our reflex reactions, the reasons why we are  champing at the bit to grab our pitchforks and unleash on everyone else.

I can't motivate myself. I can't care about a lot of things I used to care. I feel empty. I don't know what to do anymore. 

Taking a break from everything doesn't work. Trying to work because motivation comes once you start doing things doesn't work.

As I'm sure you all know, several major companies (Apple, Nike, Bath &amp; Body Works, Hot Topic) have announced their retail locations to be closed at least through the end of the month. Their employees are receiving full pay and are able to stay at home, greatly decreasing their exposure to the virus and unarguably stopping the spread to the public. As more businesses and corporations join in supporting their workers and protecting the public, your Starbucks baristas have been left with dismissal and inconsideration.

In the¬†announcement made by Starbucks¬†last week, Rossann Williams stated that partners have ""full support"" during this time, and that workers will not have to choose between making money or taking care of themselves. Unfortunately, this means absolutely nothing and acts as a pretty face to the public. While the corporate offices are closed as people are instructed to stay at home and limit exposure, baristas are still being called to work at their retail locations and instructed to handle cash and process drinks at high volume. Yes, safety measures have been taken to reduce the risk (now we sanitize everything and wash our hands every 30 minutes) but partners have started to call in after feeling sick and have simply been told to find coverage.

In high-risk areas, a few stores have temporarily closed and baristas are only being told they can use their accrued sick time or pick up shifts at another location. We are not receiving ""catastrophe pay"" unless we test positive ourselves, and we are going in to work every day knowing that the measures that corporate has given us is nowhere near sufficient.

Hop on over to¬†r/starbucks¬†and read stories from partners the past few days. You should know that your baristas ARE having to choose between feeling sick/being close to someone sick and working!

Well, I just wanted to say I've lost 50lbs. Although I'm not where I'd like to be, I thank everyone on here who were so very nice about all of it. I'm really happy at how far I've come and I'm so excited to see where I end up!!",17Mar2020,1
172,"so, COVID 19 is clearly the huge talk around the world currently, and everyone is feeling the effects and damage from it. it's awful, disheartening, and terrifying. 

I work at a well-known retail store that sells everything for a dollar (you know the one.) People have been coming in to our store constantly. This past Saturday, we exceeded $6000 in sales, the highest in our store since the Saturday before Christmas, which was about $7000. Over a virus for, at the time, wasn't threatening to my area. We usually only do about &gt;$1500 on Saturdays. 

So, clearly, we are getting a LOT of foot traffic. Getting cussed out for no hand sanitizer and toilet paper, people buying in bulk because the company won't set an item limit. We don't even have toilet paper for our own restrooms. And I have a digestive disorder, so that's pretty not cool for me. 

On Sunday, me and a coworker were talking about wearing face masks, because we both have pretty shitty immune systems, and I also just had surgery, which makes my immune system more vulnerable. Corporate is telling us we are not allowed to wear face masks, only gloves, because ""it would make our customers panic."" 

I come into contact with at least 100 or so people a day, we have a very busy store. I stand within 2 feet of the customers, as I usually cashier. This virus travels through micro-droplets, some people don't even show symptoms, literally just saying a word that starts with the letter ""P"" could cause their spit to come into contact with me. (I know, because I constantly have people spitting at me when they talk already.) I feel like for my own personal welfare, I shouldn't be working with the public with out a protective barrier.

So, here's the question. Do I just show the fuck up with a face mask and tell em either I'm wearing it or they can send me home? What can I even do in this situation? 

My last day is on this Saturday, and I love the people I work with and don't want to cause more stress for them. But, at the same time, this is fucking bullshit. We've started getting cases close to us, as we live in a well populated area, so this is really unnerving for me. I already have diagnosed anxiety, so this definitely isn't helping my mental state either. 

I mean, fuck. Should I just tell my manager I'm not coming in? Should I just say fuck it and show up with a face mask on? What do I even do in this situation??? Please help.",17Mar2020,1

176,"So first off I haven't really told anyone this story and I really need to get this off my chest and I picked this subreddit because it seems like the right one.

NOTE: V=Me // Friend=F // mom=m // dad=d
So this starts in the Winter of 2018, around April or so.
I am currently 15 writing this, this takes place when I was 13. My mom and I make plans with F to go see Post Malone live in Mansfield, MA. We are very excited and count the days to the day we go. Backstory, my mom since I was a little kid has always been a little out there and has gotten worse over the years. She is currently prescribed to take certain meds to help keep her somewhat normal. At the concert she decided that it would be a good idea to have wine and weed, on top of the meds that she was taking (which strictly prohibited alcohol and drug use during the time she was on them). by the time the concert is over, its around 10:30PM and we have a 3-4 hour drive back home. by the time the concert was over, I was pretty sure she had around 5-6 glasses of wine. They weren't big but they were decent sized plastic cups. (picture half of a red solo cup.) On top of the weed she smoked. She was there but was a little out of it. We were driving home and a old lady in a crown vic moved lanes on the highway without looking and she thought that she was trying to run us off the road. She panics and instructs me to write down license plates that she reads off to me. We are in a 2017 Nissan Frontier Pro-4x which was quick but it was still a truck. We were reaching speeds of over 130mph on highways. Granted that there wasn't many people out around 2:30 in the morning, it was still WAY too quick to be traveling with kids in the car. I felt unsafe and i told her to slow down. She told me she would slow down if I wanted to die. At this point she thinks someone is out to kill her and such and such. We finally arrive back in town and go straight to the police dept. It is now around 4-5 in the morning. She tells them her *VERY SLURRED* version of the story. The cops now come over to my friend and I and take our statements. (which line up very closely). They deem her unfit to drive and it was clear she was still high from the weed and wine so they called an ambulance and it took her to the nearby hospital. They called my dad and told him to come pick us up from the police station. We finally got home and he said that my friend had to go home because of all of this. (the plan was for him to stay the weekend). We drove him back to his house and went back to my house after. For the next few days after this everything SEEMED normal. Out of nowhere she got convinced that my dad sent a killer after her and was stalking her. (sidenote: my dad is the nicest, most honest, best man you will ever meet.) She threw me in the car and we drove 5 hours to our neighbors 2nd house in upstate New York. We stayed there for weeks and I was very unhappy. I didn't see my dad for weeks and my mom kept feeding my head with lies about him. We returned back to the house about a month later and to this day she acts like everything is normal and nothing ever happened. My dad and I both believe that there is definitely something wrong with her, but she denies it.",17Mar2020,2

179,"I didn't think too hard about the coronavirus thing until the military base I work at shut down and now we're just sitting at home. I checked my stocks and my net worth is going to shit. I just lost 9 years worth of investments (retirement, stocks, etcetera), literally 30k down from where I was a month ago. Yet I am unphased, like I do not give a shit right now.

I find the whole coronavirus thing oddly liberating from the daily anxieties, and the thought of the world going into chaos doesn't scare me. Intellectually I can see the depth and gravity of the situation that others must feel, especially if they have kids and elderly parents to look after. (this is probably also why others are joking and talking about how everyone else is ""overreacting"" because if it's real then it's too real)

I am in my mid 20's. I get by, I am objectively doing alright. I hate my desk job which I can't get out of because military (and I lost the job I came in with), but overall I made a decent life for myself. These days I have been working out like never before and taking on loads of online classes in hopes that I will finish my bachelor's in time to become an officer (of another military branch). I have some casual friends I talk to, but nothing deep and nobody I talk to daily anymore. I was rejected by my family. I drifted away from a lot of friends due to different lifestyle choices, moving a lot, changing name, joining the military, and converting to a religion a lot of people think is ""a bit much"". I still think about my ex every day after a year though I don't plan on getting back together. Sometimes in the middle of the night I woke up to myself uttering the names of the friends that I lost, the people I could've gotten to know better, the unfulfilled dreams, or repeating to myself the stories I never wrote. When I wake up in the morning, I went back to the drudgery of the desk job.

All my plans have been stalled. My online classes are slower thanks to coronavirus, and I can't meet with the officer recruiter to work out together because everything is shut down and everyone's quarantined. It's possible I have coronavirus myself, because I had a fever and bronchitis, and have been coughing and feeling weak for 3 weeks. But, I find all this to be a relief, and I am glad I don't have to go to work anymore.",17Mar2020,2
181,"My first boyfriend was very toxic. Ive been trying to get over it. With my new boyfriend a lot has changed. It feels like he loves me and spoils me. But today, on the second day of quarantine, something happened with him that happened with my ex.
We divide our housework. I clean, he cooks, i put the clothes into the washer, he hangs them to dry.
Early in the day i asked him if he could take the clothes out of the washer (it was only 5 of his white shirts and i let him know that too) and that he could do it at any time of the day.
5pm rolls around and i tell him im hungry and if he could make anything for dinner. He ""gets out of work"" around this time but i have an hour and half more to go.
I go look through the fridge and stuff and pull out some of the things needed to make pancakes and ask him to make me pancakes because im a shit cook and i literally Always burn at Least 1 pancake and he makes them perfectly. I just have no patience in the kitchen.
Meanwhile, i go sweep the floors and put the clothes to dry cause he didnt do it even though i reminded him once when the sun was about to go down.
An hour later and he is still playing a pausable game. So i just start playing League of Legends and suffer in silence and hunger.

Earlier in the day we talked about comunication (because we argued about work and i explained to him that i cant read his mind and he needed to say things.) so i didnt want to push it on him Again and just waited until he made dinner. But i feel really hurt.

My ex always said he was going to do things and never did. It built up a lot of resentment inside me. Some days i dont mind doing everything, even cooking, but i take every word seriously and im really sad and disappointed right now. (I cant even cook pasta/rice properly)...",17Mar2020,1
