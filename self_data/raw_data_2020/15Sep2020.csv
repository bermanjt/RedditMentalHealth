1,"I've (24F) just had an epiphany that my anxiety is rooted heavily in one central aspect of my life: my self esteem. Google self-esteem and I could agree with a multitude of potential sources (social media/unrealistic beauty standards, child of divorce, sexual assault survivor, etc).  

I've always been very anxious clothes shopping, and that's the only place I might be lacking confidence. In addition I would always consider myself a giver and not a receiver, which makes sense through this new lens. Like I'm not worth mutual human kindness... it's all very exhausting. 

I've been trying to manage my anxiety recently but this weekend I experienced a very self-deprecating episode, one I've never had before. Generally I am very happy and content in life-- but when my anxiety comes out to play she's my worst critic. 

Does anyone who's gone through something similar have any tips for working on self esteem? 

I am currently attending Telehealth therapy and won't be able to speak to my therapist for a few days. In the mean time I turn to Reddit! Thanks guys!",15Sep2020,1

I’m not sure where I want to go with this.

I scroll through the r/love sub on a regular basis, it feels like another world I’m not part of. Something alien in my real life that I only get a peak into through all the romance books I’ve devoured and the beautiful period dramas I thoroughly enjoyed. Strangely enough, none of that caused me to create a picture of romance in my own life. I felt all the feels, healthy butterflies and shed a tear here or there. But I never imagined myself to be the protagonist, the subject of someone’s deep admiration or being the one expressing their love and affection. By reading posts on that sub, I try to familiarize myself with love and romance, understand that it’s very much real, it’s not cringy and even when it is- who cares if those involved are blissfully happy?

As a mid-twentysomething woman (in many ways it feels like ‘girl’) I have not had the privilege of loving and being loved, in a romantic sense that is. It’s a part of myself that is deeply buried and not yet unlocked. I often wondered: am I capable to love and be loved? Unjustly, I ruled that I wasn’t. Not realizing the only reason for that incorrect conclusion is merely the fact that *I myself* did not allow myself to accept the part of me that wants to love and be loved. I needed to stop perceiving the need of the warmth of another human being a pathetic, silly one. I’ve never allowed myself to open up enough, nor did I dare to grow close to someone. I remain largely unfazed by crushes, handsome strangers and public expressions of romance from others that you’d think would instill a sense of jealousy or cause pang of deep longing. In an almost robotic way I answer curious interrogation as to why someone like me hasn’t found their person yet, not allowing the other to find out the truth. On the surface I come across as independent, self-sufficient and simply not that interested in the other gender. I do my utmost best to hold that image in place. I want the world to know that I don’t have to be needed.

I am very much good on my own.

Am I, though? To an extent, yes. But it’s becoming increasingly harder to fight the merciless strong desire to be close to someone. It’s always there. Always has been. Festering beneath the surface. I could push it away, bury it in work and academics but all that is starting to crumble. One can only be in denial for so long. Some things are not in our hands and we can either tirelessly fight it, and still lose at last or surrender and open your heart to that which it calls for but terrifies you the most. In my case, as I’m sure you’ve gathered, it’s intimacy in every sense of the word. I’m trying hard to change it, and it starts today:

I admit I want to love. I know I’m capable of profoundly loving someone. I can fight to the end of the world for someone I'm passionate about, I can love and affirm every fiber of your being. I’m capable of nauseating romance, one where I write silly notes and put them in random places, bring breakfast in bed and demand we stargaze together on a beautiful summer night.

I admit I want to be loved. I want to be admired, show all that I am and have, and be loved despite it. *For* it. I’ll be honest, whomsoever pledges to love me will have to have the patience to push through the hard shell and see that all I need is gentle encouragement and true signs that I can trust to put my heart in your hands.

Once I do put my heart in someone’s hands, I’m not sure I would ever want them to realize the power it holds. You see, there’s a reason I fear intimacy. I fall only for those that shake my world and I share an indescribable unique connection with. How would you know, you say, didn’t you claim to not have experience? But trust me, I know. I have felt it in its beginning stages, but it could not be further explored for various reasons. Part of me is terrified to find it, the real deal. Finding it would mean I could lose it. And I truly believe investing emotionally in the wrong person would shatter my world beyond repair. Beneath this seemingly hard to get through exterior, is a fragile heart that can’t take beatings. A heart full of love, loyalty and unbridled affection that is waiting to finally be listened to-and find a recipient for that which it has to offer.",15Sep2020,1
3,"I lost my father three years ago and my mother moved abroad with another man the year after. We barely talk. I tried reaching out, asking to video or even voice call. She told me several times that she would initiate the call instead of me doing so, but she hasn’t. So now I only text her hi from time to time.        
   
Despite us having our differences and arguing due to our stubbornness, my dad was the rock I could always lean on. And my mother was so kind and loving. I could share anything with her. I don’t know what happened.          
         
I’ve been holding up fine until the lockdowns and all because I’ve been so busy last year. Last summer my brother and I found a flat to rent and I also decided right after we finished moving in to resume my education which I had earlier put on hold for a few years. But now that online education ended, I realized in all my newly obtained free time these thoughts and feelings I’ve been pushing down inside me are popping back up more intensely and eating me alive. I feel abandoned.      

Of course there are many wonderful people in my life who do care about me, but I don’t want to be a burden to anyone with this misery which I feel like should have ended a year or so ago.

6,"Acceptance for what things are is the best type of growth

For a couple of months I’ve been trying my hardest questioning why the things that happen in my life happen or even why people come and go, or just simply when things just go  in unexpected ways

At this point I’ve realized that we really don’t have a lot of time here in this world at all, So why should I spend days and weeks and months questioning myself like I already have been for while about the things in life?

Fuck that. Life’s so much happier when you don’t question everything, just go through what life puts you through, enjoy it, don’t stress over the little temporary things, and simply just stop focusing on the past you. We’re not there anymore. Whatever problem comes up theres a possible way to solve it. You’re still learning everyday, and thats okay.

My testimony got fucked interjected and then added with a negative statement by one of the board members of this hearing. How dare he does such a statement that has no evidence, just merely word of mouth from ""his young folks""? Does he not know the power of his words that can skew the hearing one way or another? This pompous fool who doesn't know when to shut it and merely just take in all the information before speaking. How the fuck does an individual like that get to even have a seat on the board with that attitude? God, I just said my point and this guy for some reason chews me out for no reason?

I don't have any friends, and most of my classes are online because of COVID. I'm far away from my family and friends, and I miss them. I'm trying over and over again to join clubs to meet people, but nothing is really working. Every club is operating solely online, and all of my in-person classes make everyone stay 6 feet apart (which is good, because it keeps people safe), but it's not helping me meet people. My classes are really hard, and I'm up late working on stuff. I have classes all day, assignments to do all week, and I know literally no one on the entire campus. I have no one to talk to, no one to do stuff with, nothing. I usually spend my weekdays doing classes online or in-person, going to the cafeteria alone, eating alone, and then going up to my room (alone) where I don't have a roommate (because of COVID) and just doing stuff by myself. I've tried to do stuff like play games online with people, but it's not the same as interacting in-person. I'm so bored, all the time. On weekends, I literally do nothing. I can't sleep because I worry that I'll spend the next four years on my own with no friends, and I have no one to talk to about it. I have no idea what to do. In High School, I had a lot of good friends and a few really really close ones that I spent every weekend with, and I could tell them anything. I talk with them online, but it's not the same.

It’s like, his reputation, and my friend’s friendship with the guy sexually harassing me is more important than me getting any sort of apology. He even said “that’s just how people are” or “well he’s happy with someone else and not bothering you now, so what’s it to you?” I kind of want justice? I kind of want to have more than just people saying sorry. I would at least the guy who harassed me to be sorry even. Or to even have half the mind to understand he was wrong for doing things to me.

She does not make sense she literally sounds like a crazy person. When I told her I was gay she said to keep it a secret until she went to the grave. She is so negative and always  talking about how the apocalypse/ end of the world is coming and she can’t wait til Jesus comes. She makes me go to church even though I do not like it and guilt trips me for not wanting to read the Bible/ pray. She is the complete opposite of me. She always says that Democrats are ruining this country and she thinks millennials are the most corrupt generation because they have premarital sex/ a lot of them are gay. I cannot stand her anymore. This sounds really bad but I wish she would pass away. I have to conform myself when I’m around her because if she knew how flamboyant/ feminine and raunchy I sounded I make around my friends( I make a lot of inappropriate jokes) she would probably disown me. I despise her, I hate her, I always wish I had a different mother. This entire thing sounds dramatic but I am a sensitive person and can not tolerate her. She loves to blame things on me and most of the time they are not my fault. To show you how terrible She is when I was in middle school I missed the bus in the morning and had asked my father to drive me to school.

Well my brother has been talking to himself the past few weeks its the first for him. He started off just laughing and talking to himself the odd time nothing too serious, i did ask him about it but he said he was just ‘thinking out loud’ so i didn’t bring it up again until a few weeks later.

He started saying bizarre things that weren’t making sense, he’d talk as if he were 5 different people he’d say names like Samuel, Michael and Gabriel (like the angels) so at first i did think it could be spilt.

I went away for the weekend and now that i’m back its like his delusions have manifested. He talks like people are threatening him and he’d answer back as those people. He’d act like a demon burning in hell then he’d start screeching and hitting things. constantly uses the phrase “he’s telling the truth” and “woah”

23,"theres no point to this, i’m starting to think i’m not real

8 years ago, I felt as if all of the flowers in my garden had been crushed. There was no more light shining down on them, no more water reaching it’s roots. I was only 13 then. I would stay up all night, pacing back and forth in my room with tears streaming down my face with the TV on for background noise so that the deepening yet empty void of loneliness didn’t absorb me whole. Some sort of switch was flipped, I no longer felt like a kid, nor did I feel grounded in reality. One of my earliest memories of this feeling was when I was in the restroom at my old middle school. 8th grade me stood at the urinal, a few friends took the trip with me, and I stared up at the ceiling. I thought to myself, “Why am I floating?” I took this question to Yahoo! Answers (this was before I knew of Reddit) and most people proclaimed I was disassociating. They told me see a doctor, tell your parents. I ignored their advice. Before long, this was the new me. This is how my body felt and how I experienced life. I adapted, in a sense.

I still think(?) I feel this way. Honestly it just became the norm for me. A year after that I got my first girlfriend. She was a grade below me, but we were only about 4 months apart. This was my first feeling of love. Even to this day, I’ve never felt this way again, really. Sure, I’ve experienced love again, but can one ever recreate the feeling of a first love, even at such a young age? We dated for over a year and she dumped me for someone else. I wasn’t the best boyfriend. Jealousy took hold of me too many times, same for her. I’ve since grown out of that these 6 years later and would like to think she has too. After the break up, I was a complete mess. I cried harder than I ever did at that point in time. It brought me down into another depression. Suicide was on my mind and the night I found out she had left me for someone else, I decided I was finished. “Teenage drama” is how most perceived it, word got around. Most people thought she was the sole reason. She wasn’t. I wonder how school was for her on those days I was absent after my attempt, this is the first time I’ve thought about that. My sister found me on the ground, I wasn’t successful, in fact I wimped out and couldn’t even go through with it. But walking into someone on the floor with a bag over their head will cause some gut wrenching screams. I stayed in a hospital for a week after that. Sometimes I wonder if I actually died on the floor and the hospital was some sort of after life or heaven or sheol or jannah or purgatory. But then life resumed.

As I get older, I fear death and aging more and more. I try to come to terms with it, live in the moment and realize it happens to everyone. But I don’t want to die. My 21st birthday happened recently (this is the worst year to turn 21) and it was a decent day overall. I bought a THC distillate syringe from a friend some months prior but didn’t use it much, I figured it’d be a good end to the night. I put it on some of my left over birthday cake and shared it with my girlfriend and sister. They felt nothing, but it started kicking in for me as my girlfriend and I laid down watching a movie. First it was pleasant, I was just relaxing and giggling a bit. Then I felt my chest pound, I was breathing quickly and couldn’t focus or see straight. I remember uttering the words “I don’t feel real” to my girlfriend. Ever since this night, I can’t get this thought out of my mind. I feel different again, a hundred times more existential than before. There’s no point to this, I’m starting to think I’m not real.",15Sep2020,1

26,"I (22m)started smoking weed around 17 and I absolutely loved it. But there came consequences unknown to my waking mind. I’ve been an athlete all my life, football for 12 years, baseball for 4, wrestling for 2. Around my junior year some of my teammates (football) were having a get together and there I met Mary Jane. The first time smoking was absolute bliss, I had a great time, loved how it made me feel happy and like I didn’t care about anything. From then I smoked on occasions and occasions turned into everyday. My senior year I had the options to have more off periods or classes. You can only guess what I chose. From there I played football(I had moved to CO from TX) in a smallish town where everyone knew everybody, and I started off rough. I was always a first string RB and I just gave up because I felt like the coaches favored the others more and I let it completely get to me. I slept in class majority of the time, my grades were slipping and I’ve always been an A-B student. I really did stop caring about it all.

I finally got tired of my own shit. I woke up that morning not only depressed, but felt like a fire had awoken from inside me. As a kid I’ve always wanted to be a Navy sailor only to become future governor (some deep aspirations for a child). So I called a Navy recruiter to talk about my enlistment and my future schooling and career. Since then I’ve been sober, more clearheaded, motivated, and just happier overall. It’s like I’m a whole new person! I started working out (going ham too) and running and I’ve never felt better, more confident. I’m upset that I couldn’t realize the vises that I’ve allowed into my life earlier whether it be toxic friends or weed. 
I started believing in myself again. Plus my old friends (good ones) started coming back into my life and congratulating me on my commitment to become a better person and for enlisting.

In those times too, I can observe it and not try to hold it at bay or something like that...not strain myself by the fear of it.

37,"I'm in a locked down state of Australia (Victoria) and recently my grandpa passed away. As a result, only local family could visit. I live on the other side of the state atm... 

The funeral was hosted online as a result, with a standard definition, poorly framed camera at the funeral for us to watch. It was weird watching a screen and crying at something. It's such an emotionally intense thing, and I was alone for it while watching. Seeing the priest and a few others in a church wearing a mask while my grandfather's coffin was in the background on my screen really felt like a weird sci-fi alternate reality. It was kinda scary in a way, for a reason I can't quite describe. 

The hardest part was seeing my grandma walk up at the end, who was hobbled over and just looked really awful.",15Sep2020,1

39,"I typically don't really use reddit to post or even really contribute, but tonight I ended my friendship with basically my only local
friend and I just need to tell someone about all this.  

I do have a few other friends who don't live nearby, and one good one whom I talked to about this who was also a mutual friend, He was supportive and completely understood why I had to go through with it.  

The friend I'd known for years, I had dealt with social anxiety most of my life and still do to this day, and back when I met him he
was the only person to go out of his way to get to know me more, And I suppose I appreciated that enough to the point I guess I just
ignored the fact that throughout most of our time knowing each other he wasn't really a good friend.  

And I hate to admit that, this is a person who was abandoned by his parents. that moved into my home and basically became my step-brother for years, he wouldn't often refer to me as his ""real"" brother.  

But I never reciprocated the statement because I knew deep down I couldn't consider him my brother. He was incredibly homophobic in  high school, (Men only, Lesbians were fine with him, which should give you an idea of what he's like.)  

he would say things like holding hands in public was ""In your face"" and would claim homosexuality is wrong because they can't produce a baby (Sperm donor?? and like where is it written you have to have a baby?) He would say things like ""the world could benefit from a genocide"" which is obviously ignorant as fuck. He grew out of the hard homophobia but he's still casually homophobic.  

throughout the years he has been inconsiderate in many aspects and doesn't really take anything about life seriously, (Himself,
politics, others) I was one of the long haired, chubby, game all day, centrist kids throughout my highschool years and early 20s I had always been anxious about initiating conversation and hanging out with friends and never dated any or even really been friends with any women even to this day, I was admittedly unhappy with myself and thought I didn't deserve to be in a relationship for a long time. And trust me I wasn't entirely wrong.  

But he would bring his girlfriends back home throughout highschool and fuck them while I was asleep in the same room. And yes I would wake to it and make noise to let them know I'm awake, But they wouldn't always stop. And this hurt quite a lot emotionally as I had always yearned to be in a relationship with someone.  

skip forward to our mid twenties, he's lost his job, on disability (Not saying that's a bad thing, I'm on it too) and hes been 
homeless several times of his own choice even when he had other options.  

He had a rough upbringing, a veeeerryyy rough upbringing. his mom nearly inadvertently got his brother killed before getting murdered herself, and I understand completely why he is in the situation he's in now, and why he acts the way he does.  

But as he was explaining himself when I went to let him know why I'm ending the friendship. I just remembered all the other times I'd been here, every time I think I need to end it he seems to do something that makes me think ""Maybe he isn't so bad."" and while it's true he could be a lot worse I just couldn't keep in contact with him anymore.  

I had a revelation last year, or maybe we are both just having our quarter-life crisis in very different ways. I've realized I want alot
more out of life and have been working to improve myself. I've been working on trying to get on a career path, I've been working out and have dropped from an average 230 lbs to around 200 now, I've cut back hard on gaming, 5-10 hours a week at most down from hundreds.  

I look in the mirror and don't think the person I see is a loser anymore. I'm starting to practice driving again to get my license 
even though I hate it. I do all that cause I want to spend what's left of my life with someone I love, and end it looking back without 
any regrets, willing to go through it all again just to experience it one more time, even with the first 25 wasted. Because that's
what I want, and that's what my anxiety makes me feel I have to do to even deserve it, even if I know the fact that I'm working towards it is good enough for now.  

he play video games constantly and gets upset that I don't wanna play often. He and his friends do cocaine often. Every time I mention any minor detail of improving myself he disregards it and makes it clear he doesn't care in the slightest, he just wants social entertainment. And today he said something today that was the final push I needed to go through with ending things like I planned to at the beginning of this year.  

I went through with it and explained why I had to end it. he acted calm and unfazed but I could tell he was shocked and bitter.
and he had also said ""We don't really hang out much anyways, no HUGE deal."" ...so yeah, so much for all the years living together.  

I knew I had to do it eventually, I'm confident in where I'm headed, I still have the anxiety problem, and It's gonna be rough finding new friends especially during a pandemic. But it still hurts.
He was friendly and usually meant well and we were like family at one point, but I couldn't stick around and be dragged down back into that miserable place again after finally getting out of it.  

TLDR: ended longtime friendship with casual homophobe/racist and unsupportive friend to focus on myself and start fresh.",15Sep2020,1
41,"The vast majority of our species buys into all of the bullshit that they're regularly being fed by their authority figures and most of them don't question it, and when you try to prove them wrong they are adamant into believing that you're the one who's living in a fantasy world.

I hate that people label me as schizophrenic just because they can't accept the fact that my actually correct interpretation of reality is different than theirs.

I see through all the bullshit, false promises and hubris that is constantly being regurgitated by those in power and yet they want to put some label on me that I'm somehow crazy or irrational?

I beg to differ - they're deluded themselves. They actually believe that the shit they do is right and justified when it isn't, and yet we're supposed to just accept whatever it is that they say and do like the good little drones that they truly believe that we are.

It takes a real insecure individual to want power over a population for the simple reason of being in power.

Police are guilty of this 100%, and they're equally as deluded.

They really believe that the job that they're doing is helping? Seriously? They're nothing more than the private army of the government - they're the hounds that are sicked onto the citizenry in order to preserve order. If they really want to help the population of people, they'd be arresting those who abuse their power regularly and get away with the most heinous of crimes, but because they have power, they are immune to the laws.

Or in actual terms, not order, but stability and security for themselves - what politicians don't want is a population of critical thinkers who can see through the veil of bullshit. Is it no wonder that a lot of our great minds end up becoming recluses, in prison or psychiatric hospitals for bullshit reasons or kidnapped off the street, never to be seen again.

They're afraid of people like them, and they always will be.

That's why people need to break free of these delusions and join those of us who actually know how this shitty world works.

It's people who actually know what's really going on... they'd rather lock us up in psych wards or prisons with the excuse that we're mentally ill, when in reality it's everyone else who is, but they buy into systems, so they don't get those labels... because they're the ones the people in power rely on to keep their power.",15Sep2020,1

43,"So last night my moms boyfriend got arrested. They get into fights very often but he wasn’t normally one to get physical he was always just very verbally abusive. Their last fight was the first time he actually got physical, he slammed her against the wall and screamed in her face. Their fights are always start with something stupid and then it works up to money or me and my sister. I will not be saying my age but I’m a young teenager and my older sister is 17. He always felt the need to make rude comments on everything that I said and he always felt the need to make comments about my sexuality which has lead to me being extremely insecure and having panic attacks. Almost every time I have a friend come over or their is a tv show that has a lesbian couple he made nasty ass homophobic comments then played it off as a joke which made me very uncomfortable. I’ve always been one to speak up but I’ve learned to just shut up and walk away because then it will start a fight. Ever since he got with my mom I haven’t liked him and I sometimes say that I wish that they never got together but they had a baby together and I would never wish for her not to be here. Also he never really liked to watch his baby and always complained when he had to but when he does pay attention to her then he is great with her, that just isn’t very often. Both me and my older sister don’t see our fathers and I really wanted it to be different for my baby sister because I wanted her to have what we never got. I am glad that she is just a baby when this is all happening because she will not remember it but it makes me sad that she isn’t going to have her father around. Anyways I’ll finally get to the point! (sorry my story is kind of all over the place) so last time around 8 he started to get drunk he was talking to himself and acting super weird. He was just sitting for hours with blaring music (to the point where the walls were shaking) and chugging his beers like they were water. I got up to go to the bathroom and he locked me and my sister out. Our rooms are in a separate part of the house btw. So I went through the doggy door to get in and when I went in he kept on saying weird things to himself and he wasn’t acting normal. I unlocked my door and went back in my room, then my mom texted me to make sure I have my camera ready because she feels like he is going to do something. I hit heard him go into their room and start yelling at my mom saying “you’re f*cking trash I don’t want you here, get tf out of my house” so I hit record and set my phone right by the door. I went in my sisters room as my phone was recording to tell her what was going on then we heard my mom scream. We ran out and I grabbed my phone. She was screaming “get off of me, I can’t breath” my sister started running in and it scared me because I thought he was going to hurt my sister too. But he stopped when my sister screamed at him to stop. I ran in their room and my mom was crouched down on the floor with a bloody nose. He told us to get my mom tf out and that we’re trash. My mom was crying and called the police, then she went out the back and through the front gate so he wouldn’t see her go outside. The police came and started talking to him but he just kept on acting like nothing happened and kept on asking if he could put on clothes because he was just in his boxers. As this was going on there were taking pictures of my mom. Then they noticed me and my sister so they talked to us and we showed them the footage. Then they went back in and I wasn’t aloud to come out so I didn’t see what happened after that but my mom cane and got ya and said that he is gone. I was in shock and couldn’t believe what had just happened, it all went so fast. We talked about it and then I went to go on my phone and realized there was no WiFi. He ripped the cords out of everything and the hid the speakers to the tv under his bed. We think that he did this so that he could say my mom did ripped them out so that she didn’t have to hear his music anymore. We all tried to get some rest because by this time is was about 5:30 a.m. Today I searched for his arrest and found his mugshots. You can tell that he was crying. We feel like he might’ve blackout because several times when they’ve gotten into fights the next day he won’t remember wtf happened. We got a restraining order so he can’t come to the house and we can move out so we’re safe. I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel because I’ve been wanting my mom to leave because it’s obviously a very toxic household but I just wish it didn’t happen like this. I feel bad because we just ruined his life he now has 3 felonies on record. I didn’t want us to hurt him like this, I hate him but now that he’s gone I keep on just thinking about what was good. My mom only makes about 800$ a month so we don’t know what to do because we can’t stay here anymore. I don’t know what to do or how to help. Sorry I’m bad at explaining story’s but I need help so I decided that the best decision was to ask a bunch of strangers on the internet. Somebody please give me advice on the situation.",15Sep2020,1

Hey guys. I’m sorry, I don’t post much, I just need somewhere to vent. I’m so sick of life and I just needed to let it all out somewhere.

So my ex and I broke up in February, I was the one that ended it because they'd gone behind my back - nothing super super major but I just couldn't accept it and it came on top of a bunch of other bad stuff. We remained friends for a while, and then in April I blocked them everywhere because we had another huge fight. June comes around and I add them again and we start talking. 

I did this because I was still thinking about them every day and just overall missing them insanely - it took an extreme toll on my mental health. 

Things don't really get any better, they act super cold towards me - understandably. I start seeing a therapist, things get slightly better, and now here I am in September, better friends with my ex and overall things are looking up. 

The past few days / week I've felt like some of my friends have taken some distance from me. I don't really understand why, but am keeping in mind that I've relied on them a lot for support over the past few months. 

Yesterday I message a close friend of mine, asking her if anything happened because she's kinda just ghosted me lately - basically she goes on a rant and says that its exhausting to be my friend, and how all I talk about is negativity and mental health etc. and I need to work on that and she needs a break from me, so don't call her for a while. 

ive told her several times that if its too much, tell me and I'll back off. I 100% understand how listening to other peoples problems, and being their support, can take a toll on ones' energy etc and it can be tiring. I get that, and I respect that. But I feel like she just blew up in my face, and just ghosting me out of nowhere isn't really a good way to do it.

i've suffered from anxiety and depression from a fairly young age. i spent most of my childhood and teenage years being miserable and lonely. most people have some sense of self by the time they're teenagers, but i was a shell of a person. i didn't know my personality, my interests, my ambitions, because my entire life had been consumed by depression and anxiety. i never really made any good friends or developed a personal style or any hobbies.

by the time i decided i wanted to stay alive and get better, i was 16 or 17. by then, i had to work nonstop to make up for lost time. develop work ethic, figure out my ambitions, make amends for past behavior. i went to community college right after graduating high school and transferred to a university two years later, which was last fall. up until then, i never had an opportunity to socialize or express myself or anything. but i finally had that opportunity for a brief moment! but i quickly ended up in a relationship. he was clingy, he pressured me to spend time with him and his friends rather than make new friends or partake in extracurriculars. i regret being with him. 

and now we're in quarantine. my university has not confirmed the entire school year to be online yet, but it is highly unlikely that any part of my final year of college will be in person. i can't make any new friends or new experiences or anything that can help me find myself. i feel lost. i didn't get a college experience or a high school experience or a childhood. i'm going to be entering the ""real world"" with no sense of self. no friends. nothing.

71,"There's a lot of things worrying me right now but the most important one at the moment is my job.

My job thus far has been an opportunity. I'm supposed to be a software engineer but I've really been doing more than that. I've been able to make financial decisions, I've been able to make decisions on the recruitment process, I've been able to pretty much learn whatever I like about software.

My company is a startup. Our team is small so these opportunities are available. Now, I'm trying to make our software building processes more efficient as well as change the structure, the coding standards and the way we do code reviewing.

I guess the place is a goldmine of opportunities. It will no doubt serve me well when I leave.

But then these are all difficult things to do and sometimes I wonder if they'll pan out. Not everyone in my company sees this as I do. Some people just seem to be there to collect the pay, others don't really seem to care much about learning. I'm also doubtful of my boss' leadership. I think he doesn't know what he's doing. He just doesn't make any decisions at all. As far as my side goes I'm the one charting the course and deciding where to go but I'm not in charge and the vision and path that I may chart apply to me and those around me but not to the organization as a whole.

We pay a consultant to help us out. We meet with him regularly but it always seems like I'm the only one whoever speaks to him. My boss never says anything in those meetings. The other people don't either.

I really want these initiatives to succeed but they won't if I'm the only one putting my weight behind them. I know there are others doing things to make the company more efficient but they don't work on the software side.

I sometimes feel guilty. This is of course a great learning opportunity for me but sometimes I feel like I am just being paid to learn all this stuff and benefit myself. I just don't have confidence that my boss knows what he's doing. I don't think he understands or knows how to take advantage of what we're doing.

Maybe I should try to do the best that I can? Make the best out of it and just hope things go right? I don't know how to feel about all this, I just don't want the company to fail.",15Sep2020,1
72,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘this is brilliant news, very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",15Sep2020,1
73,"For a long time (pretty much my whole life) I would have trouble sleeping before 2am. Falling asleep at night was a struggle and it was just me alone with my thoughts until the sun came out.  Obviously, there were periods in time when this was better/worse.

I've fixed this now. I sleep before 2, I wake up early (6-10)... But once I wake up I have so much trouble finding it in me to get OUT of bed. I just feel this sinking hopeless feeling like I could just stay in bed and curl up in my covers all day. It probably sounds crazy.

79,"I don’t know I just want to sort stuff out in my brain. My mind used to be my best friend, I used to not be scared of it. Now I feel like there’s a policeman sitting in my head policing all my thoughts. It’s so bloody unconscious I can’t describe it. It makes me feel like i can’t freely think anymore. There’s something in my head stopping me. Maybe I’m not as intelligent as I used to be, maybe I damaged my brain from all the marijuana smoking. I’m only 21. My focus is off. Just last night with all my might I was trying to meditate , just be aware of the thoughts. But the crowd of thoughts kept pulling me back in, I was just trying to stand there and be present. But those motherfuckers wanted me in the crowd. Worst part is my thoughts made no sense. Who says thoughts have to make sense? They can just be like flashing pictures on a screen. No correlation to each other or anything. It’s really scary when your brain is so random. It’s almost like my mind has turned against me. I can’t control it, I feel mentally handicapped. Like every time there is a thought that doesn’t make sense, I pay attention and I react to it with silence and then it’s like more thoughts come. I feel like i am possessed with something, like the keyboard to my brain is in the worst hands possible. It’s this feeling of not being able to stop my own mind that hurts the most. Not being able to think constructively property, I used to be a genius. Now my intelligence feels average , because I am so scared of using my brain sometimes and feeling how slow it is. It’s weird and I am very sad, nothing feels like mine. Last night I was laying Awake I felt like another person in my body. I am not even describing the brain feeling correctly because it’s a weird eating away feeling that cannot seem to be penetrated with words. I can’t think of who I used to be because it just makes me want to CRY. I used to be very happy and benevolent and my mind was my greatest ally. I was always writing silly things coming up with jokes being myself, now it’s Like my brain is not allowed to do that anymore I feel like a miserable old man that’s suffering in a world that nobody can enter. I am a 21 year old girl and I genuinely do not know how to handle this. I am not freaking out or anything but it makes me want to put my body on hold. I feel trapped in my head and my body. All the thoughts I don’t want to think of pop up and I am too handicapped to find ways around it anymore. I feel like stress has eaten away at my brain and my happiness. Sometimes I get moments of pure spontaneity where I’m thinking freely BUT as soon as I’m aware of it I flash back into a mentally paralyzed state where all my thoughts are frozen and I am confused by them. Thoughts are like a feeling I learned, it’s a sensation to travel down your mind thinking of a variety of different things. Just like taking a walk or eating a sandwich. When you become aware of how illusive the thought process is and how you can disrupt it, it almost becomes impossible not to disrupt it. It’s this feeling of “everything is not what it seems, it’s an illusion” writing this makes me realize how insane I am. But any advice on how to stop living my life on pause would be really nice. Or if you could just tell me that you understand the feeling, I don’t know. Hopefully my life gets less annoying, less question marky and more like life.",15Sep2020,1

87,"TW: Self harm


I begged my LDR boyfriend to stay with me. We broke up 4 days ago, he blocked me everywhere. I pathetically created a new account just to message him asking if he really wants to end the relationship. Waited for him to response. After 2 days he did.


He’s a kind of man that absolutely wants his alone time to be *super* alone time. If he says he wants to rest, he will go to rest without telling me for hours even if I send him *few* messages he wont respond. If he does, he goes saying “you are not respecting my time”, “you are so annoying”. I’d message him at times because he will not reply to me amidst the conversation, of course I’d send him quite a few messages asking where he went. He will tell me how impatient and disrespectful I was and when I point out that he didn’t tell me he wanted to be alone he’d say “if I’m not responding that means I’m resting, it’s a common sense” so yeah lol we’ll end up fighting. But this isnt the reason why we broke up.


We talked tonight. He said he will think about that another chance because we were on and off last Aug - Sept and all break ups were initiated by me. So I said I understand. He said he wants to rest but I sent him, at the same time, a question (do you hate me now?) 


He said I was being annoying and how ironic for me to ask him to get back together when “you know how much I hate being interrogated on my alone time” then he added: _Pathetic._


Before, he accused me of being a future murderer for having an unstable mind, a witch for “always trying to mind read”, he told me I was crazy and psychotic. Man writing all these I dont know why the hell I want to stay w this man lol. Anyway


He called me pathetic. I told him to fuck off and he said that all the chances he’d give me are gone now. I said I’m aware how pathetic and low I get right now but thats because I care about our relationship and I dont want to throw all the things we planned for away. And I’m aware that I’m pathetic, I just dont want someone to tell me that directly most especially coming from him! And suddenly all the stupid fucking dreams we had before came flashing in my mind and instantly I regret saying “fuck off”. I never wanted to be with someone other than him so I said I’m sorry. He sent me a meme saying “no” and all other ridiculous meme that is so annoying but


I fucking begged him to not leave me and I will change. I will be better. This went on for an hour until he said he had to go somewhere. I asked if he’ll think about giving me a chance and he said he will.


I am so fucking annoyed now at myself. I know I always wanted to leave this relationship but I am so attached to the man I was in loved with. He wasn’t that man anymore. I am also clinging to those stupid dreams we had in which I don’t think will happen anymore. I realize how stupid, pathetic, low, every other shit I am right now. I have no more dignity. There are times I was fine with us not talking anymore but most of the time I cry for the things we could have been! All of these seriously makes me want to kill myself and reset all the idiot things I’ve done. I seriously have nothing left for myself anymore. I dont want to do this for other people but fucking hell how low have I become now. I hate myself I seriously hate myself.",15Sep2020,1

In order to combat this amalgamation of malfunctions, Shock said the medical community needs to combine resources and focus attention on finding causes rather than treating side effects. Like a leukemia patient mustering every bit of strength and technology within their means to rid themselves of cancer, the pharmaceutical industry would need to unite to put to rest this end of life mental degeneration. This book accounts the introduction of L-DOPA a dopamine antagonizer that revitalized catatonic patients to a level of youth they didn't know was within them. Before an age where 1/8 of people are on antidepressants, Dr. Sacks found the key to a healthy sustainable life is holding onto that enlightenment and continuously refining the sense of self.

My mother was my inspiration, she was the one who got me interested in what i do today, when we got to Chicago i remember her first job she got was a manager position in a chain restaurant called ""Cozy"" (If your from Chicago you know what im talking about) and from there she started to build up a REP and eventually she became an event planer for the Hilton corporation, this is were my story begins.

I was (13m) years old by this time now and i remember we were coming out of school for summer vacation and i was thinking i would go camping with some friends, when i got home my mother was waiting for me so she could tell me something really important, that i wasn't going camping because she got me a job for the summer in the hotel. I was devastated and scared, my first job in my life was as a dish washer in events, my first week was really hard i wasn't prepared for this, my second week i was getting the hang of it but this time i worked near the kitchen and there is when i started to see my self in this. Seeing all cooks and chefs moving chaotically and making different kinds of foods made me feel like i belong there, in this moment i knew this was going to be my life. I went home with my mom that day and when we got there i told her i wanted to become a chef, she literally started to burst into tears.

From this point on i had multiple restaurant jobs this included a taco stand, Macdonalds, a pizza joint and a restaurant called ""Huck Finn"" (Another reference if your from Chicago). When i got to 17 years old we had to leave United States because my dad got a job offer in Mexico and from there on i kept working my ass off, saving up all the money i got from all this places i worked on basically just to pay my culinary school. After i finished My high school my parents helped me find a good culinary school, i was 20 years old by this time i spent 4 years of my life studying to become the best chef, i graduated and i was ready to face the world..

This is when my life started to take a down hill in my profession...

I started working in some of the most luxuries restaurants in Mexico and met a lot of good chefs, I was getting a lot of experience out of this, things that helped me in my professional life, Ive to work 8 to 14 hours daily and i didnt care i loved what i did, eventually i got my own apartment and started paying for my stuff and this when i started noticing something wrong with my paycheck, i noticed i was getting payed very little for the hours i was working, maybe i didnt notice this because i lived with my perants, but now i see that here in Mexico people who work in the food industry are paid horribly. I use to work 14 hours and got paid $1,800 MXC weekly thats about $84 dollars per week CAN YOU BELIVE THAT....this is when i started to think ""4 years of my life studying for such little pay"" I love what i do but you cant live with love, and were talking that i worked in high end restaurants so i started talking to the head chef and he told me he was winning the same thing and he wouldnt leave because it would be the same in other places, i was devastated and i thought ""his right"" i didnt know anything alse then the kitchen were would i go and i couldnt go back to the United States, so i decided to keep going and do my best and guess what COVID hits and literally destroys my career because all restaurants closed, so i had to start looking in different perspective and guess what now i work in a company that sells Cement tiles and they only hired me because of my english.

Question: Any of you out there are chefs like me and had to suffer this ?",15Sep2020,1

She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

116,"Just thought someone might find this interesting.  A while back I started connecting with some family members id never met before, on both parents side. I’m not looking to build deep relationships I was mostly just curious. Most people were very nice.  But there was one semi  distant aunt (my grandfathers niece) who acted crazy, we exchanged some emails and she basically attacked my branch of the family, brought up old stuff I didn’t know or care about (not like sexual abuse but financial disputes etc). She also made nasty comments about other branches of the family I also don’t know, telling me that this person was a drug addict, this person committed suicide because of this person etc. And bragging about her own immediate family how they were raised proper, didn’t suffer from problems like the rest of the family etc. It didn’t really bother me, I don’t know her, I was just like ok she’s nuts, I ended the email chain politely. A few days later she apologized, said I had brought back old
memories. I said it was fine no big deal etc.  a little later her adult daughters (40-ish) reached out to me on FB and we are connected and see each other’s posts, exchange greetings occasionally. 

So a few months ago, one the daughters posted on Facebook that she had just discovered that her father (raised from birth) was not her biological father.  She connected with a half-sister sister she never knew, her biological father had already passed away. Through the comments she explained that her mom (the woman I was taking about above) denied it, said it was impossible, she didn’t sleep with anyone else at the time, but that you can’t argue with DNA testing.

So yeah this woman who felt a need to go off on the family to basically a stranger either didn’t know or hid the identity of her kids father.  All while making herself out to be a saint. Lol.",15Sep2020,1

I’m at my breaking point.

I can’t do this on my own anymore. I need help.

I need fucking help guys

I won’t survive the rest of this pandemic.

Hey guys. I’m sorry, I don’t post much, I just need somewhere to vent. I’m so sick of life and I just needed to let it all out somewhere.

This lockdown has absolutely ruined me. At the start of quarantine, I lost my job. It was minimum wage but it got me by, as well as my father and my brother, because I always took as many hours as I could get. Losing this job destroyed me. I have no savings, I currently have 1.43e in my bank account and no job prospects in sight. 

My father has been weak for a few years now, as last year he was hospitalized for 12 weeks due to lung problems. My brother and I are absolutely terrified for him, and pray he won’t catch Covid 19. 

I feel the worst for my brother, he’s only 13 and sees his family struggling to put food on the table for him. His birthday is next week and I really don’t think I’ll be able to get him anything. He deserves a great life and I feel so guilty that I can’t provide it for him.

Guys I’m just broken down and tired, and I need to just talk to someone or scream into the void. Thank you for listening

124,"

 Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘this is brilliant news, very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


TLDR she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",15Sep2020,1

Alright so I’m the type of person that likes to try new things, the hobby type. On the other hand though I’m also the type of person that has a weird obsession with saving money. (Im21 btw) 

So what’s the difference? Well, being 21, I’ve always noticed people my age are always buying new things, getting Starbucks on the daily, etc stuff like that. It’s one dollar today, another tomorrow but it adds up. 

In the end what do these two things get you? Well, I mentioned I liked trying new things and saving money BUT when I make up my mind I’m gonna try something new I go all out. I mean it.. for example, a few years back I was looking into motorcycles. My ass went over to the dealer and got a brand new (at the time) 2019 Kawasaki zx6r. It was a pretty good deal but it was still a considerable amount of money. 

Anyways, I got so much hate here on Reddit lmfao not for the reasons you’d think(beginner starting on a pretty powerful bike/crashing) but instead more like, “I guess we can buy anything when we use daddy’s cards” “gtfo with tour humble brag” bruh lmfao (never dropped the motorcycle tho )

Currently, I’m thinking about starting another hobby, guitar. So I go over to a sub for that and I start reading older posts etc. a lot of people talk about 300ish and I’m like “oh” bc I was intending on spending significantly more than that. But yeah, this time I won’t be posting about it 😭

148,"Freshman in EE. Not sure if college / my degree was right for me and I’m very lost on what to do + thinking about if I took a gap year

I’m a freshman and my classes were moved online 2 weeks ago. I’ve been staying home since then, and the university is deciding in two weeks whether to send everyone home or stay online. I’m behind in all my classes and haven’t done any work since I got home. 

I picked electrical engineering because I am interested in audio / sound design, and I’d like to work in places such as a recording studio, movie set, or do fx for video games, movies, tv shows, or composition scoring for anything. I read online EE is the best degree to choose for this as it will give you a solid understanding of audio and how it moves, but really I’m not sure what to do. 

I’m a first gen college student, and my dad owns a trucking company. He did horrible in school and he really wants me to get a degree so I will have a better chance of getting a job. The thing is, I’m tired of the education system. I was always in all the AP classes in high school, I ranked 3rd in the class, I scored a 31 on my ACT, and I never really cared about it. So many people praised me for intelligence and still do, but I don’t care about it that way. I’ve never been as interested in academics and stuff as much as my peers, who are going in for biomedical engineering, and civil engineering, and they are the type of people who want to work in those industries. I don’t want to work on a community power grid, I would rather design software/hardware instruments and obsess over what happens to an audio signal when you do x,y, or z. 

I’m a very musical person, and I write songs and mix them all myself. I know I’m really talented, but I haven’t put as much effort into it as I should have. I kind of wish I took a gap year and got a job, and focused on my music full time for a year just to see what happens. Since quarantine started I did it more and more, but always viewed it as a hobby and not as a full time thing.

I know there is a niche for what I want to do somewhere, but I’m not sure where. I was thinking of minoring in music tech, or getting a dual degree in EE and music industry. 

I just don’t know if EE is right for me, and I’ve basically stopped with school because I have completely lost my focus right now. I’d appreciate any help.",15Sep2020,1
149,"I am female and lesbian. I’m keeping exact ages out of this, but we are both well into our 20’s. My (very recently - as of last night) ex will be referred to as J. 

We have been struggling for a long time (together about a year and a half I’d say). We seem to bounce off of each other constantly, be it communication style or relationship expectations. We could have loads and loads of fun together and be very romantic and sweet, but the way we went about serious conversations and such was very toxic. J also has a bit of a tendency to get frustrated, defensive, and hostile very easily, be it over a small inconvenience or something I brought to the table about our relationship. I’m no saint either. I know I didn’t provide her the level of affection that J needed and these two aspects were major fuel for us feeling unfulfilled.

A few days ago, we did almost break up. We both talked about how it just felt like a vicious cycle and we were both very unhappy. She stated at some point in the conversation that if we broke up, she’d have no one and wouldn’t be hear anymore. I clarified what she meant and she stated she would kill herself. This made me uncomfortable but I didn’t chalk it up to manipulation as much as just her expressing her feelings. We decided what we would do is make a list of expectations that the other person could hold us to, and would set a time frame on it. We gave each other a bit of time to think about expectations.

The next night, she could tell I was off and asked what was wrong. I expressed being concerned about our future together because we both had trust issues that things would actually change and I kept foreseeing it ending unhappily. She suggested we go ahead and make our lists - so we did - and put a month timeframe on it after going over our lists in detail.

Well then things just still didn’t feel right to me. I had this nagging feeling of things ending horribly and felt more and more suffocated. I went only two days like feeling like this and last night she could definitely tell I was off so I made myself just out and say I couldn’t do it anymore. She was upset, and I don’t blame her for that one bit. She was angry and confused and yelled a lot. I made sure to keep myself calm and not escalate it while she was dealing with emotions that were far more painful than what I was feeling. J knows I want to find a way to continue being friends once the dust settles, but indicated she couldn’t trust that I care anymore or would even want to be her friend. I told her we don’t have to be friends and she responded accusing me of lying of ever being friends. I clarified and said that I meant we didn’t have to be friends if she didn’t want to be my friend ever.

She ended up leaving the house. I can’t say I blame her as she probably felt really trapped and needed to get out. While she was out, I called a friend and told him what happened. During this, she sends me a photo of a knife in her passenger seat, won’t tell me where she is, won’t promise me she won’t hurt herself, and basically starts ignoring me. I have my friend call her repeatedly until she answers (I knew she wouldn’t answer my calls) and he talks to her while I talk to police. They say they will be on the lookout for her. He gets her to calm down enough to agree to drive back home, and I let the cops know she is home safely. I fell asleep at about 3 am when I could hear her watching tv downstairs and felt like she was at least marginally more safe.

Today I woke up and went about my morning but kept thinking about her and hoping she was okay. After a bit, I went to go check that she had put the knife back. She hadn’t so I checked to see if it was in her car. Since it wasn’t I knew I had to go check on her as well as procure the knife. I go to the room she is isolating in and ask her to please give me the knife. She yells at me a bit about something, but I do get the knife in the end. She then indicates that it didn’t matter that I took the knife because she had something else in progress. I asked what she meant but she refused to clarify. I had no choice but to call the cops again. They show up along with paramedics and I stay on the front porch to make sure she has a safer place without my presence to talk to them, hoping she will be honest.

She tells them she isn’t planning to hurt herself and beyond that, there isn’t much they can do. A cop told me he left his business card with her and told her to call him if she did intend to do something. 

I’m terrified to leave her alone. The cats ran out of food this morning but I asked a friend to drop some off for us and that I’d pay her back. She drops off the cat food and had left pizza and soda for us. I go to tell J that there is pizza for her if she wants any, as well as soda. I try to figure out if she’s going to hurt herself or kill herself but she won’t answer. I beg with her to go to the hospital but she keeps saying no.

She blocked my number at some point so I ended up sending her a Snapchat message telling her she is valued and begging her to get help.

I don’t know what else to do, guys. I want to move forward with my life so desperately but this is eating me alive. Please give suggestion and advice on what you would do. She doesn’t want to talk to me at all. She will answer certain people’s phone calls but idk how much they’d even be able to do aside from listening to her vent (which is totally fine! She is allowed to have and express those emotions). But from my angle: my hands are tied and I just want to know she is safe without my presence making things harder for her to heal.

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I’m very shy and quiet and look nervous easily) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’
