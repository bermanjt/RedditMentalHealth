0,"TL;DR: I’ve been on a mental decline since Thursday. I’ve been crying a lot, I feel exhausted, I can’t focus, I’ve lost interest in what I previously enjoyed, and I’ve become numb. My anxiety has caused me to worry about different things each week during quarantine (I normally worry about stuff but not to this degree), but none of them affected me the same as the most recent one. What’s going on with me?

This week has probably been the worst week emotionally since my grandfather passed away four years ago. I promise I’m not trying to be dramatic, I just feel that horrible. I knew my mental health was going to plummet when quarantine started, but I just didn’t know when. I think it’s officially happened, and I am a wreck.

I’ve felt kind of off ever since quarantine started in mid March. Most people felt this way though, so I passed it off as normal. I’ve had a feeling of slight emptiness. I didn’t feel much joy or excitement, but this is pretty normal for me. I started worrying more a couple weeks in. I found a different thing to worry about each week, but then I would talk to a friend or something about it and get over it. This was happening over and over and over again. It stayed like this for awhile, but I began to decline last Thursday. I started worrying about something new, but this one was different. (I’m not going to say exactly what this was because it would make this 10 times longer, if it would help knowing what this is DM me or PM me asking to add this). Then, I started to lose some of my typical interests, but not fully. I still had music. Then, on Friday, I started having difficulty focusing on my elearning (online schooling). I talked to a friend, as I normally do, about what was bothering me, but, this time, it didn’t work. She recommended something. Then, on Sunday night, I did something minor that I would regret. I’ve come to terms with it (kind of) but I’m still very indifferent about it. But that’s a whole other thing. I would start to feel sick soon after, but this ended up being poorly timed food poisoning. I started feeling even more anxious than I had been feeling for the last couple days. On Monday, I couldn’t get my mind off of it. I had lost all my interests by this time. Then, all the other things I’ve been worrying about came back to haunt me. Yesterday was even worse. I couldn’t get my mind off of it, but now Im crying off and on all day. Off topic on topic, but I had posted about my struggles with this on another subreddit right after it happened and somebody DM’d me, she’s helped a lot but I’m still off. She assured me that this was something I should probably talk to my Mom about, we have a good relationship. I ended up texting her, and, right after I felt okay, but then suddenly everything came back to me. Her response was positive, but some things in it didn’t give me much comfort. I cried for about 2 hours after this. I felt off the rest of the night but couldn’t cry anymore. 

Today hasn’t been as bad, but it’s been different. I feel mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted. I’ve been sleeping fine, better than I normally do, actually. I haven’t cried yet, but I don’t feel like I have the energy to cry. I thought I felt numb before, but now I know what true numbness feels like. My Mom offered to go on a walk to clear my head, but I don’t feel like it at all. I’m afraid and don’t know about what we would talk about. She’s been acting as though nothings happened, which I know it supposed to comfort me, but I can’t act like that. I can’t really fake a smile right now. Would the walk help? I was able to focus enough to work on school stuff, but it was rough. Normally, the assignments are really easy for me, but the simplest ones took forever. I haven’t felt much nausea today, which is nice. My appetite is slowly crawling back. At least my illness is starting to go away, but mentally, I’m still a wreck. I feel better about what I did but I’m still confused with myself about it. I’m indifferent I guess, but I’m still thinking about it a lot. Thankfully, I haven’t thought of suicide or self harm. I’ve never experienced those feelings 

For the past couple days my cycle has been watch a YouTube video (and forget about my feelings for a moment), have those feelings come back to me, write about it, cry, post what I wrote, cry some more, and then repeat. Like I said, I don’t have the energy to cry anymore, so it’s more like write, stare at the ceiling, write some more, stare at the ceiling, etc. I hate it. I want to feel something again

I can’t focus on things is used to enjoy. Like, for example, music has been my escape for years. Listening to it has helped me, but I still don’t feel the same as when I would have listened a week ago. I have my favorite bands and love watching interviews and reading articles about them, but now, I couldn’t care less. Any of them could release an album tomorrow and I wouldn’t care. I love playing guitar too, but I’ve had no interest for the last couple days. I recently (about 3 weeks ago) found my Xbox that I haven’t played in years in the basement. So, bought a couple new games and started playing. I was really enjoying that, but not anymore. I haven’t talked to any of my friends since Saturday, but I don’t have a desire to. I feel sick.

I think it’s a combo of a lot of things: coronavirus, online schoolwork piling up, just being a hormonal teenager, being ill, and being on my period. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety by my doctor but have never seen a therapist about it. I may have more, but that’s all that I know of. I’m a nearly 15 year old girl who’s stuck between childhood and adulthood (one of the things I’m struggling with), and I don’t know how to feel. I feel like I know myself, but at the same time, I really don’t...? It’s hard to explain I guess. I feel like a different person from who I was even a week ago, and I want to go back to her. Maybe I didn’t feel 100% before, but I just want to go back. I don’t know what to do. How do I overcome this? How long will it take? Am I going to feel like this forever? What’s wrong with me? Is this normal? Please help, I’m desperate",14May2020,1

6,"Now that I think about it more clearly, I've always (or most of the time) thought about only myself. I rarely think about others, and EVEN if I do, it's for my benefit somehow. Whether it's about what I did wrong, or if someone else did wrong, I feel sorry for myself. I think: ""I hate my life"" or, "" I wish I had better people around me"". Funny thing is, I'm the one who should be better. What's worse is that I KNOW that I have my faults and wrongdoing. And I still give in to my ego that tells me, ""You know you're not a bad person, they are. Just forgive them."". HELL, AM I A GOD OR SOMETHING? NO! I wonder how I can end this. My selfish image of myself. Are there people like me? When I do a mistake, I hurt otgers more than myself. For instance: Dad told me to buy some paint. I bought the wrong one. Since I was raised to be scared by him (even though he's changed). My instinct is to LIE. Is that right? Then when he finds out about it, I think he gets outraged. But no, he doesn't. Instead, I DO. Out of fear. Thinking to myself some dark thoughts: ""He's always a manipulative person, he's a cruel person, he's a bad person, he's mistreated me back then, I HATE YOU NOW, GO AWAY"".. See? I'm a bad guy? And I'm sorry. It's not fair for me to tell people's mistakes if they ACTUALLY TRY TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO CHANGE, And if they know they are are wrong. I'm so selfish. I just want to say I am sorry, but I can't. Not because I don't want to but because I'm scared. I just wanna change, but turns out saying it is a lot easier than actually doing it. I need help.",14May2020,1
7,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. I wish there was a decently popular subreddit called ""insecure"" but I couldn't find one.

Latest memory was maybe around 9 yo. I remember I looking at my face and hating it. I saw to girls whispering to each other and I assumed they were pointing out my insecurities. 

It sucks how people that look like me are never represented in any major movie industry and it sucks that even in my culture I'm considered ugly. 

I think about my appearance all day. I stand in front of the mirror often. I hate what I see and I've hated my body since forever. I have social anxiety and part of it is fear that people will see me. 

I have this strong feeling that no matter how much I try, I'll never be enough. Cheating happens so often. I don't like anything about my body. I'm weak in every way. I was just not meant for life. I don't believe it. I've never felt love and I've never seen it. 

Now I've never had friends irl for years. I don't see why anyone would be to be fair. I don't want to accept my body because I can't, I want to die.",14May2020,1

I’m a nice person— I’m a good friend, a good listener, empathetic— but it’s like all that goes out the window when I’m on reddit. Someone trolls or goes off on an offensive point— I’ll argue with them and argue until they say something that just boils my blood, and I’ll think ‘what’s the most hurtful thing I can say to this person’. I would NEVER do that in person. Reddit is making me mad all the time. I think I need a break. Sigh. So many negative emotions is exhausting.",14May2020,1
10,"I’d been able to do admin assistant work from home since the lockdowns happened. I was under the impression that where I work (a college), the campus would be closed down for at LEAST the summer. This morning, I got an email that gave the employees at said college some “good news” about the college’s plans to open back up in phases. 

I understand that they may be forced to open back up, but do the people (us) have any option on what to do other than just go back? From who I’ve talked to, we know it’s too soon, and the announcement to open in stages seems to come out of left field. But, I’m worried we won’t have a choice, and that we’ll end up involuntarily being at a larger risk of catching covid. 

I’m sorry if this is a dumb question. I know there are plenty of people who have had to continue working in these conditions anyway, so I worry I sound like a total wuss. 

If context helps, I think that the classes at this college would still be primarily online, so it’s another reason I don’t feel we should have to go back so soon.",14May2020,1

14,"A long time ago, when i was in as a senior in high school something pretty weird happened. I (male)was in class normally standing and as the teacher (male) was passing by his hand slightly brushed my butt he didnt seem to realise it (most people would just assume it was mistake and probably not even realise but i was extremely insecure and untrustful of others to the point where i would take everything seriously. I was pretty weirded out but assumed it was just a mistake as it has happened to me on a few occasions where i'm passing by and my hand accidentally touches someone's butt it. After that, I never thought about it or anything it didnt bother me. I just totally forgot about it. I was at the school for 3 months and never had any problems with this teacher he was eccentric but seemed fine and caring. Shortly after this ( weeks to a month ish) I started having serious sexual problems. I should mention that i had many serious mental health issues and a rough upbringing wich could easily be the cause. I just started thinking about this today as i had totally forgot about this incident. Do you thing the sexual problem is related to that incident ? any advice

Edit: I do have severe anxiety and have thought about a million different things so this might seem like overthinking or down right stupidness",14May2020,1
15,"Ok so I feel guilty every time I do something that might moderately upset someone, even if I’m not doing anything “wrong”. 

For example, a few weeks ago some of my friends and I got into a fight. I felt like I was being disrespected, so I stood up for myself. They were like “ok yes you’re right we’re sorry” and then \~two hours later I felt really bad about it, and was suddenly overcome with worry that they were going to decide that I’m too overdramatic/high maintenance/ whatever and not want to be my friend anymore. Even though they apologized and told me they thought I was right.  

ANY TIME I get into a fight with my parents, I feel guilty afterwards. I’m constantly worried about getting in trouble when I tweet about politics, even though my twitter cannot be traced back to me and my political opinions aren’t really a secret. 

I’m a pretty confident person and I have a bunch of “healthy habits” (work out daily, usually get at least 8 hours of sleep, make good grades), but ANY TIME I make a mistake with my habits (sleep for five hours, eat too much chocolate), I feel really guilty. 

Almost a year ago, I had a huge (but necessary) falling out with some friends. IMO, I didn’t do anything wrong and it was honestly just the “course of nature”/time for the friendship to end. I’ve even spoken about it with other friends and my parents, and they have told me that I really didn’t do anything wrong. Sometimes, however, I feel really guilty about the situation. Nothing specific, just guilty. 

Sometimes I’ll think about random things that I’ve done in the past and just be overcome with guilt even though they were literally all normal teenage things to do. The guilt often makes me sick to my stomach. 

I’ve never really broken any rules either and ugh I just don’t know what to do. How can I deal with this?? Any ideas as to what is causing this?? 

TL;DR: I constantly feel guilty even though I really shouldn’t. How do I deal and what could be causing this?",14May2020,1

19,"Alright so I'm in college but I'm living at home right now because of coronavirus. Let me preface this by I'm generally relatively helpful and most definitely not what one would consider a problem child. I do my work, do well in school, help out here and there, stuff like that. 

But like, ok bro, shit like this has been a consistent occurrence and I am going to lose it. Today my mom went shopping and asked me to wash all the vegetables because of like coronavirus stuff. So I wash all the vegetables and leave them in the dish drainer to dry, and then also clean all the solid surfaces of the cereals and such so that we don't need to quarantine them for like 3 days and then go downstairs. And this takes well over an hour and a half because your bitch is thorough and there's a lot of food. So I'm downstairs and my mom comes down and first yells about how the downstairs kitchen isn't clean (but it is as clean as it realistically should be, given my brother and I live down there and use the kitchen daily) and how I can only put dishes in one half of the sink now (did I lose my sink privileges??), then she leaves for a bit. Like 5 min later she comes down again and starts fucking screaming at me how I'm ruining food and how if this is what I'm gonna do then I should be the one to go shopping and spending money on good food, so we go upstairs and it's all because the dish drainer is in the sun and I didn't open a bag with oranges in it. And she was fucking screaming at me dude. And then when I get upset that she's being so rude she's like well I'll admit that I'm wrong if you own up to your part in it. And I say wtf do you mean I was trying to be helpful, like I even cleaned all the other foods so they could be eaten sooner, and to that she goes off about how I just did that for myself because she didnt ask for it so that doesn't mean shit. What the fuck am I supposed to do here, this is so frustrating. I was just trying to be helpful and I'm done being treated like I'm a bad kid because I mess up one damn thing or don't spend all my time working like she does.",14May2020,1
20,"  

I'm so tired of this shy personality. I've tried so hard to overcome it over the past couple years and while now I can normally handle everyday conversations with strangers, today it's just gotten to be too much. 

People take my shyness as me being ""arrogant"". As someone whose self-esteem is nonexistent, I can assure you that is not the case. I tried to find ways to make myself feel confident, which I did through finding clothes that make me look good, learning how to do my makeup, spreading my legs for whoever asks. Healthy? No, of course not. I know that. But what else was I supposed to do when people wouldn’t give me attention otherwise? Now people just think I'm some dumb bimbo who doesn’t have two brain cells to rub together and who doesn't deserve any respect. 

I've been bullied my entire life. Bullied by my ""best friend"" in elementary school who routinely got the rest of the girls in the class to circle me and make fun of me. I got spit on in high school. Abusive boyfriend in college. Why do I always attract these people into my life? It’s not like I’m asking for it. 

I never do anything to hurt other people. I’m a year away from being a doctor for Christ’s sake. I just want to help people. I like being nice. But me being soft spoken and nice is taken advantage of so much. Especially in the field of medicine. Attendings call me stupid and treat me like I’m worthless. Nurses tear me apart because they assume I’m acting superior to them. Fellow med students throw me under the bus and make me look stupid. 

Of course, I can’t stick up for myself because in this environment if you stick up for yourself people will just call you a “gunner” and you look like “one of those” med students who’s arrogant and self-centered and once you have that label you can never outrun it. 

I really hate myself. I hate everything about me. I hate that I never have the right answer, that every time I’m in a social encounter with my peers I just do stupid things and end up feeling embarrassed, that I’m shy, that I’m boring. There is literally nothing redeeming about myself other than the fact that I know my intentions are good hearted and I don’t seek to hurt anyone. But what good is that if people constantly take advantage of you and treat you like you don’t matter? I’m so sick of everything.",14May2020,1

This year my mom wanted to start watching with us which is nice but I made it known that there is my spot so I sat there every episode during the season. Then it was the finale tonight and my mom decided she wanted to sit there and it was 'her turn' even though I am the one who sits there. She also decided to sit there while I was making popcorn for all of us to eat so she kinda slid in. 


I joked about how it was my spot and how I have sat there every time and she joked back how she took it and it was hers now. So I let her have the spot and then during a break I expressed how I was frustrated because it was a tradition that I sat there and she stole my spot and she could have it but next time to respect the traditions.

35,"I've always known retirement homes in the U.S are shitty. Especially the private homes. But during this pandemic I'm hearing how these old folks are dying and the for profit homes are trying to get out of this... I am terrified of being old and someday going to these people. I have no wishes to live to that age if those demons will be the ones taking care of me. 

Last year my grandfather died due to neglect in a retirement home in Guatemala. To be precise he died a good few hours before my birthday. I wish death on all those responsible and thankfully I sort of got my wish a few months after we buried him. But considering what I saw... I wouldn't put my mother or father in one. Sure I may have joked about it for years and years but I'm gonna take care of my mother when she gets of that age. My father on the other hand doesn't want to live to see the day he can't wipe his own ass and specifically told me he wants me to kill him when that time comes. I understand why as he had to deal with my grandma dying when I was in middle school. But I'm conflicted on that ya know? I want to carry out his wishes but the legal matter of it is insane. I hope someday the U.S let's us die by euthanasia so my dad can have his wish and I can avoid any legal problems if I get found out if I decide to carry that out. If my mother wants to do the same as my dad then u pray euthanasia will be legal here some day. Or if I have the money I'll fly them somewhere legal and do it there if I'm allowed to.

Seriously why is that illegal in most countries? Why should we let the old suffer in their failing bodies if they want death? If they are of sound mind I say let them have that final wish so they can pass on peacefully instead of living the remaining days in agony and confusion. Me personally if given the chance I'd like to die saving someone... But for me to live out my days in a home full of evil people... Kill me now instead. I'm almost 30 for christ's sake and I'm having a terrible go at this life but if I know horrible nursing homes are in my future... No... no no no no!

I'm thinking about moving to Dallas from where I am (maryland), because any small income I make online won't be taxed in Texas and I feel like I have exponential growth there.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are foreign and are talking about marriage and its freaking me out. Like, are my parents scared I'll never find a girl? My dad said that they aren't trying to pressure me its just other people in our culture have gotten married this young so its not weird. But It freaks me out tbh

I have ADHD which doesn't define me but also in a way describes part of me

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just scared that even If I save money and make the move, I'm going to end up failing. I don't even know what I want yall to say to me or what this post is",14May2020,1

Okay so I’ve tried googling this so many times but there never seems to be an explanation for this. Or even anything similar. For as long as I can remember, since I was a kid(I’m now almost 20) I’ve gotten this feeling that’s hard to describe. It sneaks up on me and can last a couple seconds or a few minutes depending on how well I can suppress it. I’ll try my best to describe it. It’s a combination of disgust, shame and guilt but to the max. I feel sick and I don’t want anyone to look at me. I just want to curl up into a ball and hide. It’s hard to breathe almost like I’m going to have a panic attack but it isn’t that. It’s genuinely the worst feeling and I have no way to accurately put in to words how horrible it is. I have no idea what it is and I’m hoping this sounds familiar to someone so I know I’m not insane. I have no clue what this is and I don’t know why this happens, does anyone else??",14May2020,1
42,"Hey there guys,

I was talking with a friend of mine and she said that not crying for a long time is a problem. 

To give a little context, I haven't cried in about 8-9 years. The last time I cried was when I was so frustrated from humiliation that I cried. I haven't cried like that since. Crying is also connected to my anger so if I don't get angry I don't cry. I haven't been very close to anyone before to speak about my emotions or to express them yet. I've always been taught that if I have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all.

I'm not sure how I can get emotionally connected with myself and others again. If anyone has any knowledge they can spare on this issue, it would help me a lot.

45,"Hi! My name is Lexi... I know I’m not a parent, but I want to reach out to some people that may be understanding because I am a human who genuinely needs help. I am 17 years old, almost 18. I live with my dad who is a single father raising me by himself since I was two years old. My mom is completely out of the picture and doesn’t help support me at all. My dad and I are on our own. I started working at 15 years old to help support my dad because we have struggled for as long as I can remember. Two days before my 17th birthday we got evicted from our apartment. For six months we were homeless moving in and out of peoples houses no one really wanted to help us including our own family. Last weekend we finally were able to move into a one bedroom apartment in a more dangerous area of our state. With covid I lost my job and I was no longer able to help my dad for almost two months, I just started a new job a few days ago. I am thrilled to be back working. but the only issue is my job is 20 minutes away from where we live and I have to take three different buses in order to get to my job. I am only 17 I am very small only 5 feet even and I am scared to be by myself at night on the bus because I am not in a safe area. I have been trying to save for a car since I first started working, but since I am constantly having to help pay for bills and rent I am being set back. I am asking for a little bit of support, if 2900 people send me 1$ I will be able to get a car. I am usually not one to ask people for money, but I genuinely need help. If you want to reach out and send me help private message me and I can give you my venmo or cash app. Even if you don’t help me financially I would love a prayer or some advice. These last few years have been tough for me and I would love and appreciate anyone who reaches out! Thank you for your time reading this💗",14May2020,1
46,"hello,

I posted this on askforadvice, but it was removed there for reasons beyond my understanding. If I need to change something for this subreddit about my Post, please tell me and don't just lock the thread.

i have schizoaffective disorder and an avoidant personality disorder. I don't really know what to do anymore and thought maybe someone here can give me advice. I've always been the quiet one as long as I remember. I am always afraid of other people. I am still not sure if I am really afraid of other peoples negative judgement or if it something else and i maybe am just not compatible with people.

I also had manic phases, but even then I was kinda afraid. I was talking very loud and had lost of self-esteem etc, but even then I did not go out, when school was over. This leads me to believe, that my character is just flawed and even if my chronic depression was cured, I would still not be content with myself.

I've tried accepting, that I just can't connect to people, because I don't know what to say and am always kind of inhibited.

I don't know what do anymore. My job is boring, but I don't think I am capable of anything else than I do now (Customer service basically, but without any direct contact to customers). I live for two years in this city where I work and I have literally zero friends here. What I do after work is lay in bed the rest of the day and just watch some youtube. I think I have degenerated mentally over time. I can't really learn anything much nor have any drive to do so.

I've had three long-term talking therapies, tried 15+ different medications and was in a mental hospital three times. Nothing really helped me. I am from Germany. Now my main question besides venting is, is there anything more I can do? I read about ketamine treatment, but I don't know if my psych would prescribe it to me since i've also had psychosis an mania. I've already had CBASP in a hospital, but it didn't do much in the long run. There's ect, it could maybe make the depression better, but there's still the problem with my bad character flaws., which I can't seem to fix nor accept. There's deep-brain implants, but I don't know if I am maybe too young for that, I am around 30. And then there's the easy way out ofc, which I do think about all the time, but I will not do it, though if I am not better in ~ the next ten years I will.

Maybe someone of you has an idea for me.

I think, that a good psychotherapy May be better to adressing the root cause than medication/ect, what do you think?

Other people often say, when they were able to live their lives again form the beginning, they would do things very differently. I've often thought about this and I always get the feeling, that no matter how often I could re-live my life, with this character flaw, that I have, I would always end up in the same hole I am in right now.

It's been around 2 months since they ordered the suspension of classes. Ever since our government recognized the gravity of the pandemic, almost all establishments around town have been temporarily closed, all activities that used to require social gatherings are now conducted online, and I haven't left the neighborhood ever since because of social distancing protocols. A lot more has happened these past few months, and its been very devastating. At first, it took me a while to process everything and figure out what's going to happen next in the coming days. Now here I am, struggling to finish online classes, and keeping myself occupied every time I find myself idle.

I've finally decided to go back to writing again because I wanted to improve my speech. I realized that all great speakers have one thing in common. They all read and write a lot. It seems that these two things really do contribute a lot to being articulate, so I decided to be consistent with my writing this time. The last time I posted here was around 6 months ago, and unfortunately, I think my skill in writing has deteriorated, seeing that it takes me longer now to think of what words to write next, and that I'm unable to establish a good flow to my sentences. Nonetheless, I wish to change that, and ultimately improve my communication skills through writing first.  I guess the challenge here would be staying committed to this goal.",14May2020,1

64,"Before anything, I just want to say, no, I’m NOT suicidal in any way. 

I just got done looking at pictures from a year ago, before I started going to the gym, while I was going to the gym, and after I got lazy and stopped going to the gym. It was just a moment of self reflection. How the fuck did I allow myself to get this fucking big? How did I allow my fucking gut to start hanging over my pants. This was all a year ago. How have I not only allowed myself to stay like this, but also I’ve not had the willpower to stop going to the kitchen at 3:00 am and eating everything I can fucking get my grubby hands on. It’s like a part of my mind has just accepted that I’m a fucking pig. Anyway, here I am at 5:30 in the morning just like every night laying in bed wishing. Wishing all this weight could go away. Wishing I could go to the gym. But nope. And that’s the worst part. I’m going to wake up later on today (probably at 4:00 PM) and just sit my lazy fat ass at home playing GTA for several hours and then go to bed again at 5:00 am. I just wish I could go to the gym and try again. I wish I could end this post on something uplifting like “I know what I gotta do now!”, but I’ve said that so many times, and that was all while the gyms were open. My words of self encouragement have lost their luster because during the day, I never act on them. It’s only at night, that I self reflect like this. Does what I’m saying make any sense? I’m just rambling. Anyway, I’m sick of fucking COVID, and I just want to get back to the gym and use an elliptical  machine for hours on end and improve my body. Also my self worth, because Incase you cant tell, that’s pretty fucking low too. I don’t have a driver’s license and I’m a fucking coward when driving. I’ve not had a girlfriend since KINDERGARTEN (I’m 21 now…), and as previously stated, I’m a fatass. I guess I just feel worthless. But I want to improve. Again, no thoughts of self harm. Because to me, that’s just accepting defeat, and if there’s one thing I won’t do, its that. 

Anyway, I guess I’m posting this for help or encouragement. Please send it my way. Tell me your stories, let me know how you’re doing things without a gym to go to, just tell me how you overcame eating disorders. Anything that you think will help me. Thank you for reading this :)",14May2020,1
66,"**NOTE:** This post is very introspective and talks a lot about my personal experience. It was originally posted to r/CasualConversation, but didn't quite fit there.

I  grew up under simple and poor circumstances. It wasn’t a problem, I was  happy. But I knew that we were different. I wore second-hand clothes, I  could not have fast food. There was always a sense that something was  missing. I didn’t have a fancy computer, I didn’t have what others had, I  didn’t have a father.

School was  easy for me. I made it through with pretty good grades, even though I  didn’t really try. My mother knew I shouldn’t let it go to waste. She  was always pretty insistent that I should graduate from high school,  everything else was up to me. I was a little annoyed, but I didn’t know  what else to do, so I did what she asked me to do. I’m glad I did and  thankful for the way she cared for me.

Then  I started university, and for the first time I did not want to learn  anything. There were only two possibilities for me, and only one of them  made money. Thanks to living in a country with free education, I didn’t  even have to work. So of course I failed, and pretty hard at that. And  suddenly, I wasn’t exceptional anymore, I was average. It took me almost  two years to have fun learning again, too regain my footing.

After  three and a half years I wrote my bachelor’s thesis. It was nice, I had  worked hard, I was proud of myself, and I decided that even though most  of my grades weren’t that good, that this would be different, this  would be my A+. But when I actually got it, I was confused. That’s when  it started, the overwhelming nagging of “What the hell am I doing  here?”. I did not know where to go, I did not feel ready to go out into  the real world. Everyone out there was a lot smarter and experienced  than me. The worst kind of imposter syndrome. So I did the only thing  that made sense to me, and kept on studying.

When  I started my degree there were around 300 people who did the same. A  lot of people wanting to study computer science, a lot of boys wanting  to make their own video games. But there were none. Slowly, but surely  they dropped out, and only those of us that were really into it  remained. Probably 30 people or less. 29 really smart and competent  students, and me. There I was, keeping on keeping on, having fun, but  feeling like I would never be ready to work for someone, to be worth the  average salary a normal programmer gets.

The  funny thing is, I was already working. Small jobs for the university,  with small compensation. But I worked alone most of the time, so I  brushed it off as the wrong kind of experience. Then finally came the  time to write my master’s thesis, and the nagging came back. How would I  be able to finish this, write this many pages, become an adult, pay  taxes? How foolish of me to ever start this nonsense. But I kept going,  because I didn’t know what else to do. That’s when a series of fortunate  events started.

I went back to  the faculty I already worked with on my bachelor’s thesis, and asked  them about possible projects. There was a very interesting idea, and  again I wanted to do my absolute best. I conceptualized, researched and  created productivity systems for myself. After around 37 pages written,  and one content supervisor, at the beginning of 2020 they told me that  they really liked my project, and asked if I would consider working for  them after finishing my thesis. “Me?” I thought, “what did I do?”

So  this is where we are today. I filled out all forms and am set to start  my career as a scientific assistant in June. In two days, my application  will be presented at an international science conference. I am  incredibly thankful and very much overwhelmed. Now I am even considering  getting a PHD in this field. Yet, I still don’t feel ready. Sometimes I  think I will never be. But after thinking about my whole life and who I  want to be, I have realized something: This isn’t just imposter  syndrome, this is something deeper.

I  remember how I grew up, and somehow I feel guilty I made it here. I  feel like I don’t belong. Growing up poor, growing up simple, with no  education about manners or how to properly wear a suit, here I am,  suddenly part of the “elite”. Going to places with people in fancy  suits. Making more money my mother ever made in her whole life in a few  years. In a way, I feel like this wasn’t meant to happen, that I should  have stayed simple, that I should have stayed poor, that I don’t deserve  this. Because parts of it were easy for me, because I was lucky,  because of the hard work of others.

I  deserve to be happy. I deserve to talk confidently about my  achievements. But most of the time I don’t. It feels like bragging, like  being an asshole to others that started out like me and went on other  paths. I wear new clothes, I eat as much fast food as I want, I have a  fancy computer. It feels like I am turning into a person I would have  disliked growing up. But I am so, so done with this thinking. I want the  nagging to stop. There is a thing I must do, and I am very scared to  admit it. But I can no longer deny it. So here it goes:

Hi, I’m cheapmon, and I am good at this. I am actually pretty good at this.",14May2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I had a real connection with her, but it turns out I was wrong (as you can see in the title). For more than a year, my life had been really tough, both mentally and emotionally until she appeared. I considered her as a light in the darkness in a way, so I made sure I was able to keep in touch often. She was one of my new classmates last semester. After discovering we had some friends in common, we eventually got really close and confessed our feelings a few months after. That's how our relationship came about. Although we weren't really official, I took our mutual understanding seriously just like in any other relationship whether it be family, friends or any other loved one. 

About a week ago, she told me out of the blue that she won't be able to reply that much to me anymore. She even showed me screenshots of convos of her saying the same thing to her other friends for proof. I believed her and told her that ""I understand"" and that she didn't have to worry about me. 

Fast forward to yesterday, we haven't talked for a week and I assumed that she was just busy with school work, but I finally decided to talk to her about it to make sure she was okay. 

It turns out that she didn't want to talk to me anymore. Apparently, I've said some things she didn't like (which she also doesn't want to tell me), and she said that we were just too different for each other that's why she ghosted me. She said ""ayoko na"" which in english translates to ""I don't want this anymore"". Hearing this broke my heart to pieces, but I did my best to handle it rationally. The whole conversation sounded like she just wanted to get rid of me and that just hurt me a lot.  Though, what hurt me the most was that I was made fun of in front of her other friends during a school video call prior to when she dumped me, but I'll spare the details. 

I cried a lot for a while, but I feel much better now especially after talking to one of my closest friends Emilio. I've been trying to not think about what happened, but I can't seem to get it out of my head. I hope I'll be able to move on in the coming days.",14May2020,1

onto bigger life goals. i hope i can get a job set in place within a few months after graduation. hopefully $50k min a year? if we’re together i think it’d be nice to move into an apartment of our own at that point. then i’d like to save for a 3 bedroom house- one master bedroom for us to share, and then the other two can be our own personal rooms :). it’d be cool to get a dog or two! hopefully by then i can get the surgeries i’d like/need, or be planning for it. also hope i don’t have to leave the country, but then again if it’s financially cheaper or gives me better protections as a trans person.. who knows. i’m becoming more and more open to it, scary as it is to abandon all i know..

And this is a really big AND...I got pre-approved for a mortgage and put an offer in on a house in a town I've been trying to move to since I was 18

The house needs a lot of work but I plan on doing as much as I can to it that's within my limits. It's in a nice little town about a mile from the beach. I'm so excited and nervous I feel my stomach cramping up but it's all good things! My grandma would have loved this house. She actually taught me how to fish and crab right down the street from where this house is!

78,"I (29m) have a group of friends that I consider best buds, one them is a nephew of my friend. He is 7 years younger and he is in his tough guy phase, always acting tough, but in fact he is a lil bitch. I disliked him since i met the guy but because he is the nephew and one my best bud they consider him a good guy. I try to give him a chance. But its been a couple years now and there are moments that I think its okay, when were alone together we dont share a connection. It feels dull. Only when were all together we have a connection.

But somehow i despise the guy. Always think he's tough and when you ask him something he reacts with fuckin attitude. My friend is a producer and when he makes music  he makes songs is about drugs, cars and guns. But in fact the guy doesnt even have a gun or sell drugs or whatever. So to me he seems really fake. But I let him. He's young and who am I to put him in his place. But everytime im around him i just hate the guy. Something in me starts to boil and cant act rational. He knows that I somehow dont like him. I really want to say it to his face, probaly starting a fight. I woke up this morning feeling even more hatred because I was asking him something and the mfer ignored me. I said ""aight you tough guy right, cool"".

I just want to ignore the guy and dont even hang out with him. But bcuz he's the nephew of one my best friend and lives with him, he is always around.

I went for a walk today and my mind keep telling how much I dislike the guy. But I dont want to sit and wander in negative feelings. So i decide to forgive him. He is just stupid and wants to act tough but he really isnt.",14May2020,2
79,"Hello everybody! I've been lurking here for a long time but it's my first time to post.

I'm kinda new to Reddit and I don't know if this is the most suitable subreddit for my post, if there're any subbreddits that would be better I'd like you to recommend it to me.

Sorry if it's too long but I'm trying to give you the important details so you can help me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the situation:

Like the title says, I (22F) am lost and don't know what path to choose in my life or how to decide what is best to do?

I have always wanted to be an architect, I believed it's what I want to do in my life so I can affect people's lives and improve it.

*Background info:*

* In my country to be an architect you either join the faculty of engineering where you study one general year and then you choose the architecture department and you study another 4 years in it, or you join the faculty of fine arts and choose the architecture department immediately and you study the 4 years only.
* Students work in companies unless they graduated, a low chance of being freelancer as a student.
* Most of us students live with our parents and they are the ones who pay the study fees and everything.

I worked hard in high school to be qualified to the faculty of engineering and I got it. In my first year (the general year) it was so hard for me to fit in with the new system (*especially with a severe depression*)  and the courses weren't what I thought it'd be. That's what made me fail most of the courses (*which none of them has anything to do with architecture*) but then when I got majored in the architecture and urban planning department I never failed any of its courses and I'm doing good at it.

Now my colleagues are graduating next year (two semesters left for them) but I'd have to stay three more semesters (5 semesters in conclusion) due to what happened in the general year.

The problem here is I'm not the most creative or the one with the highest grades in university, and **I've been worrying that maybe architecture isn't my thing?** Although I'm the best in interior design and hosing and I'm still so excited to work in these majors (*my department qualifies the students to exterior design, interior design, urban planning, housing and real estate, working details and shop drawing*).

And there have been a while where I really wanted to study **furniture and product design**, but it's not available here where I live, and I would have to rejoin faculty of fine arts to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

But I also am into graphic Design, brand identity designing and packaging designing so much and I have participated in contests and won the best branding design.

I work by piece sometimes and people say I'm great at this and a creative person and they like my designs most of the times.**That makes me think maybe I should be a graphic designer?**

&amp;#x200B;

I also like illustration (digital and non digital) and I'm getting good at digital illustration, people like my work in this too and I've been thinking **maybe I should improve in digital illustration and make my own business taking commissions or designing posters, characters and stickers?**

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so lost and don't know how to decide which one to choose  that I can stick to it and improve myself in it and get better so I can be the best in what I do or if there's a way I can balance between all of this in the same time (*is this even possible?*)

And I need to start working on myself from now so I can get a real job (*I can't wait until I graduate)* because I need to work and to do something in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it this far and read all this thank you so much, and so sorry for grammar mistakes as English isn't my first language.

80,"I'm a 25 year old male, for reference. 

Since I was 13 I've been addicted to shooting methamphetamine. A year ago today I was in the depths of psychosis, tearing through all of mine and my wifes belongings, looking for her ""super-secret-stash"". This was a daily occurrence. She stopped using months prior due to watching me spiral into insanity. I was so goddamn insecure, and unsure of everything around me. I wasnt even sure of what was reality, and what was delusions. 

Today, we have a four month old little goober who will never see daddy high, a place of our own, and a chance at life. And even though most days I still struggle with paranoid delusions, I'm actively trying to better myself instead of playing the victim. 

And that makes me really fucking happy.",14May2020,45
81,"I (16F) live in Portugal and our government as decided that next week high school students will go back to school with some limitations. My grade will only have 4 subjects taught in school and we will only go there 3 half-days per week.

Aside from the mandatory use of masks and frequent sterilizations, there are some other safety norms and that's where my problem comes to play. To allow students to sit further apart, the classes were split in half. This is a good idea, I'm not contesting that. My issue is the people that are in my half of the class and the people that aren't.

Pretty much all my friends are in the other half and the people that I don't like are in my half. The reason I don't like them is fairly simple: they are always talking shit behind people's backs and then pretending to be their friends. It's very pleasant to hear people say mean things about your friends and, since I'm not very popular or people-skilled I feel like I can't do anything about it. Also, I have nothing in common with them, we are completely different. Recesses also have to be spent in the classrooms so I can't even talk to my friends then.

A lot of people hate lockdown because they can't hang out with their friends but the thing for me is that now I can't hang out with my friends even if I do go back to school.

I am completely aware that my problem is so small compared to the greater context of the pandemic but I needed to vent.

87,"Very happy it finally came to pass. I could have gotten reinstated in 2000, but I found I liked living without the expense and hassle of having a car. I went back to university two years ago and was gifted a car for graduation. Excited and a little fearful of getting back on the road again. I'll need a car to look for a job. My previous job was very walkable, but since the old good boss retired they replaced him with a micromanaging prick (I was lead of department) and he got in my way too much.

The old boss left me alone with my crew as long as my numbers were good. This micromanaging thing made me feel like an infant, esp since I knew much more about the process than the new boss.

Kept in touch with some of my former co-workers, evidently their revenue since new boss came is about 50% of what it was when good boss was there. It was a multi-million dollar business. 

So I finished my degree in a semi-unrelated field and I'll have to drive around to find work. But this goal is part of my overall goal to have a great ""rest of my life"". 

I'll admit I wasn't a very good driver back then and lost my license for points. Since then I've aged and matured; I'm trying, oh boy am I trying, to be the best driver I can be and follow the rules of the road.",14May2020,1

89,"Not getting into the PHD program at ULM has been the most significant perceived rejection I have experienced on the journey as an Marriage and Family Therapist. I remember being very excited and telling everyone that I had applied, but I didn't really tell anyone that I didn't get in. How could I? I didn't even know how to feel about it. With all the conversation about race, I have found myself again asking, was it racial? And I have always felt such immense shame and guilt for asking and wanting an answer to that question. I mean my training as a family therapist tells me that believing ""it was racial"" is only one set of infinite possibilities, for example, they could have just thought I was a bad candidate. Lol, the thing is there is no way for me to know why I didn't get in and I am tired of letting that define me. Because I didnt get into the PHD program I now have a wealth of actual therapy experience, stories that I would otherwise not have.

92,"I‘ve had a friends with benefits situation for a long time now. I personally have no interest in any kind serious relationship. I got out of a terribly toxic relationship a long long time ago and since have realized not only am I young (26F) but I need to learn to take care of and love myself more. Because if I do that I’ll be able to better communicate and care for the people around me. That’s why my friend with benefits is perfect, and we actually get along well and have fun together.

Recently he’s needed to crash while his apartment is being redone. We’ve hung out, chilled, had great sex one night. Even during these times, being two ppl who live on their own and self isolated till he’s had to come over, we knew it would be safe. Except last night he left to go fuck someone else and it doesn’t sit right with me. First off, wtf? It’s a pandemic like we know we’re both safe. But why you gotta go and fuck someone else right now? That’s when I knew I was reading too much into this cause it’s caused my kind to go to “why can’t we just fuck”. Tbh since he’s been here he’s only been on his phone. Like mentally he’s not here, but physically is. And it totally reminded me why I don’t want to be in a relationship because I take things so personally. And then I started spiraling and thinking “what am I gonna tell him when he gets back? I need to express how this is impacting me” that’s when I started realizing my thought was all me me me. And I was once again doing what I always do, I’m making it about myself. I even stopped and asked why do I really feel irked? Is it because he’s not with me? No... it’s because I wasn’t chosen.

I have this terrible competitive nature that seeps into every facet of my life. From when I was in school to my relationships and my work, if I am not chosen then I feel like I’ve lost and I’m the loser. I take it personally, I begin to feel insecure and depressed. And for what? At the end of the day I’ve only wasted my time and energy feeling so negative. At the end of the day, benefits aside, this is a person I see as a friend and I care about their wellbeing. They need a place to stay, and have even provided me with one when I needed one. So for me to expect things like that is just so gross and selfish.

104,"Throughout much of elementary school one of my best friends was this girl, but once middle school came we kind of stopped being friends. This is because the area i lived in had two middle schools. She went to one, and I went to the other. 

In the second semester of 6th grade my family moved from Pennsylvania to Indiana because my dad got a promotion, and while the sudden change was hard I did manage to make new friends that helped get me through middle school relatively ok. I stayed in contact with some of my old friends for a bit but eventually we stopped talking and now we only talk when I’m wishing them happy birthday or vice versa.

Now it’s high school, and while i’m still friends with those friends from middle school, we don’t hang out outside of school, and only really talk if we’re in the same classes or happen to see each other in the halls. Not gonna lie, i’ve been kind of lonely due to my lack of close friends (I only have one). 

Last night i found myself thinking about the girl i mentioned earlier along with my other old friends from Pennsylvania. I got on instagram and searched up her name. I didn’t really expect to find her, at least not easily, but i found her pretty quickly. I know for sure it’s her because i recognize her face, and her bio says she’s going to the same high school that I would’ve gone to if i hadn’t moved.

Finding her threw a storm of nostalgia at me and now I can’t stop thinking about my life in Pennsylvania and how better my life would be if I hadn’t moved, and how I’d still be friends with her and the people I used to play outside with every day. I want to contact her just to say hi, but I don’t even know what to say. I don’t even know if she’ll remember me and worried she’ll think I’m some random creep or something.

And with the way I study, I will graduate with no real knowledge and I will have to leave my parents' house with no skills.

And the longer I procrastinate, the more I realize what kind of loser I am and this gives me depressions, because I see time going by, quicker and quicker (like the movie Click) and I don't know what to do.

My dad and I are on our own. I started working at 15 years old to help support my dad because we have struggled for as long as I can remember. Two days before my 17th birthday we got evicted from our apartment. For six months we were homeless moving in and out of peoples houses no one really wanted to help us including our own family. Last weekend we finally were able to move into a one bedroom apartment in a more dangerous area of our state. With covid I lost my job and I was no longer able to help my dad for almost two months, I just started a new job a few days ago.

I am only 17 I am very small only 5 feet even and I am scared to be by myself at night on the bus because I am not in a safe area.

112,"Hi everybody. 

Sorry for my english in advance (second language).

I just want to share story about my abusive childhood, because I always wanted to tell somebody about it, but I have no one to talk with.

I started noticing that something is wrong when I was 5-6 years old. My parents started fighting with each other. In the beginning I thought it was pretty normal, like a simple argue at school between kids. But every single day it was worse. My father started ignoring my existence, I was talking to him and he was just staring into space, not saying a word to me. 

Beside fighting at daylight, they started fighting at night. When it was bedtime, my father was laying at bed talking to himself just loud enough to don't let anyone sleep. It was like someone was trying to torture you by whispering. One night my mother lost control and she got drunk. I remember how scared I was, when she was laying on the floor near my bed. But It wasn't my worst night.

I don't remember how old I was then, but I was in primary school. So other night my parents fight got a little longer than usual. During this nightmare, my father went to my brother room and said something like ""Your mother want to kill herself"". So we ran to see what is going on. I only remember my mother sitting at the table on which the tablets were scattered and my brother who was throwing pills to trash. I think I started to yell at my father but I can't remind. Actually now I don't remember many things from my childhood.

The biggest fight was when I was 14-15 years old. It was day like always, I was playing games as  usually, games helped me to cut away from real world, usually I was playing all day. So my parents were fighting but this time my father had support in the form of his mother. I was ignoring them, but then I heard my grandma shouting ""Call the police"". So we ran there with my siblings and we saw that my father was trying to kill my mother with knife. He was trying to stab her in the chest, but she and others grabbed his hands, I was trying to drag him away. I was pulling him by the shirt so hard that I thought it will tear apart. And I was scared even more because I thought he will turn back and stab me. But he didn't, he finally dropped knife and went outside. Nobody was harmed. I think then police came up. But I don't remember what happend next. It  wouldn't be the first time when police visited my family. After that incident they got divorced. And my father finally moved out.

Me mother don't care about me either. She is narcissistic and care only about herself. For three years I had two pairs of pants to wear to school, I had another two pairs but they were almost completely destroyed and I weared them only at house. She had a money to buy a new but she didn't want to. Of course for herself she was buying alot of clothes.

Last time she took me to the dentist I was like 6 years old. Now my teeth are complete disaster.

I'm 18 years old and I don't know if there is even a point to live. It will take like 10 years to fix my teeth. And that's only one of the problem. 

I don't have a bond with my siblings, we barely talk. I don't have friends. Something is wrong with me because after some time people just start forgeting about me or they text me only if they want something.

I'm sorry for my chaotic writing.

Have a nice day or night!",14May2020,1

Back in November, I met a girl playing Xbox, she messaged me first because of something I said to a mutual friend. We started talking, first on Twitter, then Snapchat. We talked pretty much everyday for 2 and a half months. We both then wanted to see each other, which was difficult because she lived in England, and I lived in Ireland. One day we both agreed that it would be great if I bought a plane ticket to come visit her, and so I did. She let me stay with her. So I ended up visiting her, she showed me around the City she lived in, we watched a lot of Netflix, etc.

After 4 days, my visit ended, and I think things went well, so I message her telling her how much I enjoyed her stay, she said she enjoyed it too, but she didn't think it would work out and hoped that we could remain friends. I was happy with just being friends, but I said that I might take some time to try and feel better about it, because I was a little hurt with the rejection.

For about 4 weeks, I tried my best to get over her to no avail. I had a really bad time with how I felt, and my friends tried to help, but they didn't really help. I started to feel better in March, and I started properly talking to her again. I thought thing might start to go well again. But I was mistaken, I saw she was flirting with my best-friend, and my heart just sank. I was incredibly hurt when I saw that, especially since my friend told me he wouldn't do anything like that. I guess I felt betrayed. I had a bit of a breakdown, we argued, and she blocked me on every social media platform we talked on.

I felt awful, I don't think I've felt that bad before. I cried a lot, didn't really talk to my friends for a while. After a few weeks of no-contact, she unblocks me and tries to make me feel better about her and my best-friend. But whatever she said didn't really make me feel better. And that's kinda how its been for the past while.

I think I'm just jealous of my friend I guess, I really liked this girl, and it felt like he just kicked me to the side and nestled in. I still want to remain friends with them, but I'm having such a hard time with it since I just feel hurt when I talk to them both. I just hope these feelings end soon.",14May2020,2
120,"My mom pissed me off yesterday and I'm just super angry. Also I kinda don't like my nephew. He's super rude and misbehaving. I know he's just a kid, but he never learns from his rudeness and misbehaving. I'll tell his mom (my sister) an example of how he acted, and she doesn't do anything about it. She just thinks he's the best thing on earth and can do no wrong. He hardly ever even speaks to me when he comes over (and yes, I speak/say hi first). 

Another thing. I'm sure if I had been there for the festivities, I would've been shamed into sticking around longer. Sometimes I just want to be alone. When I don't want to be alone no one has any time for me. In this case I would've watched him eat cake, and open some presents, and left for my room. But I know that would get me looks and I would hear about it later on. Just like I'm going to head about this for so long. ~sigh~",14May2020,1
121,"I'll always be a bit empty. I'll always be a bit resentful about it. I'll always sprinkle some piss on my gift. I'll always live for the spikes. It makes me feel gross.  It hurts.

123,"Today was another fun day at work where i was completely screwed over by people with more seniority than me. I’m going to be passed on promotion again and I work on a team that discourages asking questions. 

On the plus side i ran 3 miles in 24 minutes this morning!",14May2020,3
124,Took me 6 years due to a very bad accident in my 3rd year and having to take part time. But I did it. With Post Concussion Syndrome and everything. I fucking did it. I can’t celebrate yet and my convocation was postponed but ...oh my god I did it. Just a major win for me today!! No matter what keep going - there is no timeline but your own!!,14May2020,3
125,"They wake up to their family helping them - they are ungrateful and unpleasant to them. All pleasantries are worth money and not much to spare.

They ride to their work in a car, annoying everyone with its existence.

They work at advertisement - annoy everyone constantly.

At least their boss likes them.... Right?",14May2020,1
126,It’s so unhealthy but I feel like my worth is somehow tied to how many people pay attention to my posts. It’s so unhealthy— that’s why I hate Instagram— but here when it’s anonymous it feels even more important whether or not people like you. How do you get over yourself and accept that they are pointless internet points?,14May2020,2
127,"I bet the guys at the restaurant were like, wow, I hope this doofus knows what he's doing, ordering all this curry without any of this rice. I bet the delivery guy was like, man, I hope buddy has his rice cooker on just about now for all this curry. Boy, would all you guys be surprised.",14May2020,1
128,"So Ive known my brother is bisexual for a while now, and yes, I am 100% positive (have written proof from his best friend), but he hasn't come out to me yet. I know he will have to one day, maybe soon, maybe not but eventually he will have to. 


How do you react to that? I have no idea and am kinda scared cuz I such a awkward person but I love him and don't wanna make him feel awkward or uncomfortable. :/

129,"I'm a 29 year old male and all I want is a relationship where I feel safe enough to be emotionally true. (currently ill agree with whatever my partner wants as not wanting to upset her) she's not violent at all. I think I'm a people pleaser. I want to be more assertive but also vulnerable.

Anyways.. Rambling and late I just wanna be able to be held while I cry and cry and let out all of this held in feeling..",14May2020,2

132,Shes so beautiful and she looks at me with such unconditional love. I have a hard time reading emotions but I can tell she loves me,14May2020,2
133,"we have enough problems as it is. We don't need fears of whether we're good enough for each other to stand in the way of having people to talk to. We are alll gorgeous, our lame parents were wrong. We deserve love and we all deserve crowns. Please let's stop making ourselves so miserable by chasing after people who don't deserve our time and by believing we don't deserve happiness. Stop worrying about what others think of you.. Go out there and be yourself with no apologies and do what makes you happy and stop worrying about whether people will like you. It's enough. We're good enough damn it! Love yourself!!!",14May2020,2
