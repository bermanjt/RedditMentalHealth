0,I have an Associates in Business Administration and I don't know what job I can get with that. I've been looking for jobs on sites like Indeed and ZipRecruiter but I haven't found anything.

1,"These past few day's have given me a lot of time for self reflection. And i can definitely see, how what i've said in the past, has gotten me where i am today. So, I make this post, if anything to let anyone know, who i've come across, or may come across in the future, that i'm sorry, for any of my actions. I really want to be nice to people, I like seeing others happy. But my social skill set can be a bit, limited, and i can come off kind of mean, and or over excited at times, with the way i word or express things. So for the time being, i hope to work on my social skills, and towards improving them for the future. But till that time comes, listening to others is always nice \^\^

Also, happy early cake day to this community. :)  Hope you all have a good one \^\^",06Feb2020,1
2,"I decided to finally try hypnosis. I'd heard the ads on the radio every 6 months for the past 3 years. I wanted to quit smoking. 

I am a chain smoker, if I don't watch myself, but I try to keep an hour between cigarettes. 

So I went. And it worked. Sort of... I thought I wanted to quit. Part of me must have, else I wouldn't have gone. But I've quickly figured out from this experience that I don't just smoke for the nicotine. I knew i also smoked out of boredom, so I was prepared for that. What I didn't realize was that for the last few years, I had become emotionally dependant on them. Any trial, any joy, anything that requires thinking your way through, all begat a cigarette. 

This morning I didn't know what to do with myself. The hypnosis took away the physical need to smoke. I woke up and didn't need one. But I wanted it. I was a little upset not to have it. So I went to work. By noon, I knew I was screwed. I didn't need them anymore. Physically, I was feeling great. But I kept reaching for the pack that wasn't there. Any time anything happened. Finished the job? Have a smoke... it began to wear on me. When I thought back to waking up, and then thought about eating dinner and going to bed, without the accompanying cigarettes, I started to panic. The reality of waking up every morning and not having one literally had me in tears. So I broke. But not right away. I still had 0 physical withdrawal symptoms. So I told myself, get through the rest of the work day, then you can break.

I'm not proud of having given up so easily. I do plan to try and limit myself on when I can have them. Waking, after meals, before bed. But I am kinda proud of myself for recognizing what the problem is. I know now what I need to work on before the hypnotist comes back to town. And since its guaranteed, I can go back and do it again for free (even if it weren't, I'd still go).

I'm still completely amazed at how well it took care of the physical cravings. I was skeptical, but it works. Now I just have to get myself out of my way.",06Feb2020,1

I posted on twitter to see if maybe my other friends wanted to come but he, once again, had to comment about the bones. I've cooked for him a million times and everything is always good but he won't let me live that one thing down. I think I was just excited and now I feel stupid.

4,"This isn’t meant to be sexist and if it is then so be it. 

I went to lunch with a new colleague for the first time today. She’s about 25 years my senior and talked the whole time about her life and all she’s been through. She went on and on about how she didn’t need help and did everything on her own. She was abandoned by her parents and lived on her own at 14. She raised kids starting at 15. None of their fathers are in the picture and she was of the notion that she didn’t need a them in the picture. One of them was murdered when he was my age. She was very proud of her life and I’m with her there it sounds like something to be very proud of. 

When we went into the Dairy Queen I didn’t hold the door for her because it was a weird angle and I didn’t want to do an awkward shuffle to open it then walk around her to hold it open for her. She noted that and joked something like “you’re supposed to hold the door open for a woman” and “don’t worry I’ll teach you”. When we left I held the 4 different doors open for her because I would have anyways. 

Am I wrong for thinking it’s odd to be so proud of doing everything on your own and basically brag about yourself for 30+ minutes straight and then expect someone to hold the door open for you just because you’re a woman? Like I feel like that sort of mentality would manifest in other aspects of her life that I didn’t get the full picture on because she’s painting it from her perspective, not recognizing it.",06Feb2020,1

6,"I want to preface this by saying Im not suicidal, in any way. For me, life is potentially our one chance to experience the universe. Id never throw it away, just on principle. Plus, my wife is amazing, and I like my hobbies. Work isnt terrible. Im pretty healthy. Turning 30 this year. 

But Im so weary of it all. It feels like I was meant to be born a cloud, but Im a person instead. I love being the observer, unnoticed, unremarkable, and unobtrusive, in an isolated environment. Sitting on a rock in a stream, just experiencing the moment far from anyone else, is pure bliss. 

Socety is exhausting. People are just so emotional all the time, and nobody is ever honest. Like, *really* honest. People get so worked up over things that are so small, and bring them only misery and anxiety. Its not their fault all the time, but still. Human beings are so fucking complicated, and so simple at the same time. They all seem to overcomplicate and oversimplify the world around them simultaneously. Wading through the miasma of social rules and conduct feels like running a marathon in a sewer. And Im a supervisor in my field. My boss had no complaints about me in my last review. Im doing something right, but Jesus its tiring. 

I really wish I was immortal sometimes. No needs aside from the emotional and psychological. I could just be, without relying on anything or anyone else to help me spend more time in this universe.

I don’t have a harder life than anyone else. I have people that care about me, but I’m just empty.

I do the same thing for work that I’ve been doing for years and years and years. I’m not respected or valued there so I feel I have to over extend to ensure I keep it (I don’t believe I can find anything paying the same or I would get out).

When I’m not working, it’s not that I’m super busy with a billion things to do, but I feel extremely obligated (both internally and sometimes externally) to give my time and attention to a few individuals in my life. When I have time from that, I help other people start whatever it is they’re doing (I’m kind of the go to person in my circle).

I have a million things I’ve always wanted to do but don’t because I don’t have time to do so, and definitely don’t have time to practice any new skills... even though I do have time but I don’t (see above with giving time / attention).

I feel like the people I do spend time with (family mainly) don’t realize that I’m doing that to be there in the moment for them, and they don’t really care that I’m there - but they DEFINITELY notice and care when I’m doing something I’d like to dive into.

I feel like a parent of a bunch of kids being pulled into a bunch of directions where they only need my attention once I’m started on something else.

I don’t want to not give them that - I’ve lost so many people in my life that time like that is insanely important to me.. but I don’t know what to do.

Now I'm applying this to everything. I will never watch ""The Mandalorian"" because everyone says it's so great. And it could be but I refuse to watch because of the fan base.

I started to also notice I'm avoiding things I used to enjoy as well. I used to be obsessed with Bojack Horseman.

Well, I shouldn’t say claw my way back into a good place. I was never there in the first place. At least, in my 17 years of living. 

I’m hard of hearing—I can’t hear as well as other people. Its such a little thing, intangible too. I can’t really grasp that it’s there sometimes. But it occupies my mind every single day. I live in a hearing world, surrounded by people I can’t really connect to. 

Noisy halls, classrooms, lounges. I’m 17 and I can’t cope with being hard of hearing at all. People say, oh, it gets better, it really does. 

It doesn’t.

17 years of trying and trying and trying to hear other people and what do I have to show for it? Nothing. 



I might as well tell my life story.



I was diagnosed with hearing loss at around 3 and 1/2 years old. The doctors, funnily enough, thought I was autistic because I continued to yell and scream at my parents and act oddly, but that’s because I couldn’t communicate with me hearing loss. 

I remained angry at the world for a long time. I had anger issues, and was quick to violence. I always felt like I wasn’t enough, and never would be enough socially.

In elementary school, my difficulties with my hearing loss didn’t really present themselves. I couldn’t hear, and I accepted that. It was a simpler time, where I didn’t realize how far behind socially I was. I didn’t notice how different I was. Life was innocent and good.

Then I grew and began to notice how I was different from the others. Conversations would happen in the cafeteria at school, and somebody’d  crack a joke. Everyone would laugh. I would too, even though I didn’t hear the joke in the first place.  I just wanted to belong. 

That’s when the depression began to set in. Would that be the entirety of my life? Laughing at jokes I didn’t hear? Nodding along to conversations I wasn’t really a part of?

Why should I continue to live, if life is always to be like this? I hate myself and I hate my very existence. I’m so tired. I just want to go home. 

The circles around my eyes only darkened. My anxiety around other people only increased, as I was afraid I’d only fuck the conversation up or say something completely unrelated to the topic at hand and look like an idiot.

My resentment only grew and grew into high school. I was sad and angry and pissed at the world because deep down I knew it was nobody’s fault that I couldn’t hear, but I didn’t know who to be mad at. 

I felt lost. 

As I matured, I realized that I couldn’t be angry at the world. It wasn’t their fault. I wasn’t entitled to their affections. My hearing loss was my problem. That was that. 

I tried to get better. Went to therapy multiple times. I’m still nowhere. I keep trying to talk to people and I’m banned, forbidden to talk to them by blunt circumstance. 

A hard of hearing life is one of circumstances. Can I go to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory? No, there’s too many people, and the acoustics suck. Am I gonna speak to that girl I’m crushing on in class? Not today I can’t—in school, you’re really only allowed to talk when everyone else is allowed to talk—it’s too noisy, everyone’s talking. 

I feel so limited. I’m so fucking smart, I know it. I’ve been able to survive for this long, but here I am: still stuck. If it’s gonna be like this for the rest of my life, sometimes I don’t see the point in living.

Sitting at a new table during lunch (in a noisy-ass cafeteria), for example, isn’t an optimal option for me. I can’t hear them, and get to know them better. What am I going to do? Ask a bunch of strangers I don’t know to move to a quieter place for me because I can’t hear them? People aren’t really willing to accommodate people they don’t know, and maybe that’s because it might come off as entitlement, almost forcing a group of people to move, people you don’t even know just so you can hear.

And when I’m in this noisy, raucous cafeteria, I can’t hear. Without sounding arrogant, I’d say I have myself pegged for a good conversationalist in good circumstances. But those “good circumstances” are so rare—all I can manage in the cafeteria during lunch is “yes”, “mhm”, “wow”, or “Heccin neat”. All I can do is act like I’m listening and I can’t engage because I can’t fucking hear.

And I can’t fix it, I can’t fucking fix it because my hearing loss violates so much of what hearing society is built on. 

I’ll be listening to a conversation, it’s noisy, and I’m straining to listen, judging whether or not this conversation is worth the effort of trying to concentrate. And then the hearing will get to talking about something that’s really not worth the effort, like their uncles pet iguana. So I zone out. 

A few minutes later, I hear interesting words. “Oh yeah, they actually pulled on a knife on them.” A million questions I wish I could ask race through my head. Who is it? Where are they? Who did they pull a knife on? And I could ask about this, but the hearing are like the deaf in many ways: 

Train go sorry!

In the Deaf culture, the Deaf don’t like to repeat themselves—it takes physical energy to sign. So when someone doesn’t follow along on the conversation, and asks about details after being distracted, or akin to what I do, zone out, the response is the same: Train go sorry! The conversation wasn’t important to you then, and they’re not going to bother repeating the information you could’ve gotten by paying attention.

The hearing are like this. Usually, they won’t bother to explain things, because you weren’t a part of the conversation. You are not engaged, and are therefore undeserving of the details. But unlike the Deaf culture, where they are much more blunt by telling others train go sorry, the hearing usually dismiss you. The hearing like to leave things unsaid.

So when I ask what’s going on after zoning out, I get no reply. I should have listened. 

I have to worry about so fucking much. The social hierarchy and dynamics, positioning, and the like. At my school, there’s usually too many people for one table—so people make themselves fit and in turn create an outside (ish) delegation of chairs and an inside delegation of chairs: the more popular kids. For instance, when I sit at a new table, I’m cast to the outside. Of course, that’s isn’t inherently a problem in of itself—you start at the outside of a table and then you work your way in through conversation and acquaintance. But I can’t work my way in, because I can’t hear what’s going on. And I can’t sit in the middle because that’d be upsetting the social hierarchy.

If life is a hierarchy, I feel like I’m at the bottom because I can’t even hear and communicate with other people. 

They say humans are social animals, and that if you’re not social, or are socially inept, you’ve failed. 

I feel like I’ve failed. 

I don’t even know what to do about my “identity” because I’m certainly not Deaf (capital D, as in the community I don’t ever do anything with), but I definitely don’t feel I’m hearing either. 

I make jokes to make it all seem okay. 

“I failed my test, just like I failed my audiogram.”

That was funny, right? Being hard of hearing is okay. It’s funny! It’s not a huge deal, see? I belong. My hearing loss is something I can joke about, it’s something I’m comfortable with. 

At least, that’s what I let you think. I’m so uncomfortable with it, I can’t ever let you see the scars this disconnect has caused me.

So I make jokes, and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh until it’s not a big deal at all anymore. 

It’s fine!

...right?


You know, people look at my ears and say “wow, I can’t even see your hearing aids!” as if it’s some great thing. People imply that it’s a good thing that I’m hiding my hearing loss—I don’t like that. 

Would I wear hearing aids that were super bright and stood out? Probably not. I’m not devastated from my hearing loss: at least, I try not to be, but I’m not proud of it. I don’t understand why people have to constantly be proud of themselves in order to accept themselves. Sometimes it’s best to just let things be. 
 
I don’t care about people, as much as I want to. I want to hear their stories and conversations and I want to hear their fears and worries and joys and achievements but I can’t. 

When people don’t matter to me anymore, neither do consequences. Oh, I was a bit of a dick to you because you cut me line? What the fuck are you gonna do? Yell at me?

That’s great because I CAN’T FUCKING HEAR YOU. 

I can’t hear you.

So I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I’m thinking about taking my own life, because no matter how much I try, nothing is going to change. There is no “happy ending” for me. No happily ever after. 

Maybe I’m just rambling. Maybe this is all just convoluted and I’m making a bigger deal of this than I really should be and I hate myself for that a lot. 

But I figure that’ll help. Getting it all out.",06Feb2020,1
38,"I'm clueless as to whether this is the right place to post but honestly just need to put things out there. I'm a freshman in college and was in a long-term relationship from high school up until about three weeks ago. I broke up with her because there was some stuff that I think is linked to baggage from my  parent's infidelity and related divorce; a lot of aspects of the relationship triggered what I'm now pretty sure were panic attacks and virtually incapacitated me from anxiety/stress. 

I'm a double math/computer science major at a top 50 school and also do undergrad research in two labs. I'm starting to notice that I'm emotionally falling apart from the break-up, as I'm still very attached to her, have very few people close to me, and am starting to realize how fucked up I am, but I feel like I'm just jumping from problem set to test prep to lab every 5 minutes and can barely get a break. I've been meaning to seek out therapy for the last week and a half but haven't even managed to call and schedule an appointment with campus mental health. 

I know a small part of me feels like I can't give myself the time to stop and let everything out because there certainly will be a long period prior to getting past issues where they make it pretty hard to keep up with everyday life and stay focused. Another part of me wants to just stuff things deep down, avoid how I feel completely, and just keep grinding academic things, but I also know that's what got me into this position in the first place. 

I don't know what to do or how to feel. I don't feel like I have remotely enough time to stop and deal with my issues, I crave and miss personal connection that I feel made a lot of my issues more manageable before other things eclipsed it, and I hate feeling guilty for writing stuff like this instead of finishing homework.",06Feb2020,1

I felt dead which over all lead to me gaining a bunch of weight. I was never bullied for it, I always acted nice to everyone. I also found out I have high functioning autism from my aunt. I’m glad I found out because made everything more clear. High school so far has been great. I tried foot ball and made some friends, and 1 best friend. Let’s call him Zac. I also found a new crush on the water girl  and I got to know her. After 4 months I give her my phone number but she never called.

I can't sit still for long and need to listen to music to stay calm or need constant stimulation. I stopped doing things that I really liked: watching anime, reading books, studying languages, and playing video games. 

But recently I started to try and get back into the things that I once liked. I started watching anime again: Fullmetal alchemist Brotherhood, The promised neverland, mob psycho, One punch man, and etc. I go through 2 books last semester during school. I started to study Japanese and Russian again. Hopefully soon, I will be able to sit down long enough to play videos games. 

I have also started to make new goals for myself like getting a new hobby, change my style to a more feminine and cute style, playing the Flute and Tennis again, getting my license, and improving my speech.

56,"I wasn't *that* mad about the fact that you called me a tool  in that rain jacket. I knew I looked like a tool. Everyone else knew that I looked like a tool. That hood fell down to my freaking eyebrows. 

The event that broke the camel's back was on a rainy Wednesday, I  think. I  had just gotten out of English, and with the torrential downpour that was ravaging the campus of our small but open campus, I decided to go back to the dorms to get my rain jacket. I was already wet without it, and was freezing my ass off. 

This rain jacket was new, a Christmas gift that my father jokingly said that I would grow out of, despite being 16-years-old and having not grown an inch in two  years.  It  was the first time I had it on, and yes, I realize that the hood made me look dumb. I looked in the mirror before walking outside, back into the trickling outdoors. 

I  saw  you walking to the dorm as I was  walking out, hoping that you'd just say hello on the way. But then you looked up from behind your brimmed cap, one that  was definitely *much*  cooler than my dumbass rain coat,  and I saw that smile cross your face. 

Oh, God, do I  know that smile. 

It's the smile you had when you looked through my old reddit account for the first time, nitpicking at my post history and *laughing* at the posts that in were no way funny. We had just met, maybe a month into the school year. You grabbed my laptop from me to get my username and went to town. 

I deleted that account, wiped it from the internet as you took screenshots of my post history and filed them on your desktop. 

Luckily for you, you caught me at a vulnerable time. I was fresh into high school, looking for friends, people to relate to. You, a junior at the time, seemed like a beacon of wisdom and banter, an all knowing master of high school life. 

You were a guy I could have fun with, in the most innocent way possible. Not wanting to seem too sensitive, a downfall in a lot of my past relationships, I brushed off this incident and challenged you to find my new reddit account, this one, in three days. 

You did. I blocked you, not immediately after, but soon enough. 

The next thing that happened, another crack in the foundation of our friendship I was oh so blissfully ignorant of, was the flash drive. 

I wanted to share some of my writing with you, stuff that I had worked on over the summer. Just one piece, even though I had rusty treasure troves. I couldn't send it through the mail so I gave you a flash drive. With it, and everything else on my computer on it. 

I *thought* you would be more mature, as your title of a junior put a false lens on my gaze of you. I put everything that I didn't want you seeing into a neat folder. I'm talking *everything*, from the writing I did when I was deep into a depression, to the other, cringy stuff I wrote at the beginning of middle school.  Was it stupid? Yes. I admit my faults.  I trusted too quick and fast in my desperation to look  cool and gain friends. 

Alas, you took everything from that flash drive and copied it onto your computer. Yeah, why the fuck  would you do that.  

Did I leave it out like bait? Yes

Should you have seen it like bait? No

What was in the file was everything I didn't show to people. By taking that file, you tore me right open, exposing bone. We talked about it later that night, just across from each other on campus. We could see each other's windows across the grass. I used to wonder which window was yours, since you didn't tell me immediately. While I was a box with a broken lock, you were sealed shut, and gave that same mischievous smile. 

It seemed to hide your insecurity.

The year went on. There were periods of silence between the two of us. You wrote my recommendation for something, and I got in. Things seemed to be looking up. No exploits, no tearing deeper into me. 

But then again, what was there left to tear into?

I took this as a good sign, in my naive state. We talked on an off, sometimes sitting at the same dinner table. Over the summer, I kept up conversation with you, the ones that you started. There was never any reciprocation on your part, yet you rarely told me to stop. It was like you were just *asking* to be  annoyed by me. 

August came, which for you meant college applications started. You shared with me everything, from the stats to the acceptance rates, to the rage that you felt over the  fact that you were missing valedictorian by .003. Why did you want to be valedictorian? To fulfill a promise to your sixth grade self. 

It was at this point I realized how stuck in the past you are. You still write your emails in comic sans, because in middle school you did the same thing. When brainstorming college application essay ideas, you were so stuck on the idea of *nostalgia.* Nostalgia, the yearning for high school when it isn't even over yet, consumed your thinking. Even when the prompt didn't even fit the idea, you spent hours trying to wedge it in there. 

It was here that your immaturity started to show along with this elusive feeling. 

The next, and biggest, crack in the foundation of our friendship was the day in the common room. It was you, Tom, and Rachel. We were all in theater tech together, and hanging out  afterwards.  I left to go switch my laundry, leaving my phone on the table. 

Tom took it and put it on the guy's side of the dorm, teetering from one of the sills that look over the common room. You three were laughing about it while I came back down, feeling dumb for leaving my phone, but not too hurt for this was just a prank. 

It escalated, though. Tom went to go get my phone back after about five minutes, but just moved it to the next sill over. You were laughing. Fine, that's understandable. I was starting to get impatient, the butt of the joke now. 

Then Rachel started joking about the fact that I liked a certain guy. Nobody defended me. You just kept laughing. 

I started to get upset, trying to defend myself. 

You were laughing. 

I stopped laughing along. 

You were laughing. 

And then I left, going back to my room to stop from crying in front of you three. That would have just kept pushing the joke farther. 

Tom and Rachel gave me an apology the next time I saw them. They were sincere, saying that they took it too far. I took it, and I'm still friends with them today. 

You, however, didn't take any fault in hurting me. You muttered something about how you ""wouldn't do it next time"" or some bs like that, not acknowledging the greater cuts you gave to me. I wasn't having the best year, and I was sensitive, yes, but kindness is a lot easier to spread than hate. 

Later, after prompting, you gave me an almost scripted apology. I took it, but didn't let you back in as far, shutting off certain doors. 

And after I confronted you about the rain jacket, asking you why you thought it way okay to just call me a tool, no playfulness in your voice, only malice and demeaning power, you gave me the same ""I will think before I speak"" excuse, a lesson that most of the people around me have learned. I didn't take it this time. 

Grow up, Jake. 

Quit pushing things under the carpet, thinking that I'll be okay next time you pinch me again. I wish the best for you, I really do, but the best can only be achieved if you stop treating people like they're inferior. Treat people with kindness, even in the tiniest forms.  In this world, we're only in a race against ourselves. There's no reason to keep up the power imbalance. 

I miss you, our talks. I miss the ignorant bliss our relationship had, but now I've grown, and I realize that good relationships cannot be built like that. 

G'night.

It just makes me look like a lonely loser living in a fantasy, I know, but I don't even realize I'm doing it until after it happens. I've been trying to correct myself, but how do you do that in conversation without sounding crazy? you don't. But I am crazy, so maybe I just need to admit that and get some help? idk.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started in 8th grade I think. I was smoking a lot of weed (heavy stoner to this day) and my girlfriends dad hated me. I think I really loved this girl.. But long story short she ends up killing herself because her step dad took her phone, beat her and said she is never allowed to talk to me. My dad even tried to go to his house to talk to him, and he ended up punching my dad. Really messed me up so I turned to harder drugs. Mostly psychedelics in hopes I'd see her again in a vision or something. Idk i was desperate.  I droped so much acid, went on a few month long shroom bend, and I'm not sure if that really messed me up, or if I'm using that as an excuse for my behavior. Probably both.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to stop lying so bad I really do. I hate the feeling when I get caught and have to walk with my tail between my legs, and it makes me look so freaking STUPID. I'm smart enough to realize how stupid I am. That at least is a blessing I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

My career is freaking taking off though. I am 25 making way more than I could ever need doing software development and bug hunting. I should be so happy, I have NOTHING to lie for.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet I do it constantly and it drives everyone I care about away. I can't keep a stable relationship because I'm mentally abusive and impossible to trust. I don't want to be that way, I want to change but shit if I know how.

Took grade 11 bio last year, and early this school year I started off with taking grade 12 bio and 11 chem, planning to take 12 chem the following year. Had to drop bio before the first mark came out because it was really hard to follow without chem. So changed it to only 11 chem for this year and taking both 12 chem and bio next year.

Busted.

I had to drop out of 12 adv. functions because the teacher was sh*t and the class had a 40 something average. Struggling with grade 11 chem a lot, math I've never gone out of the 50s range. English dropped to a 70 and philosophy is 87. Tech is a 11 course I put to fill and doesn't matter.

Several months ago I started reading sub reddits and learning about other peoples trouble. First feeling pity for myself but soon realising my life wasn't so bad. It got me thinking and I started looking what was wrong in my life. I loved my girlfriend and family, but just couldn't get the energy to give them any time. My job was fine, liked what i was doing there but in the end I realised that my (now old) workplace was killing me. Making long hours, Living to work and it had to stop.

Now, 5 months later I feel reborn. I have a new job which I love. My relationship feels better than ever and I feel accepted again by my whole family. I really believe that reading the troubles of other people helped me to realise that my life was good and just had to get out of a sloach.

68," Survival was what a man's purpose was. But now we have overcome the basic necessities, and since there isn't a primitive motive that drives us, it's only natural to feel empty and when we look at the bigger picture, our minds become a void. At least this is the bigger picture for me. As a species, our next objective would probably be growth, or maybe becoming a closer world. One where people become closer and put the differences that we are born, and the millieu that we cannot control aside and provide equally for everyone and develop equality for everyone. But this might also put aside the parts that make us human in the first place. This is only my perspective. But I feel bad because I think that as an individual, you are only bound to the things you are here with. Although it is true that there are a few things that you can do with the opportunities you are given, I think that it's only till a certain extent. And to humanity, what significance do you carry as an individual? Where does man truly find bliss? In growth? In human connection? Or is happiness not the true purpose?

they told me i need surgery, and at the same time this girl ghosted me which sucks a lot.

i will obviously loose most of the gains and im starting college on april so its gonna be a rough start socially-wise cause i wont feel as confident.
how can i change my mindset? any tips? i honestly feel like shit",06Feb2020,1
82,"Asking this question after  i had a conversation with some members of the LBGTQ community.

I raised a opinion  that sometime in urban culture  or just media a female with an intense , takes whats she wants and no apologies type of personality is often seen as empowering toward  there sex. Which is why i feel alot of young woman are trying this whole bad and boujee lifestyle nowadays. And anyone that says hey this may be wrong  or you shouldn't act like this or do that can be labeled  something  childish as a hater or even  sexist for not allowing the woman to simply be her self. 
We can't  judge then or label  them or put in in a generalized box because  we are not woman ourselves etc.
But i sit and watch men get branded, and labeled, and grouped into negativity everyday at a great level it feels  because  not as many people voice this opinion or again its almost like men would be sexist  now adays just for trying to protect  and defend ourselves and what we feel is right. 
If toxic masculinity is a form of social dominance  and sexism  that we are suppose to have inforced on the woman around us since we were born. A so hierarchy men created through fear, power and intimidation. They why can't  woman be put under the same term. Woman are taught crippling ideals since birth no one stops but constantly empowers instead. Always  protecting  them or minimizing  the blow on where or how they are often wrong or over aggressive. But they always get an excuse. That excuse is how bad we are as men can always justify  a women's  motives  and feelings for anything socially.",06Feb2020,1
83,"(This is fucking *long* but I promise it’s worth the read.)

For context, the principal at the time had only been at the school around two years, but he was already fucking everything over. His main goal was to make the school look as good as possible on paper, but in order to achieve this, he neglected the well-being of the students and the overall morale of the school was extremely low at all times during his leadership. Everybody hated him.

I was in a student leadership position in year 12 and I tried to make a positive difference. I explained to him exactly how the students felt at every single leadership meeting. I even suggested things we could do to improve that, while also keeping the good results the school was seeing on paper. And yet, every single time I tried to bring up a point, he would shut me down. He was so quick to deny anything negative I had to say, insisting that I’m “hearing a loud minority, when really the silent majority are doing just fine”. I was so fed up that at the end of the year, in order to restore some shred of my own dignity, I decided to hide a political message in my yearbook quote.

My quote was “Happiness and tolerance enhance us. \*\* \*\* \*\* \*\* \*\*” with the first letter of each word spelling out “H. A. T. E. U. \* \* \* \* \*” (I’ve censored his surname, as well as the words that correlate to it. Sorry for that, but you can imagine)

I only told my close friends. But when I was telling one of them, the teacher of the class at the time overheard me saying it. He asked me about it, and I explained why. This teacher always kind of had it out for me but I figured it would be fine.

Anyway, the quote got approved. Everything was looking fine. The next two months went by and then, a week before graduation, the bomb dropped.

It was the Wednesday of my final exam week. I had three exams left, on the Thursday and Friday, which were also my most difficult. I had just finished a presentation when the teacher tells me that the behaviour manager wants to see me at the office.

My stomach drops but I tell myself that it’s nothing. While I’m waiting at the office, I see one of my friends who knows about the quote. I fill him in on why I’m there and we both joke “aha what if it’s about the yearbook thing? How funny would that be, getting suspended a week before graduating”.

I go in to see the behaviour manager and I also see my head of year (who was in charge of the yearbook) with him. I jokingly say “aha I feel like I’m in trouble!”

They don’t laugh.

I sit down and they ask me to explain my senior quote. I immediately tell them the quote and say “this is about the hidden political message, isn’t it?” I immediately accept full responsibility for my actions.

They accused me of defamation, of hatespeech, of passive-aggressively lashing out. They told me that the yearbooks had already been sent out to production and that if they can’t get them pulled and edited, they have no choice but to suspend me.

But what still makes me so fucking angry is that they had known ALL MORNING. I knew immediately that that horrible teacher had told them. TWO MONTHS LATER IN THE MIDDLE OF MY FINAL EXAMS, WHICH I DID TERRIBLY ON, BY THE WAY.

But anyway, they knew ALL MORNING, waited until after my presentation, which was at midday, to call me in and talk to me. But they still hadn’t called the company yet? If those books were already in production, they supposedly had to suspend me. So why didn’t they immediately check with the company as soon as they found out?

I was forced to come up with my own punishment in case I wasn’t suspended. And I immediately offered up the only valuable thing I had left at school, which was my valedictorian speech at graduation. But they still kept pushing for me to give up more? They suggested I even “promise to come back next year and tell the new seniors what I did”.

So to be clear, I’ve been accused of hatespeech and defamation (which are so incredibly not the case) and now I’m being threatened with public humiliation? All for trying to restore a bit of my own dignity in a covert way?

I’m sent home and told to tell my parents what happened. At this point, the principal did not know. But they said if they had to get the yearbooks re-done then then I would have to be suspended and they would have to tell him.

Later that day, my parents and I were called in for an interview with the principal. So I knew immediately that they couldn’t stop the yearbooks and, as they’d made very clear to me, that meant I was suspended.

We go to the school office, but the principal wasn’t fucking there? Apparently he “went home” because he was “so gutted”. But I later found out that I didn’t “gut” him, and that this was actually the last straw in a list of things that were affecting him at the time. So that was another unnecessary guilt-trip.

We go into the meeting and the two from my interview earlier - the behaviour manager and the head of year - were there. The behaviour manager opens with a long speech about how he’s “suspended kids at this point in the term for even less than what I did!” And that the “re-printing of the yearbooks will cost the school $600”. He goes on and on, and I’m just waiting for them to fucking tell me I’m suspended. But it never comes.

After over an hour of feeling like my insides were being shredded - since finding out the principal was involved and now enduring this dickhead’s little speech - they finally decide to tell me that they aren’t going to suspend me because I had an impeccable behaviour record up until then. But my valedictorian speech was definitely being taken away.

I said that I wanted to apologise to the principal in person, so they set up a meeting with myself, him and my parents on the following Monday (the first day of my final week at the school).

Over the weekend, my parents and I formulate a plan for how we’re going to deal with him. He said the reason he wanted a meeting was to find out why I did what I did. And so I saw this as an opportunity to finally tell him everything he was doing that was harming the school, and he would finally be forced to fucking listen to me. My dad suggests also fighting for my valedictorian speech back, since the school wanted to keep the whole incident a secret and a lot of people would ask questions if my speech was cancelled. A lot of the community know who I am and like me significantly more than they like that principal, and since I actually had a case against them, with their threats of public humiliation, their incorrect use of defamation and hatespeech, and the way they handled the whole situation (making me do poorly in three of my most important exams, over something relatively harmless that nobody was ever going to know about).

We go into the interview and I clarify that I don’t hate him personally, but I hate the values he represents. I essentially get to rant to him for an hour about every single thing I’d been trying to say all year, and he finally had to just sit there and listen to me. We also bring up the threat of the media, and he tells us that he’ll have to talk to the other staff about the speech, since it isn’t his decision alone.

The next day, we get a call asking for a draft of my speech for graduation the following night.

The sweetest thing about all of it is that I got away with it relatively punishment-free. I finally got to tell the principal exactly how I feel without him pulling any bullshit on me, too.

Finally, remember the teacher who ratted on me? The one who waited to tell them so he could sabotage my final exams and get me banned from speaking at graduation? You should have seen the look on his face when I got up there to speak. Absolutely incredulous.

I don’t expect anyone to read all of this. But if you did, thank you for coming on this journey with me. And always remember to treat yourself with dignity and stand up for what you believe in.",06Feb2020,1
85,"I'm not one for complaining constantly but I have this bother me, I go on some rich peoples life and I guess they didnt like I understood them so they kept wish bad shit on me to compensate for their insecurities, I felt like they kept analyzing me and could break in to me so they got even more uncomfortable, I feel like shit and now everything I'm doing feels annoying.

I tried to warn her that the man she was marrying was not mature enough for a serious relationship, but she told me I was wrong and married him anyway.

I can't help but feel like something is off. Like something is wrong with me, and something is missing. I can chase down my flaws and improve them, but there's always going to be something fundamentally wrong with who I am at my core. I'm really scared that no matter how smart, sociable, and kind I convince myself I am, and I think I'm all of those things at least to some extent, I will just never like myself.",06Feb2020,1
90,"I am a 24 yo and i have never had a serious relationship. And now at this point in my life I feel a lot lonely. I have talked to many guys but I didn't feel connected to anyone, it felt so forced. I know no one is exactly our type but idk i feel relaxed when i dont have to talk to them. And the guys I am interested in, I dont know... I wouldnt even get the chance to like have a chat with them even.

And I am also a bit hypersexual (maybe its because of my PCOS; i dont know the real reason though) and i cant even go to a psychiatrist for this.

So I almost hit on a married man (honest to God i did not know he was married). He was someone i felt attracted to and interested in. Thank goodness i wasnt obvious but i still feel embarrassed and humiliated and heavy. I am just feeling sorry for myself, like why cant i just get on with someone and be with him and not be this horny all the time.

I just didnt know whom to tell this to to feel lighter its like such a burden. I just dont want insecurities to come in my way. I know i am not ready for a relationship but how to keep myself from wanting someone? How to not be horny? I am really really depressed.",06Feb2020,1
92,"I'm 23M, and I don't have a lot of friends. And I rarely see the friends that I do have. I have one friend who I see about once a week most weeks, and a few others who I see between once a month and once every 4 months. A lot of the time I have periods from several days to a few weeks where I can go without seeing any of my friends, and I get extremely lonely at times. And just to top everything off, I just recently learned that one of my friends plans on moving VERY far away in the next year or two. 

I'm diagnosed with Asperger's, although I have it pretty mildly and put a lot of effort into my social skills. I'm still not completely perfect, but I feel like it could be much, much worse. In fact, a lot of people are surprised when I tell them I have Asperger's. Two of my friends are also Aspies, but aside from them I have a hard time connecting with other people on the autism spectrum (I have a full post about it here ). I'm going to college right now, and the people there are decently polite and friendly to me, but on the other hand I don't get invited to their hangouts.

I'm currently going through my last year of college. After this I'll be done with education for good. I'm lucky that I've found a program that will lead me to a career doing something I've wanted to do for as long as I can remember (conservation and breeding endangered animals). I feel like I've found the right path and what I'm meant to do in life. This is my purpose, and it's what I've wanted to do for a living since I was a kid. But with that being said, at the same time I'm really, crushingly lonely a lot of the time.

I've been to three different colleges since high school, and I've been trying to click with people for years with no results. I'd hoped that I would find the right people when I found a college program that made me feel like I'd discovered my path in life, and don't get me wrong - I have been making friendly conversation in class with several people in my program, and done homework outside of class with a couple of them. But when it comes to hangouts that don't have to do with school, I'm left out. I know for a fact that some people in my program who also live on residence have been hanging out together along with other people that they know, but I'm not invited to these hangouts. I've asked about the hangouts a couple of times before, and they've said things like ""yeah, we'll see if we can bring you along next time"", and then it just doesn't happen. Apparently I just don't fit in with other ""animal people"".

I've also tried finding other ways of connecting with people on campus. Unfortunately there isn't really anything in the way of social or hobby clubs, just study groups, and even then it looks like there are no study groups for my program. There aren't many residence events either, and the last social one was an icebreaker at the start of term. Basically the vast majority of social contact that people have at this college is through classes, and since the people in my program don't seem to want me around I'm pretty much screwed.

There aren't many volunteer opportunities in the area, either. There is the local humane society, but I've volunteered there for years and the vast majority of people there are much older than me (as in retirees). Other than that, there's really no opportunities to volunteer with animals anywhere near me. I tried joining a local photography club, but I ended up being literally the only person to show up to the event. There was one hiking group I went to join, but again the people there were MUCH older, mostly in their 50s and 60s. 

This isn't a new problem, either. I've spent the past six years trying to find circles that I'll fit into. But for reasons that I really don't understand, nothing has worked out. I've spent a LOT of time working on developing social skills and as far as people have told me, my social skills are pretty good. In fact, I've had a therapist and a life coach both tell me that they're actually surprised that my process and approaches towards social situations are pretty good and I'm still not getting any results. Unfortunately, I've tried to go to support groups and clubs for people on the autism spectrum only to find out that I really don't fit in there, either.

I really feel like I don't belong anywhere. Maybe I'm just meant to be lonely. Lots of people are, and it's just a fact of life. But that doesn't make it hurt any less.",06Feb2020,1
93,"I’m 21 for reference. I basically have had a crush on a girl in my extended friend group for a little while. Won’t go into details cause it would take too long, but I thought there was a little spark there at the very least. It’s been a while since we’ve all been out together, but when we had been recently we’d basically spend the full night together, were opening up to each other about some really private shit, sometimes messaging outside of our big group chat, she’d always post shit to do with me on her story, etc. 

Anyway, at the weekend I was at a friend’s house, pretty wasted. She was out at another place and messaged me asking what I was up to, where I was etc. She ended up not coming over cause my friend didn’t want too many people up, but we talked about how it had been too long since we’d been out and arranged for all our friends to go out this weekend. Me, being drunk and stupid, just happy that she wanted to see me that much, started ranting to like everyone there about how I couldn’t wait to see her, about my crush on her, you get the gist.

Since that night it’s basically now an open secret between all our friends. They’ve been joking a lot about it in our group chat, which she’s definitely seen, and even her friends have joined in on the jokes. She’s completely ignored the jokes, while I’ve tried to laugh them off, but I think she feels awkward about the whole thing. I’ve tried messaging her today, and she just opened it and didn’t reply. I feel like she wouldn’t have done that before. She has been really keen about still going out though, and usually she doesn’t much care about organising our group’s plans until we’re actually there, so I’m not sure. It seems like this has kind of scared her off if there was actually any interest to begin with, I’m about 90% sure she doesn’t feel the same way.

Now I’m just fucking nervous and anxious as shit about going out with her and all our friends there though. If she doesn’t feel the same, which seems likely, I’ll take it as best I can and obviously not get mad about it. You can’t control who you like, and I’ve had enough in the past to be able to handle it. But fuck if this isn’t the most embarrassing shit ever. I’ve got a completely open, likely unrequited crush, that literally every one of our friends knows about and is gonna be joking about. It’s just embarrassing really, and this is just one in a long string of unrequited crushes. You’d think it gets easier, but instead everyone’s just gonna be laughing at my expense for having a thing for a girl who’s not interested just because she showed a little interest. It just makes me seem like a desperate idiot.

I’m just fed up I suppose. Just once I want to like someone and they like me back, it just never happens. It feels like every time I put myself out there it’s just rejection, which like I said, isn’t anyone’s fault, but it doesn’t make it sting any less. This one is far worse because literally everyone knows about it, and I feel bad for both of us that we’re gonna have to endure a load of shit about it. It’s so immature man. I’m gonna end up a laughing stock, especially at the weekend. Part of me wants to just not go, but I know the best way to handle this is to just try act like it doesn’t bother me. But it really will, and I feel like I just look so fucking stupid. I definitely don’t want her to think any less of me, so I’ll take it all on the chin as best I can and move on if it’s clear she’s uncomfortable about it all, but I’m a pretty private person and this shit is like my nightmare scenario; putting myself out there even though it terrifies me, only for it to end up in rejection and everyone finds it fucking hilarious. Shit sucks.",06Feb2020,1

97,"So I am trying to find this movie and here's what I know: It's around 2010-2012 when I was younger. I am walking into the living room and my dad is watching something on the TV. The movie is in color and looks like it could've been made from the 90's onwards. It's at night and there are a bunch of men taking children away from their mothers. I remember one woman screaming, ""Don't take my baby!"" Looks like something BIG happened and there's like a mass panic. An adult woman and man (could be couple or friend, not for sure) are then riding in this helicopter and are looking down at the scene. The next thing I can remember is the pair is in a hospital or morgue and and are taking a sheet over a dead person and the dead person (looks like a man) has x's over his eyes. This has been bugging me, so if you have ANY idea of what film\television episode this could be, PLEASE TELL ME!!! Thank you.",06Feb2020,1
98,"No one wants to read a rant about how sad J am. That's not the point of the post. 
It's just, lately I've kind of woken up to the fact that I'm a below average guy with emotional issues like addiction and depression. In below average,  I dont mean I get less romance or I feel lesser (actually sex is a great coping mechanism for the short term), but that despite everyone telling me I'm so cool, so cute, I'm so smart, etc. I also get people who want to evaluate my life on their lifes grading system and it doesnt work like that. I guess I'm not even mad.
I just wish that people could be more honest with me about things like friendship and loyalty. 
I dont need friends, I desire ""good friends"" people who dont try to keep me down but try to build me up.",06Feb2020,1
99,"Maybe some of my beliefs are “out there”—sure, fair enough. Maybe sometimes I get too wrapped up in my love and obsession for a man I never knew. Maybe, at the end of the day, he’s HASN’T really come to know me from beyond the grave and isn’t looking down on me. 

But why would you be so determined to convince me he’s not? Why not allow me to have this comfort, this hope that he is watching over me from the afterlife and that I will meet him when I get there? Why would you want to take this dream away from me, when it’s one of the only things that brings me true joy? Why do you have to call me “crazy” and other demeaning names just because I believe that we can communicate with spirits through our hearts and minds? Why does it even *matter* to you what I believe?

I’ll never stop believing in my dreams, regardless of how much other people try to crush them. But it really, really breaks me and makes me feel like a piece of shit when people mock me for this.",06Feb2020,1

101,"I regret everything. My dad saved up a chunk of money for each of us to spend on college or as a failsafe if we didn't go, but I decided to go to college because I thought it made sense. I've only managed to complete like half a degree in 4 years and I'm sick of college. I've wasted so much money on dropped classes, and even the classes I actually completed are just a waste. I hate my major and I don't know what to change it to, I don't want to be in college, I want to start my life already. I don't feel like I have a future here but I don't want to admit it to my parents, I feel like they'll hate me for it. I basically just go to campus everyday now and sometimes go to class but usually don't to just walk around campus to enjoy the fresh air. 

I spend almost all my freetime just listening to music and playing games or drawing or just wasting time in general. I'm trying to get a job to actually be productive, but am afraid I'm undesirable because I hate smiling and can't fake one for the life of me. Instead I just feel bad about myself like that will fix anything.

I fantasize a lot about just leaving in my shitty car one day and moving up north where they hopefully have cold winters because I love the cold, but it's not like I'd have a chance. I have no friends and haven't for years so I'd have to room with strangers, and I'm possibly trans so I'd want to explore that aspect of me but that costs money, and there's no way in hell I'd be able to make that work. 

I wish I just moved out from the get go instead of pretending like I had a future in school and wasting all my money. I haven't evolved as a person since I graduated high school, the only difference is that I feel even more stuck and I don't know how to move forward.",06Feb2020,1

104,"I was thinking about a person who I barely knew that hated me for seemingly no reason.

People are touchy and can form life-long opinions about other people from things as benign as having a passing resemblance to someone that once did them dirty.  But usually, because I'm brown and I live in the states, I assume racism.

I'm not saying they are, it's just like the simplest explanation, and you know Occam's razor and all that.  

Because of this line of thinking though, I immediately resent that person. If they're not racist I just made an enemy when maybe I could have made a friend.  Instead of trying to convince them  that their preconceived notions are wrong, I treat them how they treat me.  Which in their eyes only justifies their previous acted.

But then I start thinking maybe even if that person is a racist asshole and deserves to be treated like shit, wouldn't it be better if I tried to prove them wrong?  Like am I infact perpetuating the problem?  Making things worse for the next brown person this asshole interacts with instead of trying to make them better? 

I understand you can't just be nice to bigots and fix racism/homophobia/sexism ect. However say you took say 50 racists, split them into two groups of 25, groups A and B.  For group A. You treated them exactly how they treated you, and for group B. you treated them how you wanted to be treated, regardless of how they treated you.  

I feel like it's safe to assume all of group A are still not fans of brown ppl, and yes I feel like that's probably also true for most if not all of group B as well.  But maybe, just maybe, if the ppl in group B run into another brown person who treats them (group B) not how they( the brown person) are treated but how they want to be treated.. maybe some of them will start questioning their beliefs.

I know this isn't a wholly original sentiment, one particularly awesome and significantly more articulate man used to express the same concepts before they killed him for it.

It just didn't occur to me that I was failing to do exactly that until I followed that train of thought all the way to the station.",06Feb2020,1
105,"I’m really bad at this so please hear me through.  
Also note this isn’t a self improvement post. 

Life has been exceptionally rough, more so after graduation. From having the love of my life I was with for 6 years, having a nice car, a job, and a promise to keep on going. To never stop until I reach the top. 

After high school was done and over things started going downhill. What I though was our undying love for one another stared unraveling more and more, slowly showing me more of her true colors. 2 years after HS and it was over. 2 more years later I’m still hurting when I know I shouldn’t. 

I was holding the position of a cook at a beloved local restaurant, loving every second of every minute (even though it’s a stressful job). Well, one day I got a really good offer. To move out of my home state I had never left, to learn how to do finish carpentry (which I love)  for 6 months and I earned a free education out of the ordeal. But when I returned to my home state, nothing was the same. Nothing really for work. Nothing to keep the bills paid. Ultimately resulting in the repossession of my car and my loss of transportation to work wherever I could find it.

The absolute loss of my love life, my work life and my social life has been the most heart breaking thing I’ve ever endured. It’s uncomfortable going from extrovert to pretty much forced introvert. 

I’m not going to hold back the fact that suicide hasn’t left my mind in an ungodly long time. And I’m dying for a way out of this cursed mindset. 

Reddit, I need help",06Feb2020,1
106,"I live with a roommate, he also happens to be my best friend, and we have lived in apartments and houses with no issues, until now. We’re both millennials, and as per the norm my roomie deals with very common mental ailments, and I have been very considerate of them, but I feel as though I am a camel and one too many pieces of straw have been placed on my back.

I am very clean, annoyingly clean, and I try and control myself as best as possible, but sometimes it really is just too much. My roommate is not the cleanest person I have ever met but he’s always done a fantastic job of keeping it in his room, and I have never had issues with that (I don’t have to do anything in his room, so to me all is fair). However, that does lead me to cleaning the common areas of the apartment by myself, and that’s been the case in multiple leases, but this one in particular (started in Aug. 2019).

I like to think of myself as a decent human being, but I know I have my flaws. Nevertheless, when it came time to move last summer, and my roommate had 200 dollars to his name, I fronted the rest of the costs (I’d say about 1500?). These are where the problems start, as it is now February and he owes me 1500 bucks. To make matters worse our PSE&amp;G (gas and electric) bill has been higher than people I know who own homes, we have a two bedroom duplex and it’s small. I have also been paying this bill in full, along with out internet, groceries, and anything other necessary bills until just a few days ago. I just finally broke down and forced his hand into a payment plan (105 bucks every paycheck until our lease is up, and he can’t borrow another cent from me). However, it’s not enough and I don’t know what to do or what to say.

Another reason, and please don’t advert to me being jealous, is that he just recently started seeing someone, and he’s a new person (naturally not to me) but this new person has him doing things I have never seen, and has him waking up in the morning to start their days of adventure (something myself and another good friend have never been able to do, so much so, that we have been hours and I mean hours late to far to many events and trips I’d like to think about). Now my issues here are that there was no discussion of her living here (she essentially does) and she’s as dirty as him. Now, I know you’re thinking oh they probably keep it in his bedroom, well they don’t. They act like they live here and I’m a live in maid because I don’t know how else you can explain letting one person clean the only bathroom, kitchen, and living area.

I have gone to him directly and said that she is a guest in our home and needs act accordingly, and I stressed this point heavily that she is not to be here alone, period. To him that means she can get here a few hours before he is done work to start her laundry, that inevitably i will end up paying for. We are not well off at all, and I don’t know where any of this came from but it’s stressing me out immensely.

We had these talks and ideas of working together and all that good stuff and I get that plans change I really do, but I also feel like I have some valid points and a stressful situation. I’m okay with money and have always been good at saving some, but this way of life I have found myself in doesn’t sit right with me. He barely used the kitchen, now they’re in their constantly, and don’t feel a need to clean? Is there something wrong with me? Am I overreacting? Am I, for a lack of a better phrase, too much? I need some help guys because it doesn’t matter what I say or do. This was proven to me when he said (during our money payment convo) he doesn’t think anything has changed since August to make this place dirtier and more expensive. ANOTHER HUMAN is living here, and I have to pay and clean for it, how do you mean.... any and all advice, criticisms, or just your two cents is appreciated.

TLDR: I was nice and patient with my roommate about contributing to our living arrangements because I thought he was truly down in the dumps. Turns out I was a placeholder until he found someone else. I am at my wits ends and just wanna hear the ideas and opinions of others.",06Feb2020,1

Never will i smile again , never will i have hope or faith or love or joy for anything ever again . I am solely here for you baby girl and when you no longer need me, i am gone.

My bf recently got a job pretty close to what I want. I'm happy for him, of course. What I am not happy about is how he responds to my feelings of frustration in my own job search. For example, I'll be venting about how I got another canned rejection email, and his responses are always something along the lines of:

""I mean, I didn't even study engineering and they threw the job at me \*shurg emoji\*""

Or,

""Lol, I'm waiting for the day they catch on to me""

116,"For the longest time, probably twenty years, I tried to be a singer-songwriter with my acoustic guitar. Looking back it wasn't silly but not true to my likes. The music that made the biggest impressions on me was rap and techno and alternative. One time I downloaded a music production program years ago but with my out of control mental illness I didn't have the patience to even begin. It was a very daunting thing for me to even look at. Now, 18 years sober and 13 years medicated and in therapy, I'm much better. In the last two years, I've actually felt stable and was able for the first time to save a little money so I treaded myself by buying me a sub for my car. That led me to wonderful feelings because it gave me an excuse to listen to some of my favorite music. Beastie Boys Pauls Boutique and Beck and others. That was about three months ago that I got that speaker for my car. About three weeks ago I had this thought about making my own music again. Mind you I had a resentment against making music for a long time because I had some bad experiences with trying to make something of my music twenty years ago. Time sorted that out. Listening to my old music again made me think, ""Can I do that?"" I asked a couple of questions on here about it and someone directed me to Ableton Live. It's a music production program that allows you to do everything you can think of in music. I am overjoyed. Every day for these three weeks I've been watching videos and reading a book and practicing in the software. Every day I challenge myself to try something new.  My ultimate goal is to put something on Soundcloud or something just to say I did. My long term goal is to master the program and see where that takes me. I'm just so happy to be happy with music again and being active in messing with it again. Thanks for reading if you did.",06Feb2020,1
117,"Let me introduce some stuff about me real quick. I WAS a weeb/gamer til I traveled abroad for college; leaving all my entertainments behind (I dont have time to explain why I cannot watch anime right now).  I’m not a fan of instagram, snap, or any other platform except reddit and when I met new people, I made an instagram account which was alright.  
  
First I’ll tell you how my relationship with my friends right now then I’ll tell you the progress from when I first met them (everything im talking about is from like at the end of Dec til now). So every relationship I have is one sided friendship (basically my friendship crumbles if I stay silent or not interact with them. They don’t try to reach me out or message me).  
  
Usually when we’re walking together, Im silent most of the time and I can’t start up a topic nor can I add to what they are talking about. There topics are extremely irrelevant to me leaving me unable to talk at all. For example, it could be about THEIR friends, whom I don’t know. They mostly have met up from before. Another thing to mention is none of their interests matches mine (quick note: everyone around me is like this, I cannot find different people at ALL). My topics cannot start up for lack of mutual interests.  
  
Another thing I’m so uncomfortable with is everyone sees me the most innocent one, sometimes they describe like a girl (I am a guy).  
  
All of these lowly descriptions decrease my confidence; regrowing my introvert self again.  
  
There is a non-serious problem since it is in instagram, but if it weren’t there, it would have substituted and improved my confidence with people. The problem is no one is interacting with me on insta. So basically, I post art and drawings that aren’t mine (my account isn’t public so Im not violating anything plus I provide the source). Im a fan of art, one day I’ll be one hopefully but anyway nobody likes or comments on anything. Only my old friends do and there is only 3.  
  
There is another issue and that nobody speaks English, which I prefer over my mother language. Everyone speaks my ML but 98% don’t speak English well, forcing me to use my ML. Why is this a problem? I got myself to hate my own ML due to past events (it’s a long story) so I put a lot of preference on English instead. I got nice fluency in it that I speak it better than my ML in terms of confidence. Infact English feels my ML now instead. And so, when I try to speak in my mother language it gets me paranoid, less confident in responding, and it makes me feel uneasy.

Around midnight I climbed to the snow covered roof from my room window without socks on and tried to get a picture of the northern lights with a crappy budget phone but suprise, suprise, it looked like shit so I googled that picture and sent it claiming me and my dad had taken it a couple days back 

In reality my father was just a narcisistic alchoholic who I went on and off disowning at the time before ending at the hate/platonic mindset I have for him now

Actually I used to lie about my life a lot to her because reality was depressing as hell at the time. It went to the point where she thought I was a devout Christian in a strict home because I never swore and was always polite

I liked it like that. Living in a corporised fosterhome with other kids that 80% of the time were gonna be junkies, dealing with a toxic family in a completely new environment was hell

126,"How do you deal with helping your parents. I speak English fluently and my mum is always asking for help finding jobs for her (as she always seems to have very bad managers who won’t even let her have lunch). I’m still at university and looking for jobs myself and since my mum doesn’t even know how to use a computer, is there anything I should suggest she do to help herself. We live in England so everything is in English which means she struggles teaching herself new things without my help.",06Feb2020,1
127,"I'm just so tired of everything, can't be bothered to keep on living honestly. I just can't with anything. I don't feel anything anymore and feel as though I don't need my life.

I haven't got any interesting relationships and feel as though I have nothing to look forward to so yeah think that's about it...",06Feb2020,1
128,"Don't ever let anyone else define who you are. You are who you choose to be and that's part of what makes you unique and awesome! 

Also, nobody will ever be liked by everyone, so stop trying to achieve the impossible; don't worry about anything, either change it or learn to accept it. You'll stress less and be much happier. 

I hope you all have a great day and coming days!",06Feb2020,1
129,"I was 14, he was 19, and he decided to text me. Knowing my age and knowing his intentions, he still talked to me and tried to justify it. I was stupid enough to fall for it and I regret it. He always said we’re technically 4 years apart not 5 so it’s okay. We looked up the laws before he came to visit me from Canada. We knew what was happening was wrong, and I blame him. He knew what he was doing. He knew our relationship was illegal. He got lucky. He was so close to being arrested, he caught a plane fast and the police decided not to do anything because they’re transphobic. He’s trans, and biologically a girl so he could not possibly do anything bad to me. Despite that being completely wrong, he was also on testosterone for a year at that time. I was grounded for months and months, justifiably, and at that time I still thought what he did was okay. We were together for a year. He gave me a promise ring, his childhood bear, his passed grandmothers box, who he was close with. He made me feel locked in the relationship. I broke up with him eventually, I couldn’t handle hiding it. Before I really broke up with him I went on a break for about a week. And without telling me, on a break, he got a tattoo of my bunnies across his chest because one passed away. He still says my bunnies are his, he’s never met them. But now I’m permanently on his body. I was stupid enough to go back to him, because I was really alone. I was 15 at this point. We stayed together for a very short time, I refused to wear my ring and necklaces he gave me. He gave me a key to our future house. He didn’t let me do a lot of things, things a teen would do. I woke up at 4am every night to call him. He pressured me. I got a haircut 3 times in our relationship and each time he avoided talking about it but was obviously disappointed. He didn’t like me to change unless he said he liked it first. I broke up with him again, and I finally realized I hate him for what he did. He knew everything he did was wrong. I wish we pressed charges, although I’d be scared if we did. On a break the first time he talked to a 16 year old at his work. He was willing to do it again. He messages me still and wish me a happy birthday or Christmas or whatever. He would message my friends asking for updates about me. I’m honestly scared of him. He wants me to come back when I’m 18. He knows where I live. He knows so much about me and refuses to get rid of our memories. I want to throw everything out but a part of me still wants to go back. I have boxes and boxes of stuff he gave me. My room is decorated in his stuff. My clothes he bought. He’s a bad alcoholic. I don’t know if he’d be abusive towards others, but he hurts himself when he drinks. It worries me, for his sake and mine. He broke up with his girlfriend of 3 years for me. I hate him for everything he did, but I still find myself trying to justify it. He was going to send me gifts for Christmas and my birthday without telling me, trying to get my friend to say it’s from my friend and not him. He is still in my life and I can’t kick him out. I want to but I’m scared to.",06Feb2020,1
130,"From the first time I got a phone in 6th grade until late tenth grade I was accidentally uploading all my photos from my phone onto my school Google account instead of my personal one. I knew this but thought I would just move them over later.

I graduated high school this spring and completely forgot about the pictures until today when I wanted to look at pictures from middle school and tried to log on only to find my school account was deactivated... All my pictures of me with my friends from 2012 - 2017 are just gone, not to mention the thousands of vintage memes I had saved over the years. I emailed my old guidance counselor and she said she doesn't think there's any way to recover them. 

I still have family photos, but I feel like I lost a lot of memories I'll never get back.",06Feb2020,1

He’s never said anything to directly offend me but I am considering firing him at the end of my series with him.

136,"This happened this past Halloween. I was driving myself and a few of my cousins across town, while wearing a pretty good quality Santa costume.

I was in the middle of an intersection when a big dog came running up to my car out of nowhere and just started running around the intersection. I threw my car in park, threw my hazards on, and jumped out. I was trying to catch the dog and my cousin was visibly distressed in the passenger seat, so I pointed and yelled, ""Move over and drive!"", and went back to chasing the dog.

The dog ended up running down the road, and a car full of people went after it after asking where it had gone. 

I went back to the car and continued with my Halloween night. 

I was just now thinking how fuckin' good of a story that'd be from an outsider perspective at work the next day.

137,"***I did post this in a different sub. I’m not sure if that’s against the rules or not. I’m new. And kinda desperate for advice. 
Ok hi guys. This is my first post so please bear with me. So I (20F) met this guy (28M). I’d known him for about a year, due to us working together occasionally. We never hit it off or talked much, and there was never a spark. Then one night we randomly hooked up, and after that we were addicted. Everything about it felt so right. I had never felt so drawn to somebody, and he said it seemed as though we were soulmates. Cool. He has an infant, and when we first hooked up he didn’t tell me that he was still with the child’s mother. I didn’t know because she had blocked me around the time we met, and why would he be with me if he had her? Naive. Anyways, when I did ask he said they were on and off, so I didn’t think much of it. This is where my dumb naive traits come into play. I knew they got back together, but he’d tell me he was done with the relationship. He’s scared to leave her because he thinks she’ll never let him see their baby. She’s toxic and crazy, and he’s over it. Blah blah blah. He tells me everything. Their whole relationship run down. Whatever. Tells me that everything about us just feels right. So I believe him. Then after a few weeks, he told me he wanted to have a baby with me. And then left it in on numerous occasions. I KNOW IM DUMB, THANK YOU. I don’t know if I’m pregnant, I’ll know for sure in about a week. We’ve talked about it over and over, and he’s adamant on having children with me. But won’t break up with her. Over time, I realized his actions and words weren’t matching up. They’re still together, although he wants to leave, I don’t think he will. So my question is, do I tell her? I’m hesitant because in the end, will she even leave him? Idk.",06Feb2020,1
