0,"A friend of mine killed himself when we were 18 and it made me turn to drugs.  For the next couple years I spent all my money on drugs and alcohol, working temp jobs so I had enough money to cover it and enough downtime to binge.  Then I got sick of it, told my friends I didn't want to do drugs anymore, they got upset with me so I had to break off from them.

From 22 - 30 I lived with my parents because I couldn't hold a job.  At 28 I saw a doctor and expressed what I felt had been going on since 22, saw a psychiatrist for a while and was diagnosed with bipolar 1.  Wasn't until recently that I got on meds that actually seem to be working, so I'm looking at returning to work and to be blunt it looks like a crap chute without education these days.  My cousin makes $110k/year as a mechanic but I can't last with physical jobs anymore (really bad back), I want to get off disability because being chronically poor is really stressful, not to mention it seems like everyone thinks ""disability = lazy leech"".  I want to afford more space, a TV, a dog and a vehicle.  There's been some stuff going on with disability where I live, it's like everyone thinks we're fraudsters and it doesn't make sense to me.  It's better to afford higher quality of life through work than this, even the crap chute jobs I'd be looking at getting from no postsecondary education will afford me a better lifestyle should I land one.",19Sep2020,1

3,"this year has been pretty shit. i was addicted to drugs from around the age of 15 (i’m 18 now) because i wanted my boyfriend at the time to think i’m cool (it was a very toxic relationship just like every single one after that) this pattern of me doing drugs to impress people kept going until i couldn’t go a day without being intoxicated. the last time i did drugs on february 13 this year i ended up in hospital fearing for my life, repeating “these are my last seconds” as my best friend was sitting next to me crying. after that he stopped talking to me and i stopped taking drugs , for the most part. i had some bumps where i’d break and i’d end up getting intoxicated and repeating the loop of my “last seconds” . i realised that experience traumatised me and even writing this gives me flashbacks and anxiety. i’m afraid to die and to grow up because i’m afraid that death is exactly what i experienced. i lost motivation to do things i feel disconnected from people around me, i feel like i died on february 13th and i’m living on a drug induced nightmare. i heard about people living for 100 years and dying just to wake up to their trip ending before and i’m so scared that that’s happening to me. anyway i’m finishing year 12 now, looking for unis. i’ve fucked my life over so much i’m scared my past will catch up with me and i’ll end up doing drugs again or i’ll never finding motivation to do anything. some days i feel the complete opposite where i want to fight going back to who i was but those days are short lived. i feel very alone like there’s no one i’ll ever connect with. i don’t do drugs anymore so i can’t hang out with my friends or people i have similar interests with and the people who don’t do drugs are just not people i can hang out with for too long without getting tired or judged.

But the second it happened to me, I lost all sense of humility. The second I read the words ""Congratulations on your acceptance"" I just started screaming and jumping for joy. I've spent 3 years dreaming of going to this college. So much so that I've planned the next 5 years of my life around this one school. I have always had really great grades so I didn't really have a reason to doubt I would get in. But still. That one email has me crying tears of joy. I'm one step closer!",19Sep2020,1
5,"So my sibling is a nonbinary person who is attracted to all genders, and I’m a woman who is also attracted to all genders. Our mother likes to pretend she cares about LGBT+ people, but she refuses to acknowledge my sibling’s pronoun preference (they/them) and chosen name. She hates that both her kids are queer, and she also mocks her queer friends behind their backs. Her only solace is that I am currently dating a man. My question for the lovely reddit community is what petty things can I do to fuck with her so she respects my sibling’s choices? There are no limits.

6,"Hey everyone. I'm 24M, turning 25 next month. A couple days ago, I rejoined match, and I've already found someone who I'm really interested in talking to. She's 28F, but there are a few things that are holding me back and making me feel like she's out of my league.

To start with, I have Aspergers. Although I'm high functioning, extroverted and have decent social skills, I still can have a hard time with nonverbal communication and ""reading between the lines"". I'll often have to ask for clarification on what someone means, since I don't always understand perfectly, and I feel like this could be annoying and make me seem like I'm stupid or immature to some people. Sometimes I have self-judging thoughts as well, like ""why would a confident, successful neurotypical woman want to date a confused aspie?"" I know that there are plenty of examples of people with Aspergers dating neurotypical people, but the thoughts aren't that easy to get rid of.

Also, I don't have a job right now. I'm a recent college graduate and with the pandemic going on I've been trying to get my bearings and get a sense of what places are hiring and which ones aren't before I dive in. I don't think I'm a basement dweller or anything, it's just that she appears to have a well established career and have her life together more than I do. This might be just because she's older, but I feel like I would seem either like an immature manchild or a basement dwelling neckbeard.

These issues are not specific to this one person, either. I've seen plenty of women on dating apps who I felt like I really wanted to get to know, but when I started trying to talk to them or even thinking about talking to them I never feel like I'm good enough for them. I'm considering deleting all of my apps.",19Sep2020,1

9,"My family, especially my mom and grandma, keep trying to ask about my life and keep getting frustrated when I tell them that “not much is going on”. Thing is, that’s the truth. I wake up, go to work, come home to eat and sleep, and then just chill out on the weekends. They can’t seem to grasp that my life really is that boring. I am not Ernest Hemingway! I don’t go on adventures every week! How do I convince them of that?",19Sep2020,1
11,"I sometimes do it on purpose, like when listening to music, when I want to be alone in my head, just me and my thoughts, to clear my mind. 
But sometimes it really feels like I lose control about it. When I'm watching a horror movie, for example, and then it can really get intense. I'm not just scared in the dark, after that, or don't wanna be alone. It's more like I'm getting more and more paranoid, - not only scared of the room and matter, but more like I'm scared of myself and what thoughts come and run through my head. It's like my head keeps spinning around, giving me more and more pictures of unrealistic things that could happen to me - and even I know it won't happen, I'm getting more and more terrified, only because I just can't feel that those fears aren't real. I know it somewhere, but I can't realise it, and that's when I start to panic and become more and more paranoid. This spiral sadly won't just stop there, it'll get higher and higher, until I start questioning reality itself and am scared of anything that I see because I'm scared of seeing something wrong that isn't there or shouldn't be. I can't realise that it's real what I'm experiencing in that exact moment. And sometimes I think I'm going crazy.

13,"**TL;DR- I really struggle to pick up social ques in real life, and on the internet it's even worse. And instead of telling me what the fuck I did wrong, even when I admit I might be autistic, people instead choose to shower me with downvotes, insults, and sometimes even death threats.**

I say ""probably not"" because my family and I never had the time or money to get an official diagnosis, but my therapist and many other people say I have signs of high functioning autism/Asperger's. It's also possible I have some other disorders, like ADHD or bipolar disorder, based on reading I did, but if you purposefully go out of your way to look for signs, it'll suddenly seem like you have every disorder. So just to keep things simple, without breaching far off too much into a million disorders, it's possible I have autism.

But ever since I was a childhood, I was absolutely horrible at picking up social ques, and even when a person outright told me something like, ""I hate that you're saying this! Can you please just stop?!"", it took me a while to get exactly what they meant, until a teacher or parent stepped in to clarify things and why.

And as I've gotten older and more experienced...it has gotten better, but not **MUCH** better honestly. I still have a really hard time understanding ""normal people's logic"", how they think, why they think what they think, and how they'll react to things I do or say.

Sometimes I've even gotten literally punched in the face, because I kept saying the wrong stuff to the wrong person, and I literally couldn't tell they were getting more and more pissed off at me.

Me: So I've heard your grandmother died. I'm sorry.

Them: It's alright.

Me: But hey, that's actually a very good thing, you know?

Them: What? What the fuck are you talking about?

Me: It **IS** good! You grow stronger, learn from loss, and you no longer have to spend money on an extra family member!

Them: Dude, that's literally the last thing I wanna hear right now.

Me: But it's true! And it is a good thing! And you'll grow even stronger when your grandfather dies, when your mother dies, when your father dies, when your aun-

And next thing I know I get punched in the face, and am on the ground getting kicked in the stomach.

Looking back at the scenario now it's very cringeworthy, and it's obvious I should've just shut my mouth, but in the moment I literally couldn't tell I was pissing them off. And for some reason, I literally can't read facial expressions either.

And on the internet...that same sort of thing happens. I say something weird or uncomfortable. The other person complains. I keep insisting. But on the internet, instead I get showered with downvotes, insults, and sometimes even death threats.

And when I try to explain I possibly have autism, people downvote me even more. So I really can't win.",19Sep2020,1

20," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk.

Another instance is when she said she booked me in for a mock interview and I said ‘is that ok?’ And I sort of turned my head away and nodded like I was being moody and I wasn’t I was just tired/lethargic and she was like ‘you could look more enthusiastic about it like’ abruptly. Is that bad? :/

I made this post back in February about a woman who I had a chance with that I didn't take because of low self esteem and social obliviousness, and, well...not much has changed in the past six months. At least not for the better. Six months of social isolation, especially when I've been described by my therapist as ""one of the most socially inclined people he's ever met"", has definitely not helped. Six months of not being able to do anything I enjoy has not helped either.

I'm now finished college, and even if there wasn't a pandemic going on right now, I would still be losing access to whatever social opportunities there might be. As I've said, there are next to no volunteer opportunities or meetup groups anywhere in my area under the best of circumstances, and since the pandemic hit there have been none at all.

I'm still really happy for her and how well things are going in her life. She really deserves all the love and happiness and success that she's been getting. I want to make it very clear that I have no resentment or bitterness or anger in me.

But at the same time, I miss her more than ever, and I regret not trying to take things to the next level more than ever. As I said last time, maybe I'm not meant to ever have a partner.

One common phrase I've heard is ""the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else"", which is not going to work since my chances of meeting anyone, whether to date or just to make a new friend, at any point the foreseeable future, are literally zero at this point.

I've also heard people give advice to immerse yourself in hobbies and spend time with friends to help yourself heal. As I've said in previous threads, everything I'm even remotely interested in doing has been shut down because of the pandemic, and I have not been able to see any of my friends for months, so this won't work either.

I can't meet anyone else. I can't spend time with my friends. My family are totally cold and non-supportive. I can't do any of my usual hobbies or activities, or start anything new, because everything that is not essential is still closed down in my area and everything that I'm interested in doing requires getting out of the house.

Essentially I'm in a position where I can't get over someone, and I can't do anything about it. I never even dated her, but I still miss her so much. It's kept me up all night twice in the past week now. I can't handle it.",19Sep2020,1

I also noticed that I not only listen to a lot of songs, but just movie or show scenes in general. Like, I’ll be watching a show that’ll have a scene of someone saying something, and a lot of times I’ll automatically think “This goes perfectly with my daydream” and then I’ll play that scene along with songs that go with my daydreams. I don’t act it out or anything either, I just pace around the house😂

I don't feel majorly stressed which is why it's weird to me, me and my mom are continually looking for ways to slow it down, we've tried CBD, Magnesium, and vitamins, but nothing has slowed them down all that much... If anyone has any questions about it, feel free to ask them seeing as I have all the time in the world. To conclude, here are a list of my ticks

- Loud humming sound
-Tightening Neck muscles
-Small cough (usually between humming)
-Tightening of the muscles around the elbow

29,"* When I told my wife for the umpteenth time that I'd appreciate it if she came to bed with me most nights, she said she didn't understand why that mattered (we haven't had sex for 11 years due a variety of factors, including her severe depression).
* My dad called me at 1am Wednesday because he'd been peeing blood all night. He has a really bad UTI, and apparently is bleeding somewhere in his bladder. Since he has to be on blood thinners, once he starts bleeding it takes forever to stop. So he gets to have a cath and a leg bag for a week.
* I didn't go to work Wednesday due to being in the ER with my dad until about 7am, I emailed managers about things that needed to happen to meet an important deadline Monday. When I got to work Thursday, only about half of those had been done.
* I found out Thursday morning that I really, really, badly hurt a friend. Someone I really cared about and would never intentionally hurt, but I can (now) see it from her point of view. She doesn't want to ever hear from me again, she made that very clear. I feel really horrible about that, it's something I can never ever make right.
* I cried more about losing said friend than I did when my mom died. I feel really horrible about that too.
* I feel like I now have only 1 friend outside of family.
* A conversation this morning reinforced that my wife will believe science until it conflicts with her religion. I've become agnostic over the years, and anti-religion.
* Ruth Bader Ginsburg died today. McConnell will ramrod through whoever Trump nominates. I honestly fear that the U.S.A. died today along with her.

35,"I grew up knowing my family had decent money but I never really identified myself with it, nor did my parents spoil me. I went through high school normally, I wasn't know as a rich kid at all. My parents grilled humbleness into me so badly that I actively hid it to please them.

 My mom told me a couple of days ago that I'd be inheriting a lot. enough to put me in the 0.01%.  I am very grateful and feel undeservingly lucky, im not sure what to make of this big picture. The logical course of life is school, get a job and save for retirement.

I'm attending uni since recently, I'm working my ass off to get a decent paying job within the industry I love. It feels off that what ill earn in a lifetime is way less than my inheritance. I want to work, i love what I'm studying.  

I've grown used to just distancing myself from it and detaching it from my identity. especially now in uni, i'm in dorms and live on an average student budget ( my parents are strong believers you need to learn to handle money responsibly through budgeting). None of my friends know, and they don't really have to. It's not relevant to who i am as a person. yet for some strange reason i constantly feel like i'm carrying around a secret.

I feel so shit that this probably won't make me happy. I have depression and i've had it since i was a small kid, I always felt so guilty that this fortunate situation is wasted on someone that is so miserable all the time. I've been able to remain hopeful and live with it for the past 4 maybe 5 months. I need passion, direction and drive to keep me going and not relapse. A very huge motivator is having to make money to afford food, rent etc. if i don't have that motivator i might just become a wallflower.

I want to become someone in my own eyes. just being born with rich parents isn't shit, it doesn't make you anything or anyone. you can get just as miserable, you die like everybody else. I'm pretty into existentialism, you could say im just immensely struggling with shaping my identity, determining my values and creating meaning.

I'm afraid people will look at me different, resent me for being lucky, make assumptions about me. Try to manipulate or take advantage of me. I don't want this to define me and I won't let it.  It feels like this background doesn't fit within my mental concept of myself. 

still I find it sad that I can only turn to reddit as an anonymous account to share what's going on in my head.",19Sep2020,1
36," I took a long weekend from work and decided to head to the beach by myself to celebrate. With tomorrow being my birthday I am going to get together with a family member I have not seen in a while to have brunch. I do not have any friends near me as I just moved to a new place for my job. Lately, feeling a bit down wondering what my purpose is in life. With turning 39, not married, no kids, only 1-2 friends to speak of and living alone I sometimes wonder if I made the right life choices. I am lucky that I have a job, pay my own bills and am self sufficient. It feels good to be able to leave when I want and go anywhere even though I am alone. Thank you all for your feel good posts and inspiration!",19Sep2020,1

39,"Hi there, you can call me Jay, 

Well my life wasn't what I expected, from 1 to 30 life was perfect. I did everything perfectly got my MBA got my undergrads taught college everytyhing was perfect. Than at 31 shit went wrong, mental inllenss struck, it all got dark I lost everything 2 sucide attempts, one that ended in a stand off with the cops on  a bridge over 20 hours and I jumped. I leapt in to oblivion and my coat my coat got caught and I survivied. Over 30 days in a mental hospital that time. Depression and anxiety and PTSD took over.

 I lost a wife of 18 years, a career my family my friends everyone. If you're reading this tonight, today or afternoon I am here to let you know someone ***cares. I hit the bottom, I was there, I detoxed in a jail cell with no one, no one fucking cared, no one came for me. I widdled away for days crying and wishing for death, I had charges and knew life had ended. I knew I was fucked and nobody cared. I know that lonliness, I know that feeling as if you're different or nobody gives a fuck. Damn, I am here, I am sorry you're going through it, I am sorry this is happening. I get it, I understand, I've been there, I ate out of garbage cans, I I jumped trains I sat in jail, I've done the the most deplorable shit that life has to offer. Take ease, listen.... Do you hurt yourself, are you unexcepted, do you feel unloved, do you feel like you could die and wouldn't matter, I am here, I am here to listen, somone cares, I promised myself if I ever got out I'd be the person I wish I was at the bottom.*** 

THats right, I got out everything I didn't walk away I ran away. I had a recent relapse with alcohol. Those feelings like you don't matter, you do matter, those feelings like you're different like life has nothing offer you. It has everything to offer, fuck them, you're worthy. I don't care about your sexuality I don't care about your race, I don't care if you're tall or short. We all could use a hug, everyone needs someone to tell them they worth it. I've seen it all death overdose, people institutionalized forever. Those that are mistreated and beat and left to die. THose that self injure and are left to wither and aren't cared for..... Fuck that shit youi're loved and worthy of love, I know how lonely it is, I know what a life of nothing of life feels like. I know whats it like to suffer and wonder if someone any will save you. Maybe nobody comes, nobody comes nobody owes you shit, but this guy, this dude here right is here to tell you 24 visits to the mental hospital, 4 six month programs in recovery, being told I can kill myself.... I am here to telll you hold on for one day, I am here to tell you from someone that been there I love you. 

That bridge, I brought a lot of booze and meth, I sat up there somking my meth and drining my booze. I unloaded on the cops and life in general, I told them how much they could go fuck themselves, I told them how much nobody cares about us ( the homeless addicted) I told them about the disabled like my daughter, I told them about a life of success, I smoked my meth, and drank and my booze and for once I felt free. For once I had been recognized I shut down a fucking city, traffic was tied up for days, everyone was yelling at me, those that were on their way to work told me to kill myself. THe cops tried to stop me, nobody was going to stop me I ran out of booze and meth and jumped. I jumped and my coat got caught despite literally 100's wathching on TV and those there that day I jumped, I igorned every single and jumped. 

I am here to say you don't have to jump you don't suffer what I did, there is help. I am here to say I am doing better and despite a minor relapse I hear you, you are heard, life can get better and has for me despite my struggles especially my recent relapse. You're worth it, you're someone and cared for if by no one by me. This doesn't have to be end it can be a new begginning, I am sorry for what you're struggles are, I know how you're feeling, I've been there. Please don't hurt yourself anymore get help and I am here. I am here to listen, I am here to let you know that life has so much to offer and let you **know I lost everything but I gained the opportunity to talk to you today, and for that I am grateful, hold on my friend....**",19Sep2020,1
41,"My husband and I work full time as managers while raising two young boys. A ten year old and an 18 month old. About two years ago my MIL moved back home from Florida after being kicked out of her brothers. She came with nothing what so ever.  I money, barely any clothing etc. The day she drove into our home state, the car she had died. She junked it for $200 to support her cigarette habit. We took her in (I was only pregnant at this time) began supporting her cigarette habit (after we ourselves quite to save money) I even paid out of pocket for her medication a few times. That’s what family does. Over the next year or so, MIL was fighting for her social security benefits to be approved. We supported her the whole time. We were the only ones who helped her during this time. Finally a few months ago her benefits were approved. She received almost 3 grand in her first retroactive lump sum and an allowance of $800 the first of every month there after. We were not expecting anything what so ever. By this time I had the baby and had returned to work full time. My husband and I work opposite shifts but overlap for an hour each day. Of course she helped with our child care and the household duties. Her being with us made my life easier. Free childcare and a picked up home to come home to. Where it gets sticky is when family members began telling me how much MIL complains about watching the baby. Remind you when I get home from work she is always telling me to relax and the baby is fine with her in the living room. While I’m at work during the day she goes in and takes the baby allowing my husband to rest before he heads into work. What is being told by her is overall she constantly has our 18 month old and does everything and all around the house. Making my husband and I out to work and relax while she is raising our sons. I have brought this up to her before but she denies ever saying anything negative. Clearly the group of people didn’t come together and make it up. I’m grateful she helps us with childcare so we are able to work and takes some of household stress off of my shoulders. Now that she actually has income we still did not expect rent from her bc she babysits while we work. What she did with the lump sum was buy her youngest child a used car when he was in need, fill his gas tank up, pay the registration, fix the brakes etc. that’s all fine we are happy she is helping my husbands brother. What is getting under my skin is that when it comes to us, she still will ask us to buy her cigarettes which I would still do once or twice a week, I stop for a coffee on the way home from work I make sure to bring her one, bough her a bathing suit bc she didn’t have one, two pairs of sneakers bc she left everything in FL. Two weeks ago we ran out of propane and had no hot water. She offered to pay half of the bill ($200) the next day came and any time I brought up paying the bill she ignored it. Finally I asked her if she was going to help like she offered and she reluctantly agreed. She gives me her card and as I’m calling in the payment she begins her poor me act. All her money is gone, she doesn’t even have socks, doesn’t even have this that. So I felt funny and instead paid $100 on her card. Our microwave was on the way out, she kept saying she was going to buy a new one well don’t you know it the microwave kicks the bucket and she didn’t do shit. I went out and got a new one myself. We’re adults we can buy our own things but don’t offer and then flake. But for two years you have lived with us for FREE. We supported you and yet yesterday she asked me to see if MY mother would give us some laundry detergent bc we were all out. I told her I will buy my own detergent but what I was thinking is..REALLY YOU CANT SPEND $10 on laundry detergent for the household?! She will have us driver her 30 mins away to pick  up her friend then drive back to drop him off but won’t offer gas when I mention the gas light is on. Now that I’m aware of the nonsense she tells people I make sure our toddler is with me at all times and I ignore her when she tells me to leave him, he is fine with her. She was given an apartment thru a church community but will share it with a roommate. Once her benefits were approved she wS supply to begin paying rent and belong to pay cable. Bottom line, she wants to free load. She complains about our house but won’t go to the apartment bc out of the $800 monthly check half would go to rent and cable and the other her smoking habit. My point is, we are not asking for rent but picking up some laundry detergent or helping with the utilities the one time I needed help. I looked into childcare and my husband and I make just over the maximum amount for any assistance. Without assistance, daycare runs over $200 weekly. That’s almost our rent total. We can’t afford it. Do I suck it up bc we need the child care or do I resort to having to adjust my work schedule so either my husband or I will be home with the kids and telling her to kick rocks?! We have three incomes coming into the household but only two contributing.",19Sep2020,1

43,"The first relationship I was ever in ended in me getting abused. I let it happen because I prioritized my future goals. It hurt and it took three tries for him to finally accept the break up. I was physically abused very early on but I felt as if communication would fix it. He was 8 years older than me and we dated for about a year and a half.

I tend to be very submissive and have a hard time asserting my needs. I have been raised in a  very christian community and a broken home life. I have been able to come to terms with my anxiety and depression but I feel like I have a very difficult time feeling love for someone else in a relationship. 

I thought I loved my ex because I felt a physical attachment brought on by him being my first sexual partner. However I tried to be logical and that only made me go insane because I was no treated right at all. After a year and a half he never complimented me and only talked about school and his interests. The only thing he provided was that he had a bed and that he would cook for me. This was not viable.

I am currently in an online relationship but he and I are afraid that I am too young and too unpracticed to be able to understand what a relationship is. I never loved anyone as much as him but I  and he are afraid that it is only a comparison. I believe it is more than that and I really do like him more but I just need some opinions to sort this out and move on. 

tldr: had abusive ex (did not describe everything) for first ever relationship. Don't know how to process feelings because of ultra christian upbringing and little experience",19Sep2020,1

46,"I (25M) have been friends with a girl I'll call Kelsey (25F) for several years now, ever since my sophomore year of university where we initially met via mutual friends. She's been in my circle of friends for years now and we both ended up getting good full-time jobs here in our college town. When I first met Kelsey years ago, she and I were both in relationships. I thought she was a pretty girl with an incredible body (big butt and 34 F boobs with a small waist), but my thoughts didn't go further than that and I was also obsessed with my then-girlfriend (we were in the honeymoon stage too). Kelsey and I were always friendly and went to the the same parties and events and we added one another on social media, along with the rest of the people in our circle.

Here's where I'm going to sound like a douche. As the year went on and I kept seeing Kelsey around at events and parties, I couldn't help but notice that her boobs were gradually getting bigger and bigger every time I saw her. I know that sounds creepy, but I'm a big boob guy, so it was really hard not to notice. Especially because her bras would quickly become too small for her, so her boobs would always be jiggling everywhere and I know I'm not the only one in our circle who noticed. lol

This has been a trend for years now and Kelsey's chest has kept growing the entire time. I developed a crush on Kelsey about 1.5 years after knowing one another (and by this time, her boobs had probably doubled in size since her original size of 34 F). I felt so awful about this crush because I was still with my girlfriend who I really loved. My girlfriend had C cups, which were really nice and perky and attractive, but I couldn't stop wondering what it would be like to be with Kelsey and her huge boobs. I know that makes me sound like a huge douche, and trust me, I hated myself for feeling this way. I kept these feelings to myself and was respectful around Kelsey whenever I saw her and really tried to keep my head on straight.

My girlfriend and I stayed together for years, while both still socializing with our friend group including Kelsey. We broke up around 2 years ago and I got into another relationship with someone else. Kelsey had started dating someone new while I was with my old girlfriend and I tried to forget about the fantasy of being with her because it looked like they were getting quite serious and they talked about getting engaged all the time.

Fats forward to today. Lo and behold, Kelsey and her boyfriend broke up about 3 weeks ago and I have been single for almost a year now. This is the first time Kelsey and I have ever been single at the same time. Also, Kelsey's boobs clearly haven't stopped growing. I saw her a a few days ago in person and over this whole covid thing, her boobs have literally ballooned past her belly button. Her shirt, which I've seen her wear many times before, literally looked 10x smaller on her than it did several months ago and like it was about to burst any second as she breathed in and out... I about lost it. I had this huge boner I was trying to hide with my arms and I'm praying she didn't notice. lol Super super awkward situation.

One of our mutual friends said Kelsey has to get custom-made bras now because her cup size isn't even sold by regular bra companies. I can't stop fantasizing about what her cup size is now and I'm dying of curiosity, but I don't think I could ever ask her that. Apparently she's also getting a lot of back pain now. I also have been wondering if she has a health condition or something that causes excess growth like macromastia, but either way I can't deny how attracted I am to her. I've even had wet dreams about her and instant boners as soon as I think about her or see photos of her online.

It's become a bit uncomfortable for me because not only is Kelsey my friend who I doubt has any suspicion that I like her, but it seems wrong to objectify her huge boobs, especially if she has macromastia or something, which I strongly suspect she does have. I keep fantasizing about her boobs just growing bigger and bigger her entire life and all the things I would do with her and boobs if we were in a relationship. I do genuinely really love her personality and mind but I'm terrified that I'm objectifying her based on a fetish and that's what is holding me back from trying to flirt with her or confess how I feel. I am scared I'm fetishing Kelsey and I know she doesn't deserve that. I know women with macromastia go through a lot and that it can get very painful. At the same time, my feelings are getting stronger and stronger even though I have tried fighting them.

I have stayed respectful the entire time I've known her and now that we are both single, I the think tiger is trying to break out of its cage after keeping my feelings and attraction to myself for years and I don't know where to go next. Kelsey is a really sweet and sensitive girl, and we've had a lot of deep talks over the years honestly so I know her well. She's a real and sweetheart outside of the body and boobs and I do think she'd be a great girlfriend. Help, Reddit. I don't want to mess this up nor our friendship and I don't want to confuse lust with a genuine crush. What should I do?

TLDR: I (25M) am very attracted to my friend (25F) of several years and I am scared of messing up our friendship and that I'm objectifying her.",19Sep2020,1
47," 

As of writing this right now, im starting to realize i am not as afraid of death as i thought i was. And even then, it wasnt as much of a fear. I think the more i think about it, the more im comfortable with having my life end. The more i think about it, its not suicidal. Suicide has such a negative thought. I mean, like whats the difference between that and getting hit by a bus by being at the wrong place at the wrong time? There really is none rather than the source of death. Why is ending your own life such a bad thing. Because it hurts others? Others can get over it. While you yourself cant even get over your own self. Take me for instance. Im fucking terriefied of my future. Im terrified if i’ll actually be financially stable, if ill be happy with someone, if i, nope. I cant even think of anything else. Im just fucking scared. With that being said, death will and can be a cure to that. However, its not the only cure. But a cure nonetheless. A last resort if you will, if i ever reach that point. People think suicide is selfish. Because they say “think of those who will hurt when youre gone”. But is that not them being selfish instead? Want yourself to be happy while the person who wants to just have it all done and gone suffer day after day. Month after month. Year after year. Is it really justifiable to say “they are selfish because they were hurting for months or years on end which feel like an eternity in their mind and they decided to be free of that pain by their own hand but now i have to deal with emotions where i know i will get over them in a given time?”. I think of my future as a coping skill to push forward because of how scared i am of anything that can go wrong in my future that will impact me negatively mentally. I think of how happy i will be with someone. With a potential family. Happy with my life. But in reality, i dont even know if i will get to that point. I thought about the last note i wrote. How im scared of my mental health. And even though its been 4 months, i still feel the same. I feel like im finally seeing myself for who i truly am. I am there for others because i cannot be there for myself and maybe that feeling and connection is the only way i can feel connected to myself. I am not a happy person like i project myself. I have created a skin tight mask to overlay my sadness and fear. I feel myself wanting to break down and cry more often and even so, its too much. And its around maybe once a month. I shouldnt be feeling that way. I just want to be happy but my fear blocks that from happening. And i dont know how to get over it. Perhaps i never will. I am ok with dying. I dont want it to be of my hand, but i feel like if the chance happens to come, i will take it with relief and assurance that everyone that i talk to, everyone that i bother with my feelings and complaints, they will be ok. They will no longer have to worry about me like they do, if they do. I do that enough for myself. Death is a part of life. It comes early, it comes late. Your time comes when it comes. No matter the hand its dealt by. The people who know i love them dearly, know that i do with all my heart. Ive read that ADHD can suppress dopamine and have a imbalance of serotonin. And while i didnt know the exact way or emotions before i looked those two words up, ive felt that for a LONG time. And now i know why and what exactly it is that i feel the way i do. What im lacking in influences the way i feel and there is no way of me controlling it except the uses of medications. Which i am completely fine using. But it doesnt always help in the way i want to feel. I dont understand how people can go through life and just live it and be happy. Like what the fuck? I wish i could do that. Give a care free fuck of life. The shit i would do to be ADHD-free. I really feel that holds me back in life, makes me clingy, makes me overthink, gives me anxiety, lack focus, and takes away my will to do things that i know i need to do and TRY  to do as much as i can. I swear, ADHD will be the death of me. My tipping point. I dont know how but my life would be so much easier without it. For myself and everyone around me. No one would have to put up with me if i were normal. People say i am normal with my adhd when i say im not. Well, theyre wrong. They dont see how easy everything in my life would be if i didnt have it. If i didnt SUFFER from it. I just want to be happy, and im afraid ill never be that on my own. And when people say, you cant make others happy if you dont make yourself happy, doesnt help because THAT IS what makes me happy. Im not suicidal. I dont want to kill myself, but i just want these thoughts to end. If that makes sense.",19Sep2020,1
48,"I recently had the opportunity to travel home and see my family. It's important to note that, excluding the actual travel, I followed proper guidelines prior to and since the visit. Stayed home for three weeks beforehand. Displayed no symptoms. Will be staying a further three weeks, and getting tested if any symptoms arise.

Now, I live almost 900 miles from ""home"", and have loved away from home for almost seven years. So I don't see my relatives often. And I don't keep in contact much, because I'm no longer on Facebook.

But while home, I only really spent time with my parents. Everyone else (aunt/uncle, grandparents, sister/brotber-in-law) I only saw at brunch for about an hour. I likely won't be home again until Thanksgiving or Christmas, and that *really* depends on COVID numbers at those times. It's not looking good.

But after brunch, I had the opportunity to see everyone except my grandparents and hang out with them for a while at my parents' place. And I skipped out to play boardgames with a couple of my best friends. These are people that I regularly play D&amp;D and videogames with online. And the whole time, and even now, I don't regret it. I had a blast. Then came home and had a movie night with my parents. But I don't feel at all bothered that I skipped seeing my sister and brother-in-law more, along with my aunt and uncle. I get along with the former very well, and the latter helped raise me when I was young.

The only thing that still catches me on this is that I know that *they* probably think I should feel bad. And in a roundabout way, it almost feels like the only thing that bothers me is how they might think of me.

Also, smoking isn't allowed in the building.

I minded my own business and ignored him as I walked by. Figured maybe he's waiting on a friend etc.

His veins and his heart is

He makes me laugh and giggle, and even think about things that I hadn't thought about in a while. However, my professor just ruined my whole entire day.

59,"Alright. So me and my family are a broke family from Brazil without U.S. citizenship or Green Card, and we've never had the time or money for **ANY** mental health illness diagnosis.

The first plausible mental illness I might have is autism, according to my free therapist, and a few other free therapist I had before him.

However...when I do research online...it might seem I have more than just autism.

Now, when you purposefully look shit up looking for signs, it might seem like you got every mental disorder in existence, so it might not be a good thing...but I think I might've noticed signs of bipolar. And my dad took note of it too, not just me.

But basically...I have really high moods, and really low moods. I would've said they're just mood swings, but they seem a bit more complicated than just that.

But here's the thing...my mood is usually really bad when I'm tired, but then really good when I'm well rested. So it's more or less a sleep thing. At least about 95% of the time.

But when my mood is bad...I'm very angry at the world. I feel pissed off by everyone. I can't enjoy anything. It seems like the world is against me. I get this idea to burn bridges with everyone on my social media, and make a public post on Instagram or Facebook lying about how I ""got a scat fetish and love to play with an eat poop"", just so I can shock everyone and they unfriend me, because I'm super pissed off at them. I'm super pissed off at them for leaving me on read. For not giving me longer responses despite me having written paragraphs and paragraphs to them. Etcetera.

But when my mood is good, I suddenly understand that being left on read most likely has nothing to do with me, and that the other person is just more busy than anything else, and I'm literally not mad at all anymore. And I suddenly wanna keep all my friends for the rest of my life. And I suddenly enjoy things frequently and very easily. Music seems way better. Food seems way tastier. Video games seem more fun. And so on and so forth.

Now I don't know what exactly this is...they could just simply be really bizarre mood swings, and I'm neurotypical after all. Or it could be bipolar disorder.

Something else it could also be, is ""angry depression"", for the lack of a better word. I'm depressed in an angry manner, but later on in the day after getting good rest I'm back on my feet.

But yeah...I'm not a doctor, so I don't know. And you guys aren't either, so you likely can't help me all the way, but hopefully at least point me in the right direction or something.",19Sep2020,1

68,"TW: suicide

I deactivated my social media accounts because things have been becoming more toxic each day in all of my accounts. The only account I have left that interacts with real people out there is my email and Reddit. I'm 23 and since high school, I've had several breakdowns in a month, but I realized that it has gotten worse and now, I have breakdowns daily. Few of my friends that were originally part of my support system are no longer part of it because they, too, have become helpless. A lot of posts here in Reddit have also become characterized of being tired, sad, demotivated, suicidal, etc., which is pretty surprising, considering I haven't subscribed to new subreddits for almost a year now. 

I just realized that we're all becoming worse. Our mental health has become more unstable over the past months or perhaps years (I can't say for sure about this because mine have been decrepit since high school). Funny how I can say that my younger self was far better off than my present self.

I was convinced that I was doing the right thing leaving her before the first year in the university which eventually has been damn tough one. BUT. Before her I had had another relationships that ended just like that. I was convinced as well that before the graduation school exams I was to be more into them than her. While she was getting on my nerves about not seeing each other very often, she had been in the same situation and had her exams coming in a few months. That was the final argument for me that it was the end. I tried to talk to her about the thing but she didn’t want to accept the truth that we both needed to have to study more. I am still recalling what exactly I’ve said to each of them. And it is so similar like I wanted to get going alone without “the cargo”. Probably it’s close to the truth. 
I don’t know, now it’s a ballast for me, these situations, although I dropped it long ago. I recalled it many times but it was nothing about my emotions or hurting my psychological condition unlike now. It was only a part of thoughts of my past and the decisions I made. Now I have thought of it from the different angle. I have though it could’ve taken that part of me that is creative. It feels now like I’ve ruined my soul.

71,"Its nothing new. I've hit her before. Over 6 years starting in freshman year of high school, our fights must've gotten physical at least 50 times by now. Nobody could keep count. Not the neighbors, not my parents, not her parents, not even her have called the police. She's so much smaller than me. She's 5 ft and I'm 6 ft if I lie to myself (really I'm a couple inches shorter). Its never even really been a fight between us. Maybe its because I'm insecure. Maybe its because I resent her for forcing me into this relationship. Maybe I'm just truly evil and there was never any other way for me to turn out. Maybe I was always destined to be the man my father was.

There is one thing new about this time though. My mom walked in. Mother dearest walked in on me with my hands on my girlfriend. The woman who raised me. The woman who stood up to my own father beating her. She walked in on me with my hands on another woman. It was about 3 am and I was stone sober. I have no excuses. I can't blame this on any drug. The thing that I will remember the most is her blood on my hands that I discretely washed off while my mother was arguing with my girlfriend.

It started when I asked her to use a lighter blanket when sleeping. She sweats like a pig at night so I wanted her to use a throw blanket instead of the heavy comforter. She fought me on it and I blew. It got physical and she started crying. Cue me covering her mouth forcefully, slapping her, and telling her to shut the fuck up. She was screaming so loud there was no way my mother wasn't going to come in. She was screaming so loud there was no way the neighbors didn't hear. It's fucked up, but I've always thought that maybe the neighbors don't call the cops on us because we hear them in similar situations as us. Some nights, I can hear the man I'll be in 20 years beating his wife in front of his children because she won't smile more. His car is even the same color as mine.

Mom came in and told gf she needs to move out and back to her parents. Its probably for the best, but for my gf it's a punishment. Idk why I call her my gf. This is no relationship I ever wanted to be in. Its a punishment for my girlfriend because apparently her parents and brother would get physical with her when she was younger. I don't want to punish her but I think its best if we seperate.

I can't help but to cry for myself. I know I'm not the victim and things are so much harder for her, but I can't imagine where I go from here. Of course its r/self and not r/others so ill talk about myself whether you fucking like it or not. Honestly I think about buying a shotgun at Academy and just shooting myself in the fucking parking lot. I don't see any other way to get away from myself and the things I've done.

I reread my post and can't make any sense of it. I don't even feel like I've explained anything well. What could there be to explain, I'm a pos. How could I explain myself when I dont even understand why I act like this? I just hope she moves out and back to her parents soon so whatever path I go down, she's not involved.",19Sep2020,1

Being a rock in a stream. A clog in an artery. 

Let's just say, they cramp my style. And they've taken over, they've won a critical mass of positions of power basically worldwide, and they're whole ideology is ""Stop! We have progressed far enough. We should head back towards the ideal time to be alive, 1955, at the very least. Sure, women would be subservient and white people would own black slaves again, but that's just a small price to pay to fulfill our indoctrinated nostalgia for a vague ideal past that never actually existed"".

Why is it fair that the actions of people in power now are are able to effect me for decades if 1 individual dies?

I mean for fucks sake. I was 16 when Trump was elected and I'm 20 now. If a new justice is chosen, then they'll be on the bench probably for another 20 or 30 years. By that time I'll be in my 40s or 50s. Why? Why the fuck is is ok for fucking morons in bumfuck Alabama to elect mostly old conservatives, who then are able to control the majority of the highest court in the nation for decades and effect the future of one kid in a very blue state. 

And dont get me started on Trump. When he was elected I said ""fuck it at least it will be kind of funny to watch him fuck up."" Then the fucking virus comes and as 200,000 people died, Trump downplayed its dangers. All while is moron supporters suck his cock and make excuses. ""Oh Trump doesnt want to cause a panic it was for the good of the nation"" or ""He didnt mean to say we should inject lysol he was joking."" Like, mother fucker no all he cares about, all ANY POLITICIAN cares about is getting reelected. It's like a game of fucking chess and we're the pieces.

83,"I have lived in the western part of Massachusetts all my live right before the wilderness takes hold while also being around a well urbanized center. In my opinion, it was the happiest medium I could have asked for. To put it in rough terms, there is the right leaning rural folk and the liberal leaning city folk (politically speaking) with our house being right in the middle practically. I will not lie, it is a cul de sac with more than enough space between each house. A well off neighborhood with good nature  folks living in it. It was not uncommon to share a beer with the next door neighbor after mowing the lawn and cleaning the garden on a hot summer day. I am thankful for having grown up there and I would love to see my kids grow up in the same kind of environment.

The USA at the moment is at a real crossroads. It's very easy to the point of almost seeming logical to think ""this place is a dump"". It's understandable. All you need to do is look into any r/politics post and see the angst of how awful the USA is. And it's easy to see why. We've influence with our allies to the point where they do not even recognize who we are anymore, on the surface. Our leaders are cozening up to dictators across the seas and selling arms to states who kill journalists. And on the inside, healthcare is not guaranteed for the middle class and students graduating from college already owe so much debt to the point they are carrying a house on their backs. African Americans are getting killed even in their own homes by law enforcement on levels nothing less than obscene. Children are getting blown away in their own classrooms.  

Things are not good right now. It's easy to see. I recognize how frustrating, downright insulting and dangerous some of the policies coming out of Washington are right now or the complete lack thereof. You may be thinking of leaving the USA, you the citizen. Granted, I don't know your story. I am sure you have your reasons to say ""enough is enough"".  I write to you today to say ""don't"". Don't do it. If you leave, the political forces in power right now will only get stronger continuing their damage to our could be even greater nation. 

Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again"" is fraught with racism especially when you pair it with his speeches. There was a time though when we truly kicked ass and for the good! I am speaking particularly to aiding our allies in Europe during WWII and completing mega projects like the Interstate Highway system and the Hoover dam. The goddamn moon landing. We have what it takes. We have slipped down a path of ruin these past three decades and I write to you today to say ""enough is enough"". We can retake the helm. For our good, for our family's good.  

I know our soul is intact despite the destruction we have grown accustomed to seeing everyday the past four years. Don't forget, Trump was outvoted by three million Americans and the house was washed blue in 2018. We need to keep the speed up this November. The passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg will not be without consequence. For starters it prompted me to write this wall today and you are here reading it. Already things are happening. More importantly, the fate of the US Supreme Court is now very much on the table and the decision will could very well determine its trajectory for decades to come effecting millions of lives both living and yet to live.

I used to be a very confident speaker, but now, I struggle with talking to a larger group, as I'm afraid of them laughing at me or me not being able to convince them in an argument.

But from then on, I was super insecure about my decisions, always thinking that my eyes were failing me. In addition to that, the kids didn't listen to me when I told them that I need a break before the next match, so I didn't have enough time to thoroughly check that I was writing down the results properly.

Hello -- my name is Titus; I was born with a disease known as ""Primary Hyperparathyroidism"" \[PHPT\] , as well as another condition known as ""Hypermobile Spectrum Disorder"" \[HSD\] (a condition closely associated with, and almost exactly identical to, Ehler-Danlos Syndrome \[EDS\]).

PHPT is a disease in which one of the parathyroid glands (the glands which regulate your Parathyroid Hormone \[PTH\], which regulates your blood levels) becomes overactive; the resulting (more common) symptoms include loss of bone density (osteoporosis), kidney stones, GERD, vomiting, constipation, feelings of fatigue, brain fog, and (for me the worst) cognitive impairment and emotional dysregulation (the most apt metaphor I've found being Alzheimer's).

HSD is a genetic disease that causes, among other things, hypermobility, loose joints, joint pain, frequent subluxation (an incomplete or partial dislocation of the joints), spatial awareness problems known as ""proprioception"" (I frequently run into doorframes when trying to enter or leave a room, or cut myself while trying to cut up veggies), brain fog, chronic fatigue, gastrological dysfunction (stomach issues), PoTS (dizziness upon standing), anxiety, and sleep disorders (thought to be brought about by much of the pain those with HSD experience).

Throughout my childhood, I frequently complained to doctors and mental health professionals about the issues I was experiencing, only to be met with disdain and cries of hypochondria.

By the time I reached middleschool, I began frequently self-harming, and became preoccupied with thoughts of suicide -- I was pulled from public schooling and homeschooled (in seclusion) throughout most of my time growing up.

By the time I reached my freshman year in highschool, self-harm had become my only real coping mechanism. I went back to try and ""re-integrate"" in the ninth grade, but couldn't focus in school; I tried very hard and, despite acknowledgment from my peers and my teachers that I was highly intelligent (regularly placing in the highest percentiles in all standardized testing, *particularly* in English comprehension/composition), I couldn't keep up with the curriculum, frequently studying myself into a two-week hole that would take weeks (or even months) to recuperate from.

I spent nearly my entire life alone, until, in my late teens, I met a woman by the name of Skylar on a roleplaying site. We got to know each other over the years and, after becoming good friends, met in person.

In her mold-ridden, 300 sq. ft. apartment (that she shared with her two furry babies), we fell in love, and quickly became intimate -- she had grown up abused by her step-father; she had grown up as much a recluse as I had, and so we were each other's first in nearly every way (waiting some years until we were engaged to actually engage in intercourse).

I had come from Florida (where I was still a student) to Iowa to meet her, but after some weeks of a Summer romance, returned to Florida to resume my education; we agreed that, after graduating, we would move in together.

Within six months, however, my issues with the (still then) undiagnosed PHPT resurfaced, and I was (once again) hospitalized for suicidal indentations; by this point, my relationship with my family had all but deteriorated, and so in the December of that same year, I moved back to Iowa to resume our cohabitation.

Her bed was a twin; her apartment had practically no heating; when it snowed, water ran down her apartment walls (we had to move electronics away from the leaks in the ceiling).

And yet, some of my happiest memories are of holding her in my arms, whispering dark secrets into her ear, carefully learning every inch of her body as we and her two cats struggled to stay warm against the Iowa winters.

Within a few weeks of moving in, her grandfather (who had been experiencing a sharp decline in his health over the course of the last several months) passed away, and I got to meet her family.

They took an instant disliking of me, and after an incident (that was a mutual error on both sides) at her grandfather's wake, I was returned home to her apartment while she went to have dinner with her relatives.

Whatever was said about me, she finally decided she'd had enough of her family (she'd already been struggling with them for some years), and we moved to Des Moines together (where, after only a few applications, I was offered a decent paying job).

Trudging miles through the snow to get to work, with no transportation and no actual home yet to speak (I'd found a ""extended stay"" hotel for us to hunker in while looking for more permanent lodging), we began trying to setup our own lives in downtown -- we struggled (like all young people without family support) with finances and employment (I quickly lost the job we'd moved there for as an Internet helpdesk worker after attempting to down a bottle of anxiety pills while on the clock); downtown was expensive; crime was awful; neither of us felt safe where we lived; and my health (both physical, mental, and cognitive) continued to decline (my fiancé had grown accustomed waking up to my morning vomiting by this point).

Finally, after nearly two decades of being accused of hypochondria, I began to self-medicate through a combination of marijuana and alcohol, and (for some time) it worked; I had two jobs, and was going to full-time school again.

Until, after a little over six months, I collapsed mid-sentence, arguing with my (after two years in Des Moines) now fiancé about some of my recent mood fluctuations.

I was rushed to the hospital, tests were ran, and, after almost twenty years (one adolescents worth) of complaints, finally found out that I had an excess of calcium;

PHPT.

It was easily cured; a couple thousand dollar operation, and a lifetime of confusion could be settled.

Unfortunately, my vitamin D was also low -- this is almost always the case in PHPT, but can sometimes occurs in ""secondary Hyperparathyroidism"" (a condition that is only ever the result of two things, kidney failure and malignancy).

PHPT is nearly always coupled with low vitamin D -- higher levels of vitamin D result in higher levels of blood calcium which, in normal circumstances, is not a problem, because the parathyroid glands regulate accordingly, but in people with an overreactive nodes, vitamin D can cause higher levels of calcium, which can lead to what is known as a ""parathyroid crisis"" (which, without immediate surgery to remove the node, is always fatal).

Insurance would not pay for the surgery unless I fixed my vitamin D levels, but with several experts warning me of the dangers of vitamin D treatment, I refused to take the supplement.

For years, we struggled under the weight of financial hardship; despite several GoFundMe attempts, we could not save money for the surgery ourselves, even attempting to move in with relatives, who (despite promising safety and security while we tried to obtain my surgery at the Parathyroid Clinic in Tampa) soon kicked us out, and we were forced to retreat (broke and nearly homeless) back to Iowa.

We stayed with her grandmother for several months before finally getting our own apartment in Perry, but by this point, my condition had only worsened -- my marijuana usage (which had only been intended as a short-term solution) had grown into a dependency, and I began to use concentrated vape pens.

Now, whatever your feelings of the medicinal value of marijuana are, I **would not be here writing this if it weren't for my self-medicating**. By the time we had moved back from Florida to Perry and began renting our own apartment again, pretending to be ""normal"" (that is to say, not actively hurting myself) was nearly impossible, and by this point I had learned better than to tell a therapist or hospital workers of my mental state (despite what you may have heard, psychiatric wards help nobody, except to make you feel less human).

PHPT is a part of your adrenal system and, as such, the disorder could be categorized as an adrenal dysfunction (in hindsight, if my adrenal gland was a thermostat, it felt like somebody was cranking it all the way up and then all the way back down...all the time...); when you tell this to therapists, they urge you to a doctor. Go to a doctor, they urge you to see a therapist.

Go to a psychiatrist and ask them the affects their medication will have on your condition, and they simply reply with a shrug and a ""do you want the pills or not?""

What's more, much of the side affects of psychiatric medication can mirror health conditions, and the last thing I wanted was another reason for my doctors to write me off as ""just suffering side affects"".

Suffice it to say, there was no real help for me; the only help came in the form of my self-medication (which, to give you an idea, was so affective, that my fiancé threatened to leave me should I ever discontinue taking my ""medicine"").

Until, as stated, with my tolerance peaked, I began to dabble with THC pens.

Cannabis, in of itself, is not dangerous. It has been used for millennia to treat chronic pain. However, much like how natives used to chew on the coca leaf (the plant ground down to produce cocaine) to obtain a result similar to drinking a modern expresso, high concentrations of anything can (and will) be fatal.

In many vape pens, CBD (the part associated with pain relief) is missing; this is also the component that causes the ""chill"" affect of the herb, and balances out the psychedelic affects of THC.

To say the least, high dosages of psychedelic's ***does not mix*** with an adrenal disorder, and I experienced what can only be referred to as ""full psychosis"".

It has been almost a year, and I still regularly wake up, remembering things I said and did to my fiancé...

...my love...

...my best (and only) friend...

Within a few months of starting the pens, there was an incident at the apartment, and we were evicted -- faced with my abuse (and mourning over what, to her, was the ""death"" of her husband), and at the urging of her friends and family, she came home to the hotel we were staying at, grabbed her things, and left, saying she was being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

I received one final text from her,

&lt;3

and then she was gone.

I stayed at the hotel for about a month with the last of our funds -- we had nothing to eat there, and I wasn't well enough to retrieve my own food, and lost almost 30 pounds in just as many days.

I regularly sent my mother goodbye messages, as I contemplated ending my own life in the tub of the hotel.

Eventually, I found a crisis rehabilitation center, and was admitted for around 45 days of (daily) psychiatric evaluation -- hitting the limit of how long I could stay there, I moved back to a shelter in Des Moines, where I continued struggling, daily, to eat and sleep; suffering still with the psychiatric aspects (and a distinct lack of natural supports or individuals that could comprehend or empathize with my condition), I watched daily as cars went by, and tried to convince myself that, if I could get the surgery, I could bring my love back,

tried to convince myself *not to jump in front of one*, as I'd watched another individual at the shelter do my first week.

""I can't do it anymore...after breakfast, I'm killing myself...""

""She's not coming back...if I haven't heard from her by the time I get done calling these doctors, I'm killing myself...""

""Lunch is as far as I can possibly make it...""

I would sob to my mother over borrowed cellphones (I didn't have my own at the time), asking her to convince me that, really, I hadn't said or done those horrible things to my favorite person in the world.

Those phonecalls are the only thing that kept me from ending it.

Then, a couple of months after starting in the shelter (known as Bethel Ministries Men's Shelter), there was an incident, and I was permanently kicked out. I went to another shelter in downtown Des Moines; it had no beds; we couldn't sleep on the floor; we had to sleep in chairs.

It was 30 below; the back pain I had sitting there was some of the most excruciating I've ever been in; I remember repeating to myself, over and over again,

""I will not sleep outside...I will not sleep outside...""

I had no winter jacket, and yet the thought of dying in the bitter cold seemed like a sweet release from the pain and suffering I was experiencing.

I even told me mother that next morning that, if we couldn't find someplace else for me to stay, that I would be staying outside that night.

Then, that afternoon, it happened:

a scan came back.

They'd found the Parathyroid node on a sestamibi scan.

I'd found the first endocrinologist in almost three years that **actually** understood the disorder, and knew what to look for. I'd had repeated scans over the years, but, on around the 6th or 7th one, there it was,

the top left node.

Insurance would pay for the surgery.

At the same time, my county representative (who'd I'd met at Safe Harbor) found a group home that would take my case -- we'd been working on it for months, but on practically the same day I was approved for surgery, the group home agreed to take me, and (understanding my predicament) expedited the process, so I would have an actual bed to sleep on.

A church (again, knowing my predicament) got me a week in a hotel room; it had a stovetop; after months in the shelter, constantly sick off of food I couldn't actually eat (supplemented by foodstamps to buy things I actually could), I enjoyed my own cooking once again.

I moved from the hotel to Burlington; around two months later (less than six months after my fiancé had left), I had my surgery.

It's been roughly six months since I received the surgery, and I'm finally beginning to understand what it feels like to be ""human"" again (after a lifetime of being sick, I can't say I ever knew what it was like to begin with).

I struggle, daily, to get things done (having been diagnosed a few months after the surgery with HSD); much still hurts; I am filing for disabilities but, in the meantime, have no income, and (despite how grateful I am not to be living in a shelter), my group home does not care in the slightest about my recovery from PHPT, nor my HSD (despite documentation, they believe I'm a lazy hypochondriac).

I fear, daily, that my county funding will fall through, and that I will be forced to live in a shelter once again.

I still dream, daily, of my first (and only) love.

My family still will do nothing to help me, despite understanding my condition.

My church has altogether abandoned me; in hindsight, I was only valued when I could offer something, not when I required help.

The few friends I did have, have fallen out of touch, living the days of young adults -- going to college, getting married, having kids, working full-time jobs, taking out mortgages, traveling,

and I'm here, going to occupational therapy to learn how to conserve enough energy to make meals, and still be able to take a shower afterwards.

I am 26; I've missed so much; friends, lovers, school,

I feel as though I've been entirely forgotten by the world around me.

Not forgotten, never known.

Despite my condition and the things I struggle with daily, I hold onto the hope that, if I work hard, I can eventually go back to school, and graduate with the A.S. I started years ago (the first student loan I ever took out was the same semester I was rushed to the hospital and, being young and naïve, didn't understand how ""loan defaults"" worked); I hope that I can pull my loans from default, graduate, and become a web designer (a job that could support me, even part-time, while leaving me to set my own schedule and workload, something that is a necessity for those that wish to work while managing health problems).

Daily, I wonder what it would have been like to go to school; to meet people; to have had the typical kind of childhood that T.V. and movies portray.

To say the least, Angel Beats has a special kind of significance to me; it (ultimately) is the ""coming of age"" tale; meeting people, discovering yourself, acknowledging past pains and, ultimately, of acceptance.

The show ends with all of them graduating and, literally, moving on to a new life, but it does so while addressing the tragedy that befell the characters, and causing them to end up there in the first place.

I never actually graduated, instead getting my G.E.D. some years after (for the second time) dropping out.

I never went to prom; I never went to any of the events; never cheered from the rafters at our school's assemblies; never (as much fun as I made of them at the time) went to any parties; never had my name called to retrieve a diploma.

I often find myself wondering when (and if) my life will finally be stable, and I'll be able to have friends (ones that actually understand my predicament, and don't think less of me for not being able to achieve the same things as everybody else).

Not only did I not have my health growing up, I was made to feel by ""professionals"" (both doctors and therapist alike) that I could not trust myself to know my own body; my own mind; my own soul.

I grew up believing I was just lazy, and that, if only I had a better mindset, I could do anything I wanted.

I often contemplate if I could survive homelessness again; despite the improvements since the parathyoirodoctomy, I honestly do not believe I would have the courage to persevere through the pain I am in (as I write this, I find myself worrying over my degrading knees, which threaten to slip from the socket with every step, and which, presently, after some minor cleaning, hurt more than I can bare -- they hurt too much for me to take a shower today).

While trying to get the surgery, I frequently watched people dance; more than anything, I wanted to be like them, but with each passing day, my knees grow worse and worse, as I spend them on dishes, and standing in place while talking to the employees at the group home (trying to act like I'm not in dire pain).

I feel as though my entire body is continuing to deteriorate, despite the improvements, and I'll never know what it was like to be young.

In the hospitals (especially endocrine offices), I would have dozens of (older) people staring at me, as though wondering ""why the hell would he be here? He's not old enough to have health problems"" (I formed a special bond my second stay at the crisis center with a young woman that had a terminal heart defect, where she told me she had similar experiences).

The world sees me as such; my roommates (both of whom are much older) remark on my youth, while attempting to tell me how you ""slow down"" when you get old (as though PHPT is not a disease experienced almost exclusively in those 65 or older, who describe the disease as ""feeling as though you're getting old"" after receiving surgery for it); they tell me that, if I just got out more, I'd feel better (this in spite of knowing that I go to a doctor an average of once every three days).

Even those that wish me well and tell me they'll ""pray for me"" do so out of a need for they, themselves, to believe that, with just the right mindset, everyone can be successful -- that, with the right amount of optimism, you cannot fail (to believe that good things happen to good people, and bad things happen to bad people, and that circumstance does not, in any way, shape us, so long as you **choose** to be a ""good person"").

People will tell me how reasonable everything I say sounds, empathizing for the sake of their own ego how bad they feel for me, before remarking how I should put more effort into my appearance, maybe get a job, have some kids...

To anybody that's reading this (even if it's just one person), I want to thank you for seeing it all the way to the end -- I finished the final episode while it was still light out, and felt compelled to write; it is now dark, and I have two appointments, one of which is in the morning that I'm trying to talk myself out of cancelling (I am in such an excruciating amount of pain from the last week, and from today just attempting to ""act normal""), because it is so late at night (and I lost track of time).

I hope that life is receiving you well; I hope that at least some part of this can help you.

I hope that you'll feel compelled to write something in reply, to let me know that some part of this inspired you to keep trying; to help you feel like you are not so alone in your struggles.

Again, thanks for reading; I know it was a ramble, and very little of the actual show was mentioned, but I hope that the distinct correlation of my life with the theme of the show (being denied that sense of self while growing up) is apparent.

Goodnight \~

Once more for the road - McConnell is nothing more than a loathsome mercenary hired by corporate and foreign powers to achieve their ends at the cost of the American people, to shovel our tax dollars and our sovereign power into their hands, for the personal and petty profit of the soldiers in his employ - Republican politicians. 

He's not an evil mastermind, he's not the grand architect or the wizard behind the curtain. He serves at the pleasure of Senate Republicans; if they didn't want him there, they would be rid of him in a heartbeat. The truth is, whatever they say, whatever they do, they like him there. He soaks up the anger and outrage and abuse. They can pretend to be ""good guys"" - like that spineless, worthless shit Mitt Romney - while wholeheartedly endorsing the entire corrupt campaign behind the scenes. Mitch McConnell is despised by everyone, even his own party. Majority Leader isn't a desirable position. Look at Nancy Pelosi - she immediately became the sole target of public ire for decisions like not impeaching Trump, despite the fact that she's almost certainly carrying out the wishes of the consensus of thousands of Democrat officials and politicians. This isn't her plan, just like this is not Mitch's plan.

Mitch McConnell is serving the designs and plans of a few massive corporations and other huge donors. That's it. The religious zealots, the industrial titans and long-time Republican donors - he passes bills like the 2018 Tax Theft bill that pleases them and delivers profits to them, while safeguarding Republican power. 

I say this because articles like this blaming him for the entire debacle help him fulfill exactly his purpose: establish a single focal point of blame without addressing the systemic issues and network of corrupt and criminal actors that actually pull the strings. ""Mitch McConnell is Really Destroying America"" as a headline (which is all that most people read anyway) makes the natural implication that removing Mitch McConnell fixes the problem. But there's always another Mitch McConnell. Articles like this give him far too much credit and cement a perception that without him, the whole machine falls apart. 

But this is factually bankrupt. The system, the real agent of America's destruction, is made up of thousands of Republican megadonors donors like the Mercers and Sheldon Addleson, corporate conglomerates like the Oil industry and Telecomm, foreign powers like Putin's Russia and Mr. Bonesaw's Saudi Arabia, and religious organizations like the Mormon Church. They funnel billions of dollars and precise, exact instructions into the Republican party, which is nothing more than a mercenary force to carry out the donors wishes. The donors pay money, the Republicans fight the war. McConnell is just another in a long line of generals. There are endless candidates. Ted Cruz could be a McConnell. So could Marco Rubio or Mitt Romney.

Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader are not enviable positions. Look at Paul Ryan. They don't really wield power. It isn't like a President, who is publicly elected. They're appointed by the party, and they're just the hate sponges for the party, the ones who will take all the blame while more ""likable"" candidates play bridgemaker in hopes of vying for President. It doesn't matter who serves in that capacity. Dark money is the rot, because it stacks the government with people acting directly against the public interest. 

All of the emotion, the partisan bickering, the sentiment and loathing, that's all a smokescreen. These people, Republicans, they are not politicians. Not in the slightest. The only thing they have in common with politicians is many of them are lawyers and they wear suits. They don't govern. The Republican party has done literally nothing even remotely resembling governance in a long time. When was the last time they passed a bill meant to improve some part of public or private life for the average American citizen? 

Do not delude yourselves. This is not about Trump, not about McConnell, not even about the Republican party. Eliminate one mercenary group, and another takes its place. The Democrats are on the side of the angels currently, but only by default, only because Republicans have devolved so far into criminality and corruption (mostly out of desperation) that it would be impossible not to be the good guys in comparison. 

If we do not do something about dark money in politics, any party, no matter how conservative or liberal, can easily be infiltrated and eventually overrun with people acting in the interest of dark money over public interest.

If McConnell were following his own comprehensive grand plan, you wouldn't see this ridiculous flip-flopping of stances and interests nearly overnight. That's why Republicans are such demonstrable and laughable hypocrites. Their hypocrisy is almost absurdist - their actions frequently contradict their words because they have no real guiding ideology. They're just working for the highest bidder. Much like a mercenary might fight for one side on one day, and then the opposing side the next day, Republicans do whatever they're told by their masters, while doing preposterous verbal gymnastics on TV. Just look at what we've witnessed in a short period of time: 

 • Republicans outspoken against Russia pre-2016; immediately turn into vocal and ardent Russia supporters (because Russia started paying them and helping them win). 

 • Republicans outspoken against and opposed to executive power pre-2106; immediately and vocally support the extreme tryannical overreach of Donald Trump (because he's a Republican). 

 • Conservative think-tank The Heritage Foundation creates outline of Affordable Care Act &amp; Republican Mitt Romney puts it into place as governor of Massachusetts - immediately and vocally condemn it as soon as Obama makes it the foundation of his healthcare policy

 • Republicans bemoan and condemn the increase of the federal deficit - until Trump creates one of the largest federal deficits in recent memory to give tax dollars to corporations. Then they vocally and proudly support it. 

 • Republicans stoke xenophobia and drone on and on and one about the threat of ""Radical Islam"" - until Trump wants to sell billions of dollars of weaponry to Saudi Arabia, the most powerful, hardcore ""islamic extremists"" in the Middle East. Then, Saudi Arabia is a wonderful beacon of freedom (because they're paying them). 

This is why they wouldn't be successful without a propaganda wing like Fox News. All politicians do a form of doublespeak, but there is nothing comparable to the hypocrisy of modern-day Republicans. Nothing. No 20th century absurdist novelist could ever dream up these clowns. They need to cut off their voters from reality and isolate them in a sterile alternate universe where they bury certain hypocrisies or explain them away and build a narrative utterly incomparable to the real world, because whatever you want to say about Republican voters, they have all the same mental capacities as your average Joe. They could easily see how badly they, personally, are being fucked over by the very people they choose to represent them - if they weren't living in the alternate universe that is Conservative Media.

All this to say that none of this is part of McConnell's grand design. Nor Trump's, nor even the entire Republican party. There's no teleology to any of this, no method to the madness, no overarching evil scheme. That's the fiction junkies in us, always envisioning the evil wizard plotting brilliant and infinitely complex schemes to redesign the world. 

Poll Republican voters about what they think they're getting - the world they think their votes are buying - and you'll get a hundred different answers and illustrations of a hundred different worlds, none of which remotely resemble what Republicans are actually building.

The world Republicans are building is nothing more than a grotesque collage of the wants and needs of some of the richest and most morally and ethically bankrupt people and organizations on the planet, disparate in scope but almost all entirely to the detriment of the American people, because the only thing Republicans can trade for their donors' cash is federal tax dollars and the power and sovereignty of the American citizens they represent. It is ever-shifting, ever-changing, but always shitty. Either a perpetual war or economic cycles of boom-and-bust or rampant xenophobia - it doesn't matter. Republicans are a black box that donors put a handful of small bills into and get back trillions of our tax dollars and untold powers over public land or contractual rights or legal rights. 

This is why the actions of Republicans need to be firmly divorced from the personalities of single individuals like Trump and McConnell and also from the veil of ""conservatism"" or political ideology in general. They don't care. They're mercenaries. Start acting like it. Stop talking and yelling to them and start yelling over them, to their masters, because these are the people and organizations destroying America, and we need to identify them, call them out, and recognize Republicans for the flunkies they are.

Everything begins and ends with the money. To begin with Citizens United must be overturned, but we need to keep going. Money and all forms of perverse incentives need to be dealt with, or we will always be governed by the mercenary armies of despots and multinational conglomerates. I don't care which party you vote for, truly I don't. The only thing that matters is to vote for people comitted to removing dark money from politics and most importantly watching over them with intense scrutiny every single day they're in office to make sure they follow up on that promise.

1. Stop being judgemental/cynical of others and start looking for the good in people.

2. Understand that most of the time, other people aren’t trying to piss you off. They just don’t realize that what they’re doing is pissing you off. 

3. Remind yourself that you won’t solve any problems by getting angry.

4. Remember that you yourself are not perfect. So don’t expect others to be perfect either.

Keeping these four things in mind has been crucial for me in dealing with my anger. I still got a long way to go, but I’m definitely headed in the right direction.

And I fucking hate it. I recently got this promotion (2 paychecks in) and am immensely disillusioned with the prospect of adult life. I spend all my time working, high, dividing up what little free time I have to fill obligations i imposed on myself with people im only lukewarm with at best, or all 3 most of the time. I haven't played a video game in like a year, haven't picked up my trumpet since I graduated high school, stopped working out. Gaming used to be a fun escape and brought me legitimate joy. Now if I even can find the time I sure as hell dont have the motivation to even boot anything up. I had a ""promising"" future in music, leading the trumpet section for my high school's marching band (you know, as ""promising"" as any future in music can be beyond being a semi-lucrative hobby at best). I was recently dumped by my high school sweetheart (first relationship, year and 8 months), twice, before rebounding too quickly and making a commitment to someone whom ALSO i am a rebound for. She was cut deep by her previous partner and is fucking overbearing with ""please never leave me"" and ""I love you"" 2 weeks in and because im a fucking pushover I oblige, digging my hole deeper every reciprocation. Add on to that said high school sweetheart wanted me back but not before I already made a commitment. So no matter what I am hurting someone and feel like a massive piece of shit. I want to leave this shithole of a city in suburban Virginia where every day is the same, where every fucking redneck that trails their inbred families in and out of my restaurant has the same mindset, where nothing i do matters and I feel like this Sisyphusian task of being a productive member of society until I die is dumb and stupid and dumb. I wish i kept my birth receipt as I have massive buyer's remourse.

I know you're taught from an early age ""life isn't fair"" and ""life sucks,"" is this really it though? Is this what I have to look forward to for the next 60 years? I almost wish i hadn't been exposed to the glamorous and exciting lives of celebrities and youtubers to idolize throughout my formative years. Maybe that's why I feel so goddamn small and angry about what ""adult life"" is panning out to be. And of course in all my disillusion and generally not being satisfied, whenever I try to open up to anyone I am reminded how fucking good I have it to be in this privileged a position. And they're right. I'll never know what it's like to fear for my life walking down the street, or getting pulled over. I'll never know what it's like to feel legitimately not safe or alienated because of a belief or lifestyle or fucking skin color. I am invisible in day to day life. I will do nothing remarkable, leave no impact on the people I interact with outside of handing them their fucking pizza to pass out to their unremarkable children and families who will also leave no impact on anyone or anything. And then I'll die. I always thought nihilism was just pessimism for people who wanted to be edgy and special, im starting to rethink that assessment though


Maybe I should get a journal or something and stop subjecting the internet to my bitching. But thanks for taking the time to read my whiny venting",19Sep2020,1
117,"2 years ago i moved into a flat with my bf and slowly i just replied to my mums texts less and less...

For so many reasons, nothing to say, we are such different people, also i would have nightmares about her and my older brother usually after having spoken to them that day. 

My mum was always so overprotective it was stifling, would threaten me so much (only hit me twice), we would have so many arguments growing up

My family is iraqi (living in uk) so me ever dating or even talking to boys was out of the question, but when my other brother died / parents divorced my mum loosened up a bit, though not completely

I once my cousin excitedly about moving with my bf, who told my aunt, who asked my mum and she got so mad at me, calling me impure etc, it feels like those moments are who she truly is, and it feels so bloody horrible, i used to cry so much out of frustration

And so since i stopped replying, she has shown up at the pub outside my place and tried to call me over to which i basically ran, and then one other time showed up at my work (retail) and made a scene in front of all my coworkers and manager when i went to the back saying i didnt want to speak to her

This post is an entire mess i feel like such shit over this situation im sorry, just wish i had different family",19Sep2020,1
118,"I’ve had an ABUNDANCE of mental issues in the first place and 2020 hit fucking hard. Over the summer I pretty much decided to give up and figured I wouldn’t be around to see 2021...but I thought I might as well try to apply first, give myself a little hope, see if maybe I can make some changes, make my life worthwhile...and I got in??",19Sep2020,1
119,"Long story short is that there was a spat between 2 family members last week. Family member 1 starts messaging other family members about something family member 2 had done. You know, just trying to stir shit up to score points. How am I connected? Well, I was there that night, as were other family members as well. I am no more connected to it than any of them. Yet, for some reason, I am now in the middle of it. 

Why? Because family member 1 knows they can use me to score points against family member 2. The next time I'm over at the house with my family she keeps pestering me about how family member 2 did this, right, right, right? I try and lie, but I'm not super great about it. Besides, everyone else there witnessed it and they're giving me faces that say, 'come on now.' I finally break down and say ok, whatever, yes. Big mistake, because family member 1 of course is giddy to throw this in family member's 2 face. The worst part is how slimy she went about doing this. She tried to make it sound like I was the one bringing it up and gossiping about it when SHE was the one who kept pressing the issue. Totally fucking scummy.

I still don't get how everyone was there, everyone talked about it EXCEPT me, and, yet I am somehow one of the bigger pieces on the board right now. I want to refute what family member number 1 said I did, but I know it will just fan the flames even more at this point. It's too late to escape.",19Sep2020,1
120,"To preface this I am not a democrat either, I believe they’re corrupt as well, but I see far more Democratic up and coming politicians willing to fight for progress.  It frustrates me that in this day, we still have archaic ideas and religious politicians who are anti science, anti rights, who only care about conspiracy theories, their version of god and the rich.  Not all conservatives are this way so I’m not talking about conservative voters as a whole, I’m talking about the backward minded fucks who partially run our country.  Fuck them all.

124,I want to die. And I wish someone just agreed with me. Maybe even told me a valid reason. Gave me comfort in leaving. But I never find that reason. Suicide is an invalid way to leave. But it’s the fastest way. It’s like I need a good excuse to leave. Isn’t it enough that I want to leave? That I don’t want to live this life against my will? I hope I live no more after I die.,19Sep2020,1

126,"I need help. I have to write a paper for a foreign language class about someone I look up to or want to be like. It's not out of arrogance but I don't think I really look up to anyone in particular. I've got people who I think are interesting or intriguing like Muhammed Ali, Mike Tyson, Jordan Peterson, Nietzsche, Tolkien, George RR Martin. I don't really want to necessarily be like any of them. I want to take what they have to offer to heart, but ultimately I just want to be me.

But now that I'm called to think about it, I'm not really sure what that entails. I don't think I'm directionless, I've got things I want to do with my life. I've got things I'd like to be good at. But I feel a lack of something. I feel like I'm missing something.",19Sep2020,1
129,"She developed an abscess pretty suddenly due to an infection and is under anesthesia getting it drained and cleaned out. It’s not super invasive, but we didn’t have enough time to get blood work for her and make sure all her organs are functioning optimally and can handle the anesthesia. She’s 9 and out of my three cats, she’s always been the healthiest and never gave us any health scares. She’s a fighter, at only 6 pounds lol. 

Still, I’m so scared. I’ve cried a lot, and I miss her so much. She’s my best friend. She was my only friend when I went through a terrible depressive episode that lasted years. I was so lonely, and she gave me a reason to be happy and grateful and strong. 

I hope she’s okay. I’ll hear back from the vet in a couple hours. The surgery might already be over. I wish I could hold her. I need love and support right now.",19Sep2020,1

But when someone else shows up and does the exact same thing, especially if it didn’t take them as long to learn or do, I feel jealous.",19Sep2020,1

132,"I am a very prideful person. But sometimes I think I don't have any right to be this proud. I just put up a front that makes me seem very prideful, but I think I am starting to realize my own mediocrity. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm excelling in something. That's when my pride starts to grow. And then when something bad happens (a bad grade, a bad response from someone) I just start to crumble. I tell myself, ""Oh, you're just mediocre. You have no right to be proud."" I am trying to focus on the present and work hard every day, but when something bad happens, I feel discouraged and I don't know what to do. Yesterday, I got a 70% on a test. This was the lowest score I've gotten this year and especially in a subject that I thought I was okay at. I studied hard for it, but I should've studied harder. My family told me that it could be a teacher mistake, even though it was the computer that graded it. I think I feel worse because I thought I knew the material well, and the test questions weren't as hard as expected. 

I know grades don't define anyone's lives, and I wouldn't consider myself to be obsessed with my grades. The reason I am writing about this is this happens every time something doesn't go to plan. It's almost embarrassing to say this, but one time, because a teacher laughed (not in a hostile way) at my face getting red during a speech, I got really upset.  It was a really trivial incident. Every time I face something bad or different, I just shut down. And my mind replays the same incident until I feel sick. I know I should be stronger. That I shouldn't let others affect me. I don't necessarily think it's because of other people that I feel like this. More than worrying about what others think, I just feel like I shouldn't make any mistakes. That I should be better. I wouldn't go as far to say I'm a perfectionist, but whenever I feel like I make mistakes, I feel so vulnerable and afraid. But when something good happens, my pride gets a little boost. So I constantly have mood swings, which not only affects me, but the people around me. 

I also overthink a lot. Any time something ""bad"" happens, my mind runs through the incident continuously. I can't stop thinking. I want to stop thinking. To stop thinking, I just play the same mobile game over and over again so I don't have to think.

I am also sorry to my mom. I thought I could be a lot stronger than this, but I think I just bring the mood down. She's already sick and I think I'm making it worse. 

I don't know why I am writing this. I think I just wanted to let it out. I would appreciate any comment on how I can get over these kinds of feelings. Sorry if this post seemed disorganized, I don't know to word how I'm feeling.

Strange thing is, I don't know if my problem is significant enough to be posted here. So I started to overthink again. I wish I can stop this.",19Sep2020,1
133,"I'm disconnected from everyone in my life and well when someone does become a part of my life I end up making them a priority just cuz there's nothing else to be in the priority slot and I believe that makes people get the best of me and not to forget makes me clingy and needy and well that's a huge part of what I believe caused my last break up 


The other person grew over their honeymoon phase while I was just being me which ended in me being intrusive I guess


But yes unless I improve on this I'll probably fail to have any social life or well would probably get used by x or y

135," 

This is history folks, how are we going to be remembered, we owe to everyone. **I MEAN THIS IS A CRISIS, HOMELESSNESS is going to SKYROCKET** and has. I am on the streets helping these days, I answer sucide hotline calls, I feed people weekly and the population its exploding. Daily the calls are getting worse and worse, this might be the largest depression the world has ridden out thus far.

A society and its people are measured by how we treat our fellows in the depths of hell. Please be ready with blankets and food, and help if you can? From a personal point of view, when those sub zero tempertures hit, I was shaking to the bone no food or shelter **the snow came**.... I froze and almost died many times on a river alone. Its scary and a pituful place to be, but we can't judge not now, its a time of action.

I had a meth pipe and a dream, but those cold nights I just wanted to survive. I know it was personal decision and a poor one. However, I was human, I had a family, friends, and things happen that brought me to that place. **Nobody wants that in life, mental illness, addiction, or other things are going on for them you just don't see it**

Please I say this again, get out there, and help someone in need? You have no idea what its like in sub zero temps with no one and nothing, where no one cares, no one is coming ot help, you're on your on your own and if die nobody will even remember. I promised myself, when I got out of the situation, I'd be the person I wish I had when I was at my worst. Be that person for someone, I can't stress enough whats happening in the world.

The biggest favor anyone can ask, remember humanity, remember those tha have less or nothing. Don't judge, offer help where help is needed, **we know not what the future brings for any of us, it can be any of us!!!!**",19Sep2020,1
136,"I have never been one to beg for money. Now I feel like I have hit an all time low because of it. COvid really just messed everything up this year. After not thinking I could get pregnant, boom. It happens at a time where I thought we would be ok and make it through quarantine and what not. Then boom, my husband's gets COvid. Then boom, he looses his job and I can't even find one. Now we are $5,000 in the hole. We tried signing up for unemployment and we can't receive anything because no one is available. Like what luck. 2020 is really the year. I'm happy we have a child on the way, I just wish everything wasn't so fucked. Now we are biting our nails hoping stimulus bills will help us float until the baby is born in January or until we can find employment. I wish something would go right.

139,"I grew up very religious. JW aka Christianity on steroids. I hate it. 

I know the Bible and I hate how it is weaponized. Taking art history, learning a man named Ezra  wrote it for the priest- yet we are supposed to believe every word. If a man in this day and age said he wrote a book based off the voices he heard- he’d be institutionalized. 

My grandma flies back and forth from her home country to here. She filed bankruptcy under my moms name so my mom got stuck with my grandmas house and debt. 

She judges us all the time. For smoking weed. For not going to church. For “straying away” from Jehovah 🙄

My mom wants me to be nice. I wanted to make a boundary where I don’t have to talk to her but they made it a huge fight so now I have to acknowledge her through my teeth. 


I can’t even workout because her bedroom is below mine and any fucking repetitive movements will have her telling my mom I’m having sex or someone over.

140,"Most people I talk to who have serious struggles with mental health, abuse, trauma etc. say they try hard to hide their problems and appear to have the perfect life, that they actively dislike sympathy, pity, attention etc. Some people have even gone so far as to suggest that people with real issues typically don’t want sympathy while people who are “faking” or have less serious issues are the ones that talk about them the most. 

While I am also very aware of how I come across to others, and try very hard to avoid falling into self-pity, oversharing etc. I very much crave to be “seen” and to share my pain sometimes. It seems very adolescent. It really bothers me because no one else seems to have this desire and it is seen (and I myself see it) as a negative thing. 

Most of the time I want to hide my problems too. But some people, particularly authority figures and bosses, trigger some deep desire in me to be seen and validated. It’s hard for me to conceive of the fact that most 23 year olds (that I have talked to ) even ones with horrible lives and issues are mature enough to realize that no one will save them and that it is in fact better (not to mention less selfish) to present yourself at least in professional, academic and romantic situations (until you have known someone for years and years) as a competent and emotionally stable person. 

This is also really messed up, but it is painful for me to be reminded that “everyone has their own struggles.” I know that is true, I really know it, and I remind myself of it all the time. But instead of feeling compassion and connection I just feel intense embarrassment and shame because it reminds me of all of the people out there who are doing the right thing day in and day out, who are not complaining, who can’t afford to have a mental breakdown, who making better choices, thriving (at least outwardly). It reminds me that they have issues too they are just dealing with the pain themselves and managing to cope somehow despite it while I am here feeing sorry for myself and struggling to function. I’m not explaining it well. I feel like I’m supposed to be comforted by the fact that my struggles are not especially difficult but instead I find it intensely painful because it implies (rightfully) that I’m overly sensitive, selfish, entitled, and lacking in character and fortitude. 

Even if mental illness is a real thing, and I know it is, everybody has struggles. Where does this perverse, narcissistic belief (or almost desperate need to believe) that I am in an extra special amount of pain come from? I suppose it is what I said. If I acknowledge reality I also have to a knowledge some extremely unsettling things about myself and my entitlement. I guess it also forces me to accept that having intense feelings is just a part of life, and because you don’t have it worse than other people, that means it’s probably not going to get that much better. So part of it is just going to be accepting that I’m always going to feel things and that there is a lot of pain in life and that’s normal. And that I can’t really complain about it.

I don’t know if any of this is making sense. I’m crying a lot as I write this. It really bothers me and I feel so ashamed and kind of disgusted with myself. It makes it hard to change because my defenses that hurt me are also what are keeping me from seeing the truth about myself, and so protecting my ego. 

I honestly think I might have a personality disorder of some sort but then I wonder if that is just another way of getting off the hook, of trying to find a reason for my suffering so I don’t have to deal with it as directly, or acknowledge it’s mostly either my own fault or simply something everyone has to deal with. 

It’s weird to realize about myself. Most people say I’m a really good person. My friend once told me I was the embodiment of no ego. How ironic! My ego and ego defenses dominate my life and nearly everything I do. I don’t know how I can be so self-absorbed and yet still come across as good? I think people are confusing good with timid and fearful of making a mistake or seeming like a bad person (but it’s really all about me, not motivated by altruism).",19Sep2020,1
141,"Just here for a humble brag. I’ve been on a weight loss journey for a year and 10 months now. I used mostly walking and hiking for my main source of exercise, but in my state it gets both extremely hot in the summer, and absolutely frigid in the winter. I prefer to hike when it’s a little cooler or just a little warmer, that said, I found it hard to stick to routine. 

I’ve had a lot of shame surrounding exercise being as I grew up in a larger body and was bullied a lot. I’ve recently started practicing yoga and have managed to stay consistent for a week now. I know it’s not a lot, but I already feel it’s benefits working through out every facet of my life. 

The meditation and spiritual grounding aspects of the yoga practice is helping my anxiety and depression immensely. 

The physical aspects are making my body feel lovely and limber and more in tune. I also have goals to work toward now. I’ve been in a rut for a while now and it’s nice to have something tangible to work toward.

143,"Guys- Why do you ghost women?

I was seeing this guy for a couple of months, things seemed to be going well in my opinion. And then he stopped returning my calls and texts. After about two weeks, I remembered that I had his roommate’s number so I texted him and he told me that his friend was out of town (which I still don’t think is true). Well 2 days ago, a girl was posted on his story with the caption “his bby”. He liked my picture after I viewed the story so I proceeded to message him and he blamed his absence on his phone not working. 

My thing is if he wasn’t interested anymore or ever, why didn’t he just tell me so rather than disappearing for a month just to pop up with a new girl?

It all started on Thursday around 3am I woke up with extremely painful stomach cramps which went on all day to the point I had to visit the emergency room the following morning as the pain shifted to sharp pains in my lower right abdomen. 

They found traces of blood and protein in my urine and recommended I see my doctor which I will be doing next week. 

I get an increase in pain when laughing / coughing or bending over/straining.  

At first I thought it was my appendix but that was ruled out, kidney stones I don't fit the symptoms either. I'm urinating fine etc.
