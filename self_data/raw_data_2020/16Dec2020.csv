0,"A few weeks ago, me and my bf were able to go see one of the apartments we applied for. I guess it was a bit naive of me to already picture myself living there. It was a good location, affordable, small but with a bit of work, itd be perfect. We were waiting on an update from the landlords but we never got any. So today we went to visit the restaurant they own to see if they had an update and apparently they called several times to my bfs number that he gave them and even left a message, but there was no record on his phone that they called him and no messages either.

Someone already moved into the apartment a week or so ago. There were 4 other people who wanted it. I'm pissed off cause I desperately want to move out away from this toxic environment I'm in, and the main reason I didnt get it that I could've fixed, was a communication error? I bet it was their fault and mistyped a number, because there was no record on my bfs phone at all that they called or left any type of message.

Whatever. What's done is done..cant do anything about it except apply for other places. We were so close to getting this place and I was so happy that we finally had a chance to get away from this stupid place, now i just feel crushed. At least I recently got employed so I dont have to worry about spending money for anything. Almost done with Christmas stuff. Speaking of which, I'm gonna go and finish wrapping presents.

Hopefully I can earn enough money soon so I can get the few tattoos on my arm fixed up because the ex convict who did it, was not good at all. But at least thatd be an interesting thing to say about myself, that I got tattooed by an ex convict. I'm just saying random shit at this point.

2,"A couple months ago I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was something like 150/95. I’m 24 years old, somewhat 30-40 pounds overweight and my family had a history of blood pressure problems. The doctor didn’t say anything about it but that’s when I realized my weight gain wasn’t just appearance anymore. I’ve been doing a lot more cardio, I’ve never stopped lifting weights since then, and watching sodium in things I eat. I went to the doctor today and my blood pressure was 135/81. I’m so happy. I worked so hard to lower it. It just feels like it paid off. I’m gonna keep working on it to lower it even more. Also hoping to lose about 40 pounds.",16Dec2020,1
3,"Well, yep, he caught me, I do have feelings for him. I'm going to keep denying it, mind you, but this man of mine is way too smart to lie to. 

But see, he seemed quite happy about it. Even as I told him I'm attachment avoidant and better drop the feelings thing lest I run away very very fast. 

The disadvantage of liking very intelligent people is that, well, they are very intelligent. I thought I was hiding it well  and then he turned around and, boom! Headshot. He got me right in the feelings.",16Dec2020,1
5,"Hey, I'm a 20yo male and I have really bad luck with women. I'm in my second year of college and I've never kissed a girl. I feel really behind and was wondering if someone could maybe give me some advice. 

I'm a fairly good looking guy (as in I've been told I'm attractive by people) and I've had girls interested in me in the past. But, when the time comes to do anything physical. I get scared and they usually lose interest. I think my main fear is being rejected or making someone feel uncomfortable. Once, at a friend's house, a girl let me touch her boob. When everyone else was leaving, I was gonna be alone with her and someone told me to use a condom. I didn't feel ready and went home. I'm glad I didn't do it because I didn't know her and it felt wrong to me. 

Still, I don't know how to talk to women. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety so that probably makes it harder for me than for others. Am I just supposed to go up to a girl on campus and talk to her? I've tried it before but my god, women can be very dry sometimes. 

""Hey, my name  is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. What's yours?""

""Oh my name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.""

""What's your major?""

""Tech""

""Oh, that's cool. I'm doing bioengineering""

....

That's usually how these things go. I can't blame them. Talking to a stranger is hard. 

Sometimes people call me gay and I worry that maybe girls think I'm gay or something. I've always just tried to be myself. Not overtly masculine or anything. Am I supposed to act more tough or uninterested? I just want to meet someone I can talk to and cuddle with. Everyone else seems to have these things come naturally to them. It makes me feel like everyone read some book that I missed out on, like I'm not in on the secret. 

Any advice?",16Dec2020,1

15,"Dear Democratic Leadership,

Please, for the love of God do the following;

1) Go on conservative media constantly. Every day you need to be on the conservative airwaves countering their inevitable lies about you. And you need to do something about the fact that they can just lie, and lie, and lie, all the while letting their viewers believe they're ""news"". It's BS, and it's destroying the country.

2) Tax the ultra wealthy &amp; corporations a lot more, close loopholes, and pass the tax cuts on to the low &amp; middle class. And do this for real; not some BS scheme that just shifts taxation around. Too many people in this country need real help, and politicians just keep making the rich richer. It's a shitty thing to do. Stop.

3A) Hold people accountable for their actions. Do not let Trump, and the people in his orbit from the Mueller Investigation, get off without paying for their transgressions. 

3B) Take Trump down. We all know the dude has been a scumbag his entire life. We all know he's guilty of countless crimes. The only way to stop the madness of this cult is to show his supporters what he really is, with a trial that's televised daily, and has irrefutable evidence.

If you do these things, you can win back a lot of people that hate you now. If you spend the next 4 years being ineffective, and just doing more-of-the-same, we'll be back in this mess again in 2024, but probably a lot worse.

Thanks for listening!",16Dec2020,1
21,"My father is a baby boomer, he enlisted in the army for most of his late  teens and 20s and on Uncle Sam's dime basically saw multiple hookers  around the world, he said he stopped counting past 10. He's half-jokingly said I may have half-brothers and half-sisters around the  world I'll never know. He did this in the 1970s **unprotected** before the appearance of HIV and the worst he got was Chlamydia which was easily cured.

After  the army he got a bachelor's degree in his early 30s and basically  lived the bachelor life with a good job, but never settling down and  spending all his money. By age 40, he had little savings, and still  rented. Nevertheless, he was ready to settle down and married a  mail-order bride who was objectively several points higher on the looks  scale.

With a very low down  payment, they bought a home in an okay-not great neighborhood, but it  was in one of those coastal cities. Guess what happened to home prices  from the 1990s to the present?

My  father today at age 70 is now a millionaire on paper with no debts of  any kind. It's mainly due to home appreciation and my mother's extremely  hard work. My mother, a mail-order bride, is the hardest working person  I know, working 2 low-wage jobs for decades, even when it's no longer  necessary. She's actually out-earned my father by a slim majority of the  years they have been married.

My  father still works, mainly for the health insurance which is the best  I've ever seen. He only works part-time but his health insurance premium  is only around $80 a month and he literally had heart surgery that cost  $300,000 but after insurance it was only $13,000 which they paid in  cash.

43,"I think the issue with the majority of conservative voters is that when it comes down to it their live suck, and that's not that different from most America. They work from morning to night, and at the end of the week get a paycheck that is barely enough to cover the essentials. They work hard, and are proud of what they have. And then at the end of each week they sit down and they look at their pay stub and they see how 1/4 to 1/3 of it is taken away from them before they even have a chance to say anything.

They ask themsevles ""Where the hell is this money going?""

They aren't getting any govt assistance, the roads? They have been there fever? The Police? Fuck the police they gave me a ticket. But know what? I see that single woman down the street with 3 kids from different baby daddies getting her rent paid, her food paid, her kids school paid, she don't work, and they connect their tax dollars going to her and it makes them angry.

IT makes them angry because they THINK SHE IS THE PROBLEM. They think the reason why their taxes are that high is because of that poor woman down the street. When in reality very, very little of their tax dollars went to that woman. Instead most of it went to things like defense contractors, big oil companies, big phrama who uses PAID GOVT RESEARCH TO DEVELOP NEW MEDICINES AND THEN CHARGE OUT OF THE ASS FOR IT.

Those conservatives are looking at the people beneath them as being the source of their struggle when in reality they need to be aiming for the meat and potatoes of the problem not the garnish on top which is the folks above them.

They support small govt and tax cuts cause in their eyes the Govt doesn't do shit for them, so the less tax they pay, the more money they have, the better their lives are.

What they can't seem to understand is liberals like me, don';t want to even tax them. Hell I say the first $30,000-$50,000 (we can debate on the amounts) should be TAX FREE. You make $30,000 a year? Fuck it we won't take a god damn dime from your paycheck. And if you make $35,000, great we'll tax you on that $5,000 and thats it.

Now instead I want to make up for that loss of tax revenue by targeting the rich, and I mean the really rich. I'm talking about the people making over $5 million dollars a year. I want to hit them at 50% or better.

But I don't want their W2 income. No sir, I want ALL THEIR INCOME. I don't think it should matter how you generate your income, income is income and it should be taxed accordinly. I don't care if your a real-estate investor and last year you spent $40 million on real-estate and earned $60 million doing it I want to tax you on that $20 million in profit the same as if you flipped burgers yes sir that's going be a $10 million dollar tax bill.

Now for the really fucking rich? Like the people worth over $100 million? Yea I want to hit you with a wealth tax, every single fucking year. I'm thinking .25%. So if your worth $100 million you will of course have to pay taxes on your income, but your also going need to write uncle sam a check for $250,000. Every single year. 

Now you maybe thinking ""that's just $250k""....yea this tax is mainly targetted to the stupid ultra rich. The top 400 richest Americans are worth 4.2 trillion dollars. We tax them at .25% wealth tax EACH year and that's 10.5 BILLION in additional taxes. On top of their current taxes.

And then I want to pass a tax law that targets big companies, if your company is worth over say $500 million dollars we will tax you dollar to dollar for every single social benefit we provide to ANY of your employees.

That's right wal-mart, you don't pay your employees enough to live? And they need $400 in section 8 housing assistance a month? Thats $400 in taxes each month for you. Don't want to pay that tax?

Great

Pay your fucking employees more.

I then want to take all those extra taxes and I want to make sure every single american has access to healthcare, regradless of their ability to pay. I want to make sure every single American has access to higher education. I want to make sure every single American has a strong, roboust safety net for the times life punches you in the face. I want to use those tax dollars to make sure you have clean water to drink, and clean air to breath. 

And if that makes me a liberal

53,"To be human is to be lucky, spoiled, and casual. To be human is to be self-loathing, fearful, and hateful.

To be human is to be a social animal. And to be a social animal is to be kind, empathetic, and tribal.

I imagine that, during the Black Death, some men would get up, go about their day, and think (in different vernacular) ""ah, this is some bullshit. fucking tripping over bodies, gross as hell. i just wanna go home and have some tea."" And then they would go home, and have some tea, and it would be nice. It would be a comfortable moment of reprieve from that reality which we currently look upon as hell on earth.

And it makes sense. Rabbits are basically the vegetables of the animal kingdom, but there are plenty of wild rabbits who live joyful and comfortable lives. If you're incredibly lucky, you may see one of those rabbits bouncing around, having fun, or relaxing. That rabbit is on the bottom of the food chain, and may soon be torn to shreds by a coyote, but it bounces around nonetheless.

So to be human is to be any regular animal. Our adaptability in the face of great stress is not necessarily an impressive trait.

But to be any regular animal is to be weak, and helpless in the face of human intellect and technology. And many humans are exactly that.

We entertain ourselves with theater--theater, which shifts and transforms over the millennia--because it excites us, and satisfies our primal urges. But what we often don't realize, is that this same theater is used in our daily lives to control us.

Some civilizations chose their leaders based on ""divinity."" The most divine person would represent them, and influence decisions on war, trade, and other matters that would affect millions of lives.

Millions, who grew up with subtle lessons on divinity (lessons learnt through listening to their mother and father's conversation, and through seeing the power that prayer held over others) would believe this theatrical performance to be completely reasonable.

Alas, it was theater. And the ones who benefitted from it most tended to be those who put on the show (as well as the leader, the star).

Today, political theater is much the same.

Across my country, the United States of America, there are millions of poor people who believe that this country is going to hell because of brown immigrants, black welfare recipients, or any other number of group with some inconsequentially different physical or sexual trait.

In slave states in the 1800s, I believe only 10% of the white population actually owned slaved. Yet most whites within those slave states were convinced through subtle lessons around them that slavery was a moral good. Maybe they believed it helped the black man, a la 'White Man's Burden.' Maybe they believed it kept black people from revolting, and destroying them. Or maybe they believed something else.

But in spite of the fact that slavery did not benefit them, (and arguably made these white folks' financial situations worse due to the monopolization of industry it allowed for white slave-owners) many poor white men supported it.

Those poor white men had more in common with slaves than they did with slave-owners. Perhaps slave-owners knew that, and perhaps they set up these socially political myths to distract these poor white men from their real economic situations.

Or perhaps not. I wasn't there.

Today, I see rich news pundits divide Democrats and Republicans based on social issues. I see Republican pundits spread conspiracies about social divisions, gender policing, forced homosexuality, ""illegal"" immigrants, welfare queens, plots to destroy the first amendment, plots to destroy the nuclear family, plots to destroy traditional masculinity, and hundreds of other plots.

I see Democratic pundits tear down those Republican claims, and imply that we must vote Democrat in order to defeat these right-wing conspiracies.

All the while, both sides ignore the plights of the deeply poor.

Yes, sometimes they'll put on a show for us. Maybe a few rich politicians will donate $50,000 to Flint Michigan, and lose a drop from their buckets of cash. Maybe a pundit will put on a fundraiser, to help a poor ex-military lunchlady, who worked as hard as any of us but still lost her job due to her physical condition. And that theater will partially distract us.

But it is not enough. It is not systemic change, it is an anecdote. It is a story you tell your wife, which your child takes to heart, and uses to convince themselves that the kind heart of humanity will win out in the end. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of drug-addicted, physically-impaired, and/or mentally ill homeless will continue to be ignored by kind-hearted humans on a daily basis. And millions more will continue to live in unnecessary poverty.

To be human is to find distractions, and seek peace of mind no matter how hellish a situation seems.

To be human is to be a rich man, who--unbound from the fear of housing or resource insecurity--focuses on petty squabbles to occupy his time.

To be human more broadly is to be a poor man, who has his fair share of petty squabbles as well, but is most adversely affected by his need to pay bills.

To be human is to be a poor man watching a rich man's petty squabbles on television, to relate to one or a few rich men specifically (the rich get a lot of screen-time), and to turn that rich man into their new favorite character in the theater.

We are divided because of delusions and petty squabbles. These rich men are far more dangerous than they've ever been in the past.

We are approaching ecological collapse, and resource shortages unlike any humanity has ever seen. We are already experiencing the world's 6th mass extinction, and it is only a matter of time before the extinction event reaches us as it has the rest of the worlds' species.

And, yes, not all humans will die. The rich are the most likely to live.

You, as a white man, are not a future rich person. You, as a black man, are not a future rich person. You, as a trans person, are not a future rich person. You are likely middle class or poor, and that is unlikely to change significantly in your life.

Dismantling our current system is one step toward saving the world. But it only matters if we replace it with a system that is sustainable, and does better to provide livable conditions for all our people.

To create a system like this, we have to educate ourselves. We have to replace inefficient crops with sustainable ones, even if it means we'll have more limited diets. We have to create prizes and incentives for certain scientific achievements, such as efficient desalination techniques and efficient methods of reducing greenhouse gas levels in our atmosphere.

Of course, these prizes and incentives will create new rich bloodlines, so we'll have to institute heavy estate taxes.

The plan I'm speaking of is unlikely to be achieved in its pure form. If we're lucky enough to pull it off, it will be a lot messier than any dreams you have of utopia. But it'll be better than the path we're going down right now.

The only way to tear down our current system, and replace it with a better one, is with education. Education that many people do not have the opportunity, or the drive, to seek out in college. As resource shortages become worse, more people will open themselves up to these ways of imagining society.

To tear down our societal order may take democracy. It may take a theatrical show of torches, meant to inspire fear and change among our rich leaders. It may take violence.

But to rebuild this order in a way that works will take us, as individuals, continually educating each other, and constantly reminding ourselves of why we sought ideas of revolution in the first place.

I've never had problems with crying until now. I cried everywhere; in the library, on my bike, in lectures, with friends on the phone, you name it. Not all the time, but often enough. I became really good at masking it when it was inappropriate, but it was always at hand.

That's gone now. I'm sort of dead inside instead, repressed, and I mostly feel like a burden or overdramatic whenever I show emotion. I still do, I can't help it, but as I feel my pain is so defining of who I am as a person I try not to. I don't want to be seen like that, but I'm not sure how much else there is. I don't want to be my problems anymore, I just can't help it, even if I can't cry. 

What is worse is that I think I've been dependent on sharing the struggles to build intimacy with others. It not good, I mean sharing hardships can be a good thing for building strength in a relationship, I would even say it's necessary sometimes. But when I need intimacy and the only way I can think of to get that closeness is to open my chest up for observation, I become addicted to my problems. And I don't mean addicted metaphorically, I believe that is the definition of addiction. 

How can I  ever get better if I need my problems to experience closeness? I just don't know how to do it without them. 

I think I have to start sleeping in my loft. I actually have a safe space, that is something really good. I just need the strength to use it.",16Dec2020,1

I've made over 80 summaries of the best self improvement books, here’s a full playlist of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOImyOGN9UE&amp;amp;list=PLaNTB6oQAa0AYuul0tqUscg1ZLj_arZga

I release a new video every other day, if you’re interested in subscribing here’s a link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfbLDMh6uGOZePAfqqjVZ-g?sub_confirmation=1

If you’d prefer to read the script instead of watching the video, here it is:

In this video I’m going to teach you the best lessons from the book the subtle art of not giving a fuck by Mark Manson. I’ll show you how to become more confident, how to have more purpose in your life plus you’ll learn the quickest route to happiness. 

But before we get into all that I want you to imagine something.

Imagine you’re 90 years old and on your deathbed, your grandson walks in, he’s 21 and asks for your advice about what he should do with his life, what he should care about and what doesn’t really matter in the end. What would you tell him?

You might say things like: 

“Go for your dreams you only get one life.”

“Don’t worry as much”

“Enjoy the small things”

If you take some time to think and decide what you would say this gives you a real insight into what you actually care about. Take your own advice.

In this video we will go through 5 lessons to help you feel more confident. This example leads onto the first lesson from the book.

1. We all die anyway.

Most people do not like thinking about their own death but I think it is a useful thing to do. 

Another great book is The 7 habits of highly effective people and one of the habits is to begin with the end in mind. Think about your own death and it really puts things into perspective. 

One day all the things that you worry about will no longer exist, nobody alive will care so why are you letting it bother you now? Why are you letting it hold you back?

If you have a hard decision to make just ask yourself how you’d feel on your deathbed about each of the choices, would you regret not going for the more exciting choice? 

Mark Twain said: “a man who lives fully is prepared to die at anytime.”

So use the thought of your own death to drive you forward. Don't put things off and to stay at a job you hate or in a relationship that is bad for you. 

2. It’s not about not giving a fuck, it’s about choosing what to give a fuck about.

The author says maturity is giving a fuck about things that are fuckworthy.

Most people are afraid of rejection, for our survival we naturally want to fit in. 

So in any situation we try to avoid all pain of rejection or someone saying we are wrong, the thing is you will never avoid all pain of rejection. 

What you should do is decide what pain you actually want to go through choose what you want to suffer for.

Before starting this youtube channel I thought about the fact that people might mock me 

but for me the pain of someone laughing at me is miniscule compared to the pain of regret I would have felt if I never went for it.

I would have always been thinking what if. 

I am so passionate about helping others that being mocked for doing what I do doesn’t bother me at all.

so, Give a fuck about things that are fuckworthy.

3. Failure and criticisms are good.

Imagine a sales firm.

Their aim is to make a many sales a possible. 

If you said to all the staff that rather than aiming to get as many sales as possible they should instead aim to get the most rejections. This is a concept called go for no where you aim for noes rather than yeses.

What happens is the person who gets the most number of noes is nearly always the person who also gets the most amount of sales. 

This is because they are no longer limited by their fear of rejection.

Thomas J. Watson who served as chairman and CEO of IBM said “If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate”

Stop trying to avoid criticisms and failures. You will always have people who want to be negative about what you’re doing. That’s actually great, it means you’re putting yourself out there.

Remember people usually only criticize people who they feel are above them, they think by doing so they will be able will bring you down to their level.

I think of the people who I look up to and ask myself if they would criticize or mock me for doing what I am doing and obviously they wouldn’t. They are more than likely say what I’m doing is great and encourage me to keep going.

An opinion is the cheapest thing anyone can give you, the value comes in deciding who’s opinion you’re going to listen to.

so, go for no’s and be grateful for each one, they are helping you towards the result you want and show you’re putting yourself out there.

4. Happiness and confidence comes from caring about something greater than yourself. 

Here’s a great lyric by the rapper Mack-le-more which is based on a Banksy quote 

“I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave and the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name. So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave, did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?” 

What is he on about then? 

He’s saying that you will only be remembered if you do something great with your life. By doing something great for humanity you will be immortal because people will talk about you well after your death. 

So a quick question, are you living your purpose? It’s a difficult question to answer but a great one to think about. 

As we said before we all die anyway, the only people who actually get remember are the people who did something that was bigger than themselves. 

It’s pretty overwhelming to think about your life purpose but a great place to start is to begin on a small scale helping people.

Just do something for someone else.

It can be something simple like baking a cake or taking them out somewhere or even just paying them a genuine compliment

Search a website called one kindness .org. They explain the power of doing just one act of kindness per day - it’s an interesting read.

On a bigger scale you can use your life to build something huge to help others and make a change. 

Bill Gates said “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.” 

Start thinking bigger, think outside yourself. 

One of my life aims is to completely change the education system so it will teach people more about happiness.

I’m not sure exactly how I will do this yet but that is why it’s such a fun aim to have. Aim huge. 

If you’re not sure where to begin search round my channel or other self improvement channels and begin working towards something you’re truly proud of. 

If you’re working towards something for other people you almost don’t have time to worry. 

When you do this you will become much happier because true happiness comes from helping others.

A great side effect of this is that you will feel much more confident, when you have a true purpose you’re working towards you won’t be stopped by small things anymore. A great quote from the book man’s search for meaning says “Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.” 

So if your why  is to change the world you aren’t going to stopped by someone mocking you because changing the world is simply way more important.

so, work towards something bigger than yourself and you will be much happier and feel more confident.

Lesson 5. You choose who is in your life.

When I was a school I really did care about fitting in and trying to impress pretty much everyone. I always looked outside myself for approval and confirmation that I was good enough. 

What a load of bullshit. It’s funny to me that almost all the people who I was so bothered about impressing are actually no longer part of my life, I don’t ever see or talk to them.

It’s easy to forget how much control you actually have over your life. 

You have full control over people who play a role in your life. 

So be who you want to be and the people who truly like you will stick around and anyone else you can just choose not to see them. 

There’s nothing wrong with people not liking you, stop getting caught up on what everyone thinks about you. The more important thing to think about is what the people you actually like think about you and what you think about yourself.

Here’s a good question.

“From your perspective what is the difference between someone who you no longer see anymore and someone who is dead?” 

Odd question but bear with me.

Each has no input on your life and you have 0 interactions. 

IT’s a pretty odd way of looking at it but you basically have the power to kill off characters you do not like in your life. 

so, rethink the way you see your world, be confident and be yourself because the only people that will be in your life long term are the people who like you anyway.

So to summarize: 

1. We all die anyway so go for it.

2. Give a fuck about things that are fuckworthy.

3. Failure and criticisms are good things, aim for them.

4. work towards something bigger than yourself and you will be much happier and feel more confident.

5. You choose who is in your life, be yourself, the people who don’t like you wont be part of your life anyway.

61,"**Distinguishing the key differences between Nice Guys and genuinely good men.**

In this world, there is a subset of men that believe women are only attracted to assholes.

Which is true, if you preface this belief with 'very few'.

The vast majority of women are attracted to good men.

The subset of men that believe otherwise are Nice Guys.

### What's a Nice Guy?

#### Nice Guy: (noun)

A man that delivers overwhelming acts of kindness towards women, with a firm expectation of immediate romantic or sexual rewards.

Some of the common traits of a Nice Guy include:

#### He puts women on a pedestal

Nice guys are prone to putting women on a pedestal. They do so to the point of making a woman uncomfortable, or worse, bored.

They will 'coincidentally' have all of the same hobbies and interests as her.

They will agree with all of her world views and personal opinions.

They refuse to say anything that could offend her (up until the point she rejects him, but we'll get to that in a moment).

They are at her beck and call whether or not she becks or calls for it. 

They constantly fawn over her.

They laugh too loudly at her throwaway jokes.

They drown her in unnecessary flattery.

#### He's dishonest

Nice Guy's are by dishonest by nature.

They pretend to agree with everything a woman says.

They deceive women through the use of emotional manipulation.

They falsely big-note themselves to women.

They literally tell women: 'I'm a good guy'.

Nice Guys are dishonest.

#### He's a (sore) loser

When a nice guy faces rejection from a woman, his response generally involves a two-step approach:

##### 1. He initially ignores it.

A Nice Guy will relentlessly continue his pursuit of a woman, despite any subtle, initial signals she gives off that she's not interested.

As such, women are eventually pushed to the point of forcefully spelling it out to him: 'I'M NOT INTERESTED, LEAVE ME ALONE'.

##### 2. He throws a tantrum

Once a Nice Guy realises defeat, he doesn't keep his cool and move on from the rejection with grace and civility.

He burns the bridge between him and her until there is nothing left but the charred remains of his bruised ego.

He calls her a prude or a slut (or sometimes both, unaware of the irony).

He makes nasty comments about her personal appearance.

Finally,then he caps it off with something along the lines of: 'I'm out of your league anyway.'

Here is an example of how this could play out in an online dating scenario:

**Nice Guy: Hello Emily, you have beautiful eyes. I should tell you, I'm not like most guys. I know how to treat a girl right. If you go out with me, I'll be the one in the kitchen making YOU a sandwich!**

**Hehe...**

**Emily: Hey, thanks for the compliment.**

**Nice Guy: You're welcome.So, what sort of sandwich can I come over and make for you tonight?** 

**\*15 minutes pass\***

**Nice Guy: Hello?**

**Emily: Hey, sorry, I'm at work.I appreciate the offer, but I just got out of a relationship, and I'm not really ready to meet up with any guys just yet.** **Nice Guy: Well that's good, cos I'm not just any guy. Hehe.How about we take it slow then. Let me take you out for a coffee.** 

**Emily: As I said, I'm not ready for that yet.**

**Nice Guy: Come on, I promise I'm a good guy.**

**Emily: Look, I'm not interested, ok? Sorry.**

**Nice Guy: Ok, fine. Jeez. Just trying to be nice.**

**\*15 minutes pass\***

**Nice Guy: I bet you'll end up dating some jobless loser who treats you like shit.** 

**\*1 hour passes\***

Nice Guy: **No wonder your last boyfriend left you.Women only date asshole losers. If you don't want to meet any guys, then why the fuck are you on this app in the first place?** 

**\*1 hour passes\***

**Nice Guy: Fine, don't respond. Slut.**

This sort of interaction begs the question: If women are only attracted to assholes, why aren't they swooning over Nice Guys? Because they mostly don't.

#### He has no respect for women

Deep down, Nice Guys have no respect for women. 

This is apparent when you witness the Jekyll to Hyde transformation a Nice Guy makes whenever a woman rejects him.

It is also apparent with the overwhelming approach Nice Guys take to their pursuit of a woman.

Men who respect women don't check in on them every ten minutes, nor do they leave women banks of 4 unresponded text messages on the regular. 

This sort of behaviour is invasive, uncomfortable and ultimately, disrespectful.

#### He's completely unaware of himself

Nice Guys seldom accept fault when a woman rejects them.

They refuse to consider: 'If I keep sending women uncomfortably flattering messages and not a single one of them responds positively, maybe that's on me?'

Instead, a Nice Guy carries on recycling the same tired, empty messages, growing more resentful with each rejection he receives in response.

A Nice Guy's inability to self-reflect and self-improve condemns him to a life of bitter cynicism and exponentially painful rejection.

### Are Nice Guys born Nice Guys, or do they become them?

Now that you've read through some of the typical traits of a Nice Guy, you're probably wondering: 'are Nice Guys born Nice Guys, or do they become them?'

While many Nice Guys have always been selfish, cynical pricks, not all of them were born this way. Some are newly Nice Guys.

#### What's a newly Nice Guy?

Newly Nice Guys are those that began their dating life as insecure, misguided young men and devolved into Nice Guys over time.

Let me show you an example of how this happens.

In this example, I'll call our pre-Nice Guy, Guy.

***Guy starts speaking to a woman.***

***He is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach.***

***The woman feels uncomfortable, and eventually, Guy gets rejected.***

***Guy is heartbroken by the rejection and confused as to why she rejected him. After all, he was so kind and friendly towards her.***

***Eventually, he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another.***

***Guy starts speaking to a new woman.***

***Just like last time, he is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach.***

***The woman feels uncomfortable, and eventually, Guy gets rejected.***

***Guy is heartbroken by the rejection and even more confused as to why it happened. After all, he was so kind and friendly towards her.***

***Eventually, he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another.***

As this pattern continues, Guy becomes a little more cynical and a little more frustrated each time.

Ever heard of the saying: The definition of madness is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?

Well, that's spot on in the case of how some men become newly Nice Guys, and how Nice Guys stay Nice Guys.

They continue the same lazy, ill-conceived attempts at seduction over and over, expecting someone will eventually take the bait.

As the rejections pile up, they develop a resentment towards women, become sore-losers and convince themselves into believing that the only reason women don't like them, is because women are only attracted to assholes.

# Let's talk about good men

Nice Guys and good men are polar opposites.

While a Nice Guy is disrespectful, insincere, overly agreeable and selfish, a good man is respectful, confident, honest and selfless.

Some of the common traits of a good man include:

#### He carries out acts of kindness with no ulterior motive

Good men don't hold the door open for women or compliment their smiles, as a way to get her into bed.

A good man displays acts of kindness towards women because being kind and respectful is in his nature.

Women appreciate acts of kindness when they sense that it's being delivered in a sincere, ulterior free manner.

Sincere gestures from a man lower a woman's defences and increase his credibility in her eyes.

#### He treats women as individuals

Unlike Nice Guys, (who let their negative experiences with a few women dictate their views on all women) a good man treats women on a case by case basis.

This is beneficial, regardless of the outcome of his past encounters with women.

When a past encounter was negative, he doesn't project his baggage onto the next woman.

When a past encounter was positive, he doesn't set unrealistically high expectations upon the next woman.

#### He's a good loser

When a good man gets rejected by a girl, (yes, it does happen) no matter how painful it feels, he knows when to call it quits, accept the loss and move on.

He won't respond to her rejection message demanding she explains herself further.

He won't accuse her of disliking him because he treated her too well.

He won't send her insulting messages until she elicits an emotional response.

He's too busy getting back on his feet and finding somebody else.

***Disclaimer:*** *The recovery time from a break-up is dependent on the length and nature of the relationship. I'm not suggesting good men move on from every rejection quickly and effortlessly.*

#### He doesn't dote on women

Good men are rarely accused of appearing desperate in their pursuit of a woman.  This is namely because a good man won't dote on a woman.

Before he compliments her, he senses that the situation calls for it.

He won't show strong affection towards a woman until he feels the relationship has developed to the point where his affection will be well received and reciprocated.

He doesn't treat women like poor, lost puppies, as he sees them as adults who are capable of looking after themselves.

#### He is always looking for ways to improve

Good men are naturally self-reflective beings.

When a good man realises his shortcomings or is faced with rejection, he makes a concerted effort to confront his shortcomings and improve himself.

This is vastly different from Nice Guys, who prefer to blame their problems on everyone else.

#### He challenges women

Good men won't enthusiastically agree with everything a woman says and does. If he disagrees with something she's said, he will make it known, respectfully.

Good men also aren't afraid to make fun of a woman (in a fun and playful way). 

Examples of this include: 'I'd ask you to dance, but you couldn't handle my moves' or 'I don't think you and I are going to work out, we should call it quits now' (after she reveals she doesn't like Nando's)

#### He is self-assured

Good men know their worth and remind themselves of it often.

They won't bend at the will of others or let 'haters' alter the views they have of themselves.

They hold strong to their values and express them with women in a mature are rational manner.

#### He respects women

Good men view women as their peers.

By treating women as their peers (which, in fairness, all men rightfully should), good men reap 2 benefits:

1. They don't run the risk of becoming subservient to a woman.
2. They don't view women as inferior by expecting immediate gratification for their attempts at seduction (therefore their expectations aren't constantly crushed, leading them down a hateful emotional spiral ala Nice Guys.)

#### He owns his insecurities

Being a good man doesn't mean being free from insecurities.

Sure, the average good man has far fewer insecurities than the average Nice Guy, but still - he does have them.

The difference is, he's not afraid to admit them.

Where a Nice Guy will channel his insecurities into bullying others and bringing them down, a good man owns his insecurities and looks to address them in a healthy manner.

The way a good man owns his insecurities is by:

\- Being open about them and seeking counsel from friends on them

\- Considering ways he can alleviate his insecurities by improving himself

\- Developing strong empathy and understanding for the insecurities of others, based on those he sees in himself

# Final thoughts

While the traits listed above provide an underlying framework of what makes a Nice Guy vs. what makes a good man, the world is not so black and white.

Some good guys fall off the path sometimes, just as some Nice Guys can have moments of clarity and good.

If you are guilty of a few Nice Guy traits and you fear you could become a full-blown Nice Guy, please know - there's still a chance for salvation.

My advice to you is to change your mindset and attitude towards women, but firstly - towards yourself.

If you don't,  you are likely to live a life filled with romantic rejection and increasing bitterness towards yourself and others.

Nice Guys, start being good men.

Good men, keep up the good work.",16Dec2020,1

My interpretation is the recipe was revisionist and they even added peas to the stuffed shells.  However there’s people out there who have to do that, and they just want to participate.  So she could be on hard times and this is the best she can do.  Could someone like that make Youtube videos?",16Dec2020,1

87,"   Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

91,"Everything becomes a bit more care-free. 

Usually I tended to wonder what it would be like to be in love or in a relationship when I saw couples in the street or at a friend's party (pre-covid, feels like a lifetime ago). That need for intimacy always came back and got me quite down because I'm horrendous at flirting and dating. 

I don't imagine people as potential partners anymore. Whatever they look like or talk about, I go about my day and leave them alone. It stops my mind from wandering about how it feels to hold hands and so on, I manage to fall asleep fast and don't mull over it too much.

Being a loner has its issues, but while we're not meant to be an island and I'd be happier if I wasn't, I'm content with my lot. I'm not as miserable as I was when I kept getting rejected and it's a lot more free time too. It'll have to do.",16Dec2020,1

96,"I've had complaints and I've been told people will hate me but I wouldn't. I would love me. I was and am happiest straightedge.

That's the life I'm into.

No Drugs.

No cigarettes.

No Alcohol.

Nothing mind-altering.

Quit complaining because I tell you I don't want to drink. Stop telling me I'm a loser because I don't do drugs. Let me be myself.

Fuck off to the fullest degree if you honestly think anything that makes my brain wonk out because it's not a familiar substance is a good thing or will help me in any way. All that only causes the weird feelings because your body and mind need to devote unbalanced resources to processing the crap you fed it.

Sure, I'm telling the internet and I'll get backlash and yeah, I smoked pot for a few years. My body hates it and I was dumb enough to think it was useful for socializing.

This is my own personal experience and the way I'd like to live my life. Before you judge me or tell me whatever negativity you're likely about to attempt, know that I haven't said anything bad about your choices. I'm only saying that's not me. It's not my choice or life.

Be who you are so long as you keep that information to yourself. It's better to advocate against something than advocate for it, anyway. Not drinking can't kill you. Not smoking can't screw up your lungs. Sorry to all who may disagree. This is me.

Sober me doesn't disgust me.",16Dec2020,1
98,"Rant//

I recently dropped out of college because I was so depressed and I also realized that maybe college isn't for me. I was studying Psychology, and it was something I was kinda interested in? I think I just felt pressured to pick something, but honestly I really just don't care. I have no idea what I want to do. The idea of working just sucks, and I know that's life but I just get upset thinking about how I'll probably be spending the rest of my life working at a job I don't care about. I'm also sad because it feels like most jobs want some kind of experience or certificate and I have no experience working besides like... helping with paperwork at my mom's job. Also, the idea of going to an interview or even talking with people makes me so nervous. I don't know what to do, and I hate that I'm like this :( . I do like baking and art, and I don't think I'm bad but I do need more lessons to learn how to do things on my own. I'd love to do something with art but I never even made a portfolio though because I completely lost motivation between middle school and high school to draw anything (been struggling with depression for a while :( I even thought farming or gardening was cool lol, but I know that's a lot of work and maybe not as peaceful as I'd like to think it is. Even then, I'm like 4 lbs and wouldn't be able to lift anything so that sucks. I just don't see a future for myself, and everyday I feel lost and that I'm just wasting my life away. Anyway, I just wanted to get that off my chest but if anyone comes across this post and has any ideas, I'd appreciate any advice.  (also please don't be mean I am literally at my limit 😭)",16Dec2020,1

105,"I feel like when I support people I’m good about having the discussion center on them and their needs because I think that’s what people need in certain moments. Sometimes people just want to talk about what’s going on with them and I think it’s important to give them that space. However I feel like every time I need support people will just find a way to tie the discussion to themselves. I get that that’s how to have a conversation a lot of the time but if I go to you and I say “I’m struggling with ______”, I’m sorry but I don’t feel like listening to how you have also felt that way. I’m the one in a rough moment and I need to discuss my stuff with someone.

109,"I’m a young guy and went to my job adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview. and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv got all that’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me pleasantly with furrows eyebrows , (see I’m very shy and quiet and look nervous easily) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say (she used her hands as gestures in motion to what she was saying) ""ok, well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes....make sure you get a shave. make sure you cut your nails. make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" (in a voice between a mix of bubbly and assertive) then she paused a bit looking at her computer and then said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing. I just smiled with it. She said it nicely judging by a laugh at the end but idk. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) but always was previous appointments. she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’
