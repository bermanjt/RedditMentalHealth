Stabbed Twice
Beaten by parents
Neglected by parents
Had a glass pane thrown at me which shattered
Almost always didn’t have enough food
Never had birthday/Christmas presents
Been told to kill myself by parents/peers
Homeless
Had to pan-handle
Sent to a mental hospital
Been jumped
Have had a cigarette burned on me
Grown so numb to pain that I can’t cry
Witnessed my parents beating each other
Witnessed my parents get arrested
Visited parents in jail
Bullied in school
Cheated on
Both parents abandoned me

15,"I moved into housing (all apartments, no dorms) about a week ago for my first year at college. The only thing I was really worried about was getting along with my roommate, especially since she had very different opinions than me on politics and other things (and she DOES talk about her opinions a lot). But even without that, I really do prefer my own space and to be alone, so living in such close quarters with a stranger who had different habits and such than me didn’t seem very exciting. I’d been anxious about it for awhile. But it turned out to be for nothing because not even a week into quarantine she wants to drop out and move back home. I ended up having a conversation with her about it, talking through why (because while I may not have been excited I wanted to be nice and civil still), but in my head I was so excited. But long story short she moved out today so now I get the apartment to myself and I’m really really happy about it. I got out of a not so good roommate situation (there were other things I didn’t mention) and now I have my own space! I’m not sure if it will be for the whole year or not, but either way I’m so relieved to have been this lucky my first semester of college! Thanks if you read this far haha, I know this isn’t anything big but still it meant a lot to me :).",05Sep2020,1

20,"Unfortunately my uncle passed away, sad story as he was the life of the party and very friendly and nice to anyone.  He was in his 40s and left behind 2 teenagers and a wife.  Looking back he never said a bad word about anyone or even criticized anyone.  I don’t ever remember him not helping out family in need.  The only flaw would be that he was a kid at heart so a bit irresponsible when it came to eating, exercise and when to stop drinking and partying.  But he was a fun drinking and party guy so never to the point of a bad drunk.

Anyways the whole family took it bad, same with the whole community he died.  500 people showed up to the funeral.  Never thought it see that.  How do people get over death?  Now I am starting to think when everyone else will die, and that everything is temporary.",05Sep2020,1

My routine pretty much everyday is working a 6 hour shift, coming home and studying for 5 hours, then playing videogames or watching a movie for an hour before I go to bed. Whenever I talk to my friends at their university I feel like I have nothing to talk about. I can’t go out and meet new people because of covid and me living with someone at risk. I really need someway to change up my life because its really starting to take a toll on my mental health. I constantly feel tired and my motivation is slipping. Is there a good community online I could get into? Or any advice on hobbies or little life changes so I don’t feel so bad everyday about the grind?

For the record, they were the size of like...medium or big cockroaches. I've never hurt an actual bigger animal like a mouse, bird, squirrel, cat, or dog.

30,"Quarantine has changed social norms for a lot of us- and I started gaming online. Met this guy who I’ve been talking to for a week now but just as friends. Today we ended up spending almost the entire day hanging out virtually - either we were sending each other memes or playing together. And he also asked if I’d be interested in going to a show with him and his friend sometime in the future. We live in different time zones but same country- so it’d be a trip to a third destination. 

Anyways, I think I’m crushing on this guy and I feel odd about it. Like, first of all he’s younger than me I’m about to turn 25 (f) this month and he turned 19 sometime June/July. My youngest friend turned 21 this July. (Idk if this helps somehow or not). I  feel like a creep- like, I should aim to get along with someone more my age. But I don’t want to go back to dating apps - they put me in a bad mental space. 

And let’s say that this guy did feel the same way - where would things even go from there? I hate thinking about the future - I feel like it would be a sad one where either distance breaks everything up or values. 

And thirdly, why am I even crushing on someone already? I just got out of a 1.5 yr relationship in July. (I know my ex is already on tinder again bc I saw his reddit profile talking about it.) I wasn’t planning to develop a crush! 

I wish I didn’t get so attached easily. I like having this person to talk to and learn more about. My friend group has broken apart for reasons between them- and I’ve been feeling like I need new friends because of the disrespect I’ve received over the years. 
So I was excited to talk to this guy —— but now... ugh why do I get attached so easily? Is this normal? I don’t want to feel hurt again from a person leaving, friend or partner wise. 

TLDR; I’m 25f crushing on a 19m and I feel weird because of our ages. And I’m also venting about how I get attached to people so easily.",05Sep2020,1
32,"Would like to start from the beginning. Last year I went thought a miserable breakup, to the point where I was under deep depression and couldn’t do anything. To add onto that, I also started university 15 days after the 2 year old relationship broke off. 

Since the pandemic started, I have worked hard on myself. I have lost 70 pounds, gotten down to 14% body fat, brought my grades up tremendously as I was diagnosed with AHDH thus the meds really helped. 

Last night, I deleted all social media (I’m an extrovert so it was a huge step for me!) after thinking about it for weeks. I did not explain anything to my friends or even my bestfriend. I just decided to delete everything at 12 am. 

I have decided to work on myself, mentally and physically. To grow myself, to become the person I aspire of being. (Have an attractive body, clear mindset). Bring my grades up a lot (currently in 2nd year business school) and transfer to my dream university. 

Just have one big concern. I am scared that once I am ready to join the “world” again, I won’t have any friends (especially cuz of covid) and will be lonely as social interactions empower me. My current social circle was getting way too toxic, thus I would like to grow in both aspects and come back but I don’t know how to do so. 

What do you guys think? Has anyone gone through something similar where they just decided to restart their social life? Any tips or advice for me? What do you think I should do regarding my fear of not finding anyone new?",05Sep2020,1

34,"Legs, legs, legs...

As a child, I liked my own legs because of how soft they were, lol. And I also liked my mom's soft legs too. 

In middle school though...I began to notice the legs of male and female classmate. Thighs, calves, all of the legs. And it was VERY sexual. Not innocent ""oh so soft."" 

And in general...I love, LOVE legs, thighs, and calves! From ankle to butt, I love all of it! For me, legs rank WAAAY above breasts, ass, vagina, penis, or any other body part! Like a billion times! 

Heck, I'm even sexually attracted to my OWN legs! 

Whenever I go shopping for shorts, I always make sure to get the shortest shorts available. Which for me, is 3-5 inch inseam. Perfect length for me. Plenty of thigh action, but still covers the important bits. 

I also shave and wax my legs, for extra silky smoothness! I'm a trans girl, but my legs are softer than that of almost any cis girl. Only one of my friends has me beat by like 1% in softness. 

And of course...I love shorts, short skirts, and short dresses on other people as well! 

And to be clear...I am bisexual, but very female leaning. So I mostly like shaved femboy legs, rather than hairy rugged masculine legs.",05Sep2020,1

36,"There is a lot of posts about licking the back of your wrist and then wait about 10secs to sniff it to test your breath. After I floss/brush/scrape tongue i would do the test and the dried up saliva would have no smell but about 30mins later it would have an odor to it. So I really wanted to find out how accurate this test is.

I tried and test this with my GF...... I asked her to lick her to lick my wrist and then i smelled it (it smelled bad), but when i sniff her actual breath by letting her breathing into me up close, there is no bad smell. I asked her to try it on me and same result. 

So my question is are there any other actual methods that actually let you smell your own breath. I know that cupping your hands over your mouth and nose and then exhale through mouth and quickly inhale through nose only works if you have really reallly bad breath that can kill a donkey.",05Sep2020,1

39,"I've had problems with depression since I was 14, I always felt lonely in High School and my desperation ended up killing the possibility of having a girlfriend. Once I got out of high school I did much better for myself, after a couple years though I decided to stop sleeping around because I had broken some hearts and I just felt like that's not the man I was. Around this time I realized my height would be 5'8 forever and It fucked with my self esteem for a bit but I adjusted, realizing that not all girls care about height. My specific personality would appeal to the right person to somebody who didn't care about my height. 

Now I've balding to the point where I have to shave my head or else I look stupid. I really loved my hair I've always had kind of like a skater haircut. I felt like it was part of my personality for the longest time.  Now I have no self esteem, I don't know who I am anymore, and I can't see anybody falling in love with me at this point. I was considering suicide for a while, but I think I'm going to bury myself in my programming study's, seeing as stress can't cause me to lose hair cause I have none. I'm 5'8, on mild anti-depressants, bald, not big or tall, not in shape by any means.

I will retire at 35 as a programmer, I will die alone at 40 hooked up to my VR gear, with a bong and a bottle of booze, I will die from drug overdose or heart issues. I will sleep with prostitutes twice a year, I think I can go without killing myself until I'm 40. Maybe I bring some Mexican/Asian into America and we sort of have a life together. I don'tr know, but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die alone in my early 40s. 

If anybody can relate to how I'm feeling I'd love some words of encouragement to keep me going. If I kill myself before my parents are 75 I'll feel terrible, thankfully they are currently 60. So yeah just any words of encouragement. Or maybe you think I'm being a whiny little bitch I just want to feel heard right now.",05Sep2020,1

43,"I'm in a rather rough period lately. Nothing's really wrong, I just feel very anxious, distant and stressed all the time. I'm also a very motivated person and know that in order to achieve in life I must do my best and work towards my goals every day (sometimes I'm too harsh of a believer) 

That being said, I dread doing nothing/procrastinating. I just feel useless. I'm also jobless and have a month to go til uni starts. I am away from home, so not many friends to hang out with. I live with my roommate and my bf is almost everyday here. 

My problem is I feel the need to baby him. I think I've become a housewife from the age of 19. I cook twise a  day, do laundry, make the bed and in general feel the need i must do everything to assist my bf. I feel that because he works big shifts he deserves some rest. I also wake up at 6am every day he's working to have coffee together. 

He appreciates everything but i feel like I'm too serious and going overboard on stuff. I also feel dependent on him in regards of doing stuff. When he's at work I do my own things but once he come home I become a slave. Just to say he doesn't force me do anything. I do everything because I want to. He even beggs me to cook. 

I know that's my own personal issue and it's toxic. What bothers me is that I find myself expecting same thing from him. And I know it's wrong! 

I know it was too long but I really wanted to vent. I think i also wanted to see it written down to acknowledge my issues.

How did you overcome compulsive talking?",05Sep2020,1
46,"So basically I had made a friend in Minecraft, we used to play together, we used to talk on Hangout and everything was good, but one day I did a suicide joke to her, I had never done something like this before and it was my first time doing this (and it was not really a joke, it was an experiment. I just wanted to see if she cares for me or not?). So I send her some messages on Hangout and pretending that I am doing suicide, and didn't talk to her for 24 hours.

Then after 24 hours, I said I was kidding. She was just mad at me and I can understand that. After that day, she was not the same as before, she was changed. She was asking me why I did that joke to her? I said come to Minecraft with your old acc and I will tell you there (she had created a new acc and I wanted her to meet me in Minecraft with her old acc). She said she will not use her old acc again because she had met a lot of creeps, had bad friendships and was done with that acc. She also said that she had forgot the password of her old acc, but I thought it was just an excuse and I was keep pushing her to use your old acc one last time. I wanted to make things right, but I was only making things worse instead. In the end, she didn't meet me in Minecraft and what she did was unexpected, she created a group in Hangout in which she added her boyfriend and me (she actually wanted her boyfriend to talk to me and tell me to leave her), and then her boyfriend started trash talking and saying toxic things to me, and she was also there reading the chat. They were both making me feel very uncomfortable, never in my life I had feel so defenseless and helpless before. And the worse thing is just listening to them and not saying anything in return, and that's what I was doing.

I was saying sorry to her many times, but it was no use, she was not listening to a single word I say. And the way she was talking, it looked like she had probably made up her mind about breaking up the friendship with me and never talk to me again. Bottom line, her boyfriend told me to leave her, never message her again or they will call the cops. I messaged her one last time ""Bye, take care"" and decided I won't talk to her again.

All those trash talking and toxic things they said to me, it made me go into depression for couple of days. And ever since then this has been such a burden in my mind. Every single day, whenever I go to sleep, I just think about how we used to be friends, how we used to play together, and that have I really caused her that much pain that she had to do all this. So after couple of months, I finally decided to text her again on Hangout, apologize to her again. I wanted to make it up to her but she had blocked me on Hangout so I didn't got the chance.

Now what should I do? Should I still try to find some another way to contact her? Or should I just forget her and move on? Don't you guys think she should give me a second chance and become my friend again? I just don't want her to see me as her enemy and leave me like this. Any other advices, suggestions or opinions, I will be happy to hear. Iam open for discussion. Thank you :)",05Sep2020,1

I basically want to leave everything:
- All the relationships I've built up
- I want to be on another country
- I want to try something new for myself (once I did leave)
- I want to live alone and enjoy things I've envisioned
- maybe a spouse (5years AFTER I do) or just live alone

All in all, I just want a peaceful, quiet life with basic necessities, simple living

Sounds simple, but the rough part is going to another country :( (getting in there requirements and having a job)

As much as I don’t want to move to the state he’s in, I think I could use this is an opportunity to kind of start over, to take some financial strain off while I finish school.

The thing is I feel I can't bear this suffering for much longer. You know, I was at home off school for almost a half year and I am very grateful for that. I finally started to get myself together, to get my life together. I was working on myself crazy. I was educating myself, I was reading books, I was writing, I was thinking .... yeah 5 times a week I was off the tv, phone and computer at the evenings and nights and I was just thinking. I stopped watching porn and masturbating, I was meditating, doing some exercises, some physical activity like running, weightlifting, swimming or jist going out to the forest. Man, that harmony I felt, that freedom, that peace, that privacy, whatever.... it was I don't know how to describe it. I know I need to grow up, this isn't the life, but you know I need this. I feel like I really need this, this is where my soul gains strength from, this is what I need. And now I am crushed, stripped away from it, I just can't do it. School started again, living in the city, in a school home and it's 5 times a week, all week just a fight, really, just anxiety and pain, so much pain and suffering, so much stress and fuk I don't think I am able to operate like this. I have nothing to gains strength from, no privacy here either, it's soul devastating.... but yeah anyway there is one thing you could be able to help me with.

I have a heavy stuttering and you know all my life I have been weak and pathetic coward, with no integrity it was hell, tremendous hell. So now I try to live in alignment with my soul, my character, to live in the Truth. Without it, if I fail, even once, I am gonna die man, I will kill myself I know it, I know it. The reason why it's so hard for me is because I havent integrated my shadow, I am not a monster, I am not able to be aggresive, I can't be dangerous, I am a pathetic slave. Well I understand it, how can I be when saying one word takes me 10 seconds... but I need to be, otherwise I will break down. I am gone. I am done. How can I be able to defend myself, to be aggressive, how can I be able to deal with the evil people, aggressive people, the dangerous people, all that mockery, how can I be able to defend myself when there is a crowd mocking me or even just one person, when there is someone who hates me and I cang get away from him. What to do man? Please tell me, please. When I just live in the truth, I am showing my vulnerability, my voice cracks I shake but I am not able to stand up for myself,how can I do that, how can I be able to fight?

59,"Throughout my childhood, I’ve always wanted an older brother or two. There’s something so easing about having an big brother. From day one, I was continually my own guide as I had no one to fall back to. I suppose that’s the reason why I love this idea of a big brother who can aid and mentor me through life. I can’t explicitly explain this innate desire, but it has dwindled down as I got older. 

Through fate or perhaps mere luck, I had the opportunity to become close with whom I’d call a/my brother-figure. I genuinely feel as if he’s more than just a friend, but rather the big brother that I’ve always wanted. The slight age gap and the pre-existing dynamic of our acquaintanceship naturally formed this platonic, bro-sis chemistry between us.

He *just* moved to somewhere somewhat far away. Before that, we would often call and give each other life-updates, survive boredom, provide each other therapy, etc. Being in quarantine gave us the chance to become much, much closer! Retrospectively speaking, I realized that I was more of an outlet/listener for him, but there is still the brotherly dynamic regardless. Anyway, we didn’t see each other during the pandemic for obvious reasons, but we were able to link before he left. 

I’m generally a happy person, but I sometimes find or catch myself missing him as it evokes a subtle sense of poignancy. The rate at which I saw him pre-move matches the rate at which I’m seeing him post-move (zero times basically), but the distance somehow has me missing him. We could just call each other like how we normally do, but I feel slightly despondent since there is the 300 mile distance between us. 

He probably perceives me more as one of his guy friends. We tend to be dry and emotionless towards each other. I don’t know why, but it doesn’t bother me. I would never tell him how and how much I miss him. I feel like that would be strange and weirdly affectionate to tell a friend, especially him. That’s why I’m writing it down.

2 weeks into lockdown, I lost my job. I’ve been struggling to find one ever since, and have been desperately trying to find any odd jobs so I can put food on the table for myself. It’s so strange when you go from being financially comfortable to having to constantly grind daily to eat.

Secondly, my girlfriends father, who was like a father figure to me, has recently been diagnosed with Covid-19. He’s a soldier, but was hospitalized for 12 weeks last year due to unrelated lung issues. I know he’s strong but I don’t know if he’s gonna make it :/

64,"This has been going around my head as of late and really wanted to share this before I close this account for good. Near a year ago I was in a tense relationship. I had to walk in eggshells with this person, and I did not realize many of the red flags that were in my face (yes, love really blinds). The day we broke up (breakup came as more of a heat of the moment rather a well planned dialogue), there was a window of opportunity to take back the breakup and resume normally. But this person let things cascade rather than wait like I told her to because I was going to come over later. And when I knew through the angry texts this person was at the peak of misery and anxiety from what what's going on, I said ""No way I'm going to show up at that house and see her at her absolute worst...""

Most people in my situation would go and end the drama with make-up sex. I am a sensitive person, and I really avoid at all costs at confronting a person and get myself into very awkward situations. I'd rather inconvenience myself rather inconvenience others, that's just how I am (and yes, gotta work on that). Week after things cooled off a bit we broke up formally.

67,"I can’t tell anyone about it yet but I’m so excited and I really need to tell someone!

I’ve been with my boyfriend for seven month, actually yesterday was our seven months anniversary. And even though I’m doing way better now, I have several mental illnesses and lot of past trauma and insecurities.

Yesterday my boyfriend and I spend a really difficult day, mostly because I had a massive panic attack that lasted for hours, because of my insecurities. He is an amazingly attractive man, and girls ask for his number and flirt with him EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I had a panic attack because of all that triggered by a text one of his ex sent him, and the discussion went very far (but always with love and respect and understanding from both sides), and at the end, we were pretty both sad and exhausted. 

Our relationship have been amazing from the beginning and we instantly knew that we wanted to spend our whole lives together. We are planning to move to his home country next year (which is 10,000km away from where we currently live), and we have our own future planned. 

Well, yesterday during my panic attack, I asked him if he ever intended to propose to me. He said of course, and I asked him when he would want that to happen, if there was some life goals he wanted to achieve before that, etc. 

I explained to him that for me, being engaged to him would mean a pretty big deal, that it is very important to me that he one day proposes because of all the symbolism I hold behind it. So he told me he wanted to save for a really nice ring, so maybe when we’re at our two years relation mark. 

Fine with it. I’d rather have it happening sooner, but two years waiting, no problems, I can totally do that. 

We both were pretty sad and exhausted from the whole thing, and I felt very guilty for “ruining” our seven month anniversary with my anxiety, so I turned to him and said 

“You know what? Let’s order pizza, it’s on me, and watch a nice movie together so we can end this day in a good way and still celebrate !” 

At that point, he had dimmed the lights and put on some candles. 

“Okay, but there’s something I want to do first”, he replied. 

He took something from the closet and he kneeled down in front of me. I laughed, thinking how cute it was of him to want to cheer me up and jokingly propose to me. 

He then started a whole speech about how I am the love of his life, how he wants to spend every day of his life with me, at one point he started crying while telling me this and looking at me in the eyes. Then he took a ring out (one ring I had but never got to wear), and asked me if I wanted to marry him. 

Guys, at this point I still thought he was joking, but the tears and emotion in his eyes made me think that maybe it was serious. 

I obviously said yes, he came and sat down next to me and with the biggest smile told me “we’re engaged, baby”. And that’s when I realized he wasn’t joking and I broke down crying of happiness. 

I asked him what had changed his mind, why an hour ago he wanted to wait until two years in the relationship and now he proposes, and he looked at me and told me still with the biggest smile “If you’re ready to be my fiancé, then I’m ready too”. 

I ordered pizza with truffle (the most fancy pizza I ever had) and a bottle of champagne because what the heck, it was time to celebrate. And we spent the rest of the night kissing and cuddling and looking at each other while smiling stupidly. 

I have never been so happy in my entire life. I know he is the one, it was that kind of story where you meet the guy and you just know, that’s him, the man you’re going to marry. 

He woke me up asking how his beautiful fiancée had slept, and I just want to cry of happiness every time I look at my finger. 

Cherry on the top, we planned two days ago a trip to Venise (we live near and will take every precaution) for next week, so in a few days I’ll be celebrating my engagement in one of the most romantic cities on the planet. 

I am over the moon. But he doesn’t want us to tell people yet because he wants to wait until he can make a real, beautiful proposal and plan something. So that’s why I’m writing here.

Hope this made you smile. Thank you Reddit !",05Sep2020,1

72,"Hello, my name is Quinten and everyday I am busy with bringing more peace and positivity to myself and others. And I also want to say to you that you can bring peace and positivity into your life and the life of others. 

Nowadays it sometimes looks like only the very wealthy can make a change in this world. And that the very poor are garbage. But both the very wealthy and the poor can make a change. Because peace and positivity are in every step.

**Here are the things I do everyday to bring peace and positivity**

1. Live in the present moment, because the present moment is the only moment there is. Most of your worries are about something in the past or future. Both the past and future are just illusions.
2. Gather and share knowledge about life (On for example Reddit, Instagram, and [this page](https://ko-fi.com/quintenvanommen)
3. Not comparing all the time because everyone is beautiful in there own way. Let´s imagine for a moment that you are walking through the forest. You will not say to yourself. Ohw this tree is ugly. or, this tree is perfect. You just let everything be. And that is because you are not constantly comparing these trees. And also because you probably don´t have an image in your head of the perfect tree. So let´s treat yourself like the forest. Just let yourself be. And let go of the image how you should be.
4. Ensure that I´m in good physical and mental health by exercising, and meditation / mindfull living
5. Not saying to much destructive things to myself. Because what you think you become

&amp;#x200B;

In the last couple of months/years I see this great change in my life that I attract more peace and positivity and that I also radiate this peace and positivity to others. So remember this, if you want to bring more peace and positivity into your life and the life of others, then it starts with you. And you can bring that peace and positivity. And together we can make this planet into a more peaceful planet",05Sep2020,1
73,"Internet is a really strange and interesting place. Sometimes you find some useful information, sometimes you find something that interests you and sometimes you will find something very disturbing and creepy... even though most of the time you will face nothing more than some idiotic perverts or somewhat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've met so many different people so far. Some of them are professional illustrators, some of them are music producers, some of them are software developers, some of them are engineers/mechanics and remaining others were just ""not so useful for the development of this society"" people with different levels of uselessness. Among the ""remaining others"", there was a guy who has never had a proper job because he didn't have much knowledge or techniques but was a blood donor who donated his blood so many times for nothing. I don't know that much about that guy, I only know his real name, phone number, how his face looks like and some ""interesting"" characteristics of him. One of the interesting thing about that guy is that he has 3 characters he has made and sometimes says some nasty things about those characters (All those characters are fictional female characters which appears to be original). 

&amp;#x200B;

When reading some ""dirty texts"" written by him, I often thought why he never made anything like NSFW images of his own characters. He had some high-quality images of his characters which were drawn by some freelancer illustrators (friends of mine) and given to him for free, but the characters had clothes on in those pictures. I was pretty sure that he could pay those illustrators for drawing nudes of those characters if he really wanted to do some ""nasty things"" with his characters but he never did. I thought maybe it was just because he did not have enough money to spend on something like that, and then I thought, ""maybe I can make his dream to come partially true"".

&amp;#x200B;

I was not that good with drawing but I tried my best. I drew one of the characters naked and taking nude selfie. Then I imported that drawing to Photoshop, hid genitals with hamburger emoji, rendered the image and then uploaded it on a throwaway account, saying ""happy selfie time with hamburgers"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I sent the link to the post to the ""character copyright owner"", waiting for his reaction. his reaction was... kinda unexpected. He told me that he felt so bad about looking at the ""nude selfie"" of the character he loved, claiming that ""the character was a very important thing like a daughter or something"" for him. He really needs the improvements of his parenting skill, aye?  


I asked him if he wants to get the original post to be removed. He said that he wants me to remove the ""hamburger image"" from my throwaway account. His request did not end there. He wanted me to send him the ""nude image"" with the hamburgers removed. I did what he asked me to do, and that became a really good reason for me to call him a cheeseburger as a joke. Happy ending. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. He satisfied with the overall quality of that drawing, he just did not like about other people looking at the ""hamburger image"" also.",05Sep2020,1

They all have different personalities too. Their names are Dupree, Garfield, Lily, and Joy. We got them in that order, from oldest to youngest.

Dupree usually doesn't interact much with the others, but he likes to run and play around, and he sleeps like a bunny.

Garfield has gigantic chubby cheeks because he's a British shorthair, and he's super lazy and always sleeps the most. However, he LOVES chicken, or just meat in general. He always asks for a piece of what I'm having, lol. 

Lily is super affectionate, and likes to be petted, carried around, and kisses. She wants lots of attention. 

Joy is quick to run away, and is always scared...but when she's in the right mood, and warms up to you, it's legendary and beautiful.

80,"I am highly narcissistic and have to constantly keep this trait in check. But that doesn’t mean I have to accept being with someone who shares this weakness and is unconcerned about doing anything to dampen it or seems to be unaware that this is something he should even try doing.

In the case of the man this post is about, at the end of our brief saga, he told me, a little pissed off, ""I am not a narcissist,"" and gave me a pretty nice-sized paragraph (by phone) of reasons that he thought proved his point.  To me, his ""reasons"" did just the opposite.  But, anyway, I tried to tell him I never said he was a narcissist and that I think [narcissism is a trait we all have](http://www.drcraigmalkin.com/blog/narcissistic-personality-disorder), blah, blah, blah. He didn't pick up on what I was trying to say.

Here's the saga:

He responded to a Facebook post of mine, saying he’d had an experience identical to the one I shared. Then, what started as friendly banter took a turn toward flirting. So, long story short, I gave him my number and he called. I felt a little wary at first because, in our few Facebook messages, it was clear that he thought I was special because of the kind of job I have (For instance, when it looked like I might give him my number, saying he didn’t know if he should be “excited or scared” to talk to me in real life because I was just that awesome).

Another huge red flag on Facebook was him saying ""I knew you existed somewhere."" I heard the alarm but figured, ""What the hell. Somebody must meet the one they knew existed somewhere sometimes. So maybe this is that one in a million. Why not? I'll play.""

So, as soon as I answered the phone, he jumped in with high-in-narcissism warning signs:

He repeatedly told me what kind of man he is -- as in “I’m the kind of person who...” Then proceeded to brag about who he is but play it off as being humble. He even said, “I’m a humble man” more than once.

Within the first few minutes of our conversation -- completely off-topic --  he told me a certain female acquaintance of his, someone I don't know at all, is very beautiful but ""Doesn't have a sexual bone in her body.""

Next, he monopolized the conversation. When I’d try to jump in he’d say, “That’s just like something that happened to me.” And presto, he yanked the wheels of the conversation back into his grip.

He talked about us like we are kindred spirits when, in fact, at this point, he knew very little about what kind of spirit I am because he hadn’t been listening to anything I said. One reason I know this is, after I described a very specified aspect of my career, he interjected to tell me I should start doing a job I'd just told him I do.

He said, “I don’t want to name drop,” but sprinkled names throughout our conversation like parmesan cheese on NY pizza.

He implied more than once that he had professional connections that could help me.

In sum, beware of the guy who:

Insinuates, at the very beginning, that he’s been looking for you his whole life. Another version of this is “We’re just alike.” Or “You’re like me.”

Places you on a pedestal. What goes up... Well,  you know the rest. And, when it comes to highly narcissistic folks, “the rest” will be an ugly experience for you.

Hogs the conversation and forgets what you say as the words leave your lips and turns everything you say into an opportunity to turn the spotlight back on himself.

Puts down people.

Repeatedly tells you the kind of man he is (Part 2). He doesn’t have to do that. He’s trying to manipulate your perception of him. His actions speak volumes. They don’t need Cliff Notes for you to get an idea of who you’re dealing with.

Name drops.

Suggests that he can offer you some type of important help.

Today, when he texted me to see if I could talk, I dreaded the conversation I knew I had to have. Personally, I’d rather just be ghosted than have a guy call to tell me he doesn’t want to see talk to me anymore. But I make the call because I never know if the guy has the same preference. I know it would a lot easier for me if he did.

I repeat: I'm highly narcissistic at times. I've done everything on this list and then some and sometimes still do. So, I get it. Narcissistic behavior happens. But, again, that doesn't mean I have to settle for someone who makes it clear that he's clueless about his and wants to stay that way.

Anyway, in this case, as I suspected might happen, the ""I don't think I'm a good match for you"" conversation didn’t go well. He wanted to know why. I told him he wasn't going to like my answer. He insisted, saying he could take it. So I tried, but after I got the first sentence out, he spent the rest of our brief conversation telling me why I had him all wrong. Afterwards, I blocked him on Facebook.

As I write this, it occurs to me that perhaps I should bring up the topic of “What happens if one of us decides we don’t want to keep talking?” during the first phone call with a guy. I could tell him I’m cool with him ghosting me -- which is what usually happens anyway -- and he can tell me his preference. Hopefully, this will result in me not having to make a phone call neither one of us will enjoy. Hmmm. I think I'll try it.

Yesterday we had training and I was late back. Awks. 
Very competent. And then there’s me! I really want to do well, I don’t want to be sacked especially because I have a mortgage to pay for at the moment too. I know it’s a good career, yes it’s extremely stressful and maybe it’s not my complete passion but I want to do well in this job. Any tips on confidence etc?",05Sep2020,1
88,"21M , I live with my parents and the plan (more from my parents than from me) is for me to move out after I am done with my apprenticeship in about 1 1/2 years. 

I am constantly unhappy due to never receiving any physical affection, never having had a girlfriend or anyone even close to that. nothing. 


Im broke and can't afford social stuff on top of my work stuff. I almost never go out with friends. Maybe twice a year to birthdays.

Right now the people that I see everyday are my parents, my step-aunt and her boyfriend. We also have 2 cats and 2 dogs which I can't imagine leaving.

I already have waves of depression coming every now and then when I start to doubt myself again. I haven't had any success yet, and everyone that I'd call a friend, is so, so fuckin far ahead in life than I am. 

The ""plan"" for me to move out and live on my own in a out a year fucking terrifies me. How???
I can barely stay sane with my family surrounding me, with the pets I have literally seen everyday for over 10 years. Greeting me even when I was only gone for 5 minutes. 


How the fuck can I stay sane in a tiny apartment with nobody to come home to. 
I am already weak, I can't anymore. 

And I feel it in me that it won't change. At least not for the foreseeable future.

I genuinely think that I will never get a girlfriend, nobody to care for. Nobody who cares about me. 

I can't even watch some series or movies in comfort anymore. Whenever I see a couple in a movie I immediately get goosebumps, my stomach hurts and I don't want to watch anymore because I don't like seeing what Ill never be able to give someone.",05Sep2020,1

Husband and I made a poor financial choice a few months back and are $5000 in debt with nothing to show for it but a crazy interest rate! I had been looking for a second job primarily to pay it off and fix our mistake. My husband works full-time, working his way up to earn his certifications to become a master technician, and I work full-time in retail. After interviews and applications that went nowhere, I finally found a job overnight at a local gas station that works around my day job and I already feel the weight lifting off my chest! This debt will be gone soon! We made a mistake, we will fix it, and we will learn from it! I’m proud that I didn’t shut down or run away; I’m facing it head on! My husband works tirelessly every day and I want him to focus on his job, especially because he pulls overtime nearly every day. Retail and a convenience store? I got this! I’m so excited for this opportunity to better our lives!

91,"After 1 month of our break up, we had a real talk on the spot we really met each other.
We talked about ourself and how toxic we had become in the relationship. 
In this 1 month, i realized the person i became in our relationship, the lack of motivation and comunication that vanish over time, how tenderness turned into just lust and how the simples things made me think aren't worth to try. 
I don't hate her for the fact she cheat on me cause was my open-mind and tender person that vanish overtime that made her reach that point. Instead, i blame her for doing it, cause she just holded a bubble that exploded later. 

Even so, when we met again, i had to being sincere and honest with her. I talked about how things around her and how people aren't being sincere with her. I talked about things she didnt even know, how even her SO isn't even being honest with her for the fact is hidding serious stuff from her, how people see her as a ""villan"" and no one has balls to talk with her and how something isn't right when people talk about what happen and she tells another story. I don't know each is real, but i said her ""if you breaked the biggest wall of fear that was face me, then there isn't reasons to stop you to seek the truth now."" 

Isn't easy to accept what you made and what you are. But yesterday was like we re-meet again our own persons and each other like the first time. We chated, we laughed, we joked around, we cried, we hugged, we comforted each other. I felt human. I felt myself. I know what mistakes i made, i know what i lost. But now, i know who i am, i know what i want, i know my future. And there is no way i'm looking back again. 

Ofc i'm not ready to apolagize her, since we both don't know who she is. And there isn't point to apolagize somebody that you don't even know. And words won't apolagize, but actions and attitudes.

On my birthday we gonna meet each other again, and really warm my heart when she said she wanted to visit my grandmam, knowing she is all time on home fighting cancer. And for sure this is really good for my grandmam to see a friendly face again.",05Sep2020,1
92,"I do Gunpla Modelling and I was introduced to it by my dad, I started this hobby at a pretty young age, I didn't even had social media back then so I never knew that other modellers are judging each other and fighting, like more experienced modellers would ridicule and make fun of newer beginner modellers or just starting out in the hobby which turns them off and pushes them out of the hobby. My dad was pretty popular since he was the 1st world champion from our country so he got lots of haters and stuff. I never knew the extent before but now that I got back into the hobby and I have socmed now, I see how toxic the community is. You can never make one mistake since the modellers or the ""trolls"" rather, would come at you. I never experience it firsthand since I'm young and I am my fathers' daughter 😅 but It still affects me since I'm basically a beginner myself and I'm part of the community. This is mainly a male dominant hobby so there's lots of pride and male ego involved that is really stressful. I started this hobby at 8 years old and I'm now 17, it was fun to do as a kid 'cause all I did back then was build it, paint and do a diorama then join a contest so I never knew this toxic part of the environment but now It's inevitable. What's worse is that the modelers whom are trolling and ridiculing each other are men in their 30s and 40s while us newbies are just enjoying the hobby and being civil and nice to each other like we just want to enjoy our hobby and not care about the flaws but inevitably we get sucked in and ridiculed as well since we're young and beginners to it's easy to prey on us.

100,"Best way I can explain this. My neurologist believes I have a spontaneous spinal fluid leak caused by EDS. As the years have gone by my symptoms get worse or I get new symptoms.

When I go to bed each night I'm not relaxed, I have myoclonic seizures that are almost constant and are everywhere in my body causing me to feel like I'm being electrocuted, ringing in my ear that is not one but three different tones all playing over each other, pressure at the back of my head and also very painful sudden headaches that come without any warning. It's gotten to the point where lying down for 2 hours just doesn't significantly help anymore like it used to, I have to sleep through the night to see acceptable improvement now. I often have to take sleeping pills since I'll go 2-3 days without sleep.

People tell me to be happy, go out with people, etc. but I think to myself what is the point? I'm not going to feel good by the end of the day, it'll be the same crap I get each and every evening/night, I'll be angry, upset and irritable due to my symptoms which will negate any temporary good feeling I had.

It's like trying to be happy when you have an abusive boyfriend, except it's my body and there's no good weeks or bad weeks, it's always the same on a slight downwards slope. I feel like my body is torturing me. There's this lingering sense of dread that drowns out all my other emotions now.",05Sep2020,1

Corona has gotten me talking to people from the past which has been fun. One of these people is my ex back when I was in college. We split a few months before we graduated, the reason being was because I was (probably) depressed and unmotivated with life. 

In his defence I was a wreck, I didn't know what I wanted to do next whereas my ex had the rest of his life essentially handed to him. He graduated top of his class from a great school (The word genius was thrown around a lot), had a job lined up afterwards that was essentially grooming him to eventually become upper management. He had it all.

Apparently a year after he realised he hated his career choice and everything went crashing down for him, he is now working in a bar and is barely making ends meet.

105,"[LONG TLDR AT BOTTOM] 

So my friend Erik 21m) was talking to a girl (20f) that I used to be close friends with. We were like best friend. Over time we stopped talking because she lied a lot and I got tired of it. 

Two years later they both match on tinder. Erik asked me if she was cool and worth hanging out with and I said yeah. So they started hanging out and ended up liking each other. 

The reason I said go for it initially was because he said he had no intention of dating her or anything like that. He just wanted to add someone to the friend group. I heard from other mutual friends that she changed a lot and has matured since the last time I saw her. So I believed them. 

When they started liking each other and “talking” it really seemed like she had changed. 

So later into the talking stage she had expressed to me that she had questioned being with him. She said it wasn’t emotionally vulnerable and it was hard to talk to him. He wasn’t that good in bed,etc. so I assumed it was going to flicker out. 

My boyfriend who is also friends with Erik has a suspicion that she hasn’t changed at all. He was catching her getting caught up in lies, all of that. One day she went AWOL and none of heard from her all day which was weird bc we were hanging out and talking daily. My bf believed that maybe she was with another guy because before she was talking to Erik she was talking to someone else. We got a hold of her later that day and she said she was with family. 

Next time we hung out it was just me, my boyfriend, and her. My boyfriend pretty much confronted her saying he’s pretty sure she’s talking to someone else. She denied it and said “besides we aren’t even dating and Erik hasn’t said he wanted to be exclusive” my boyfriend explained that Erik already assumes that talking and having sex means exclusive. She said he hasn’t said anything to her about that and that she’s been having second thoughts (as I explained earlier). 

Once me and her were alone, she said “how did he know I was talking to someone?” And I froze up just shocked. I said “are you?” And she explained that she was still texting that previous guy because she wanted to keep her options open if her thing with Erik didn’t work out. I told her to immediately stop talking to him because Erik would end it right there if he knew. She promised she would. I felt like I didn’t need to say anything because Erik really liked her and in a way I understood where she was coming from. He never said they were exclusive and she promised me she would stop talking to that guy. Since then they’ve hung out nearly every single day so really I don’t see how there would be time for her to cheat or anything anyways. 

Weeks later now they’re dating and are in “love”. I had forgotten about the conversation and only remembered today because my boyfriend was complaining about her. He really dislikes her because he feels that she’s a lying snake. I told my bf about that conversation and naturally he’s fuming. He had tried to get Erik to stop talking to her in the past because he had a really bad vibe of her. 

Basically I really fucked up. I told him and now we don’t even know what to do. Should we tell Erik? He thinks he’s really in love with her and they’ve been really close lately. 

We’re stuck because lately he hasn’t hung out with us at all. Even leaving us on read. We’re just assuming that he’s just spending all of his time with her and that’s why. Yeah we’re salty but it’s not the end of the world. BUT with this behavior from him we’re scared if we tell him he’ll see it as us trying to break them up to spend more time with us. We also just don’t know what to do because he’s really happy and he don’t want to hurt him. 

I know I’m going to get hate for this, which is understandable. I just didn’t say anything because they were only talking, she wasn’t feeling him at the time she told me, he never asked to be exclusive, and she promised me she would stop. I also felt that maybe I should give her a chance and trust that she would stop. 

TL;DR: my friends gf told me she was talking to someone else during their talking stage. She said he never said anything about them being exclusive and she was keeping her options open because she wasn’t too sure about him at first. About a month and a half later they’re in “love” and Over time I forgot about the convo and just remembered what she had told me. Naturally, yes what I did was fucked up and beyond stupid. But now that I’ve told my BF, he thinks we should tell him but we’re unsure. Read above two paragraphs to see why were debating it.",05Sep2020,1

For some years now, I immediately become self-conscious when I am about to tell a story.

I have developed doubts about my ability to relate experiences I had to other people. 
I am an otherwise very social und communicative person with irrational inferiority issues.

Then, the consistent rejections by woman I admired over the years only dug this nail deeper. Losing my best friends in high school did this as well. Failed relationships in college only made this feeling worse. Unlovable was my identity. Yet, I’m realizing none of that is the case. The wound that turned into my identity still exists, but will no longer exist as my identity. I’m worthy of love. I’m worthy of affection. I’m handsome. I’m smart. I have acne scars. I extra pounds on me. I’m short. Still, I’m lovable. I’m enough. Just because people choose not to treat me this way, doesn’t mean it’s not true. Yet, If what I say is true, how can I live it out? How do I elevate my value and continue to love myself? The answer is Love others. Be less judgmental with them. Have more compassion. Have a laugh with them. Be softer and more empathetic. Listen to them:), because if we don’t value others, the only way we’re able to value ourselves is in the superficial ways like money, power, and assets, which have nothing to do with who we are deep down. So, to truly love yourself, you must look beyond those things in others to see the beauty that lives within them. And if you notice in others, you’ll be able to see it in yourself too.
